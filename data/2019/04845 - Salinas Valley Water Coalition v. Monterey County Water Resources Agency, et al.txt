PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioner and Plaintiff Salinas Valley Water Coalition ("Coalition") petitions this Court for

2 a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, directed to Monterey County Water
3 Resources Agency, Board of Supervisors of Monterey County Water Resources Agency, and Board

4 of Directors of Monterey County Water Resources Agency (collectively "Defendants"), and further

5 requests declaratory and injunctive relief, and alleges as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. a When a project that was previously subject to environmental review is changed in a
8 way that may cause new or more severe significant environmental effects, the California
9 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), mandates that the
10 lead agency first complete further CEQA review before approving any project change. An agency
11. cannot hide behind the original CEQA document but must conduct new, further CEQA review to
12 analyze and publicly disclose the significance of effects from changing its project. To allow
13 otherwise would violate CEQA by permitting project changes that may cause significant adverse
14 impacts on the environment-without any environmental review and public disclosure. Such project
15 changes must be enjoined unless and until an agency completes the required further CEQA review.

16 2. In the early 2000s, the Salinas Valley's landowners worked with the Defendant
17 Monterey County Water Resources Agency (the "Agency") to develop and approve the Salinas
18 Valley Water Project ("SVWP") to increase groundwater recharge and halt seawater intrusion. The
19 SVWP was developed to reoperate the Agency's Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs to
20 increase their annual water supply yield for release into the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers,
21 which discharge into the Salinas River, which recharges the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin

22 (*Basin").

23 3. In 2002, the Agency certified an environmental impact report ("EIR") assessing the
24 SVWP's effects and approved the SVWP. In June 2007, the National Marine Fisheries Service
25 ("NMFS") issued a SVWP Biological Opinion to protect steelhead trout, which are listed as
26 threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act ('ESA"). The Biological Opinion prescribed
27 a year-round 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") minimum release requirement for Nacimiento
28 Reservoir to protect adult steelhead spawning in the Nacimiento River and to protect juvenile

1844316.1 9202-012 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- steelhead rearing in the Nacimiento River for at least 1-3 years as a result of that spawning. In July
2 2007, the Agency's Board of Supervisors adopted an Addendum to the SVWP EIR that analyzed
3 the effects of modifying the SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum release and other requirements

4 of the Biological Opinion. The Agency's Board of Supervisors then adopted a Resolution modifying
5 the SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum release requirement for Nacimiento Reservoir, along with
6 other steelhead protection measures from the Biological Opinion. In 2008, the State Water
7 Resources Control Board ("State Water Board") added the 60 cfs minimum release and other
8 requirements of the Biological Opinion to the appropriative water right license and permit for
9 Nacimiento Reservoir. On June 4, 2014 the Agency cut Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum release
10 below 60 cfs based on the contention that NMFS had approved the cut. The Agency resumed the 60
11 cfs minimum release on May 28, 2015.

12 4. The Agency's failure to operate the SVWP as required in 2014 and 2015 resulted in

13 litigation between the Coalition and Defendants. Certain water rights claims in that litigation

14 ultimately were referred to the State Water Board for evaluation of certain claims pursuant to Water
15 Code section 2000 et seq. (the "Reference Proceeding"). Pursuant to orders by the Monterey County
16 Superior Court, the reference proceeding was divided into two phases. Phase included the question
17 of whether Defendants violated the 60 cfs minimum release requirement in Nacimiento Reservoir's
18 water rights.

19 5. During the Reference Proceeding's Phase 1, the Defendant Agency for the first time
20 adopted the position that the 60 cfs minimum release requirement in Nacimiento Reservoir's water
21  rights was not triggered in 2014 or 2015 and, therefore, is not a real "minimum release" that must

22 be made year round, every year. The Defendant Agency's new position directly contradicts the
23 Biological Opinion, the Agency's SVWP EIR Addendum, and Agency's Resolution modifying the
24 SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum release as a constant minimum that must be made year round,
25 every year. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Defendant Agency now applies its new
26| interpretation of the 60 cfs release requirement in Nacimiento Reservoir's water rights to the 60 cfs
27 minimum release requirement that the Agency Board of Supervisors approved in its 2007 Resolution
28 modifying the SVWP. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency's new interpretation

1844316.1 9202-012 2 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 of the 60 cfs release requirement is a substantial change to the SVWP that will cause significant
2 adverse environmental impacts to steelhead and downstream water supplies in the Salinas River and

3 Basin.

4 6. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency has effected this change to
5 the SVWP's 60 cfs minimum release requirement without completing any further CEQA review or

6 amending its 2007 Resolution adding the 60 cfs minimum release requirement to the SVWP.

7 Moreover, the project change is divorced entirely from the underlying CEQA review. In fact,

8 evidence presented in the Reference Proceeding demonstrates that this change in the SVWP would
9 nullify one of the 60 cfs minimum release requirement's two purposes by dewatering and killing
10| juvenile steelhead rearing in the Nacimiento River as a result of adult spawning induced by the 60

11 cfs minimum release requirement. The preceding evidence shows that the Agency's new
12 interpretation of the 60 cfs minimum release requirement would transform what NMFS describes as
13 some of the best steelhead rearing habitat in the Salinas River basin into a trap that kills steelhead

14 and helps push this threatened species closer toward extinction.

15 7. The Agency's apparent new change to the SVWP is substantial and will have
16 significant impacts on the environment that have not been evaluated and publicly disclosed. The
17 Agency must be enjoined from proceeding with its project change unless and until this Court
18 determines that the Agency has complied with CEQA, completed applicable procedures for the
19 Agency's Board of Supervisors to further modify the SVWP, and comply with other applicable law.

20 THE PARTIES AND STANDING

21 8. Plaintiff and Petitioner Coalition is a non-profit corporation organized under the laws
22 of, and qualified as doing business in, the State of California and the County of Monterey. The

23 Coalition was formed and operates to represent and further the interests of its members in protecting
24 their water rights, their access to supplemental water supplies, and in sustainably managing water
25 resources within the Monterey County portion of the Salinas Valley. The Coalition's members
26 include individuals and business entities that own, lease or otherwise control real property including

27 riparian surface water rights and overlying groundwater rights in the Monterey County portion of
28 the Salinas Valley, and are otherwise beneficially interested in this matter.

1844316.1 9202-012 3 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

9. The Coalition and its members, as property owners and taxpayers, also have an

2 interest in ensuring that public officials lawfully perform their duties, including duties that are

3 mandated by applicable law, and ensure that such laws, regulations, and duties are executed and

4 enforced uniformly, fairly and as written.

5 10. Although some or all of the Coalition's members would have standing to sue

6 Defendants in this action in their own right, neither the claims asserted nor the relief requested
7 requires the participation in this action of individual members of the Coalition.

8 11. Defendant and Respondent Agency was created pursuant to the Monterey County

9 Water Resources Agency Act, 1990 Stats. 1159, 1991 Stats. 1130, 1993 Stats. 234, and 1994 Stats.
10 803 ("Agency Act") and is public entity organized and existing under the laws of the State of

11 California. The Agency Act directs Defendant Agency "to provide for the control of the flood and
12 | storm waters of the Agency and the flood and storm waters of streams that have their sources outside
13 the Agency, but which streams and flood waters flow into the Agency, and to conserve those waters
14 for beneficial and useful purposes by spreading, storing, retaining, and causing those waters to
15 percolate into the soil within the Agency....*"* (Agency Act §§ 4, 8.) The Agency holds appropriative
16 water rights to store water from the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers, subject to prior water

17 rights, like the riparian and overlying water rights of the Coalition's members. The Agency is
18 responsible for operating the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs.

19 12. The Agency has a Board of Supervisors and a separate Board of Directors. Section
20 52(a) of the Agency's enabling act states: "The Directors shall advise the Board of Supervisors on
21 all matters relating to the Agency within the scope of the Supervisors' duties. No action shall be
22 taken by the Board of Supervisors relating to the Agency without seeking or obtaining a
23 recommendation from the Directors."

24 13. The Coalition is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Defendants sued herein
25 as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue these Defendants by such fictitious names. The
26 Coalition will amend this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained. The
27 Coalition is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of said fictitiously named
28 Defendants is in some manner responsible for the legal violations and injury and damage to the

1844316.1 9202-012 4 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Coalition's members that is alleged herein. The Coalition is informed and believes and thereon
2 alleges that at all times herein mentioned, Defendants herein were the agents, servants, and
3 employees of their Co-Defendants, and in doing the things hereinafter mentioned, acting within the

4 course and scope of their authority as such agents, servants and employees, with the permission and

5 consent of their Co-Defendants.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 14. The Agency's enabling act states that "[a]ctions and decisions of the Agency,
8 whether by the Board of Supervisors, the Directors, or others acting on behalf of the Agency are
9 subject to judicial review
10 15. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action and personal jurisdiction

11 over the Defendants, all of whom reside in and operate and conduct business in the State of
12 California.

13 16. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 392, 395, 1060, and 1085 and Public
14 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, venue as to each Defendant is proper in this Court
15 because the Coalition's members own and use real property and water rights located within
16 Monterey County, the Defendants reside and operate in Monterey County, and the transactions and
17 occurrences giving rise to the Coalition's claims arise within Monterey County. Further, the
18 environmental impacts of the Agency's decision to change the SVWP without completing proper
19 environmental review will be most keenly felt in Monterey County.

20 THE PETITION IS TIMELY

21 17. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivisions (a) and (d), the
22 Coalition timely filed the Petition in this matter.

23 18. Any applicable statute of limitations must run from or after the first date of possible
24 notice of the Agency's change to the SVWP, which, at the earliest, is December 21, 2018, when the
25 Agency adopted the State Water Board Draft Report's interpretation of the 60 cfs release
26 requirement. The Petition is, therefore, timely.

27 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

28 19. The Agency has not noticed or held any public meetings with respect to its decision

1844316.1 9202-012 5 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to change the SVWP. The Coalition has presented its opposition to the project change, and exhausted
2 any and all available administrative remedies.

3 NOTICE

4 20. On June 14, 2019, the Coalition sent via U.S. Mail and email a written notice of

5 I commencement of this action in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true
6 and correct copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit 1.

7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

8 Environmental Review and Approval of the SVWP.
21. In 2002, the Agency proposed the SVWP to capture more winter storm flows for use
10 in providing more groundwater recharge. To do that, the Agency proposed: (1) to enlarge
11 Nacimiento Dam's spillway to safely hold back more water by eliminating the need to maintain
12 empty reservoir storage space for flood control during the winter; (2) to reoperate both reservoirs to

13 use the additional storage space by capturing more winter storm flows to create more water supply
14 yield; and (3) to use the additional water supply yield to increase groundwater recharge. The Agency
15 estimated that the spillway modification and reservoirs reoperation would generate an additional
16 average annual water supply yield of 29,000 acre-feet per year (*AFY"). Most of that new yield

17 would be used to increase recharge releases, but an annual average of 9,700 AFY would be diverted
18 by a newly constructed Salinas River Diversion Facility ("SRDF") to augment the water supply
19 delivered to farmers through the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project's ("CSIP") pipelines within
20 the area overlying the portion of the Basin where local groundwater pumping has caused seawater
21 intrusion.

22 22. The Agency prepared a draft and final EIR assessing the SVWP's effects under

23 CEQA. The Agency's draft EIR explained that during droughts, the Agency would not deliver water

24 to SRDF customers, committing that SRDF deliveries "would be constrained during drought
25 periods." The Agency's Final EIR retained the commitment, explaining that "[d]rought is,
26 essentially, considered those times when water is unavailable for delivery through the diversion

27 facility." The Agency used the Salinas Valley Integrated Groundwater Surfacewater Model
28 ("SVIGSM") computer program to identify and describe the SVWP's beneficial effects on

1844316.1 9202-012 6 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 groundwater levels, and the Agency's EIR concluded that seawater intrusion would be halted by the
2 SVWP. The Agency's Final EIR also explained:

3 The conveyance of water released from the reservoirs via Salinas River channel causes an increased recharge through the Salinas River bed. The 4 groundwater levels would, thus, increase in the Forebay and Upper:

5 Valley Subareas.

6 23. Accordingly, the Agency's Final EIR concluded that downstream riparian and
7 overlying water rights would be fully protected against any significant impacts from the SVWP,

8 because the SVWP "would help improve the hydraulic balance of the basin and would be considered
9 a beneficial impact of the project."

10 24. The Agency's EIR also analyzed potential effects on steelhead trout using Salinas

11 River tributaries, like the Nacimiento River, for adult spawning and rearing of juvenile steelhead
12 produced by that spawning. Steelhead are listed as threatened under the ESA. The EIR concluded

13 that the SVWP would not cause significant adverse effects to steelhead, because the SVWP included
14 "operational criteria" specifying flow-based habitat triggers requiring reservoir releases between
15 December 1 and May 31 to maintain steelhead migration conditions. The operational criteria include
16 and specify:

17 During the period of December 1 to May 31 and while the Arroyo Seco daily average flow as measured at the USGS Arroyo Seco near 18 Soledad gage is 173 cfs or more or if daily average flow in the Salinas River measured at Paso Robles is 60 cfs or more, the project 19 operational scheme would allow sufficient releases/spills from

20 Nacimiento and/or San Antonio reservoirs, such that Salinas River daily average flows upstream of Spreckels (measured at the USGS Spreckels gage or estimated from the Chualar gage) would not be 21 below 155 cfs, and Salinas River daily average flows downstream of Spreckels would not be below 72 cfs. 22
Also, during the period of December 1 to May 31 (Alternative A only) 23 while the surface diversion facility is in operation and while the
24 Arroyo Seco daily average flow as measured at the USGS Arroyo Seco near Soledad gage has been 173 cfs or more within the preceding 10 day period or if daily average flow in the Salinas River measured 25 at Paso Robles has been 60 cfs or more within the preceding 10 day

26 period, sufficient flow would be bypassed at the diversion facility to allow passage of steelhead to the Salinas River lagoon. A flow of 45 cfs from the dam site to the lagoon has been estimated as sufficient 27 for passage when the lagoon is open to the ocean.

28 During the period of December 1 to May 31 (Alternative A only) and

1844316.1 9202-012 7 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

when the lagoon is closed and the surface diversion facility is in operation, the lagoon surface would be maintained at an elevation of
2 not less than 3.0 feet NGVD by regulating the flow through the lagoon

3 outlet gate. A minimum flow to the lagoon of 15 cfs will be bypassed at the diversion facility under these conditions. Flow through the outlet gate will be maintained at a level sufficient to allow passage of 4 steelhead to the Old Salinas River channel during this period.

5 25. The Agency's Draft EIR concluded that implementing the SVWP with the preceding

6 operational criteria would avoid significant adverse impacts to steelhead from SVWP
7 implementation. The Agency's Final EIR retained that analysis and conclusion.

8 26. The reservoir releases specified by the preceding operational criteria for steelhead
9 protection were part of the SVWP that the Agency analyzed by computer model and concluded
10 would increase groundwater elevations through recharge and would halt seawater intrusion.
11 27. On June 4, 2002, the Agency Board of Supervisors certified the SVWP Final EIR
12 and approved the SVWP. When the Agency certified the Final EIR and approved the SVWP, the
13 Agency approved and committed not to operate the SRDF during droughts and also approved and
14 committed to implement the preceding operational criteria for steelhead protection. The Agency's
15 approval and commitment to implement the preceding operational criteria for steelhead protection
16 was, and remains, necessary to avoid significant adverse effects to steelhead and to downstream

17 water supplies. A true and correct copy of the Final EIR is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

18 The Defendant Agency Obtains Incidental Take Coverage For Steelhead Protected Under

19 The Federal Endangered Species Act

20 28. In June a 2003, the Agency initiated a process to ensure its implementation of the
21 SVWP would comply with the ESA, pursuant to which steelhead in the Salinas River system are
a 22  listed as a threatened species. The Agency submitted a Biological Assessment (*BA") to initiate a
23 consultation process to obtain from NMFS a Biological Opinion to ensure that the SVWP would be
24 carried out by protecting steelhead in compliance with ESA Section 7. ESA Section 7 restricts

25 federal permit approvals that would jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or destroy
26 its critical habitat and requires any incidental harm to a listed species be reduced or avoided through
27 specified measures. The Agency's BA explained that the Agency would "maintain present
28 conservation release practices to recharge the groundwater basin" and that the 29,000 AFY of

1844316.1 9202-012 8 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

"additional •water released from the reservoirs under the proposed [SVWP] will provide for
additional recharge to the basin, in addition to diversion requirements at the diversion facilities." To

3 address droughts, the Agency's BA said the SVWP's new "river diversion is variable and will be
4 constrained during drought periods."

5 29. On June 21, 2007, NMFS issued its Biological Opinion for the SVWP. The
6 Biological Opinion stated that "MCWRA will increase minimum flows downstream of Nacimiento

•7 Dam to 60 cfs during the steelhead spawning season. MCWRA will continue the 60 cfs release

8 throughout the year to improve rearing habitat. This minimum flow criterion will be in effect as long
9 as the surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir remains above elevation 687.8 feet msl, the
10 reservoir's minimum pool." The Biological Opinion further states that "the three miles closest to

11 the dam are thought to have the best rearing habitat where stream temperatures are cooler, riparian

12 vegetation is more dense and substrate components are larger compared to conditions further
13 downstream." The Biological Opinion states that "NMFS anticipates than an increase in base flows

14 to 60 cfs will provide adequate rearing habitat during spring, summer and fall in the first three
15 miles downstream of the dam in years when the Nacimiento Reservoir is above its minimum pool
16 level." The Biological Opinion recognized that the SVWP "would result in approximately 29,000

17 AFY of additional stored water that would be available for additional conservation releases (i.e.,
18 recharge of the groundwater aquifers), downstream diversion, as well as fish passage."

19 Modification Of The SVWP To Impose The 60 cfs Minimum Flow Release Requirement
20 30. After the Agency negotiated the 60 cfs minimum release requirement with NMFS

21 through the 2007 Biological Opinion, the Agency completed further CEQA review to assess impacts
22 from modifying the previously approved SVWP to replace its "operational criteria" for steelhead
23 protection with the 60 cfs minimum release requirement for Nacimiento Reservoir and other release
24 commitments that the Biological Opinion prescribed to protect steelhead. To complete that further
25 CEQA review, the Agency prepared the 2007 SVWP EIR Addendum (*Addendum"), which
26 documented the Agency's analysis and conclusion that the 60 cfs minimum flow release requirement
27 and other SVWP modifications for steelhead would not cause any new or more severe significant
28 adverse environmental effects from what had been disclosed by the original SVWP EIR process that

1844316.1 9202-012 9 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Agency completed in 2002. A true and correct copy of the Addendum is attached hereto as

2 Exhibit 3.

3 31. As a part of the Agency's further CEQA review, it used the SVIGSM computer
4 program to assess whether the 60 cfs minimum release and other flow release requirements from
5 the Biological Opinion would significantly alter the SVWP's beneficial groundwater recharge
6 effects. This model characterized Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs release requirement consistently

7 with the •Biological Opinion-as a constant minimum (subject to Nacimiento Reservoir's water

8 surface elevation remaining above the 687.8 feet msl minimum pool).

32. The Addendum said: "The new minimum release [FN.6] is 60 cfs from Nacimiento

10 Reservoir." The Addendum's footnote 6 said: "The 60 cfs will be released until a study can be
11 conducted to determine how much water is needed to provide adequate rearing flow for the
12 Nacimiento River below the dam []." The Addendum concluded that replacing the SVWP's original
13 operating criteria with the 60 cfs requirement and other flows required by the Biological Opinion

14 would not cause any new or more severe significant impacts to the environment, so that steelhead
15 and downstream water supplies would be protected.

16 33. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency has completed no further
17 study determining that release of less than 60 cfs will protect juvenile steelhead rearing in the
18 Nacimiento River. The Coalition is informed and believes that NMFS has never approved any
19 reduction in the 60 cfs minimum release requirement for Nacimiento Reservoir.

20 34. Based on the Addendum, the Defendant Agency Board of Supervisors adopted
21 Resolution No. 07-294 modifying the SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum flow release for
22 Nacimiento Reservoir and related flow release requirements from the Biological Opinion. The
23 Resolution states "the Board approves the proposed modifications to the Salinas Valley Water

24 Project as described in the Addendum." By finding that those changes "will not cause new
25 significant environmental effects of a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
26 effects," the Defendant Agency confirmed that implementation of the SVWP with the 60 cfs
27 minimum release requirement would protect steelhead while providing groundwater recharge to
28 protect downstream water supplies. A true and correct copy of the Resolution is attached hereto as

1844316.1 9202-012 10 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Exhibit 4.

2 35. Accordingly, the 60 cfs release requirement for Nacimiento Reservoir was a constant
3 minimum in both the Biological Opinion and the CEQA document on which the Defendant Agency
4 relied in approving the 2007 modification of the SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum release for
5 Nacimiento Reservoir and, thus, is an essential component of the SVWP.

6 The 2016 Complaint & Reference Proceeding

7 36. On January 13, 2017, the Coalition initiated a lawsuit against the Agency to prevent

8 injury to the water supply on which its members and many others depend. (Salinas Valley Water

9 Coalition v. Monterey County Water Resources Agency, et al., Case No. 17CV000157, Monterey

10 County Super. Ct. ("SVWC v. MCWRA").) The operative complaint in that lawsuit, the Verified

11 Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive
12 Relief (filed May 23, 2017) ("Complaint"), alleges twelve causes of action that fall into three

13 categories: (1) water rights violations; (2) Proposition 218 violations; and (3) a Public Records Act
14 violation.

15 37. The Complaint's water rights causes of action, among other things, seek a writ of
16 mandate ordering the Agency to operate Nacimiento Reservoir in compliance with its appropriative
17 water rights, including their 60 cfs release requirement.

18 38. On August 1, 2017, the Court in SVWC v. MCWRA entered an order referring the
19 Coalition's water rights causes of action to the State Water Board for investigation pursuant to Water
20 Code section 2000 et seq. On September 8, 2017, the court ordered the State Water Board to

21 investigate and report on the Coalition's 60 cfs violation claim as follows:

22 Whether the Defendant Monterey County Water Resources Agency
23 (*Agency") has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543

24 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from

.25 Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015....

26 39. On January 25, 2018, as a part of the Reference Proceeding, the State Water Board
27 conducted a "Modelers Conference" to facilitate the Defendant Agency's production of information

28 necessary to understand the SVIGSM computer files evidencing the Agency's analysis of how

1844316.1 9202-012 11 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

modifying the SVWP to include the 60 cfs requirement would affect downstream water supplies. At
2 the January 2018 Modelers Conference, the Agency's former consultant who conducted the
3 SVIGSM groundwater modeling testified that the 60 cfs minimum flow release requirement for
4 Nacimiento Reservoir was part of the 2007 SVWP modifications analyzed for the Agency in the
5 SVIGSM model file set that the Agency had produced to the Coalition.

6 40. The State Water Board issued the Phase 1 Draft Report of Referee (*Draft Report")

7 on November 16, 2018, and asked the parties to file comments. A true and correct copy of the Draft
8 Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 5.
9 41. Based on the evidence and briefs the parties submitted to the State Water Board, the
10 Draft Report correctly found: "There is no factual dispute that the actual rate of release was less

11 than 60 cfs during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015. After an initial ramp-down
12 period, flow releases from the Nacimiento Reservoir for this period ranged between approximately
13 25 and 30 cfs." (Draft Report at 18.)

14 42. The Draft Report then reviewed the Agency's water rights and their "Flow
15 Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River," observing that "[a]fter

16 May 31 of each year, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription requires the Agency to continue
17 to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder of the calendar year as long as the water surface elevation
18 of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.7 feet mean sea level."" (Draft Report at 19.)

19 43. The Draft Report then reasoned that "whether the Agency was required to release 60
20 cfs starting in June 2014 and 2015 depends on whether the Spawning and Rearing Flow

21 Prescription requires releases after May 31 even if there were no adult steelhead passage days earlier
22 in the year." (Draft Report at 19.) From there, the Draft Report stated:

23 We read the plain language of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription

24 to require a release of 60 cfs after May 31 only if adult steelhead passage days triggered the requirement prior to May 31. Key to our interpretation is

25 the word "continue" in the flow prescription. To read the provision to require the permittee to begin releasing 60 cfs after May 31 when not

26 required to do so previously would be inconsistent with the meaning of the word "continue," and is a not a reasonable interpretation of the term.

27 (Draft Report at 19.) Based on that rationale, the Draft Report concluded that the 60 cfs requirement

28 in Nacimiento Reservoir's water rights was not "triggered" in 2014 and 2015, so the Agency did not

1844316.1 9202-012 12 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P violate the 60 cfs release requirement in 2014 or 2015.

2 44. The Draft Report's interpretation of the 60 cfs release requirement in the "Spawning
3 and Rearing Flow Prescription" in Nacimiento Reservoir's water rights as something that switches
4 | on or off each year, and not as a constant minimum, was new-not articulated by either party or
5 anyone else ever before. The new interpretation disregards the second half of the express two-part
6 purpose of the 60 cfs minimum release requirement: (1) to attract and protect adult steelhead

7 spawning in the Nacimiento River and (2) to protect juvenile steelhead rearing in the Nacimiento

8 River for at least 1-3 years as a result of this spawning.
45. On or about December 21, 2018, the Agency filed its comments on the Draft Report.

10 In addressing the 60 cfs violation claim identified as "Issue (A)," the Agency's comments stated

11 "the Draft Report correctly finds and concludes that the Monterey County Water Resources Agency

12 (*Agency") did not violate the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the
13 Nacimiento River contained in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit-21089 (Application
14 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water from Nacimiento Reservoir
15 during the period June 4, 2015 through May 27, 2015." The Agency's comments further state that
16 "Respondents [i.e., the Agency and its Board of Supervisors and Board of Directors] accept the State

17 Board's analysis and conclusions regarding Issue (A)." A true and correct copy of the Defendants'

18 comments on the Draft Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 6.

19 46.. On or about January 31, 2019, the State Water Board lodged its Final Report of
20 Referee ("Final Report") with the Monterey County Superior Court. On or about March 4, 2019, the
21 Agency filed with the court its Exceptions to the Final Report. A true and correct copy of the State
22 Water Board's Final Report is attached hereto as Exhibit 7. The Agency's Exceptions do not
23 challenge the Final Report's reasoning and conclusion that the 60 cfs release requirement in
24 Nacimiento Reservoir's water rights did not mandate a constant minimum release but, instead, was
25 conditioned on factors that would switch the release on or off each year (i.e., aside from the
26 minimum pool requirement). A true and correct copy of the Agency's Exceptions to the Final Report
27 is attached hereto as Exhibit 8.

28 47. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency has now adopted the position

1844316.1 9202-012 13 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- that both Nacimiento Reservoir's water rights and the Agency Board of Supervisors' 2007
2 Resolution modifying the SVWP should be interpreted as conditioning Nacimiento Reservoir's 60
3 cfs release requirement on an annual trigger instead of interpreting the 60 cfs release requirement as
4| a constant minimum release commitment (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool

5 elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl).

6 48. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency's adoption of that new

8 interpretation of the 60 cfs release requirement is a substantial change to the SVWP that will cause

9 significant adverse environmental impacts that have not been evaluated and publicly disclosed.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10

11 49. (Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA - As Against All Defendants)
The Coalition hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 48 as if fully
12 set forth herein.

13 50. In adopting the State Water Board's new interpretation of the 60 cfs release
14 requirement, the Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency substantially changed the
15 SVWP. The change to the 60 cfs requirement from a constant minimum will have significant, new
16 environmental impacts that have not been evaluated and publicly disclosed pursuant to CEQA.

17 51. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency changed the SVWP without
18 conducting any further CEQA review. That failure to complete further CEQA review before
19 changing the SVWP is a violation of Public Resources Code section 21166, which requires further
20 review when "(a) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions

21 of the environmental impact report [or]. (b) Substantial changes occur with respect to the
22 circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the
23 environmental impact report."

24 52. The Agency failed to undertake a mandatory duty and/or abused its discretion in
25 failing to conduct any further CEQA review before substantially changing the SVWP. The Coalition
26 requires a writ a of mandate ordering the Agency to refrain from proceeding with any change to the
27 SVWP from that which was evaluated in the 2007 Addendum and approved in the Agency's 2007
28 Resolution before such time as the Court determines the Agency has completed appropriate further

1844316.1 9202-012 14 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate - Implement The SVWP As Approved - As Against All Defendants)

4 53. The Coalition hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 52 as if fully
set forth herein.

6 54. The Agency has a non-discretionary duty to implement the SVWP as described in
the underlying environmental documents, including the 2007 Addendum, and the 2007 Resolution
8 approving Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs release requirement as a constant minimum (so long as
9 Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl).

10 55. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency has failed to discharge its
11 duty by now adopting an interpretation of the 60 cfs release requirement that does not require a
12 constant minimum release (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains
13 above 687.8 feet msl)-in conflict with the Agency's 2007 Addendum and 2007 Resolution.

14 56. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency changed the SVWP in
15 violation of its own 2007 Resolution modifying the SVWP to include the 60 cfs minimum release
16 requirement.

17 57. The Coalition lacks an adequate remedy at law if the Agency is allowed to proceed
18 with the modified SVWP prior to such time as this Court determines whether the Agency's actions

19 to change the SVWP were lawful.
20 58. The Coalition requires a writ of mandate ordering the Agency to discharge its duty
21 and implement the SVWP in compliance with the Agency's 2007 Resolution.

22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Declaratory Relief Regarding Defendants' Duty to Implement the Salinas Valley Water

24 Project As Modified in 2007 To Include A 60 cfs Minimum Release Commitment for Nacimiento Reservoir - As Against All Defendants)

25 59. The Coalition hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 58 as if fully

26 set forth herein.

27 60. The Agency has a non-discretionary duty to implement the SVWP as described in
28 the 2007 Addendum and the 2007 Agency Board of Supervisors Resolution approving a

1844316.1 9202-012 15 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

modification to the SVWP that makes Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs release requirement a constant

2 minimum (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet
3 msl).

61: An actual, present, and substantial controversy exists between the Coalition and
5 Defendants. The Coalition is informed and believes that the Agency now disputes that its 2007
6 Agency Board of Supervisors Resolution makes Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs release requirement

7 a constant minimum (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above

8 687.8 feet msl). The Coalition is informed and believes that present dispute now exists between
9 the Coalition and Defendants over whether the SVWP includes a requirement that Nacimiento
10 Reservoir release a minimum of 60 cfs of water to protect steelhead and downstream water supplies

11 (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl).

12 62. A declaration of the respective rights and duties of the parties is necessary and
13 appropriate.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Injunctive Relief To Prohibit Any Project Change Before Completion of Environmental Review - As Against All Defendants) 16

17 63. The Coalition hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 62 as if fully
18 set forth herein.

19 64. The changes to the SVWP adversely and significantly affect, and will continue to
20 affect, the environment and cause irreparable harm to the Coalition if not enjoined.
21 65. The Agency changed the SVWP in violation of its own 2007 Addendum and 2007
22 Resolution adding Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs minimum release requirement to the SVWP, and
23 without conducting further CEQA review.

24 66. The Coalition lacks an adequate remedy at law if the Agency is allowed to proceed
25 with the changed SVWP prior to such time as this Court determines whether the Agency's actions
26 to change the SVWP were lawful, and/or the Agency completes appropriate environmental review.
27 67. The Coalition seeks an injunction prohibiting the Agency from proceeding with the
28 changes to the SVWP prior to such time as this Court determines the Agency has completed

1844316.1 9202-012 16 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

appropriate environmental review, and amends its Resolution,

2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

3 WHEREFORE, the Coalition prays as follows:

1. For a writ of mandate, commanding Defendants to:

a. Comply with the 60 cfs minimum release requirement as a constant minimum
6 (so long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl.), as
7 described in the Addendum and Resolution approved by the Defendant Agency;

8 b. Refrain from changing or otherwise altering the SVWP, including the 60 cfs

9 minimum release requirement as a constant minimum (s0 long as Nacimiento Reservoir's minimum
10 pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl), unless and until this Court determines that Defendants
11. have completed the necessary environmental review pursuant to CEQA and complied with other
12 applicable law;

13 2. For a declaration that the Defendant Agency's 2007 Resolution obligates Defendants
14 to operate Nacimiento Reservoir to provide a 60 cfs minimum release, SO long as Nacimiento
15 Reservoir's minimum pool elevation remains above 687.8 feet msl.

16 3. For a stay, temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
17 prohibiting Defendants from altering the SVWP, including the 60 cfs release requirement as a
18 constant minimum;

19 4. For attorneys® fees;

20 5. For costs of suit: and

21 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Salinas Valley Water Project Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT/ENVIRONMENTAL
IMPACT STATEMENT (EIR/EIS)
On June 8, 2001, the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) distributed to public agencies and the general public for review and comment a Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) for the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP or proposed action) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The SVWP is proposed to halt seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley groundwater basin, and to help hydrologically balance the basin. Seawater intrusion has resulted in the loss of use of a large part of the groundwater in the northern Salinas Valley. The proposed action includes the following components: 1) modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam; 2) reoperation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to store: higher volume of water in the wet season and allow greater releases of water from the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs during the irrigation season; 3) increased recharge of the groundwater basin through the higher irrigation season releases of water from the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs; 4) the construction and use of a seasonal diversion structure to move water from the Salinas River during the irrigation season for delivery to agricultural users through an existing pipeline system known as the "Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project," or CSIP, system; 5) reduction in groundwater pumping in the CSIP area; and 6) a potential expanded distribution system for diverted Salinas River water in the future if monitoring indicates that seawater intrusion has not been halted.
In accordance with $15105 of the State CEQA Guidelines and 40 C.F.R. 1503 (NEPA), a 45+- day review period was provided on the Draft EIR/EIS. During the review period, written comments were received from 163 commenters. In addition, a public hearing was held at MCWRA's offices in the City of Salinas on August 1, 2001, during which oral comments were received on the Draft EIR/EIS from 11 commenters.

1.2 ORGANIZATION OF THE RESPONSES TO COMMENTS DOCUMENT

All comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, and the responses thereto, are presented in this document. Chapter 2 contains all the written and oral comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, and presents
responses to significant environmental issues raised in the comments. All comment letters and
comments by speakers at the public hearing are labeled to correspond with an index table (Table 2-1) in Chapter 2. Each individual comment is assigned a number followed by a dash and another number (e.g. "1-1") that corresponds to the response following the comment. The focus of the responses to comments is on the disposition of significant environmental issues raised in the comments.

Section 2.2 consists of "Master Responses," which address comments raised by several commenters. The topics addressed in Section 2.2 represent many of the key issues of concern to
the Monterey and San Luis Obispo County communities.
In some instances, responses to comments may warrant modification of the text of the Draft £8610
EIR/EIS. In those cases, information that is to be deleted generally is shown in strikeout T

Salinas Valley Water Project 1-1 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

(strikeout) and additions are shown in bold (bold). Text changes resulting from comments and their accompanying responses have been incorporated into the original Draft EIR/EIS text, as
indicated in the responses. These text changes can be found in Chapter 3.0 of the Final EIR/EIS, "Changes to the Draft EIR/EIS."
The entire EIR/EIS for the SVWP consists of two volumes, the first of which has already been made available for public review: 1) the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement, and 2) this document, Responses to Comments. Together, the two volumes constitute the Final EIR/EIS.

THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The purpose of the proposed action is to provide for the long-term management and protection of groundwater resources in the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin (Basin). The specific objectives of the proposed action, as expressed in the EIR/EIS, are to (1) stop seawater intrusion, (2) provide adequate water supplies to meet the current and future (2030) needs of the Salinas Valley, and (3) improve the hydrologic balance of the Basin. Both the agricultural and urban sectors of the Salinas Valley rely on groundwater as their primary source of water, and meeting the project objectives is essential to the health of the greater than $2 billion-per-year agricultural economy of the valley as well as the urban economies that are inextricably linked to it. The basic viability of a project developed to meet these objectives depends, in part, on its ability to do so without resulting in substantial harm to the economies it is being developed to
support.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SEAWATER INTRUSION PROBLEM

Seawater intrusion has been recognized problem in the Salinas Valley for over 50 years. It is estimated that more than 24,000 acres of land now overlie areas of the 180-foot aquifer in which chloride concentration is 500 milligrams per liter (mg/) or greater, and more than 10,000 acres overlie an area of the 400-foot aquifer having chloride concentration of 500 mg/1 or greater. In some parts of the area of highest impact- the coastal side of the north valley- well water has become unusable for agricultural purposes and unfit for human consumption.
The Salinas Valley is effectively entirely reliant on groundwater for its potable supply and for agricultural irrigation (as supplemented by recycled water from the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project [CSIP). As the water supply is increasingly degraded by the inland advance of the seawater intrusion front, contaminated wells must be retired and the economic health of the immediately affected area, and the entire Salinas Valley, is threatened. The advancing seawater intrusion front is approaching the City of Salinas, where over 60% of the population of the valley resides.
As described in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the rate and movement of seawater intrusion vary in response to annual patterns of precipitation; the advancement rate is higher in dry years and lower during wetter years when precipitation recharges the Basin. Similarly, more seawater intrusion occurs when the Basin is being drawn down (typically during the irrigation season) than when it is being recharged (more likely during the non-irrigation season).
The Salinas Valley is considered by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to be a contiguous ground water system, formed by the fluvial deposits of the Salinas River. Although the valley is subdivided by DWR into smaller subareas based on depositional time frame and hydrogeologic conditions, it is generally believed that the major source of recharge to the Basin is the Salinas River. For this reason, the hydrologic impacts are evaluated as valleywide effect. Because all parts of the valley draw ground water from the same Basin, pumping throughout the valley has the potential to affect the advance of seawater intrusion, although pumping in the lands that overlie the area of greatest intrusion has the most direct effect. In other words, pumping in the coastal areas closest to the seawater intrusion front has a greater influence on 9 LOZO
sea water intrusion than pumping in a valley area more distant from the front. Nevertheless, %

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-35 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

pumping in each area affects seawater intrusion because each subarea draws water from the
same Basin.

Groundwater modeling was conducted in 1993 in an attempt to determine whether seawater intrusion could be halted if reductions were focused in the coastal areas of the Salinas Valley closest to the sea water intrusion front. The MCWRA found that, while pumping reductions themselves in any one area would not halt seawater intrusion, a reduction in groundwater pumping in the coastal areas would have a greater effect on seawater intrusion than pumping reduction elsewhere in the Basin. The 1993 modeling used the Salinas Valley Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Model (SVIGSM) (an earlier version than was used for the modeling for the Draft EIR/EIS) and examined 14 different theoretical operational scenarios, ranging from a 15% to 60% valleywide reduction in groundwater pumping, with combinations of reduced pumping by specific valley area also considered. This modeling preceded the implementation of the CSIP, and seawater intrusion averaged 15,600 acre-feet per year (AFY). One scenario considered the 15% valleywide pumping reduction, and a companion scenario examined a 15% reduction in only the Pressure and Eastside subareas (those areas closer to the coast). The valleywide 15% reduction in pumping reduced seawater intrusion to 11,300 AFY. Targeting the reduction on only the Pressure and Eastside subareas showed a reduction in seawater intrusion to 12,000 AFY. Thus, the MCWRA determined that the most effective approach to halting seawater intrusion would be one focusing on the areas closest to the coast.
For this reason, the MCWRA, in designing the SVWP, has focused on meeting the project objectives by reducing groundwater use in the coastal areas. Of the total of more than 460,000 AFY of Basin-wide groundwater pumping estimated for project baseline conditions, approximately 30,000 AFY is pumped in the coastal CSIP area. It is estimated that the proposed project, in combination with CSIP, would reduce irrigation demand by 77% in the CSIP area. However, the proposed project's in-lieu deliveries of SVWP surface water, and the CSIP recycled water, allow this 77% reduction in irrigation demand to occur without commensurate adverse effects. In addition, the SVWP approach (represented by both Alternative A and Alternative B), by integrating reservoir reoperation, downstream surface water diversion, and the use of delivered surface water in lieu of groundwater to meet a substantial portion of irrigation demand, provides the additional benefit of providing increased Basin recharge through: combination of streambed recharge and percolation of applied irrigation water. These project features are described further below. As will be shown below, the integrated-approach SVWP Alternatives (A and B) are designed to maximize the conservation and water supply benefits of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoir releases, in contrast with alternatives that focus on demand management alone.

The average annual rate of seawater intrusion has been reduced from 15,600 AFY to approximately 9,000 AFY since implementation of the CSIP. The SVWP is intended to build on the gains of the CSIP and implementation of voluntary water conservation, described later in this master response, to fully halt seawater intrusion.

OPTIONS FOR HALTING SEAWATER INTRUSION AR 02019

For the advance of seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley to be halted, the water supply needs of the valley must be met while overpumping of the aquifer is reversed (i.e., the hydrologic balance of the Basin is improved). Absent drastic changes in natural conditions (i.e.,

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-36 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

considerably more rainfall over an extended period), this may be achieved through one or a combination of the following basic approaches:
dramatically reducing demand for groundwater supply, substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater, and increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water.
Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs were constructed by the predecessor to the MCWRA. The reservoirs were placed in operation and the CSIP/Salinas Valley Water Recycling Projects implemented as initial phases in the MCWRA's efforts to halt seawater intrusion while providing flood control benefits to the valley. The proposed SVWP would build on the conservation benefits provided by operation of the reservoirs and the CSIP.
The following subsection describes the results of the MCWRA's evaluation of the amount of groundwater pumping curtailment (i.e., demand management) that would be needed to halt seawater intrusion. This is followed by a description of the basic hydrologic concepts underlying the proposed SVWP for comparison with a demand-management-only scenario.

DEMAND MANAGEMENT

In 1993 the MCWRA, through a contract with Montgomery Watson, directed the preparation of modeling to determine various levels of groundwater pumping reduction that could solve seawater intrusion. This preceded the completion of the CSIP. The results of the modeling were presented at a meeting of the MCWRA Board of Directors (April 26, 1993). At the time the modeling was completed, seawater intrusion into the 180-foot aquifer was estimated to average 15,600 AFY and into the 400-foot aquifer was estimated to average 6,500 AFY. Various scenarios and combinations of pumping reduction were considered. A 15% pumping reduction valleywide was shown to reduce seawater intrusion to 11,300 AFY in the 180-foot aquifer and to 4,400 AFY in the 400-foot aquifer. If the 15% reduction were targeted to only the Pressure and Eastside subareas, seawater intrusion in the 180- and 400-foot aquifers would be reduced to 12,000 AFY and 4,800 AFY, respectively.
Other scenarios considered included valleywide pumping reductions of 30%, 45%, and 60%
with corresponding reductions in seawater intrusion to 5,700 AFY, 1,300 AFY, and -1,800 AFY (i.e., seawater intrusion was halted) in the 180-foot aquifer (the 400-foot aquifer showed similar results). Following is a combination of pumping reductions considered, with the corresponding results to the 180-foot aquifer:
30% reduction in Pressure/Eastside, 15% reduction in Forebay/Upper Valley: seawater intrusion reduced to 5,100 AFY.
45% reduction in Pressure/Eastside, 15% reduction in Forebay/Upper Valley: seawater intrusion reduced to 2,000 AFY.
60% reduction in Pressure/Eastside, 15% reduction in Forebay/Upper Valley: seawater intrusion halted with positive flow of 1,000 AFY.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-37 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Following the preparation of this analysis, additional modeling was performed for a presentation (August 4, 1993) to the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). This modeling found that a 50% valleywide pumping reduction was needed for seawater intrusion to be zero (no margin of safety). The CSIP project was also modeled and was shown to reduce seawater intrusion by approximately 5,400 AFY (from 15,600 AFY to 10,200 AFY).
The MCWRA used this data to develop the assumption that a valleywide reduction in pumping of 30% to 50% (with the CSIP in place) represented a reasonable range for considering what would be needed to halt seawater intrusion absent a project that would supply an alternative source of water. Other combinations could have been assumed (such as the 60% reduction in the Pressure/Eastside together with a 15% reduction in the Forebay/Upper Valley), but were rejected for two reasons:
1. The MCWRA looks at the Basin as one unit and this method recognized this consideration; and 2. It would have unreasonably complicated the analysis to examine different combinations of reduction in different areas when the only reason for considering this analysis is the development of a "reasonable alternative" for CEQA and NEPA purposes. Given the large reductions in groundwater pumping that would be needed (regardless of the combination of areas considered) and the resultant economic effects, the MCWRA has never believed it to be reasonable to pursue massive-scale pumping reductions as the means to halt seawater intrusion. Thus, this analysis was considered sufficient for
comparative purposes.
For the reasons described above, the MCWRA considered a 30-50% curtailment of groundwater pumping throughout the Basin to represent realistic appraisal of the degree of demand management that would be needed, absent the provision of additional water supply and increased aquifer recharge, to halt seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley. For this reason, the No Action Total Demand Management Alternative was evaluated in the Draft EIR/EIS to represent the most likely scenario for long-term management and protection of groundwater resources in the Basin should the SVWP not be implemented. This alternative represents a 30- 50% reduction in groundwater pumping, assumed to be achieved through the implementation of pumping limits and/or other water extraction monitoring applied by the MCWRA to agricultural and urban users throughout the Basin.
The MCWRA also recognized from this exercise that the most efficient approach to halting seawater intrusion would be to focus on reducing groundwater pumping 1n the coastal areas. This is the impetus for the proposed project.
Some commenters have questioned the basis for evaluating total demand management as a valleywide reduction in groundwater pumping, and have suggested that the Draft EIR/EIS should have instead evaluated implementation of total demand management only within the coastal area of the valley (the 53,000+acre Pressure Subarea of the Basin) to meet the project objective of halting sea water intrusion. The rationale for this suggestion is that the Pressure Subarea, on average, has a higher per-acre use of irrigation water than the other parts of the Salinas Valley and groundwater pumping in this area has greater direct effect on seawater intrusion than pumping in other areas has.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-38 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The proposed project (Alternatives A and B) in effect does, in combination with the CSIP, replace groundwater use in the coastal area of the valley. The CSIP is already in place and providing recycled water to the 12,000-acre CSIP area (11,000 AF was supplied in 2001). The project would also supply this area. CSIP water is currently supplemented by well water and $

would need to continue to be supplemented by groundwater or other water supply both to meet demands and to be blended with higher quality water.
Together, the CSIP (delivering an average of 13,300 AFY) and the project (Alternative A, supplying an average of 9,700 AFY) would provide approximately 23,000 AFY to the CSIP area, which is over 77% of the estimated 30,000 AFY used in the CSIP area. The project (Alternative A) would account for 32% of the water used in the CSIP area. In addition to directly replacing groundwater, application of irrigation water also helps recharge the Basin through percolation. If the project were not to be constructed and this area were to continue to be the focus of efforts to halt seawater intrusion, ground water pumping would need to be severely curtailed in the CSIP area. The reduction would need to encompass not only the 32% represented by SVWP deliveries, but would also need to account for the loss of ground water recharge from the percolation associated with the application of this volume of water for irrigation. Thus, more than a 32% reduction in groundwater pumping in the CSIP area would be needed, absent the project, to halt seawater intrusion.
If an alternative were developed to focus on eliminating seawater intrusion by substantially eliminating groundwater pumping in an area such as Castroville, the economic effects would be substantial. Artichokes are the predominant crop grown in Castroville. The 2000 Monterey County Crop Report reports that artichokes brought in approximately $8,400 per acre. Using artichokes as a surrogate for the value of agriculture in the Castroville area, a corresponding reduction of 32% in the amount of artichokes would result in primary annual lost revenue on the order of $32,256,000. This does not account for secondary effects (wages to farm labor, processing costs and revenues, shipping, etc.).
If, instead, the MCWRA were to reduce pumping in an area such as the Pressure Subarea, over 53,000 acres would be affected. As can be inferred from the data presented above for the
12,000-acre CSIP area, large-scale reductions in groundwater pumping and the corresponding reduction in crop revenues would result in substantial economic impacts to the region. If the seawater intrusion problem could be resolved by reducing even only 30% of the pumping in the Pressure Subarea (and modeling would bear out a much higher reduction based on the 1993 results described earlier), lost revenues would top $130 million.

INTEGRATED-APPROACH OPTIONS

Halting seawater intrusion through the forced reductions in groundwater use described in the foregoing section can be expected to have drastic detrimental effects on the economic health of the Salinas Valley in general, whether implemented valleywide or in a more focused subarea. The MCWRA developed the integrated-management approach represented by SVWP Alternatives A and B to meet all the project objectives without causing such harm to the valley's economy. (And, in fact, when the cost of Alternative B was borne out, the stakeholders in the 02022

Salinas Valley expressed grave concern over its economic viability and instead motivated the MCWRA to explore the more cost-effective Alternative A.) The integrated-management E

scenarios can achieve this end because they combine groundwater demand reduction,

substitution of water supply, and increased recharge through both streambed recharge and percolation of applied irrigation water.
The extent of gains in water conservation thät can be provided through the MCWRA's operation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs is limited by two operational parameters, the flood control rule curve and the MCWRA's target storage rule curve. These are described below, followed by an overview of the basic concept of reservoir reoperation and other SVWP features and how they would achieve the project objectives.
Operational Rule Curves for Flood Control Releases and the 3:1 Release Ratio
The flood rule curve describes the operational requirements established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the California Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) to ensure that reservoir operations are conducted to provide an appropriate level of flood protection for areas downstream. The flood rule curve identifies the amount of empty storage space that must be maintained in a reservoir during different months to allow for the capture of potential stormflows. The curve is based on the historical hydrologic records for the watershed, which identify the amount of runoff that corresponds to storm events of different frequencies, and on the ability of the dam spillway to pass the probable maximum flood (PMF). Enlargement of the Nacimiento Reservoir spillway capacity is being planned to allow the dam to pass the recently recalculated PMF. Increasing the amount of water that can be evacuated in given amount of time from the reservoir means that the flood rule curve for the reservoir can be redefined. It is anticipated that new flood rule curve will be specified that requires that less empty storage space be retained during the wet season. This will allow for more water to be stored in the wet months and that this increased water supply can be used toward providing
some

The water supply as substitution for groundwater pumping, as described below.
target storage rule curve is the method established by the MCWRA to balance releases between Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs in order to optimize water conservation and flood protection benefits. Operating according to this curve ensures that the ratio of empty storage space at Nacimiento Reservoir is maintained at approximately three times that of San
Antonio Reservoir.

Some commenters have questioned the rationale for the MCWRA's use of a 3:1 ratio for empty storage space at Nacimiento Reservoir and San Antonio Reservoir. Other commenters, while accepting the 3:1 ratio, have questioned whether the MCWRA could delay releases from Nacimiento Reservoir to later in the recreation season so as to reduce recreational impacts on the lake associated with lowered water surface elevations. The target storage rule curve is in place because, given the topography and hydrology of the region, the Nacimiento watershed generates three times the amount of runoff generated by the San Antonio watershed. Given this difference and based on its experience in operating the two reservoirs overa period of approaching a half-century, the MCWRA attempts to match empty storage in Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs to the 3:1 ratio in order to achieve the flood protection levels established by FERC and DSOD (with an adequate safety margin) and, at the same time, maximize water conservation for release and recharge of the Basin.
Once the SVWP is operational, the MCWRA would need to consider whether to revise its reservoir operation practices (including the maintenance of the 3:1 ratio in storage space 02023
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-40 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

between the two reservoirs) in order to reflect the larger spill ways and the need for increased releases to recharge the Basin. The MCWRA intends to consider revision of these operations standards (including revisions that would lessen impacts on recreational impacts at Lake Nacimiento) as it gains experience in operating the reservoirs under these new conditions. Because any such changes will be the result of future experience gained through operating under real-time (rather than modeled) conditions, however, it is premature and speculative at this time for the MCWRA to commit to any specific changes. For this reason, the potential for such changes in operations are acknowledged as desired to minimize recreation impacts, but the MCWRA does not consider them to represent a currently known to be feasible mitigation measure that is currently known to be able to feasibly address potential impacts on recreational uses. Therefore, the MCWRA has not proposed such changes in operation (see also Master Response MR-2 regarding mitigation for project effects on recreation).
Overview of Proposed Project Operations
The crucial components of operation of the SVWP under either Alternative A or Alternative B
can be summarized as:

Increases in reservoir storage during the wet months Associated decreases in releases during wet months for flood control purposes (i.e., "spills")
Increases in releases of water for conservation purposes (i.e., stream recharge) during the irrigation season Capture, impoundment, and subsequent delivery of some portion of releases downstream during the irrigation season
Continued delivery of recycled water provided for irrigation use through the CSIP
Because releases can be more deliberately timed under operations with a modified spill way (i.e., some volume of water currently lost as result of flood control spills can be used instead for planned conservation releases), SVWP operation under Alternative A or B would have the overall result of increasing stream recharge, decreasing Salinas River outflow to the ocean, maintaining essentially the same level of recharge from applied irrigation water, reducing groundwater pumping by providing some substitute water supply, and halting seawater intrusion.

PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

The proposed action was developed over the course of several years and has evolved from and represents the culmination of years of planning, engineering, and public involvement. The MCWRA considered numerous alternatives in the course of developing the proposed action. The alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study are described in detail, along with the reasons they were not pursued further, in the 1998 SVWP Draft EIR; this discussion was incorporated by reference into the Draft EIR/EIS, as indicated in Section 4.3. See Master Response MR-8 (Alternatives Previously Considered) for a discussion of the alternatives that were previously considered but eliminated from further consideration due to environmental, economic, and/or technical feasibility issues.

AR 02024
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-41 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The MCWRA identified the range of alternatives to be analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS (the proposed action, or Alternative A; Alternative B; and three different no-action/variants of no- action alternatives). Consistent with the requirements described in the NEPA CEQ Regulations and the State CEQA Guidelines, the Draft EIR/EIS includes and evaluates a range of reasonable alternatives, identifies and discusses alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study, and provides information that will allow reviewers to evaluate the comparative merits of the proposed action and alternatives.
As described above, the SVWP integrated-management approach became the MCWRA's proposed approach to halting seawater intrusion. The benefits of alternative scenarios representing this approach are evaluated and contrasted in the EIR/EIS analysis with scenarios representing demand management and no action. In terms of the options for seawater intrusion discussed in the foregoing section, the alternatives evaluated in the Draft EIR/EIS can be described as follo ws:

Alternative A (Integrated management): Integrates reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs made possible with the modification of the Nacimiento Dam spillway, Salinas River recharge, conveyance of additional flows, and diversions; distribution and delivery of surface water in combination with recycled water, and delivery area pumping management.
Alternative B (Integrated management): Integrates reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs as under Alternative A; Salinas River recharge, conveyance of additional flows, and subsurface diversion, storage, and delivery flows; storage and use of recycled water; and delivery area pumping management.
Alternative C (No action): Represents no project and no other action or solution.
Alternative D (Total demand management): Primarily depends on demand management (forced pumping reductions) stop seawater intrusion and bring the Basin into hydrologic balance. This alternative would not provide supply to meet demand for water.
Alternative E (Demand management through State adjudication): Assumed to consist of demand management imposed under judicial control, with reoperation of Nacimiento
and San Antonio reservoirs to maximize conservation releases, but without the features of the SVWP that would enable the capture of water downstream for irrigation use in lieu of groundwater.

HYDROLOGIC EFFECT'S OF 'THE ALTERNATIVES

MODELING OF THE SVWP

The SVIGSM was used to evaluate hydrologic effects of operations under Alternatives A and B. The SVIGSM is a planning tool. Like all models, it cannot entirely replicate the complex hydrologic interactions of the physical world and is not a precise determinant of the future. However, it is the best tool available to predict how the project would operate and whether it would halt seawater intrusion. The SVIGSM has been prepared and refined by a number of 02025
T

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-42 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

expert hydrologists and has undergone substantial scrutiny. It was reviewed and refined through an open public process, including several workshops that have occurred over a decade's
time. While a number of commenters have expressed their disbelief in the results of the modeling, none has presented substantial evidence that the model is inaccurate or its results are wrong. No one has suggested that a better model is available to evaluate the proposed action or that other modeling would produce substantially different results. Importantly, absent a model, the only possible method to determine the effectiveness of the project would be to operate it and to monitor its results (monitoring is proposed as part of the project). Thus, in the context of NEPA and CEQA, as well as responsible planning, a model is needed a to predict the effects, and effectiveness, of a project so it can be evaluated.
Some commenters have argued that the modeling of the project is inadequate because the assumptions used to model the two alternatives are somewhat different. As described in Chapter 3, the modeling used for Alternatives A and B uses different assumptions regarding the needed outflows from the Basin in order to halt seawater intrusion. The differences result from a number of minor modifications that have been made since 1998, when Alternative B was analyzed as the proposed action, to better to calibrate the SVIGSM. However, the modeling for Alternative B is considered to adequately reflect both the overall ability of the alternative to halt sweater intrusion, as well as the hydrology-related impacts of Alternative B compared with the baseline that was modeled for Alternative B. No comments have been submitted contesting whether the 1998 version of the SVIGSM used for Alternative B is adequate. And, as described above, no comments have been submitted providing substantial evidence that Alternative A modeling is inaccurate. However, because of the differences in modeling of Alternative A and B, and as discussed in section 5.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS, it is not appropriate to compare specific model outputs between Alternatives A and B. Instead, it is important to focus on whether the impacts of the two alternatives are significant in relation to the corresponding baseline conditions used in each model and whether these significance conclusions differ one from another. This is the approach documented by the Draft EIR/EIS. It is also important to note, nevertheless, that the modeling shows that both alternatives can halt seawater intrusion and so provide a very significant benefit to the Salinas Valley.
After the Draft EIR/EIS was distributed for public and agency review, the MCWRA recognized that some minor adjustments needed to be made to the SVIGSM model to ensure more accurate correspondence between the modeling parameters and anticipated operational parameters under project implementation. To fully disclose all information to reviewers, this information and the corresponding modifications of model results are presented in the Final EIR/EIS, although the modifications are minor and do not affect the conclusions of the analysis. Please see Master Response MR-4 for a description of the changes, and Chapter 3.0 for corresponding changes to the model results presented in Draft EIR/EIS Section 5.3.
Because all modeling and analysis must be based on assumptions about future conditions, all modeling involves some uncertainty. The SVWP evaluation relied, for example, on assumptions about future population growth and water demand in the Salinas Valley, hydrology (patterns of wet and dry years), and regional economic trends. The assumptions used in this evaluation are reasonable expectations of future trends based on historical records and predictive tools used by agencies such as the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) and city and county planning departments. Moreover, the SVWP includes monitoring and performance 9ZOZO
standards. If monitoring of data of the seawater intrusion indicates that seawater intrusion has Z

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-43 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

not been completely halted, an additional stage of the project (additional distribution facilities), described generally in the Draft EIR/EIS, will be more fully developed for implementation.
The modeling performed to evaluate Alternatives A and B provides output showing the interactions of a complex array of hydrologic features that, together, factor into an overall water balance for the Salinas Valley. These are summarized for the overall valley in the follo wing schematic diagram (Exhibit 1).
The modification of the Nacimiento Dam spillway and the proposed reoperation of the reservoir would provide for the additional storage of water during winter months and, therefore, the retention of some of the water that is currently "spilled" to provide flood storage space under the operative flood rule curve. This volume, rather than being released during wet months when it has it more limited benefit for groundwater recharge (and no benefit for diversion), would instead be used for planned conservation releases during other months under the SVWP. As identified on page 3-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS, it is estimated that reoperation of the reservoirs under Alternative A would, on average, result in approximately 29,000 AFY of additional stored water in comparison with modeled baseline conditions. Conservation releases would be increased by 30,000 AFY.
Said another way, the total amount of water in the watershed that flows through the reservoirs does not change substantially between baseline and project conditions. However, the timing of releases does change, with project conditions allowing more water to be retained at the reservoirs during the non-irrigation season (instead of being released as spills to allow for more flood storage), with this water (plus a small amount more) being released from the reservoir during the irrigation season when it can be used for more efficient conservation purposes.

Some commenters have questioned why the 30,000 AF in additional irrigation season conservation releases does not equal the conservation benefits reported in the model results. Attempting such correlation is not appropriate for the following reasons. The 30,000 AFY represents only a single component of the hydrology of the system being modeled. It must be remembered that the full results of hydrologic changes under the SVWP consist of both conservation gains and offsets, not just the gains associated with conservation releases alone. For instance, under current conditions, a portion of the 29,000 AFY currently spilled to make flood storage space available does recharge the ground water basin. But because it is spilled during the wet season, less of this water is recharged (due to more saturated ground conditions) than if it is available for release during the irrigation season when conditions are drier. The majority of the results reported in the Draft EIR/EIS are average annual hydrologic changes.
These annual averages represent the total gains and offsets, of which the 30,000 AFY is one part. In other words, it is inappropriate to attempt to identify the fate of the sum of decreased spills and increased releases (30,000 AFY) in isolation from the other components of the whole system as it functions throughout the entire year.
The hydrologic changes that are most important for an understanding of the project benefits are shown in Figure 5.3-5 from Section 5.3 of the Draft EIR/EIS, which has been corrected and is presented in Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS. This figure provides a schematic representation of the average hydrologic changes estimated to occur under Alternative A through year, LCOZO

consisting of changes estimated for the peak irrigation season and those estimated for the non- irrigation season. Together, these changes represent the annual average changes estimated to occur under Alternative A. As can be seen in revised Figure 5.3-5, the approximately 11,000 in additional reservoir releases and approximately 10,000 AF less lost in outflow to the ocean result in 21,000 AFY becoming available for conservation purposes. That 21,000 AFY goes to approximately 10,000 AF (i.e., 9,700 AFY) provided for irrigation diversions downstream and approximately 11,000 AF in additional groundwater recharge from baseline conditions. These numbers reflect the fact that the Salinas River and the Basin are not perfectly efficient conveyance vehicles; for that reason it is inappropriate, for instance, to add decreased spills and increased releases without an effort to model the impacts of those actions through SVIGSM. They do demonstrate that the proposed action would halt seawater intrusion and so benefit the
entire Salinas Valley.

WATER CONSERVATION PRACTICES INCORPORATED INTO THE ALTERNATIVES
Some commenters have raised concerns that the evaluation of the proposed action and alternatives does not adequately address potential water conservation practices. In fact, voluntary water conservation practices are critical element of the overall SVWP, and are incorporated into Alternatives A, B, D, and E. The modeling for the proposed action assumes that the Salinas Valley will continue existing conservation measures. As discussed on page 7-7 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the Salinas Valley, and particularly the City of Salinas, already has a relatively low per capita water consumption rate compared to that of other areas of the state. While future urban water usage is expected to increase as population increases, the total projected demand of agricultural usage is expected to decrease, resulting in an overall net decrease of 17,000 AFY in combined total water demand by 2030, despite projected population increases. A significant reason behind the projected decrease in total water use is improved conservation measures for both agricultural and urban water uses. These measures, described in Master Response MR-5, include, but are not limited to, the following:

MCWRA-required submission of an annual conservation plan, along with extraction reports, by all irrigators in the Salinas Valley. The plans provide basis for assessing and improving agricultural irrigation practices. The reports document that a substantial amount of farmland in the Salinas Valley has been converted to improved sprinkler irrigation, and both surface and subsurface drip irrigation.
Increased use by growers and landscape irrigators of data collected and compiled by the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), a series of weather stations that monitor climatic conditions, to make decisions about optimizing crop irrigation efficiencies.
Monterey County water conservation ordinances that apply to both urban and agricultural areas. The agricultural sector in the Salinas Valley has implemented "best management practices" for the use of irrigation water in the Salinas Valley since 1991 that have improved irrigation methods based on soil type, crop type, and weather conditions. Substantial increases in the use of drip irrigation and agricultural irrigation with recycled water recycling are also already in place, with over 11,000 acre-feet of

AR 02029
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-46 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

recycled water from the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) used in lieu of ground water pumping in the CSIP area in 2000.
The use of the Groundwater Extraction Management System (GEMS), which uses both Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to track and manage both locational and attribute information from each of more than 600 wells in the Salinas Valley Basin, to help manage and protect the Basin's ground water supplies.
Ongoing water conservation education for urban water users, aimed at continuing the downward trends in per capita water consumption.
Water conservation has also been incorporated into the proposed project with the inclusion of a delivery area pumping management component, as described on page 3-24 of the Draft EIR/EIS. Management measures are already in place in the CSIP area as part of CSIP implementation and MCWRA will continue to manage and limit pumping by those users who receive direct water deliveries from the proposed project. This type of restriction would continue to be necessary to ensure the project's effectiveness in meeting its objectives. Pumping management within the proposed delivery area has also been included as a necessary component of the hydrologic model evaluations. The hydrologic model also assumes that irrigation will be more efficient in the future due to technological advances in agricultural irrigation. See Master Response MR-5 for details on water conservation practices and the role of water conservation in
the proposed action.

COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES
As described above, some commenters have suggested that the MCWRA should have analyzed an alternative that focuses on demand management (i.e., reduction in pumping) in the coastal areas rather than across the entire Valley. The commenters suggest that a reduction in pumping in these areas would be sufficient to create enough hydraulic head to meet project objectives.
In order to halt seawater intrusion, the MCWRA must develop a project that results in continual spilling of ground water from coastal areas into the Pacific Ocean. Alternatives A and B both
halt seawater intrusion by, respectively, reducing pumping in these coastal areas by replacing pumped groundwater with delivered river water. Alternatives D and E also halt seawater intrusion, but would require pumping reductions of between 30% and 50% throughout the Salinas Valley. (Please see the prior discussion under "Demand Management" for an overview of the pumping reduction scenario.)
The differences between these sets of alternatives are based upon whether or not the alternatives include provision for a supplemental source of water, including recharge from irrigation applied water. Alternatives A and B, which incorporate such recharge and the CSIP project, require significantly less reduction in pumping in coastal areas than Alternatives D and E. If Alternatives D and E were limited to the coastal areas, they would both require significantly greater reductions in pumping, because of the significantly smaller area of pumping. Because alternatives similar to D or E that are limited to coastal areas would require such large reductions

AR 02030

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-47 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

(close to total reduction in pumping), the MCWRA believes that these alternatives are infeasible because of their sübstantial economic impacts.

SUMMARY

Some commenters suggest that the alternatives analysis did not adequately consider the reduction of pumping in focused area. Additional analysis of reduction of pumping in focused area, beyond that which is considered in the preferred project, is inappropriate for the following reasons:

1. The proposed project (in conjunction with CSIP) already reduces pumping in the pressure area by nearly 80% with minimal economic and environmental impacts. Consequently, the project, as proposed in the Draft EIR/EIS, incorporates the
commenters' concerns
2. The proposed project stops seawater intrusion by balancing (1) reduction in extractions, including reduction in extractions in a focused area; and (2) increasing recharge via supplemental water. Because the proposed project already incorporates the commenters' suggested reduction of pumping in a focused area, the commenters' concerns must lie with the increasing of recharge via supplemental water. However, the only alternative to increasing recharge via supplemental water is reducing extractions in the CSIP area by more than the combined CSIP and proposed project's 77%. A reduction of more than 77% (32% attributed to the project) would effectively cut off water to more than 100,000 people and thousands of acre of the most productive farmland in the world. Such a result is contrary to the policies of CEQA These policies emphasize that the state must: ensure "that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions" [Pub. Resources Code Section 21001(d)]; that the state "[c]reate and maintain conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive harmony to fulfill the social and economic requirements of present and future generations," [Pub. Resources Code Section 21001(e)]; and that CEQA "not be subverted into an instrument for the oppression and delay of social, economic, or recreational development or advancement." 14 CCR. Section 15003().

MR-2 RECREATION MITIGATION

The Draft EIR/EIS concluded that recreational impacts were significant based on the expected number of days that reservoir levels would fall below a 730-foot threshold compared with existing conditions. The results of an economic analysis prepared for this response to comments document (see Master Response MR-6) reinforces the general conclusion that recreational resources at Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio would be significantly affected by the proposed project. Specifically, MR-6 indicates that under Alternative A conditions, recreational use, as expressed in annual visitor days, is predicted to decline by 10.5% at Lake Nacimiento and by 33.9% at Lake San Antonio compared to use levels under baseline (without project) conditions. No mitigation measures related to recreational resources were presented in the Draft EIR/EIS.

AR 02031

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-48 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Various commenters have questioned whether the conclusion in the Draft EIR/EIS that indicates that recreation-related impacts at Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio are significant and unavidable is valid. Commenters suggested consideration of various mitigation measures that could reduce the impact. In order to address this issue, specific mitigation measures proposed in the public comments were evaluated, and representatives of some of the commenting groups were contacted, including the private concessionaire operating Lake Nacimiento Resort, Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores homeowners associations, and Monterey County Parks Department (MCPD). Each of the suggested mitigation measures was evaluated for potential effectiveness and feasibility. They have been classified into one of several general categories of mitigation measures described below. Below is a brief description and response to
the comments on suggested mitigation measures.

Proposed Mitigation Measure: Adjust proposed reoperation of the SVWP to maintain higher lake levels. Various commenters suggested that appropriate mitigation would be to re-operate the project in a manner that would maintain higher lake levels during the recreation season. Specific suggestions include reducing diversion rates during below normal and drought conditions and maintaining lake levels above normally accepted thresholds for recreational use.

The EIR threshold of significance was based on lake levels of 730-feet at Lake Nacimiento. This level is generally accepted by commenters, although some also recommended using higher lake levels as thresholds based on the location of their boat ramps and docks and the underlying lake depth at that location. The issue faced by the MCWRA in operating the proposed project is that modeling, the only tool available to analyze project effectiveness, shows that seawater intrusion is halted by the project, but only by a small margin. This is based on operating the lake in a manner shown in the Draft EIR/EIS, as modified by Master Response MR-4. If the lake were operated so that lake levels were not reduced below 730 feet in certain hydrologic conditions, modeling shows that sea water intrusion would not be halted and the objectives of the project would not be met. Consequently, iS there is apparently little flexibility in operation of the reservoirs that would accommodate the suggested operational restraints.
Additional comments addressed altering the release patterns from Lake Nacimiento and
Lake San Antonio to release water from San Antonio first, then Nacimiento later in the
season. MR-1 discusses the current 3:1 release ratio between Nacimiento and San Antonio
and why the ratio is important to consider. As also described in MR-1, the MCWRA will consider adjustment to the release ratio (to keep higher levels in Nacimiento longer) once it has experience operating the project. Because it is not known if the release schedule can be modified (it is speculative at this time), this iS not included as a mitigation measure.

Proposed Mitigation Measure: Extend public/private homeowner association boat ramps and docks to a lower elevation to allow continued access to the reservoirs. Various commenters indicated that the extension of boat launch ramps and docks, thereby providing reservoir access during low water periods, would serve to reduce impacts to recreational resources associated with the project. This mitigation option was evaluated further in consultation with the private concessionaire operating Lake Nacimiento Resort,

AR 02032
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-49 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

several private homeowner associations at Lake Nacimeinto, and with the Monterey County Parks Department, which operates the boating facilities at Lake San Antonio.
It was found that the boat launch ramp and dock at Lake Nacimiento Resort is fully operational to a lake level of approximately 690 feet. On average, the proposed project would not result in lake levels of 690 feet or below. As such, the existing facilities at Lake Nacimiento Resort would be sufficient in most conditions to provide reservoir access under the proposed project and would not need to be extended. At this low lake elevation, the surface area of the lake is approximately 760 acres, compared with 2,350 acres at a surface elevation of 730 feet and 5,370 acres at full capacity. Thus, while accessible, the small surface area of the lake makes boating less desirable, especially to water skiers. The extension of boat launch facilities at private homeowner association facilities, namely Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores, was found not to be feasible. This is due to the fact that existing facilities already extend to the lakebed at the locations of the launches. During low
lake conditions, the area under the ramps, and for a large distance surrounding the ramps, is dry due to relatively flat topography. To access the lake, private property owners would be able to use the existing boat launch and proposed boat launch at Lake Nacimiento Resort, which provides deeper access than at Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores.
At Lake San Antonio, boat launch facilities are operated by Monterey County Parks Department (MCPD). Public boat ramps at this reservoir extend to the approximate 660- foot level. The proposed project would not substantially change the number of days that the reservoir falls below this level. Therefore, 1S there is no true need, nor is it practical, to extend boat launch facilities at Lake San Antonio.
Proposed Mitigation Measure: Evaluate mitigation measures in consultation with the Monterey County Parks Department, lake concessionaires, and landowners at Lake Nacimiento. The development of potential mitigation measures involved consultation with local stakeholders at the reservoirs during the development of this response to comments document. Results of the consultation effort are included throughout various aspects of this master response. Further consultation and coordination among local stakeholders will occur through the MCWRA's Reservoir Operations Committee process. The Reservoir Operations Committee meets on a monthly basis to manage scheduled releases at Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. Members of the public are included on this committee. This forum provides a venue for public input into lake level management on a year-round basis. The Reservoir Operations Committee would still be functional during project operations, which would allow the public to express their concerns about low lake levels during the peak recreation season. It is proposed that the management directive for the Reservoir Operations Committee will be only to release sufficient water to meet the objectives of the SVWP and other operational objectives taking into consideration the needs of recreational interests to the maximum extent possible. (This would include consideration of the 3:1 release schedule for Lake Nacimiento and Lake San
Antonio.)

Proposed Mitigation Measure: Implement a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. EEOZO
Please refer to Master Response MR-5 for further discussion of water conservation measures %

in practice. As described in MR-5, additional conservation is not sufficiently available to alter the need for the project.

Proposed Mitigation Measure: Construct a new boat launch facility at Lake Nacimiento Resort. A commenter inquired whether there are plans to construct a new boat launch facility at Lake Nacimiento Resort, and if so, stated that it would not provide benefits to private homeowners surrounding the reservoir. There are plans to construct a new four-lane concrete boat-launching ramp, boarding floats, two new parking areas, and restrooms at Lake Nacimiento Resort. The new launch ramp would extend at a beginning elevation of 800 down to an elevation of about 699. The existing facilities at Lake Nacimiento Resort are sufficient to serve boat-launching activities from 800 feet down to
about 670 feet.

Proposed Mitigation Measure: Establish maintenance fund for facility managers to utilize during low lake level conditions. The MCPD expressed interest in having a fund developed that could be utilized during low lake level conditions. The MCWRA has reviewed the proposal and determined that funds are not available for this type of activity. However, the MCWRA is working with the MCPD to develop a non-water related recreational facility at Lake Nacimiento. It is envisioned that the MCPD will receive from the MCWRA approximately 1,200 acres on which to develop this new recreational facility by means of a 99-year lease at a cost of $1.00. This would provide a non-water related recreation facility with substantial public benefit. See the discussion below.
These mitigation measures have all been considered for inclusion in the Final EIR/EIS. Based on the discussion provided above on the feasibility of proposed mitigation measures, page 5.9-20 of the Draft EIR/EIS is revised as follows:

Reservoir Impacts at San Antonio and Nacimiento Reservoirs during Existing Plus Project and Future Plus Project scenarios (Alt A-1, Alt B-1, Alt A-3, Alt B-3).

MCWRA will implement the following mitigation measures to address impacts to recreational
resources:

MCWRA will continue its local coordination effort on managing lake levels through the Reservoir Operations Committee. It is proposed that the management directive for the Reservoir Operations Committee will be to only release sufficient water to meet the objectives of the SVWP and other operational objectives taking into consideration the needs of recreational interests to the maximum extent possible. Because the success of the project will be monitored, the delivery of water will be scaled back if the water release levels shown in the EIR/EIS are not needed to the extent shown.
The MCWRA is currently working with the MCPD to develop a non-water related recreational facility at Lake Nacimiento. This new recreational facility will house an eight-week summer camp sponsored by Coca-Cola for at-risk youth in the local area who exhibit leadership potential. Camp Coca-Cola is a multi-year program that provides mentoring while promoting awareness of the outdoors. The target age for this summer. camp program is middle school to high school-aged children.

not in session, the MCPD can use the facility specifically for non-water related recreational activities including horseback riding, rock climbing, camping, hiking, and eco-education. It is envisioned that the MCPD will receive from the MCWRA approximately 1,200 acres on which to develop this new recreational facility by means of a 99-year lease at a cost of $1.00.
MCWRA's Reservoir Operations Committee will seek to operate the project such that the project objectives of halting seawater intrusion are met, while trying to maintain recreational opportunities at Lake Nacimiento to the degree feasible. Consideration will be given to altering the 3:1 Nacimiento:San Antonio release schedule such that water levels are maintained in Nacimiento as long as possible during the recreation season. Because it would be speculative to commit to any programs prior to experience with 1S project operations, this is not considered a project mitigation measure.
Residual Impact: Existing Plus Project conditions would result in significant impacts to recreational resources. It is not known if releases can be reduced when they approach the 730-foot level. Because it is unknown whether the number of days below 730 feet can be decreased, the mitigation would not change the conclusion that recreation impacts at the reservoirs are significant and unavoidable. However, the proposed mitigation measure(s) would result in potentially reducing the severity of impacts experienced by recreational users and providers. The residual impact remains significant and unavoidable.

MR-3 GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS

Various commenters requested additional information concerning the growth-inducing impacts resulting from the proposed project, including potential indirect impacts as well as identification of related land use controls and other regulatory measures that would help minimize future environmental impacts from the projected growth. Chapter 7 of the Draft EIR/EIS addressed the potential growth-inducing impacts of the proposed project and concluded that five environmental issue areas, Population Growth, Land Use/Agriculture, Biological Resources, Traffic and Circulation, and Air Quality, were the primary impacts related to growth enabled by Alternative A or B. Other, more direct growth-inducing impacts associated with the specific locations of facilities proposed under Alternative A or B would not be expected. In developing the analysis in Chapter 7 of the EIR/EIS on growth, all available general plans and general plan EIRs, as well as the Local Coastal Plan and other environmental documents addressing growth in the affected area, were reviewed. The information in these documents ranged, but the degree of specificity was limited. Chapter 7 reflects this inforiation to the degree needed to convey the overall growth inducing potential of the project. Chapter 7 also aids the reader in understanding the growth inducing potential of the project by additionally describing what would occur if the project did not go forward. Patterns of land use change are indicated by where growth would be expected in the County (see Table 7-1), the degree of anticipated agricultural land conversion is calculated, biological resources at risk are described, etc. The need for additional analysis of

growth, through environmental review on a project-by-project (or larger) basis is also described in the chapter.
Most future projects that would potentially induce growth in the project area would be subject to environmental review under CEQA. In addition, these projects would need to conform to local planning and zoning regulations (e.g., general plans, local costal plans, etc.).
Table 7-1 of the Draft EIR/EIS provides growth projections for communities within Monterey County. These projections are based on forecasted population figures provided by AMBAG. AMBAG's forecasts extend to the year 2020, and MCWRA staff extrapolated these figures to the year 2030 to coincide with the hydrologic model for the proposed project.
In forecasting populations for these communities, AMBAG considered whether potential resource and infrastructure constraints should be considered. The forecasts that are presented in the Draft EIR/EIS are generally unconstrained. AMBAG decided on this course because it felt that "(I)n most cases, potential resource or infrastructure constraints to growth can be removed if policy makers, and in some cases voters, are willing to support and fund the infrastructure improvements required to do so." (AMBAG 1997, page 5) Thus, AMBAG's forecast for the subregion that currently relies on water from the Salinas River basin assumes that there will be no constraints in the future associated with water (or other resources).
This is not to suggest that there are not acknowledged constraints associated with water use in the Salinas Valley basin, however. To the contrary, the AMBAG forecast includes a discussion of potential resource constraints that, if not resolved, could affect population and employment forecasts, and this discussion plays a role in the consideration of the growth-inducing potential of the project. The AMBAG forecast and the extrapolation by MCWRA staff represents the best available information for population projections for communities within Monterey County.
As to regulatory controls, the general plans and the local coastal plan contain regulatory controls that address growth related impacts. The analysis in the growth inducing impact chapter conveys the expected impacts of growth based on implementation of the various general plans, so effectively reflects impacts that would be expected to occur with regulatory constraints in place. The various general plans contain numerous policies encouraging that growth occurs on non-prime farmland, that development occur as in-fill prior to developing in outlying areas, that traffic impacts are addressed with new development proposals, that water conservation is built in
to new development, etc.
The MCWRA does not have any land use regulatory control, so its ability to impose regulations on new development is limited. In addition, the newly enacted SB 221 specifies that new development has to consider if there is an available water source. However, as management of water resources are within the purview of the Agency, and in response to this comment, the following is added to page 7-11 of the EIR/EIS:
"The MCWRA will work with Monterey County and the cities and communities within the County to encourage maximum use of water conservation practices in new development, including the use of ultra low-flow water fixtures and drought- tolerant/low water demanding landscaping."

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-53 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Additionally, the following text is added to page 7-11 of the EIR/EIS in response to this
comment:

"As local jurisdictions consider development proposals, they should aggressively implement general plan policies and other zoning ordinances and programs that result in
reducing potential environmental impacts, including impacts to agriculture, water use, traffic, air quality, and biology. While these programs are not within the purview of the MCWRA or the USACE, they are reasonable requests that would help reduce potential impacts from land use conversion. These programs would be the responsibility of local agencies as part of their land use approval process."

MR-4 REVISED HYDROLOGIC MODELING RESULTS

After the Draft EIR/EIS was distributed for public review, the MCWRA determined that two elements of the SVIGSM modeling of Alternative A needed to be modified to more accurately reflect anticipated operations under the SVWP. These revisions do not alter the conclusions of the Draft EIR/EIS and are presented here in the interest of full disclosure of the range of anticipated potential effects of project implementation. The revisions to the model consisted of minor corrections to the required Salinas River minimum flows (for steelhead) at the diversion structure and the incorporation of an updated reservoir target storage rule curve under Alternative A.

As described in Draft EIR/EIS Section 5.6, specific minimum flow requirements would apply to the Salinas River during certain months (primarily April and May) when the diversion structure is in operation, to allow for steelhead smolts and adults to migrate successfully to the Monterey Bay. Minimum flows would be required at the diversion structure when flow is greater than 170 cubic feet per second (cfs) in the Arroyo Seco or greater than 60 cfs in the upper Salinas River and the sand barrier to Monterey Bay is breached. When these conditions are met, a minimum flow of 15 cfs for smolt migration and 45 cfs for adult steelhead migration would be in effect at the diversion structure. The modeling performed for the Draft EIR/EIS evaluation used a minimum-flow value for smolt migration of 20 cfs rather than 15 cfs. Changing this in-stream flow parameter to the lower value of 15 cfs translates into slightly lower releases from the reservoirs at times when the flow requirement was the determinant of release volume.
The other change to the model entailed updating the MCWRA's target storage rule curve of 3:1 for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs. The target storage rule curve is the rule set by the MCWRA to balance releases between the two reservoirs in order to optimize water conservation and flood protection benefits. The rule curve is in place because, given the topography and hydrology of the region, the Nacimiento watershed generates three times the amount of runoff generated by the San Antonio watershed. Given this difference, the MCWRA has historically operated the reservoirs to ensure that the amount of empty storage space in Nacimiento Reservoir remains approximately three times that of San Antonio Reservoir. By maintaining the 3:1 ratio, the MCWRA effectively operates the two reservoirs as a single system in a way that maximizes the reservoirs' flood protection and water conservation benefits. This issue is also addressed in MR-1

AR 02037

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-54 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Revision of the 3:1 rule curve was overlooked when the model was revised to incorporate changes resulting from the Nacimiento Reservoir spillway modification. The flood control rule curve that is established by FERC and DSOD defines the maximum allowable storage levels (and, therefore, the minimum required empty storage space) in a reservoir on a monthly basis. It is assumed that the flood control rule curve will change with acknowledgment of the additional flood evacuation capability provided by an enlarged spillway at Nacimiento Dam. Because this change is expected to result in reduction in the required empty storage space at Nacimiento Reservoir during some months, the target storage rule curve between Nacimiento and San Antoniò would also change such that the 3:1 ratio is maintained between the two reservoirs. The change in the target storage rule curve essentially results in less water having to be released from Nacimiento Reservoir under Alternative A and more being released from San Antonio Reservoir and results in less of an impact on Nacimiento Reservoir surface storage volumes and elevations than described in the Draft EIR/EIS. The revised model results reflecting these changes are provided in Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS. As stated above, the modeling changes described here do not change the significance of any impacts presented in the Draft EIR/EIS and do not result in the identification of any new significant impacts.

MR-5 INCORPORATION OF WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES

Several commenters have requested the incorporation of additional water conservation measures into the preferred alternative, including water metering, appropriate water pricing, and restrictions on the use of irrigated water. Although MCWRA helps manage water resources within the Salinas Valley through its management of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoir releases and recharge programs, and encourages water conservation techniques, it has no authority to impose water conservation on growers or urban areas in the Salinas Valley. However, Section 8 of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency Act (California Water Code Appendix, Chapter 52) does indicate that one of MCWRA's stated purposes is to "conserve (the flood and storm waters of the agency) for beneficial and useful purposes by spreading, storing, retaining, and causing those waters to percolate into the soil within the agency, or to save and conserve in any manner all or any of those waters."
Nonetheless, the proposed project incorporates water conservation in numerous ways. The
modeling for the preferred alternative assumes that the Salinas Valley will continue existing
conservation measures.

As discussed on page 7-7 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the Salinas Valley, and particularly the City of Salinas, has a relatively low per capita water consumption rate compared to that of other areas of the state. The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) assumes a current per capita consumption in the Salinas area of 153 gallons, reducing to 132 gallons through conservation by 2020. With the exception of San Francisco, which iS characterized by its high population and development density and relative lack of landscaping, DWR shows that Salina uses less water per capita than any other area of the state, both in 1995 and projected in 2000. By contrast, statewide averages were 224 gallons per capita per day in 1995 (46% higher than Salinas) and are projected to be 203 gallons per capita per day in 2020 (54% higher than Salinas) (DWR Bulletin 1960-98, January 1998).

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-55 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

A significant reason behind the projected decrease in total water use is improved conservation measures for both agricultural and urban water uses. These measures are multifold and include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) The proposed project, along with CSIP presents a 77% reduction in groundwater
pumping.

(2) MCWRA requires submission of an annual conservation plan, along with extraction reports, by all irrigators in the Salinas Valley. The conservation plans are intended to provide a basis for planning and assessing the on-farm irrigation practices and to establish improved on-farm conservation practices. The annual reports document upgrades in irrigation systems, reducing water losses due to runoff, spray loss, improper percolation, and evaporation. A substantial amount of farmland in the Salinas Valley has been converted to improved sprinkler and both surface and sub-surface drip irrigation. The reports document shift toward low-energy precision application (LEPA) sprinkler technology.

(3) Salinas Valley irrigation is also improved by increased usage of the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS), which is a series of weather stations that collect and compile climatic conditions. There are four rainfall and six rainfall/evaporation data stations in the Salinas Valley. With use of CIMIS information on climatic conditions, growers and landscape irrigators can make decisions about when, where, and how much to irrigate, resulting in reductions in overall irrigation water needs, leading to increased crop irrigation efficiencies. A recent independent assessment of the CIMIS program suggests that growers using CIMIS have reduced applied water use their lands by an average of 13%, while increasing crop yields by 8%. on

(4) Monterey County has water conservation ordinances that apply to both urban and agricultural areas. The agricultural sector in the Salinas Valley has implemented "best management practices" for the use of irrigation water in the Salinas Valley since 1991. Under the "best management practices," the best type of irrigation method for the soil type, crop type, and weather conditions is put in place to the greatest extent possible. In 1999, there were approximately 50,000 acres using drip irrigation compared to about 25,000 acres using drip irrigation in 1993. Tertiary treatment of wastewater and agricultural irrigation water recycling are also already in place. During calendar year 2000, over 11,000 acre-feet of recycled water from the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) was used in lieu of groundwater pumping in the CSIP area. The MCWRP is considered to have established benchmark for the best water recycling and reuse program in the world.
(5) The MCWRA has also utilized Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies to better track and manage water resources within Monterey County. On January 26, 1993, as part of the on-going water conservation effort in Monterey County, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance requiring that all wells in the Salinas Valley basin with a discharge line equal to or greater than inches in diameter be registered with the MCWRA. A new application was created to assist the MCWRA in this effort, the Groundwater Extraction Management System (GEMS), which uses both GPS and GIS technologies to capture 02039

both locational and attribute information from each well within the Salinas Valley Basin. Statistics are collected from over 600 wells around the 300,000-acre area to help manage and protect the basin's ground water supplies.
(6) The urban water use sector has shown similar downward trends in per capita consumption, much of which can be attributed to consumer education and various conservation efforts taken during the last decade. Consumer education typically consists of providing information on the many facets of water usage. For example, California Water Service Company (Cal Water), which is the primary purveyor of urban water in the Salinas and King City areas of the Salinas Valley, maintains an active water conservation education program. There is a significant amount of information being dispensed on topics ranging from responsible and intelligent water usage to conservation gardening. It is estimated that these conservation programs have led to a reduction of approximately 5% in per capita usage.

(7) Water conservation has also been incorporated into the proposed project with the inclusion of a delivery area pumping management component, as described on page 3-24 of the Draft EIR/EIS.

One alternative analyzed previously in Section 7.3.5 of the 1998 Draft EIR, the Reoperation and Conservation Alternative, included required reductions in water use. It was determined that the
alternative could not achieve the project goal of meeting existing and future water needs, and that forced reduction in water use at the level needed to stop seawater intrusion and achieve hydrologic balance in the Basin (a reduction of between 30% and 50%, see Master Response 1), would substantially affect the productivity of prime farmland and would have severe economic effects on agricultural practices and support industries that would be devastating to the local and regional economies. In fact, the 2000 Monterey County Crop Report shows a crop value (not including livestock, poultry, and dairy) of over $2.8 billion. Most of this is produced in the Salinas Valley. A 30% to 50% reduction in water use would affect the crop values by a similar percentage (roughly reducing values by $800 million to well over $1 billion per year.) Because of this, the forced-conservation element of this alternative was not carried forward, although the reoperation component was.

It should be noted that forced reduction in water use is a foreseeable outcome of both No
Action/Total Demand Management (Alternative D) and No Action/State Adjudication (Alternative E); neither of these alternatives presents a desirable scenario, as both would likely result in the severe economic impacts mentioned above, having the likely indirect result of blight and associated environmental problems as well. As noted previously (see also Draft EIR/EIS page 2-6), a less drastic level of water conservation would help reduce the level of this impact, but it is already assumed that conservation will take place. Given the already low level of per capita water use in the project area, it is unreasonable to expect that per capita water use could be substantially reduced, and certainly not to the degree the need for the preferred action would be obviated. Consequently, water conservation (beyond that already assumed) is not considered a meaningful additional component or mitigation for the proposed project.

MR-6 ECONOMIC AND PROPERTY VALUE EFFECTS

A number of comments were received pertaining to the economic effects of the proposed project. It is acknowledged that the proposed project could affect local economic conditions in a number of ways. The project would affect recreational opportunities, which would adversely affect the recreation economy reliant on use of Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio and could also affect the value of properties around Lake Nacimiento. The project also would affect the urban and agricultural economies of the Salinas Valley, which are heavily reliant on the use of groundwater.
CEQA requirements regarding economic and social effects are provided in $15131 of the State CEQA Guidelines. In summary, CEQA states that economic/social effects of a project shall not be treated as significant effects on the environment, but may be considered if these effects, in turn, lead to physical changes to the environment. CEQA also states that economic/social effects of a project may be used to determine the significance of physical changes caused by the project. Similarly, economic and social effects are not considered to be significant environmental effects under NEPA ("... economic and social effects and not intended by themselves to require preparation of an environmental impact statement." CEQ NEPA regulations $1508.14). The CEQ NEPA regulations do state "when an environmental impact statement is prepared and economic or social and natural or physical environmental effects are interrelated, then the environmental impact statement will discuss all of these effects on the human environment." (40 CFR $1508.14). There is little guidance under NEPA on what is meant by the interrelationship between economic and social effects and natural or physical environmental effects.

Both social and economic issues were considered in the Draft EIR/EIS evaluation of impacts of the SVWP. For instance, effects on recreation were considered to represent potential environmental impacts, even though it can be argued that recreation is a social issue rather than a physical environmental issue. The extent to which the project could affect recreational opportunities was used as a threshold of significance for environmental effects. The analysis considered the correlation between historical use of the lake and lake levels and identified threshold below which visitation would be expected to be substantially diminished. This analysis concluded that the number of quality visitor days would be substantially diminished by the project and significant and unavoidable impacts would result. Project effects on aesthetics, which can also be considered a social issue, were evaluated as well. Regarding homes and visitors with views of the lakes, the Draft EIR/EIS concluded that the lake elevations would be
sufficiently lowered by the project such that significant and unavoidable adverse visual impacts would occur. Social and economic effects to agriculture and urban uses were also considered. With regard to agriculture and urban uses, the Draft EIR/EIS concluded that halting seawater intrusion would have a substantial beneficial effect related to water quality. This would, in turn, result in continued productive use of agricultural land, which is a substantial component of the local economy. While these economic and social factors were considered in the environmental impact analysis consistent with NEPA and CEQA guidance, economic effects were not, by themselves, quantified or considered, Substantial public interest in potential economic effects related to changes in lake levels has been expressed in comments on the Draft EIR/EIS. In response to these comments, an analysis of these economic effects has been completed and is 02041

Salinas Valley Water Project 5

2-58 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

presented in this final EIR/EIS to further the disclosure of the severity of physical impacts related to changes in lake levels. The results are provided below. The economic effects quantified here are not considered environmental effects in themselves under CEQA and NEPA. Accordingly, no conclusions are made regarding the significance of these effects and no mitigation is required.
Before reviewing the results of the economic analysis, several items are worth noting.
1. The economic analysis shows that the project would adversely affect visitor spending at the lakes and, to a lesser extent, in the local and regional economy. It also shows that property values around Lake Nacimiento would be negatively affected. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of the Draft EIR/EIS, which states that recreation and visual resources at Lake Nacimiento (and San Antonio) would be significantly affected and that this effect would be an unavoidable consequence of project implementation (i.e., the effect is not mitigable).
2. The reservoirs were built by the predecessor to the MCWRA and funded entirely by agricultural and urban uses in the Salinas Valley for the express purpose of providing flood control and water conservation benefits to the Salinas Valley. The agricultural and urban economies of the Salinas Valley rely on the reservoirs for their health, Although the presence of the reservoirs provides recreational and aesthetic amenities, these are not the primary purposes for which the reservoirs were constructed. An analysis of the project's economic benefits to landowners in the Salinas Valley and to the local and regional economy in Monterey County has not been conducted. Nevertheless, it needs to be recognized that the agricultural industry in Monterey County, most of which is in the Salinas Valley, is $2 billion plus/year industry, and the northern Salinas Valley, where the project would halt seawater intrusion, is home to some of the most productive agricultural land in the Valley (and the world). The northern Salinas Valley is also home to over 150,000 people. Both agricultural and urban uses rely on groundwater as their primary and nearly singular source of water. While this economic analysis does not examine the project's benefits, they would appear substantial. As described in Master Response MR-1, demand management options (no supplemental supply) would remove over $32,000,000 annually in primary agricultural crop revenues, and secondary impacts (farm labor wages, processing, transportation, etc.) would add to this economic loss. A complete evaluation of economic effects of the project would need to consider these effects in addition to the adverse effects related to reservoir lake levels and curtailment
of recreational opportunities.
3. The MCWRA owns the reservoirs and operates them in accordance with the water right license granted to it by the State of California, which specifies the beneficial uses for the water stored in the reservoirs. The priority beneficial uses specified in the MCWRA's water rights license are flood control and ground water recharge for the agricultural, domestic, municipal, industrial, and recreational uses in the Salinas Valley. Recreational use of San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs is not the primary beneficial use. The Agency has an agreement to provide up to 17,500 AFY to San Luis Obispo County for its use.

AR 02042

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-59 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The economic analysis focuses on two main issues raised in public comment: (1) the regional economic and fiscal effects of the project resulting from changes in lake levels at Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio, and (2) the indirect impacts to property values surrounding Lake Nacimiento resulting from changes in lake levels there (no residential properties exist at Lake San Antonio).

ECONOMIC/FISCAL EFFECTS

Methodology. Changes in recreational activity at Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio
resulting from project operations were predicted using a recreation visitation model, which evaluated the quantitative relationships between historical attendance data (1985-2000) and hydrologic (lake-level), demographic, economic, and climate data. Based on the results of the recreation visitation model, changes in recreational spending by visitors to each lake were estimated using estimates of visitor spending by type of recreational user. Based on estimated changes in recreational spending onsite, in Paso Robles, and in San Luis Obispo County as a whole, the economic effects of the project, as measured by changes in employment and income levels, were then estimated using information obtained from the resort operator and from the IMPLAN economic input-output model. IMPLAN is a commonly used analytical tool for estimating regional economic effects associated with changes in economic inputs. Fiscal impacts were evaluated by applying relevant tax rates to predicted changes in levels of recreational spending on retail goods and hotel/ motel services to determine changes in local government
revenues.

Results. The proposed project is predicted to result in changes in recreational activity at Lake • Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio, which would, in turn, affect visitor spending, jobs, and personal income at the lakes and within Paso Robles and San Luis Obispo County. Under with- project conditions, recreational use, as expressed in annual visitor days, is predicted to decline by an average of 10.5% at Lake Nacimiento and by 33.9% at Lake San Antonio compared to use levels under without-project conditions. This is an average, and effects would be greater or lesser in a particular year depending on rainfall and reservoir levels.
The economic analysis estimates that annual visitor spending at the two lakes would decrease by an average of $2.0 million under the project, a 24% reduction compared to without-project conditions. This reduction in visitor spending would result in an estimated 57 jobs being eliminated and total personal income being reduced by approximately $900,000 annually onsite. Within Paso Robles, the project is expected to result in a decrease in visitor spending of approximately $1.1 million (19% decrease), with 28 jobs being eliminated and reduction of personal income of roughly $924,000. Compared to 2000 employment figures, the reduction of jobs represents about 1% of jobs in recreation-serving businesses and roughly 0.2% of all jobs in Paso Robles. Based on information from the California Employment Development Department, job creation in Paso Robles averaged about 200 jobs per year between 1991 and 2000.

In San Luis Obispo County as whole, which includes Paso Robles, average annual visitor spending is expected to decrease by $2.3 million, resulting in the elimination of 74 jobs and a decrease in personal income of about $1.5 million. Relative to employment within the county as a whole, these estimates represent a reduction of 0.2% of jobs in recreation-serving businesses EtOZO
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-60 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

and approximately 0.05% all jobs in San Luis Obispo County. Based on information from the California Employment Development Department, job creation in San Luis Obispo County averaged about 2,500 jobs per year between 1991 and 2000.
Potential fiscal impacts in the project area are associated with changes in recreational use of Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio and related effects on property values near the reservoirs. Fiscal impacts would include reductions in sales tax, transient occupancy, business license fees, and property tax revenues. For San Luis Obispo County, the proposed project is expected to result in a decrease of approximately $10,500 (-0.2%) in sales taxes, $35,700 (-0.9%) in transient occupancy taxes, $100 (-0.2%) in business license fees, and $60,300 (-0.1%) in property taxes. In total, the annual fiscal impacts on San Luis Obispo County are estimated to be $106,600, or a reduction of 0.1% in the affected revenue sources. For the City of Paso Robles, sales tax revenue is expected to decrease by roughly $6,400 (-0.1%), transient occupancy taxes would decrease by $19,400 (-2.0%), and business license fees would fall by $200 (-0.1%); there would be no property tax effects because the affected properties at Lake Nacimiento are not located within the City's jurisdiction. In total, fiscal impacts on the City of Paso Robles are estimated to be $26,100, or reduction of 0.3% in the affected revenue sources.
In addition, reductions in recreational visitation would affect revenues received by Monterey County Parks Department (MCPD). MCPD generates revenue through its lease agreements with on-site concessionaires and through campground/day-use fees for facilities it directly operates. Assuming MCPD revenues change at the same rate as recreation use levels, annual revenues could be expected to decline by $30,800 at Lake Nacimiento and by $360,400 at Lake San Antonio based on average annual (unadjusted) revenues between 1985 and 2001. Taken together, the reductions at the reservoirs could total $391,200, or 28.8% of total (unadjusted) annual average revenues generated for the MCPD between 1985 and 2000.

PROPerty VALUE EFFECTS

Methodology. The property value analysis was conducted by evaluating historical property sales data at Lake Nacimiento. Anecdotal data from discussions with knowledgeable locals and results from other comparable studies also were considered. Historical property sales data (1987-2001) were correlated with reservoir levels and other structural and location characteristics of
properties to evaluate the relationship between these variables. A hedonic property-pricing methodology, which relies on multiple regression techniques to analyze the marginal
contribution of parts of commodities to their overall value, was used to estimate the effect of reservoir levels and housing characteristics on a home's value (sales price).
Results. A statistically significant relationship was found between property sales price and lake levels. Under the preferred alternative (Alternative A), the average minimum summer lake elevation at Lake Nacimiento would be reduced from 748 feet above mean sea level under the baseline (without-project) conditions to 734 feet above mean sea level, a reduction of 14 feet or 1.9 %. Based on observed responses in property sales to annual fluctuations in lake levels explained by the hedonic model, this reduction in lake levels would cause the average residential home at Lake Nacimiento (with an average market value of $177,000) to decline in value by $2,255 (1.3%).

AR 02044

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-61 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Historical fluctuations in lake levels have been primarily related to short termclimatic variations rather than more permanent changes in Monterey County's operation of the two reservoirs, a situation likely understood by existing homeowners and potential buyers. Because reoperation of the reservoirs under the SVWP would cause a long-term reduction in lake levels, it is expected that the impact on property values would be more pronounced than can be deduced from short- term (annual) fluctuations. A more pronounced effect on property values is likely because the project is expected to more frequently result in lake level conditions that are too low to support boating activities and would adversely affect aesthetic qualities of the immediate area. Based on conditions that occurred during the 1989-1991 drought years as a proxy, the long-term impact of the project on property values is estimated to be $7,700 per home (4.4% of the average value of improved property). Lakefront and lake view properties likely would experience substantially higher reductions in property values.
The fiscal impact to San Luis Obispo County, in terms of the potential loss in property tax revenues, is described above under the fiscal impact discussion for the economic impact report.

IMPLICATIONS OF THE E CONOMIC ANALYSES

The economic analyses prepared for the SVWP indicate that the project is expected to indirectly result in lower recreational visitation to Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio, which would,
in turn, have economic and fiscal impacts for the local region. Economic impacts would be more pronounced at the reservoirs (e.g., resort operators, MCPD) relative to local and regional impacts within the City of Paso Robles and the County as a whole. The predicted change in fiscal revenues generated for these jurisdictions would be relatively minor compared to total annual revenues.

As stated in the outset of this response, these conclusions are consistent with the extent and nature of the impacts to recreational and visual resources stated in the Draft EIR/EIS; that is, impacts of the project to both these resources would be significant and adverse. There is no feasible mitigation available to reduce this mitigation to level that is less than significant. However, please see Master Response MR-2 for a discussion of mitigation that is being considered to reduce this impact to the degree feasible.

MR-7 FISHERY IMPACTS FROM RESERVOIR REOPERATION

A number of comments expressed concern that releases from the reservoirs, particularly Lake Nacimiento, would have detrimental effects on the environment including reservoir fisheries. One commenter questions the Draft EIR/EIS conclusions regarding the significance of potential effects of lake level fluctuation on the fisheries of Lake San Antonio and Lake Nacimiento and also questions the degree to which mitigation measures were given serious consideration.

The Draft EIR/EIS evaluated the effects of lake level fluctuation on reproduction of largemouth bass and on existing habitat enhancement projects. Lake level fluctuation influences bass reproduction only during a limited period during the spring, while habitat is most likely to StOZO
be influenced by lake drawdown during the summer. It is important to realize that potential E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-62 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

impacts of the project were evaluated relative to existing levels of lake fluctuation, not to a condition where the lake has no fluctuation. Largemouth bass and other fish species have done well in Lake Nacimiento even though the lake level has fluctuated significantly throughout its history.
Based on the criteria evaluated and the changes in lake level projected during the bass spawning period and summer drawdown period, the Draft EIR/EIS determined that there would be potentially significant impacts on largemouth bass spawning success and largemouth bass populations in Lake Nacimiento but that effects in Lake San Antonio, though present, would be at a level considered less-than-significant. The proposed project is projected to result in an increase in the number of years when largemouth bass reproduction may fail substantially in Lake Nacimiento from 3 years under existing operations to 7 years in the 46-year study period. However, this is not expected to substantially impact bass hatched in previous years. Since largemouth bass a are a relatively long-lived species, reproduction failure in any one year can be
offset by more successful reproduction in subsequent years.
It was also determined that potentially significant impacts to Lake Nacimiento could be partially mitigated by providing additional habitat enhancement structures in Lake Nacimiento, such as old Christmas trees, which provide fish habitat. These structures could increase survival of newly hatched bass and thus offset some of the impact resulting from lower reproductive success. In response to several comments received on this issue, the mitigation measure for fishery impacts at Nacimiento Reservoir found on page 5.6-85 of the Draft EIR/EIS is hereby replaced by the following:
NACIMIENTO RESERVOIR WATER LEVEL CHANGES, WARMWATER SPORTSFISH
REPRODUCTION AND HABITAT (ALT A-3, ALT B-3)
Alternatives A and B would result in greater fluctuations in surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir during the largemouth bass spawning period and increased frequency of summer drawdown of Lake Nacimiento below 760 feet. This may result in potentially significant impacts on largemouth bass spawning success and largemouth bass populations in Lake Nacimiento. MCWRA will consult with the CDFG on the development of habitat enhancement program at Lake Nacimiento to help mitigate this impact. This program may include coordination with CDFG on release schedules, construction of habitat enhancement structures and various lake levels (below 760 feet msl), and other elements. Because the program has not been fully developed, it is not known how successful it will be in maintaining spawning activity. Therefore, this impact would be considered significant and unrwidable.
Residual Impact: Increased fluctuation of Nacimiento Reservoir during the largemouth bass spawning period would be a sigrificant unaridable impact of Alternatives A and B.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-63 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

and public involvement. Consistent with the requirements of CEQA and NEPA, the MCWRA, through a lengthy screening process, developed a reasonable range of project alternatives for analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS. This process involved assessing the basic feasibility of various types of measures and generally evaluating their ability to meet the project objectives. The outcome of this process was the identification of the preferred project, or proposed action, and four alternatives to the preferred project, which include three no-action scenarios. Chapter 4.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS provides a detailed description of the alternatives evaluated throughout the document.

The MCWRA began analyzing alternatives for the SVWP as early as 1983. The alternatives that were previously identified and subsequently removed from further consideration were donè so for a variety of reasons, including: public controversy, cost, inability to effectively meet project goals, environmental considerations, engineering feasibility, or some combination thereof. This master response provides a brief overview of these previously considered alternatives and components, and demonstrates the wide range considered by the MCWRA in development of the SVWP. For additional detail, refer to the Salinas Riner Basin Management Plan (BMP) A lternatives A nalysis Report (MCWRA 1994). Several of the components presented below were common to multiple alternatives, and some of these "common components" have been carried forward into the SVWP (i.e., spillway modifications). The purpose of the discussion below is to give an overview of major alternative proposals, not to describe every combination of components previously evaluated by the MCWRA.
DIRECT PIPELINE ALTERNATIVE(S)
The MCWRA considered a series of alternatives that featured, as the primary component, a 90- mile pipeline from Nacimiento Reservoir to the North Valley for th direct conveyance of water required to meet the project's objectives. The pipeline would have supplied agricultural water needs during the irrigation season, and urban needs throughout the year via a water treatment plant. Variations on the alternative, including the addition of some type of North Valley Storage, spillway modifications at Nacimiento and reoperation of the reservoirs, etc. were evaluated. Though several of these other project components were deemed feasible and carried forward as part of the SVWP, the pipeline itself was removed from further consideration primarily based on its high capital cost (over $400,000,000) and its potential environmental effects (e.g., endangered species, cultural resources, farmland conversion, etc.).
SALINAS RIVER WELL SYSTEM ALTERNATIVE(S)
The primary component of these alternatives was a well system along the Salinas River, between Greenfield and Chualar. The purpose of the well system was to pump water previously stored in the ground as a result of Nacimiento and San Antonio operations, and to induce additional recharge to the aquifers. Water pumped from the well system would then be delivered via a pipeline for redistribution to the agricultural and urban users. One variation of this alternative included an off-stream storage component that, along with a surface diversion structure, would collect the wintertime storm runoff from the Salinas River and store it as subsequent irrigation supply for peak agricultural needs. This additional component was deemed necessary to meet the projected water needs in 2030.
There was substantial public controversy surrounding the proposed well system, primarily based on concerns related to the effects on ground water levels in the surrounding areas and 02047
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-64 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

corresponding effects on the operation of individual wells. As a result of the strong public opposition, this project component was rejected from further consideration by the MCWRA. It was determined that other feasible project alternatives existed, and the MCWRA worked towards developing more widely acceptable project alternative.
ARROYO SE.CO DAM ALTERNATIVE
This alternative proposed the construction and operation of a new reservoir along the Arroyo Seco, with several altemnative dam locations considered. This alternative would have been supplemented with other components to meet water demands through 2030. The dam would have captured Arroyo Seco water, which would have allowed the regulation of recharge of the Arroyo Seco Cone area. A well system component would have been implemented with this alternative in the vicinity of the Arroyo Seco Cone so that water could be pumped for distribution to the northemn portion of the Salinas Valley.
In the 1994 analysis, the Arroyo Seco Dam Alternative poorly met the majority of the screening criteria, and as a result, had a relatively low ranking compared to the other revised BMP alternatives. Specifically, the key issues which made this alternative less desirable than the other BMP alternatives included: biological and fisheries impacts (including the loss of riverine habitat utilized by steelhead trout for rearing and spawning), the permitting and other legal and regulatory requirements, the reliability of the water source, sociocultural impacts including the displacement of over 60 residences, and the high cost of the alternative.
Recently, this alternative has become even less viable due to the listing of the steelhead trout as a federally-threatened species. The Arroyo Seco provides the primary spawning and rearing habitat for this species along the Salinas River system within Monterey County.
CHALONE CANYON DAM ALTERNATIVE
The Chalone Canyon Reservoir was envisioned as a new off-stream storage facility located approximately one-mile upstream of the Metz-Soledad Road crossing of Chalone Creek. Releases from the Chalone Reservoir could have entered the Salinas River for downstream
diversion via a well system, or via pipeline for direct deliveries to agricultural and/or urban water
users.

In the 1994 analysis, the Chalone Canyon Reservoir received moderate to high ratings; however, it was subsequently determined that a reservoir in the Chalone Canyon that would store and
deliver water to users directly would not eliminate seawater intrusion or meet the 2030 needs for water. Upon further scrutiny, it was also determined that the watershed draining to the reservoir could not provide sufficient water in wet years to compensate for the lack of water during dry years, These factors, in combination with the high permeability of soils underlying the proposed site, made this alternative less feasible as a new reservoir location and it was subsequently removed from further consideration by the MCWRA.
REOPERATION AND CONSERVATION ALTERNATIVE
This alternative considered the reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs so that conservation releases would be maximized to enhance recharge through the Salinas River. The modification of the Nacimiento spillway was also assumed as part of this alternative. In order to meet the remaining water balance, a plan to reduce water use through forced conservation was 8t070

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-65 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

contemplated. In forcing the reduction of water use, this alternative would not achieve the project's goal of meeting existing and future water needs. Although the capital costs associated with this alternative would have been low in comparison to other alternatives, the indirect economic effects on agricultural practices and support industries would have been devastating to the local and regional economies. See Master Response 1.
It should be noted that although this IS not the preference of the MCWRA, forced reduction in water use and loss of local control over the management of water resources is a foreseeable outcome of both the No Action/Total Demand Management Alternative (Alternative D) and the No Action/State Adjudication Alternative (Alternative E).
DESALINATION ALTERNATIVE
Desalination of seawater was initially considered as an alternative source of water for the project. The average cost of desalinated water is between $1,000 and $2,200 per AF. At present, Basin water costs (based on average cost to pump) between $50 and $100 per AF. The relatively high cost of desalination, and the volume of water needed to meet the project's objectives, dismissed this as a viable alternative for this project. The desalination process requires a source of water and a means of disposing of the brine generated from the process. A federal marine sanctuary has been established in Monterey Bay and in areas to the north and south. Therefore, extensive studies would be required to address the potential impacts and mitigation requirements associated with a discharge to Monterey Bay. Notwithstanding the significant environmental issues of a potential discharge to Monterey Bay, desalination is cost prohibitive as a source of agricultural water. The cost of SVWP water is approximately $200/AF, including the capital and annual costs of the spillway modifications and the diversion facility. This is between one-fifth and one-tenth of the cost to develop similar supply under desalination.
IMPORTATION/WATER TRANSFERS ALTERNATIVE
Importation of water from outside of the Basin and water marketing and transfers were considered by the MCWRA during the initial planning process. At the time, the amount of State and Federal project water potentially available to the MCWRA was unknown, and reliance on this as a primary source for the proposed project was highly speculative. As result, the MCWRA decided not to pursue this alternative as an immediate solution to the problems facing the Basin. In the future, however, the Coastal Branch of the State project in San Luis Obispo County and/or Federal water from the San Felipe Unit to the north/ northeast of the Salinas Valley could be considered as possible sources. To implement these alternatives, the MCWRA would need to find willing sellers of current water contracts/entitlements or request ; future allocation from the State or Federal governments. Use of this water would likely require the construction of conveyance facilities for water transfers. Nevertheless, due to substantial uncertainties regarding timing and availability, this remains a speculative alternative and has been rejected from further consideration in this EIR/EIS.
INTERLAKE TUNNEL/PIPELINE COMPONENT
San Antonio Reservoir typically has excess capacity for the storage of additional water. The watershed and average annual precipitation within the watershed, however, does not provide for such opportunities. Early during the BMP planning process, the MCWRA evaluated the 6t070
potential to convey water from Nacimiento Reservoir (which is forced to release water during 5

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-66 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the rainy season based on spillway capacity limitations) to San Antonio Reservoir. The additional water would be stored and subsequently released for downstream recharge through the Salinas River and/or diverted from the river for use.
An interlake tunnel connecting the two reservoirs was originally considered as a method to balance and maximize water capture at the two facilities. In 1991, it was estimated that an interlake tunnel (which would require a pump station) could increase the yield of the San Antonio Reservoir by between 20,000 and 27,000 AFY. Several engineering and environmental factors were identified during the screening process that made these components undesirable. Such factors included engineering challenges associated with geology of the area and tunneling, concern regarding the spread of the predatory (introduced) white bass species by hydrologically linking the two water bodies, and the energy/ pumping needs associated with moving water from Nacimiento to San Antonio via an interlake pipeline. These and other factors substantially increased the capital and environmental impacts of the facility, and it was subsequently removed from further consideration.
NORTH VALLEY STORAGE COMPONENTS
Storage of water in the northern Salinas Valley had long been considered an integral component in defining physical solution to the Basin's seawater intrusion problem As a result, the MCWRA evaluated several potential storage sites throughout the North Valley. These sites were assessed for their engineering feasibility, land use/environmental resources, and potential capital costs. Table 2.2-1 provides an overview of the sites considered, including information related to their removal from further consideration. As described in Chapter 4, the MCWRA brought forward the Merritt Lake surface storage component, as well as a subsurface storage component, as part of Altemative B (the proposed project evaluated in the 1998 Draft SVWP EIR).

MR-9 MODIFICATION OF AFFECTED RIPARIAN ACREAGE

Section 5.5 of the Draft EIR/EIS estimated the loss of riparian habitat under Alternative A to include 32 acres of mixed riparian habitat as a result of the construction and operation of the inflatable diversion facility. This total included an estimated 30 acres due to flooding after
creation of the inundation pool and the removal of 2 acres of habitat resulting from construction of the surface diversion facility. As discussed on page 5.5-37 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the location of the inundation pool and subsequent analysis of loss of riparian habitat was based on the best available information. The area has little topographic relief, and detailed topographic surveys were unavailable. The approximate boundaries of the inundation pool were estimated based on spot topographic surveys and combination of USGS topographic information, aerial photographs, and GIS mapping. The Draft EIR/EIS recommended that additional topographic surveys and habitat characterization be completed to present a more precise estimate of project impacts to riparian habitat. Following release of the Draft EIR/EIS, topographic surveys were completed and this was used along with additional field work, to supplement the assessment of habitat within the inundation pool, and the location and size of the inundation pool was defined in greater detail. This was completed in the summer of 2001.
A revised analysis of surface-diversion impoundment impacts on riparian habitat is included in this Final EIR/EIS as Appendix A (Habitat Characterization and Mitigation Report. The revised analysis indicates that the impoundment would fluctuate within the existing riverbanks, which are relatively steep and high within the reach that would be influenced by the impoundment. Thus, the large amount of riparian habitat previously considered affected was overestimated. The estimate of the amount of vegetation in the impoundment area was reduced to 1.3 acres, and the amount of riparian vegetation at the diversion construction site was reduced to 1.1 acres. Similarly, the length of the inundation area wäs reduced from 4.5 miles, as described in the Draft EIR/EIS, to approximately 3 miles. Therefore, using this new information, it is estimated that a total of 2.5 acres of riparian habitat (1.3 acres within the inundation pool and 1.1 acres at the site of the diversion facility [rounding up) would be affected by the proposed project. Figures 5.5-3 to 5.5-5 of the Draft EIR/EIS (Inundation Area, Maps 1, 2, and 3) have been revised based on this new analysis and are hereby replaced by the two figures on the following pages.

USACE and CDFG regulation typically requires a no-net-loss of wetland with replacement habitat located near the area of impact. USACE regulations have been changed such that the "no-net-loss" is to be considered in terms of habitat value on a watershed basis. Because MCWRA will be required to obtain permits from both USACE and CDFG it can be assumed that a minimum of 5 acres of replacement habitat (or an equivalent amount based on habitat value) would be needed before permit approvals were issued. Thus, mitigation measure Alt A-7 on page 4.4-45 of the Draft EIR/EIS has been revised to read as follows:
Impacts to Riparian Habitat (Alt A-7). The MCWRA will mitigate for the loss of riparian habitat through a program that may include 4-cembination ef the following options. The precise mitigation will be determined through consultation with CDFG and USFWS, as required to obtain a CWA Section 404 Permit from the USACE. See Appendix A for proposed mitigation plan...
Option-4
The loss of riparian habitat will be mitigated through replacement and/or restoration at least a 1:1 ratio (2.5 acres) that will be determined during the permitting process. The restoration will include a combination of new plantings and restoration of areas invaded by non-native species, at a ratio to be decided upon by the involved agencies. Mitigation for this impact will include development of a detailed riparian restoration plan, prepared by MCWRA and approved by CDFG and USFWS. The goal of the restoration plan will be to eventually establish mature stands of riparian habitat near the banks of the lower Salinas River. The exact location and planting design will be developed through consultation with CDFG and USFWS. Performance standards will be included to ensure
that an 80% coverage in replacement trees is achieved over a 5-year period checked by
aerial photo coverage. Annual reports identifying planting success and monitoring efforts
will be submitted by MCWRA to CDFG and USFWS.

MR-10 SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY WATER ENTITLEMENT

Several commenters questioned how the MCWRA factored the San Luis Obispo County water entitlement into the proposed action and the evaluation of project effects described in the Draft EIR/EIS. Several others questioned how reoperation of Nacimiento Reservoir would affect the provision of domestic water supply to residential areas around the lake and suggested that potential harm to this water supply is an impact that the MCWRA must mitigate. Because these issues are related, they are addressed together in this master response.
The MCWRA built Nacimiento and San Antonio dams for flood protection and groundwater recharge. The rights to beneficial use of the water captured behind the dams were granted to the MCWRA by the State. A recent decision by the SWRCB (Application 30532) again acknowledged the MCWRA's right to Nacimiento Reservoir water. (The SWRCB is the State agency charged with public trust oversight of surface water resources.)
Under an October 1959 agreement between San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (SLOCFC&WCD) and the MCWRA's predecessor, the Monterey County Flood Control and Water Conservation District (MCFC&WCD), the MCWRA is obligated to provide to San Luis Obispo County up to 17,500 AFY of water from Nacimiento Reservoir. 02054
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-73 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The 17,500-AF entitlement comes from the MCWRA's permitted allocation of 180,000 AF of water. The MCWRA's contractual obligation is to provide this water from the San Luis Obispo County diversion at the discharge end of the low-level outlet works (670 feet) of Nacimiento Dam. The agreement does not include any responsibility on the part of the MCWRA for delivering the water. The authorized diversion of water does not include water taken from wells around Nacimiento Reservoir, and the MCWRA is not required to furnish water at a rate in excess of the present capacity of the low-level outlet works.
With the exception of Oak Shores, all the water users at Nacimiento Reservoir, including those at Heritage Ranch, obtain their water supply as part of this entitlement. San Luis Obispo County has historically exercised only part of its rights to water under the agreement, with the amount delivered to lakeside residents from this entitlement totaling approximately 1,300 AFY. However, the MCWRA is fully prepared to provide the full entitlement of water in accordance with the agreement.
The San Luis Obispo entitlement was accounted for in the modeling performed to evaluate project effects. The San Luis Obispo County diversions were simulated as a monthly amount of 1,450 AF. This diversion was included in every month of the simulation period, as long as the minimum flow requirements were met downstream of the dam. In other words, for purposes of the modeling performed to evaluate the SVWP, it was assumed that San Luis Obispo would exercise its full entitlement, even though it has not done so historically. Therefore, it should be noted that the modeling and model results are conservative in this regard, showing greater effects than would occur if San Luis Obispo County continues to not exercise its entitlement. Most important to note, regardless of the method used to incorporate the San Luis Obispo County entitlement into the modeling, is that the MCWRA will provide the full entitlement of water In accordance with the agreement, as stated above,
The water supplied to iS Oak Shores is covered by a 1984 agreement between Nacimiento Water Company (which serves Oak Shores) and the MCFC&WCD. Through this agreement, the Nacimiento Water Company received a water allocation of 600 AFY, which is drawn from the bottom of Nacimiento Reservoir and other intakes. The agreement specifies that the Nacimiento Water Company waive any claim of right or title to water being taken from its three wells located at the bottom of Nacimiento Reservoir. This allocation is not an obligation for the MCWRA to supply 600 AFY of water, but allows Nacimiento Water Company to take the water from the lake when it is available. Although some water is always available for extraction, the quality of the water may be poor when the reservoir is drawn down substantially.

Dear Mr. Smith:

The Department of the Interior (Department) has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS/EIR) for the Salinas Valley Water Project, Monterey County, California (ER 01/0500). This letter has been prepared under the authority of and in accordance with provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; 83 Stat. 8523, as amended (NEPA), the Endangered Species Act of 1973 [16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.; 87 Stat. 884] (ESA), as amended, and other authorities mandating Department concern for environmental values. Based on these authorities, the Department offers the following comments for your consideration.

GENERAL COMMENTS

The draft EIS/EIR does not adequately address ESA issues within the proposed project area. These issues are related to federally endangered and threatened species known from, or predicted to be in the project area. The Department is therefore unable to completely assess the proposed action in this draft EIS/EIR and its effects to our trust resources. We include information in our 2-1
NEPA response to help the Corps analyze for these effects, and request the following changes be made to ensure the final EIS/EIR adequately addresses our ESA and-other concerns in the proposed project area.

Endangered Species Act
California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora draytonit) 2-2

The draft EIS/EIR indicates the federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora

draytonif) are found in "streams and ponds with emergent vegetation." We bave included additional information (through the U.S. Fish and Widlife Service Ventura Field Office) that should be used to analyze for effects to this species in the project area, and included in the final EIS/EIR

California red-legged frogs are found in more than just streams and ponds. Breeding sites include streams, deep pools, backwaters within streams and creeks, ponds, marshes, sag 2-2
ponds, dune ponds, lagoons, and artificial impoundments such as-stock ponds; they can also use shrubby riparian or emergent vegetation: These frogs also occur in upland habitat, and have been recorded moving as far as 2.25 miles from nonbreeding to breeding
sjtés; they can also.be found further than 328 feet from water in adjacent vegetation (66 Federal Register 14626; USFWS 2000, Scott and Rathburn 2001, in litt.).

We are concerned that the draf EIS/EIR classifies the Salinas River watershed as "unsuitable
habitat" for California red-legged frogs. However, if the Salinas River (including proposed project area) were unsuitable, it would not have been included in the fimnal determination of critical habitat for California red-legged frogs (66 Federal Register 14626). The proposed surface 2-3
diversion facility location falls within critical 'habitat Unit 17 (Elkhorn Slough-Salinas River Unit). This critical habitat unit was designated based on the location and its habitat containing the primary constituent elements necessary for California red-legged frog survival and recovery, and the ability of the unit to provide connectivity from the coastal plain and outer coast ranges to the inner coast ranges.
Due to the documented presence of California red-legged frogs in the vicinity of the proposed surface diversion facility location (Lower Salinas River Sighting: 1999; Las Paimas Ranch sighting: 1994; and Elkhomn slough-occupied habitat), surveys of frogs along Salinas River may need further attention for the final EIS/EIR.

According to the California red-legged frogs final determination of critical habitat (66 FR 14626), the frogs are adapted to survive where habitat quality varies spatially and temporally. Due to this variability, population sizes can vary widely from year to year, which in turn make surveying more dificult in arcas where populations of frogs may not be very high.
According to a report prepared by EDAW, Inc. for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (dated 2-4

February 18, 2000, and obtained at the Ventura Field Office), the project area was surveyed by
two biologists from EDAW, Inc. between September 13 and 15, 1999. Based on the amount of project area and our U.S. Fish and Widlife Service biologist's professional opinion, we believe the amount of time to survey the area required to document the presence of California red-legged frogs in the vicinity of the proposed surface diversion facility location was insufficient.
The survey area along Salinas River may need further attention. This amount of area could not be

AR 02060
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-79 Response to Comments on the EIIED

thoroughly surveyed (two daytime surveys and two nighttime surveys) in two days by only two biologists. Phone messages from the Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office have been left with EDAW, Inc. (Cindy Davis) during 2000, and as late as January 31, 2001, regarding this matter, although no messages were returned. We request that additional surveys be conducted and
included in the final EIS/EIR to fully assess the presence or absence of California red-legged frogs in the project area. Please include the qualifications of the biologists conducting the surveys in an appendix within the final EIS/EIR for our review.
We also request the agricultural pond adjacent to the river (Merritt Lake and the stock pond being the same thing in the document) be surveyed for presence of California red-legged frogs for the
final EIS/EIR. The February 18, 2000, report from EDAW, Inc. indicated "the agricultural pond 2-4
adjacent to the river is likely unsuitable, because this type of pond is often inhabited by bullfrogs (cont'd)
and other predators."

The EDAW, Inc. Report and draft EIS/EIR indicate that this pond was not surveyed. We suggest. all aquatic.areas within the project area should be thoroughly surveyed for California red-legged frogs, whether exotic species are present or not. California red-legged frogs have been documented to occur within the same types of ponds, streams, or other aquatic features, which are habitat for bullfrogs and otber non-native predatory species (66 FR 14626; USFWS 2000;
Scott and Rathburn, 1998, in litt.).
The draft EIS/EIR is unclear as to what kind of habitat type in the upland inundation area (beyond the 30 acres of riparian habitat) would be lost. Please clarify this in the final EIS/EIR 2-5
Also, it is likely that the inundation area resulting from the proposed surface diversion facility will provide additional habitat for bullfrogs and other predators of California red-legged frogs. Please clarify in the final EIS/EIR the measures your agency plans to take in order to prevent an increase 2-6

in abundance of bullfrogs and other predators that might be present in the inundation area.
The range of California red-legged frogs was incorrectly reported in the draft EIS/EIR. Please
include this information in the final EIS/EIR:

Historically, Califoria red-legged frogs were more widespread. Today they are found in only 248 streams or drainages, in 26 counties in California. They are locally abundant in 2-7
many areas of Monterey County. Isolated populations have also been discovered in the Sierra Nevada, northern Coast, and northem Transverse ranges, The species iS also present in Baja California, Mexico (66 FR 14626).
Califomia tiger salamanders (Ambysioma californiense)
We suggest that the final EIS/EIR provide evidence of surveys conducted at Merritt Lake for the 2-8

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has sufficient information on the biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals to list as federally endangered or threatened. This location falls within the current range of this salamander; please include this information in the final EIS/EIR:
• California tiger salamanders have been found to occur along the coast ranges, from the Santa Rosa arca of Sonoma County south, to the vicinity of Buellton in Santa Barbara 2-8

County. They occur in disjunct vernal pool complexes, isolated ponds, sag ponds, and (cont'd)
human-maintained stock ponds. California tiger salamanders have been found from sea level up to about 460 m (1500 feet), using scasonal aquatic habitat for breeding. They burrow in cracks in the ground or small mammal burrows in grassland areas surrounding
the pools or ponds (USFWS, 2001),

Least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) and arroyo toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus)
We are concerned that the draft EIS/EIR does not identify surveys for two federally endangered species in the project area around the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, the least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus) and arroyo toad (Bufo microscaphus californicus).
Habitat for these two species is expected to be affected from increased water levels. Both of these federally endangered species' ranges include these reservoirs. Arroyo toads have also been documented to occur on a 17-mile stretch of the San Antonio River above the reservoir. We
request your agency do thorough surveys for these species in the identified areas, analyze for project effects to both these species, and include the information in the final EIS/EIR.
It is likely that arroyo toads may be found both up and downstream from the current inhabited area on the San Antonio River. It may also be necessary to conduct arroyo toad surveys: 2-9

downstream from the reservoir to determine if they are present and to assess potential affects on
this species below the reservoir.
Although no least Bell's vireos have been documented in the Nacimiento, San Antonio, and Salinas River watersheds since the 1993 Salinas River observation, suitable habitat still exists within these watersheds. In addition, the populations of least Bell's vireo in the Southern California area have recently increased in numbers and have expanded northward; they are expected to reestablish in the northern San Luis Obispo and southern Monterey County areas in the near future.

Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)

As a result of this proposed project, we believe changes in water release operations at the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoir will adversely affect the fish populations and the fish 2-10

habitat, which may in turn adversely affect the main food source for the threatened bald eagle (Haliacetus leucocephalus). The DEIS/EIR gives a very brief description of bald cagles in the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoir areas. The document also mentions that bald eagles are *uncommon winter residents".
Based on observations by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Ventura Field Office personnel and on 2-10

recent reports submitted to this office, bald eagles have been observed along the Nacimiento River (cont'd) and Nacimiento Reservoir annually during winter months over the past few years. The eagles have also been documented to nest along the San Antonio River just upstream of the San Antonio
Reservoir on Fort Hunter Liggett property. We request the final EIS/EIR provide evidence of bald eagle surveys to estimate the numbers of bald eagles in the project area, and an assessment detailing the effects to the eagles if a decrease in its main food source occurs.
Tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryf)
The draft EIS/EIR does not provide an analysis of effects of the proposed Salinas Valley Water Project on the tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi), a federally endangered fish species that may occur within the project area. Please include this analysis in the final EIS/EIR. Also, please include the following information in the final EIS/EIR:

Historically, the tidewater goby was found in coastal lagoons from the California/Oregon 2-11

border south to San Diego; has been found to range upstream from the Pacific Ocean into fresh water up to 1.2 miles; and typically found in coastal lagoons, estuaries, and marshes with relatively low salinities. Its habitat is characterized by brackish shallow lagoons and lower stream reaches where the water is fairly still but not stagnant.
Hydrological Modeling
The draf EIS/EIR document states a number of times that "the proposed actión would halt seawater intrusion". In other paragraphs, the document states that "hydrologic modeling shows that the project may not halt seawater intrusion in the long-term future." Please clarify these opposing statements and include a better discussion and analysis of the hydrologic modeling 2-12

results in the final EIS/EIR. This discussion is needed to demonstrate more concisely both the
•short-term and long-term effects of the surface diversion structure on State and federally
threatened and endangered species in the project area.

several pegative impacts associated with enhanced fluctuations in reservoir water levels. Table 5.8-2 (Page $.8-18) indicates that annual reservoir water-level fluctuations in San Antonio Reservoir will, on average, increase from 10 to 20 feet under existing conditions and existing conditions plus Alternative A, respectively. Similarly, table 5.8-5 (Page 5.8-20) indicates that water-level fluctuations in Nacimiento Reservoir will, on average, increase from 34 to 43 feet under existing conditions and existing conditions plus Alternative A, respectively. 2-13

The zones around the rims of the reservoirs between low and high annual water levels are virtually vegetation-free. The draf EIS/EIR does not provide a map showing the extent of the current and projected (under Alternative A) unvegetated zone. The draft EIS/EIR does describe the negative • impacts of enhanced bank erosion associated with substantial broadening of the unvegetated zone. 2-14

To adequately address environmental impacts associated with enhanced reservoir fluctuations in Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, the final EIS/EIR should include a map showing soils, in which the area affected by water-level fluctuations is superimposed. Inclusion of this map in the 2-15
final EIS/EIR will permit identifying areas with low, moderate, and high potential for erosion.
The final EIS/EIR needs to address effects of enhanced erosion on aquatic life and on recreation. 2-16
Page 3-10, Section 3.2.2 Reoperation of Reservoirs: The draft EIS/EIR states "During normal and heavier rainfall years, this has meant that the MCWRA was forced to release water from the reservoir that could otherwise have been stored for conservation (i.e., recharge) uses later in the year during late-spring/summer months. By increasing the capacity of the spillway and reoperating the reservoir, more water can be stored during the winter/spring, while still passing the PMF, thus making more water available for release later in the year.'
Page 5.3-12. Section 5.3.2 Environmental Impact of the Project, subsection Reservoir Reoperation
- Alternatives A and B: The draft EIS/EIR states "Modification of the Nacimiento spillway is
required by DSOD to remove restrictions on flood control operations. Once modified, the
operating rule curve would allow increased flexibility of Operations at the reservoir, This would be especially evident during the late winter and early spring periods when lake levels have

In this simulation, initial reservoir levels for the modeled (Alternative A) conditions were 4 feet lower than the March 1995 levels.(762 as compared to 766 ft elevation). The model shows that Nacimiento Reservoir releases under Alternative A conditions were less than the actual March 2-17

1995 conditions. (cont'd)
If the MCWRA anticipates near-capacity water levels in some years, under Altemative A conditions, the draft EIS/EIR should provide information about the frequency at which near-
water releases that would occur during storm events capacity reservoir levels would occur, and with water levels at near-capacity.
It is of note that these potentially higher releases would be more similar to, but less intense than pre-reservoir discharges in the lower Salinas River (see page 5.3-7 of the dräft EIS/EIR), Nonetheless, it is possible that Alternative A condition releases could be above the 5,000 cubic feet 2-18.

U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance Patricia Sanderson Port, Regional Environmental Officer July 31, 2001

2-1 The DRAFT EIR/EISmeets its statutory requirements under CEQA and NEPA to identify the significant effects on the environment including potential effects on state and/or federally-listed species. In addition to the evaluation presented in the Draft EIR/EIS, MCWRA initiated informal consultation with USFWS under Section 7 of ESA regarding potential effects on federally- listed species in 2000. MCWRA fully intends to continue consultation with USFWS until all issues related to the potential take of ESA-covered species are resolved. The Section 7 consultation will provide additional opportunities for USFWS to ensure compliance with ESA. However, it is the professional opinion of EDAW (a biological consulting firm hired by MCWRA) that the potential impacts of the project to any ESA listed terrestrial species would not be significant under CEQA or NEPA.

2-2 The information regarding habitat for the California red-legged frog presented in the Draft EIR/EIS is accurate and meets the statutory requirements of CEQA and NEPA. The description provided by the commenter is also accurate, including information presented regarding the use of uplands by California red-legged frogs. However, it is important to note that uplands provide only temporary habitat and that suitable breeding habitat for the California red-legged frog is limited to streams, ponds, and other similar aquatic environments. The Draft EIR/EIS cites a Draft
Califomnia Red-legged Frog Assessment for the Salinas Valley Water Project (EDAW 2000). This document, which was provided to the USFWS Ventura Fish and Wildlife Office in February 2000, provides more detailed information on the life history of the California red-legged frog and acknowledges that California red-legged frogs are known to use upland habitat.

2-3 The land designated as critical habitat for the California red-legged frog covers an extremely large geographic area; the Elkhorn Slough-Salinas River Unit alone encompasses over 165,000 acres Much of the land designated as critical habitat is unsuitable for the California red-legged frog. For example, the area mapped as the Elkhom Slough-Salinas River Unit includes areas of urban development and active agricultural land.
The Draft EIR/EIS does not state that the entire watershed is unsuitable habitat for California red-legged frog. The location of previous observations and known populations are presented in the analysis, thus acknowledging that suitable habitat is present. However, the watershed is not the focus of the analysis. The Draft EIR/EIS focuses on the Salinas River channel, particularly in the vicinity of the proposed surface diversion facility. The habitat assessment conducted by EDAW in 02067

Salinas Valley Water Project 86 Response to Comments 0n the EIR/EIS

1999 focused on the vicinity of the proposed dam location (i.e. two miles upstream and two miles downstream of the proposed dam).
The Draft EIR/EIS evaluated the primary constituent elements, listed by USFWS as essential, to determine if the project area was suitable for California red-legged frog. The primary constituent elements, as determined by USFWS, include: (a) suitable aquatic habitat; (b) associated uplands; and (c) suitable dispersal habitat connecting suitable aquatic habitat. The Salinas River generally meets these requirements (elements); however, localized environmental factors within the project area limit the potential for a reproducing population of California red-legged frogs. These factors include erratic, fast flows; well-drained soils (which results in temporary aquatic habitat); and the scarcity of suitable adjacent uplands (i.e., riparian habitat). There are no known breeding populations in the Salinas River channel and only a single observation of a California red-legged frog. The Draft EIR/EIS notes that portions of the river channel do represent suitable habitat for non-breeding California red- legged frogs. However, EDAW does not believe that the channel provides habitat that is important to the survival and/or recovery of the species (i.e., critical habitat) given the absence of any recent or historical breeding records and only one previous reported occurrence of : California red-legged frog from the entire length of the river channel.

The proposed project would not in any way, reduce the connectivity of California

2-4 red-legged frog habitat on the coastal plain to habitat on the inner coast range.

The comment suggests a report including survey results was sent to USFWS in February 2000. The referenced report was a habitat assessment and did not include focus surveys for California red-legged frog. As outlined in the USFWS Guidelines on Site A ssessment and Field Surwys for California Red-legged Frog (1997), the habitat assessment was conducted as the first step to aid in the determination of whether focused surveys would be required for the project. It is our opinion that two days is adequate to assess the suitability of habitats occurring within the vicinity of the proposed surface dam location (i.e., approximately 4 miles of the Salinas River).
Focused red-legged frog surveys of project area do not appear to be necessary for USFWS to assess the potential effects of the proposed project. As stated in the Draft EIR/EIS, the proposed project is not expected to adversely affect any occupied habitat, or potential breeding habitat, for the California red-legged frog. The project area would continue to represent potential non-breeding habitat for the red-legged frog after project completion. However, as the Draft EIR/EIS states, impacts associated with the surface diversion facility are not expected to affect the red-legged frog or its habitat because they are presumed absent and no suitable breeding habitat is present. In addition, the proposed project would not substantially reduce or degrade the amount of unoccupied potential habitat.
The agricultural pond in question is not part of the proposed project and would not be affected, either directly, or indirectly. The Merritt Lake surface storage site was evaluated but is not part of the preferred alternative; therefore, subsequent environmental analysis, which would include an evaluation of potential biological 02068

Salinas Valley Water Project E

87 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

impacts, would be needed before this alternative could be implemented. Merritt Lake and the agricultural pond provide an aquatic environment that could support California red-legged frogs, at least temporarily. However, there is no evidence that California red-legged frog inhabit either of these areas. Moreover, Merritt Lake and the agricultural pond provide few if any of the characteristics of higher quality red- legged frog habitat. Both areas are surrounded by intensive agricultural development; the Merritt Lake basin is active agricultural land during summer. months. The commenter is correct that California red-legged frogs and bullfrogs may exist in the same aquatic environment. However, several researchers have attributed the decline and extirpation of California red-legged frogs to the introduction of bullfrogs and introduced predatory fish. Therefore, high bullfrog densities, when combined with habitat that includes few if any of the characteristics of higher quality California red-legged frogs and from which there are no previous occurrences, can be used to support the conclusions presented in the Draft EIR/EIS that impacts would be less-than-significant.
The commenter is misinformed about the previous contact between USFWS and EDAW. The California Red-legged Frog Site Assessment for the Salinas River Water Project (EDAW 2000) was sent to Catherine McCalvine of the USFWS
Ventura office on February 18, 2000. The project was assigned to Steve Henry of the USFWS Ventura office in late February. A conference call between EDAW representatives, Entrix representatives, and Steve Henry occurred on March 16, 2000 to discuss the results of the site assessment. Based on this conference call a field meeting was set up and attended by Steve Henry (USFWS) and two EDAW representatives (i.e., Cindy Davis and Janelle Nolan-Summers) on May 4, 2000. Steve Henry received a tour of the project site and was shown all habitats occurring onsite. During the fall of 2000, Cindy Davis of EDAW, Inc., left several phone
messages for Steve Henry that were not returned. Cindy Davis contacted Steve Henry on January 2, 2001, to discuss the project; however, at that time Mr. Henry informed Ms. Davis that he is no longer working on the project and a new contact would be assigned.
After receiving comments from the USFWS on the Draft EIR/EIS, EDAW (i.e., Cindy Davis) contacted USFWS biologist Heidi Crowell of the USFWS Ventura office to arrange site visit to the location of the proposed surface diversion facility. Ms. Davis and Leo Edson of EDAW and Ms. Crowell visited the site on January gih, 2002. Following the site visit, Ms. Crowell stated that she believed red-legged frogs would not be adversely impacted as a result of the proposed project provided that the inundation pool behind the dam did not exceed the ordinary high water mark. At full capacity, the inundation pool encompasses approximately 49 acres. Approximately 5 acres of the inundation pool will be located above the OHWM. The habitats that would be flooded above the OHWM include Arundo
(approximately 0.5 acre), sand (approximately 3.2 acres), mixed forest (approximately 0.3 acres), and willow (approximately 1 acre). Because only small fraction of the inundation pool will exceed the OHWM and the small area that may be inundated appears to be unsuitable as breeding habitat for red-legged frog, the proposed project is not expected to adversely affect California red-legged frog or other sensitive biological resources found above the OH-IWM. Ms. Croweli did state that the 02069
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 88 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

USFWS would recommend preconstruction surveys to ensure that no red-legged frogs were affected during dam construction. However, Ms. Crowell also stated that, in her opinion, focused red-legged frog surveys would probably not be necessary provided the height of the inundation pool did not exceed the ordinary high water mark.

2-5 Because the inundation is almost entirely limited to the area below the Ordinary High Water Mark, only a minimal amount of upland habitat would be inundated. Upland habitat inundated would include approximately 0.1 acre of Monterey cypress habitat.

2-6 The Draft EIR/EIS does not include any mitigation measures to prevent an increase in the abundance of bullfrog and other predators because such an increase is not anticipated, and no California red-legged frogs would be expected to be affected, even if such an increase occurred. The inundation area would be flooded from April to October. In California, bullfrogs typically lay their eggs from March to July. Because bullfrog tadpoles require at least six months to metamorphous, it would be unlikely that bullfrog larvae could complete their metamorphous in the inundation pool given the proposed operational period for the surface diversion structure. The inundation area is a temporary feature and similar suitable aquatic habitat for adult bullfrogs can be found in the Salinas River channel during periods when the surface diversion structure is operational (e.g., upstream from the Highway : crossing). Therefore, the surface diversion structure and resulting inundation pool would not substantially increase the availability of breeding habitat for bullfrogs.

2-7 The Draft EIR/EIS states that California red-legged frogs were once common throughout most of lowland California and that currently, significant numbers of California red-legged frogs occur only in coastal drainages between Marin and Santa Barbara Counties. This description, while general, is accurate. The more detailed information provided by the commenter on the current distribution of the California red-legged frog is acknowledged.

2-8 No surveys were conducted at Merritt Lake for California tiger salamander. The 217-acre proposed Merritt Lake surface storage site is currently farmland that is used for growing row crops such as artichokes, celery, and strawberries. Biologists did conduct reconnaissance-level surveys at Merritt Lake and found no habitat that appeared to be suitable for California tiger salamander breeding habitat. Because the Merritt Lake surface storage site is not part of the proposed project, additional environmental review that could include focused surveys for special-status species would need to be completed prior to implementation of this alternative. If it is determined that potential habitat for the California tiger salamander could be affected, future environmental documents would likely include relevant information on the range and life history of the California tiger salamander.

2-9 No surveys were conducted in the project area for arroyo toad. Surveys were conducted for least Bell's vireo and the methods and results of those surveys are presented in the Draft EIR/EIS. While neither species has been reported in the 04020
project area, the Draft EIR/EIS acknowledges that both species could occur. 9

Salinas Valley Water Project 89 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Potential impacts to both arroyo toad and least Bell's vireo were evaluated and it was determined that the project would not have any effect on potential habitat for either species. The project's intent to manage releases such that peak runoff in winter is marginally less than current conditions. For Nacimiento, spring and summer flows would be more constant but still minor when compared to winter flows. During
spring, average Nacimiento releases would be lower in March and April but higher in May. However, May flows would be expected to be confined to the main channel. Flows from San Antonio reservoir would not change substantially. The changes in flows from Nacimiento would not reduce or otherwise affect riparian vegetation that could provide breeding habitat for the least Bell's vireo, nor would it result in wash- outs or other disturbance to potential arroyo toad breeding pools. Therefore, it is the opinion of EDAW, the biological consultant for MCWRA, that additional
surveys are not necessary.

2-10 Bald eagles can be found throughout the year in the vicinity of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs. However, bald eagles are much more numerous during winter months at both reservoirs. Each winter, an eagle count is sponsored by the USFWS and the Monterey County Parks Department for the San Antonio/Nacimiento Recreation Area. According to information provided by the Monterey County Parks Department, over the last twenty years (i.e., 1982 to 2001), the number of bald eagles counted on the winter census has ranged between 15 and 44 individuals, with an annual average count of 30 bald eagles. Recently, as many as three pairs of bald eagles have nested annually in the vicinity of the reservoirs.
Potential adverse impacts to fish populations are addressed in the Fish Biology Section of the Draft EIR/EIS (Section 5.6). The fish community at San Antonio Reservoir is dominated by largemouth bass, bluegill, and threadfin shad. The fish community at San Antonio Reservoir is dominated by threadfin shad, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill. The impact analysis focused on impacts to largemouth bass, a warmwater gamefish that frequently nests in shallow water along the shoreline. Based on the criteria evaluated and the changes in lake level projected during the bass spawning period and summer drawdown period, the Draft EIR/EIS determined that there would be potentially significant impacts on largemouth bass spawning success and largemouth bass populations in Nacimiento Reservoir but that effects in San Antonio Reservoir, though present, would be at level considered less- than-significant. The proposed project is projected to result in an increase in the number of years when largemouth bass reproduction may fail substantially in Nacimiento Reservoir from 3 years under existing operations to 7 years in the 46 year study period. However, this is not expected to substantially impact bass hatched in previous years. Because largemouth bass is a relatively long-lived species, reproduction failure in any one year could be offset by more successful reproduction in subsequent years.
The Draft EIR/EIS adequately evaluated whether or not the proposed project would have a substantial impact on the bald eagle. There is no specific information available on the diet of bald eagles wintering or nesting at Nacimiento and San 02071

Antonio reservoirs. In general, live fish represent a major component of the bald E

Salinas Valley Water Project 90 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

eagle's diet. Other important food items may include ducks, wading birds, turtles, rodents, snakes, and carrion. The Draft EIR/EIS concluded that the reservoir reoperation would result in a slight decrease in fish at Nacimiento Reservoir; no
other food sources are expected to be affected at Nacimiento Reservoir. No significant adverse affect on food availability at San Antonio Reservoir would be
expected.

Under CEQA, a significant impact would include one that would have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modification on the bald eagle. A substantial effect could include one that resulted in death or injury, decreased breeding success, or one that caused bald eagles to permanently abandon a wintering or breeding location. Implementation of the proposed project would not be expected to result in death or injury to bald eagles. In addition, there is no information available that would suggest that bald eagles would abandon this location as a wintering site. The potential for a minor decrease in the overall fish population at Nacimiento Reservoir could possibly cause bald eagles to increase efforts associated with locating food. However, the overall food availability would not be substantially diminished.

2-11 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS does not analyze the effects of the proposed project on tidewater goby, requests that such an analysis be provided, and requests the inclusion of information provided by the commenter on the historical range and habitat characteristics of this species. The Draft EIR/EIS provides a discussion of tidewater goby (E ucydogobins neuberry) status, life history, and habitat requirements on pages 5.6-38 and 5.6-39. The information included in this discussion encompasses the information provided by the commenter; therefore, no additional text is being added to the discussion. As noted on page 5.6-38, tidewater goby have been reported in the project area only once, from the Salinas River Lagoon in 1946, and this species is not presently known to occur in the project area. Because available evidence indicates that tidewater goby do not occur in the Salinas River basin, the SVWP is not expected to have any effect on this species. No additional analysis needs to be provided.

2-12 The effectiveness of the SVWP in stopping seawater intrusion was evaluated by comparing the amount of groundwater pumping that could be offset by project implementation with near-term water demand, based on 1995 land and water use conditions, and future water demand, based on projected land use changes in the county projected to the year 2030. The modeling performed for the proposed project based on current (1995) water demand, indicates that the project would halt seawater intrusion in the near term. As noted in Section 3.2.4, overall water demand in the Basin is anticipated to decline by 2030, but total urban needs are projected to increase from 45,000 acre-feet per year (AFY) in 1995 to 85,000 AFY (a 90% increase) based on projected growth, large part of which is expected to occur in the northern end of the valley. The modeling shows that with projected 2030 demands, seawater intrusion with implementation of the proposed project may total 2,200 acre-feet per year (AFY) (10,500 AFY of intrusion is anticipated to occur without the project). For this reason, the Draft EIR/EIS reports that the SVWP may not halt seawater intrusion in the long term. 02072

Salinas Valley Water Project T

91 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

As noted on pages 3-23 and 3-24 of the Draft EIR/EIS, given the dynamics of the hydrologic system, the uncertainties of whether future demands will equal the projected 2030 demand, and the limitations of modeling, it cannot be known whether this level of seawater intrusion would actually occur. It is possible that the project as proposed, with deliveries only within the CSIP system, would continue to fully halt seawater intrusion in 2030. To address these uncertainties, the project includes a monitoring program that would evaluate the success of the project in halting seawater intrusion over the longer term. If monitoring indicates that seawater intrusion has begun to advance landward in the future, deliveries of surface water from the SVWP in the future may need to be expanded beyond the CSIP area. A potential expanded delivery system has been conceptually planned to address this potential future need. Given the uncertainties in predicting whether seawater intrusion will occur in the long term, it is appropriate at this time to consider the
expanded delivery system only at this conceptual level and to address the environmental effects generally.
The commenter requests that a "better discussion and analysis of the hydrologic modeling results" be provided in the Final EIR/EIS to "demonstrate more concisely
both the short-term and long-term effects of the surface diversion structure" on threatened and endangered species. It is unclear which types of effects the commenter believes have not been addressed sufficiently. Draft EIR/EIS Sections 5.5 and 5.6 provide detailed discussions of the potential effects of the project on terrestrial species and fish, respectively, based on 2030 diversion requirements. To the extent possible, the potential impacts of the expanded delivery system have been addressed in these analyses. If an expanded delivery system is required to meet future demand for water and offset potential groundwater pumping, detailed analysis of the effects of implementation of that system would be performed after planning is developed beyond a conceptual level.
Also, please see Master Response MR-1.

2-13 Tables 5.8-2 and 5.8-5 of the Draft EIR/EIS provide an overview of surface elevations for San Antonio Reservoir and Nacimiento Reservoir, respectively, under both existing conditions and Alternative A for the 45-year period modeled. The tables allow for comparison between awrage monthly surface elevations for the 45-year model period. They do not show the entire range of surface-elevation fluctuations under existing conditions or projected with-project conditions. The commenter notes that Table 5.8-2 shows changes in average monthly surface elevation of 10 feet under existing conditions at San Antonio Reservoir and 20 feet under existing conditions plus Alternative A. Similarly, the commenter refers to a change of surface elevation of 34 feet under existing conditions at Nacimiento Reservoir and 43 feet under existing conditions plus Alternative A. While these results show greater fluctuations in awrage monthly surface elevations at both reservoirs under Alternative A operations (and also overall lower average monthly elevations under Alternative A than under existing conditions), these greater fluctuations would still be within the range of elevations presently experienced at each reservoir. In fact, in drought years, when reservoir elevations are lowest, and wet years, when they are highest, the 02073
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 92 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

changes in reservoir levels under Alternative A would not differ measurably from those under existing conditions. The increased fluctuations in reservoir levels reflected in the data in these tables generally would be associated with "normal" hydrologic years. During these years, water levels would fluctuate more than under existing conditions, but, as previously noted, the fluctuations would remain within the existing range of surface elevation changes. The changes in reservoir operations would not increase the inundation area, raise the high-water mark at either reservoir, or reduce the low water levels at either. The rate of drawdown would remain slow.
Therefore, the area of the unvegetated zones around the reservoir rims would not be changed by Alternative A operations, contrary to the commenter's assumption, and vegetation mapping of these areas under existing conditions and existing conditions plus Alternative A would serve no purpose in evaluation of project impacts.
Please refer to Master Response MR-4 and Section 3 regarding revisions to the
hydrology analysis.

2-14 As noted in response to Comment 2-13, the elevation range of the "unvegetated" zone at the reservoirs would not change under the proposed reoperation of San Antonio and Nacimiento Reservoirs. The maximum water surface levels will not increase, the minimum water levels will not differ from those presently experienced during dry- or drought-year conditions, and reservoir levels will not fluctuate rapidly. On page 5.2-15 of the Draft EIR/EIS, it is concluded that no impacts to geology and soils would be anticipated as a result of changes in reservoir reoperation because these changes would not increase the inundation area or raise the high water mark at either reservoir. This conclusion applies to potential erosion effects (i.e., no new erosion effects would be associated with reservoir reoperation). See also response to Comment 2-13.

2-15 As indicated in responses to Comments 2-13 and 2-14, the elevation zone within which reservoir water levels would fluctuate under proposed project operations would not differ from the zone in which water levels fluctuate under current conditions. The changes relate to frequency of drawdown in some water year types, but not to the range of fluctuation. The soils subjected to erosion potential are the same as those affected under current conditions. Therefore, mapping of soil types is not necessary to determine project effects on erosion in the unvegetated zones of the
reservoirs.

2-16 As indicated by the responses to Comments 2-13 through 2-15, water level fluctuations in Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs will be within the range occurring under present operations and are not expected to result in increased erosion in the drawdown zone. Therefore, there should be no potential for impacts on aquatic life or recreation from erosion as a result of the proposed project.

2-17 Modeling using the 1995 simulation of Alternative A operations indicates that near- capacity levels would occur at Nacimiento Reservoir in 11 of 46 years in the modeling period, or with frequency of approximately 24 percent. San Antonio Reservoir would experience near-capacity reservoir levels in 7 of 46 years in the DLOZO
modeling period, or with frequency of approximately 15 percent. The 1995 E

Salinas Valley Water Project 93 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

baseline simulation showed near-capacity reservoir levels at Nacimiento Reservoir in 9 of 46 years in the modeling period, or with frequency of 19 percent, and occurring at San Antonio Reservoir 15 times, or with frequency of 33 percent.

2-18 Releases under Alternative A would not be above the 5,000-cfs threshold cited by the commenter. Please see response to Comment 2-17.

Dear Mr. Smith:
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIS/DEIR) for the project entitled Salinas Valley Water Project, Monterey County, California (CEQ# 010228). Our review is pursuant to the National Environmental Policy.Act (NEPA), Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508), and Section 309 of the Clean Air Act.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) proposes to issue permits to the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act for the construction of a Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). The goal of the SVWP is to halt seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley groundwater basin, and to help balance the basin's current and future water use. The Agencies have identified five project alternatives, two of which include construction of physical structures, and three "no- action" scenarios which include various policy/regulatory controls for groundwater pumping in the basin. The preferred alternative focuses on groundwater recharge and includes the following components: 1) modification of the spillway on Nacimiento Reservoir, 2) reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, 3) a surface di version/impoundment on Salinas River, 4) surface water delivery to agricultural users, and 5) limiting groundwater pumping in the basin.
EPA supports the Corps and MCWRA in their efforts to halt the annually increasing seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley groundwater basin. Seawater intrusion threatens the quality of groundwater for both agricultural and municipal purposes.' The agencies and impacted communities have obviously devoted considerable effort to finding solutions to this problem. The DEIS/DEIR is a very well-written and thorough document. Project alternatives and potential 3-1
impacts are clearly discussed, and maps, aerial photos and graphs help to illustrate the existing conditions and project components.
However, in our review of the document, EPA has several unresolved concerns regarding the project. As such, we have rated the DEIS/DEIR as EC-2, Environmental Concerns - Insufficient Informanion (please see the attached Rating Faciors for description of our rating system). In 3-2
particular, we are concerned with the narrow scope of alternatives analyzed, impacts to riparian

EPA Comments on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Salinas Valley Water Project DEIS/DEIR
August 17, 2001

Proiect Alternatives

The Draft Environmental Impact Statement/Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIS/DEIR) states that the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP) is proposed to halt seawater
intrusion, provide adequate water supply for current and future users, and improve the hydrologic balance of groundwater in the Salinas Valley basin. The DEIS/DEIR evaluates five project alternatives to meet those goals - two primarily structural alternatives, and three policy/regulatory alternatives. Each alternative includes several components. Overall, the scope of project components evaluated in the DEIS/DEIR (and it appears through numerous other studies in the last ten years) is quite comprehensive, and adequately covers range of options for addressing the seawater intrusion issues in the basin. However, each alternative is presented as a distinct action, when in fact some components from different alternatives could be combined for a less environmentally damaging project. Given the modeled estimates provided in the DEIS/DEIR for water demand in the basin, the preferred alternative appears.to rely more on physical water supply
structures than is necessary for meeting the project goals.

The DEIS/DEIR discusses current and future water needs for the basin, and states that either
a water project will be implemented or that the local government and/or state would step in to manage wäter demand in the basin (i.e., require reduced water use in the basin). EPA recognizes
that many alternatives have been discussed and evaluated for addressing the groundwater problems in the basin over the last decade. While we are pleased that the Corps of Engineers (Corps) and 3-3
Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) have worked with the community and the state to develop options for addressing this problem which have reduced the potential environmental impacts, we encourage you to consider re-combining some of the existing structural and non- structural project components to yield a less environmentally damaging project.
For example, the preferred alternative includes several components which (in combination with ongoing water supply activities in the basin) would provide up to 23,000 acre feet/year (AFY). of surface and reclaimed water to the Castroville irrigation area. According to the model used for project planning, this provision of surface and reclaimed water and the subsequent reduction in groundwater pumping, would halt seawater intrusion in the basin. The preferred alternative is based on only 13,300 AFY of reclaimed water being used to meet the goal of 23,000 AFY. However,
according the 1993 Final EIS for the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP), the goal of this system is to provide a minimum of 19,000 AFY of reclaimed water for the Castroville irrigation area. If that full capacity was utilized, MCWRA and the Corps could consider both structural and
non-structural components from the identified alternatives to meet the additional 4,000 AFYof water needs (e.g., recharge from re-operation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, demand management and/or conservation improvements, pumping restrictions). A combination of components such as this would meet water needs and halt seawater intrusion without the need to build a diversion structure. This would reduce the potential impacts to riparian habitat and endangered steelhead salmon associated with the diversion component.

AR 02078

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-97 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Recommendation: The Corps and MCWRA should maximize the capacity of the existing CSIP program to provide the goal of 19,000 AFY reclaimed wastewater for irrigation
purposes as a means of addressing water needs and seawater intrusion. 3-3

Recommendation: The FEIS should address whether providing full capacity of the CSIP (cont'd)
project combined with greater groundwater recharge (from reservoir reoperation) and new
policy or regulatory controls on groundwater pumping would address the same goals as the proposed diversion structure. This analysis should be quantified where possible.
Also, the preferred alternative does not include a component to further improve water conservation as a means of addressing water balance in the basin. While per capita water use in this
basin is one of the lowest in the state, new technologies and management practices are always improving the ability to reduce water use through conservation. It is our understanding that Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties have both prepared water conservation plans för agriculture and urban uses. Information on these planning efforts has not been included in the 3-4

DEIS/DEIR, and specific conservation measures have not been included as part of any of the alternatives, EPA encourages the Corps and MCWRA to require stringent water conservation practices and policies for both agricultural and urban users to help reduce the future demands on
water needs.

Recommendation: The FEIS should further discuss the effecriveness and feasibility of
incorporating water conservation measures as part of the preferred alternative.

Habitat and Fisheries Impacts

The preferred alternative includes a seasonal diversion structure which would impound
water to a depth of approximately 10 feet. The water would be pumped and diverted to the CSIP delivery infrastructure, and combined with reclaimed water for delivery to the Castroville irrigation area. The diversion structure would include several features to protect migrating steelhead salmon,
including a fish ladder, minimum flows, and fish screens.

While the Corps and CSIP have made great efforts to reduce the impacts from this diversion structure, and have worked with several state and federal resource agencies to design a structure that minimizes impacts to fish, EPA has some remaining concerns regarding the impacts to riparian habitat and endangered steelhead salmon. The di version structure will impound water for 4.5 miles upstream on the Salinas River. This will submerge about 30 acres of mixed riparian vegetation, and
result in potentially harmful impacts to steelhead from predation and migration constraints. 3-5

• Recommendation: In order to minimize the environmental impacis from this project, the Corps and MCWRA should assess whether project goals to reduce seawater intrusion and provide balanced water supply för existing and future needs can be met without the
construction of the diversion structure and impoundment. Potential impacts to endangered steelhead salmon and riparian habitat could be significant and should be avoided.

AR 02079

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-98 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The diversion facility will submerge approximately 30 acres of mixed riparian habitat. This is a significant impact for which, according to the DEIS/DEIR, MCWRA will mitigate. The "precise mitigation will be determined through consultation with California Department of Fish and Game and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, as required to obtain a Clean Water Act 404 permit." No mitigation sites have yet been identified, and the ratio of mitigation has not bèen determined. This does not allow the public and decision makers to evaluate the overall impact from the loss of
the 30 acres of riparian habitat. 3-6
Recommendation: If the diversion facility is included as a project component, the Corps and. MCWRA should identify and disclose in the FEIS the sites and the ratio for mitigating riparian habitat impaçts. In order to reduce the impacis on species which rely on this riparian habitai, the mitigation should be lacated close to thè impacied area or at a minimum within the same sub-basin. The FEIS should also demonstrate MCWRA'S
commitment to the proposed mitigation by providing information on the site, proposed
restoration activities, cost, and post-implementation monitoring.
EPA is also concerned that the likely impact of the diversion impoundment in increasing predation risk on outmigrating steelhead smolts is underestimated. The DEIS/DEIR concludes that
the lack of predatory species, such as largemouth bass, in the existing lagoon near the mouth of the
Salinas River is evidence that those species are unlikely to take up residence in the new
impoundment. However, predator species probably do not occupy the lagoon because of the shifting salinity patterns there. The consistent freshwater nature of the impoundment is much more conducive to increasing the population of such predators. In fact, the document states that the upstream Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs support large populations of largemouth bass which are frequently washed downstream during high winter flows, but that the Salinas River channels below the dams are generally "too shallow and fast flowing for largemouth bass" to take up residence (p. 5.6-81). It seems likely, therefore, that largemouth bass washed downstream will find that the impoundement area is the only suitable habitat along the river course, and could thrive there. Such large impoundments are thought to be one of the major sites of largemouth bass predation on steelhead and salmon smolts in the Tuolumne and Merced rivers. 3-7

Recommendation: Potential impacts to endangered steelhead salmon from construction of the diversion facility could be significant and should be avoided. If the diversion facility is
included in the project, the Corps and MCWRA should minimizie and mitigate predation
impacts to oumigrating steelhead. Possible mitigation measures could include periodic
lowering of the inflatable dams when monitoring suggests that steelhead are moving
downstream and/or predation densities get too high. Sampling at the fish screens might be
adequate to monitor both conditions. Such 'pulse flows' might reduce predator populations and simultaneously facilitate smolt out-migration. The FEIS should include a discussion of outcomes (including a copy of the biological opinion, if one is issued) from Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding impacts to steelhead.

Hydrology Impacts

The DEIS/DEIR states that groundwater levels under the preferred altemative will increase
dué to the reoperation of the reservoirs, reduced groundwater pumping, and redistribution of the surface water. However, it does not distinguish the relative contributions to the groundwater
increase from each of these project components. For example, what portion of the increased groundwater level is due to in-stream recharge from reservoir reoperation? How much impact does subsequent reductions in groundwater pumping have? In evaluating the effectiveness of the individual project components in meeting the goals of halting seawater intrusion and balancing 3-8
water supplies in the basin, it is important to have a clear understanding of the relative contribution each activity would have on the overall increase in groundwater level/decrease in overdraft
conditions.

Recommendation: The FEIS should clarify the individual impacts from each project component on the overall increase in groundwater levels/reduction in basin overdraft
condition.

Also, the DEIS/DEIR states that more water may need to be diverted from the surface
impoundment in the future to meet water needs and halt seawater intrusion. Under this scenario, more water would be diverted, and additional deliyery infrastructure would be constructed. The DEIS/DEIR discusses the potential impacts from this expansion on such things as habitat, air quality, and water quality, but does not provide any information on the impacts to hydrology in the Salinas Basin. Increasing the amount of water diverted from the reoperations could have significant impact on groundwater levels, recharge rates, and seawater intrusion. EPA is concerned that potential expansion of the diversion distribution may work against the efforts to increase 3-9
groundwater levels and reduce seawater intrusion in the basin. While the DEIS/DEIR states that any future expansion will be further evaluated, some initial information on the hydrologic impacts (similar to that provided in other sections of the document for other impacts) should be provided in
order to evaluate the overall project.
Recommendation: The FEIS should expand the "Hydrology and Flooding" chapter to discuss the impacis on groundwater levels, recharge rates, and seawater intrusion from potential fuure expansion of the diversion distribution system. Given the potentially
significant impacis from an expanded diversion system, any future expansion showld be evaluated in a supplemental EIS which thoroughly examines the impacts on hydrology, habitat, waier quality, wetlands, aesthetics, cultural resources and air quality.

Recreation Impacts

Reoperation of the two reservoirs will cause significant, unavoidable impacts to the large mouth bass fisheries, associated recreation (fishing), and aesthetic value of the reservoirs to the public. The FEIS should address what efforts the Corps and MCWRA have taken to reach out to, and work with the public in addressing these impacts. Several relevant measures to mitigate and 3-10

reduce recreational impacts were identified in the FEIS for the CSIP project in 1993 when it was

AR 02081

.Salinas Valley Water Project 2-100 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

evaluating reoperation of these reservoirs, such as relocation of camping facilities or boating access.
The options for this type of mitigation should be included in the impact analysis.

Recommendation: If the Corps and MCWRA have not already done so, public hearings, 3-10 workshops, direct mailings, and other outreach activities should be scheduled to explain the (cont'd) potential impacts and receive input on ways to reduce the overall recreational and aesthetic loss to the region (i.e., improving recreational opportunities in other areas of Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties). The FEIS should include a discussion of potential mitigation activities to reduce the recreational impacts from reservoir reoperation.

Growth Inducement Impacts

The DEIS/DEIR discusses the potential growth inducing impacts of this project, and correctly acknowledges that the proposed project will have growth inducing effects. The •Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments projects an 80% increase in population in the Salinas Valley Basin between 1995 and 2030. This is a substantial increase, and one that would not
happen without available water supplies. EPA recognizes that the groundwater supply needs to be protected from increasing intrusion of seawater, but the current project also facilitates future
population growth. The DEIS/DEIR only provides a short, general overview of some of the
potential indirect effects of this growth (on land use, biological resources, traffic, and air quality). While implementation of this project is not the only factor affecting whether the county will reach its projected 80% increase in growth, it moves one of the most significant barriers to that growth - 3-11

available water. As such, the DEIS/DEIR should include : thorough discussion of the potential
indirect impacts, including growth inducing impacts, on patterns of land use, air, water, and other natural systems (see 40 CFR 1508.8). Some of this information may be contained in previous
environmental assessments for the General Plans of the Cities and Monterey County, and could be
incorporated into the EIS.

Recommendation: In addressing growth inducing impacts, the FEIS should further discuss the potential indirect impacts from this project, and identify the related land use controls and other regulatory measures which would help minimize future environmental impacts from the projected growth (i.e. restrictions on conversion of agricultural land, conditioning water deliverie's, local coastal plans, zoning/general plan restrictions). Some of these local.
measures are discussed elsewhere in the DEIS/DEIR, but should be specifically discussed
within the context of fuure growth.

Energy

The DEIS/DEIR does not address any of the potential impacts on energy resources or demand associated with the project altematives. Nacimiento Dam has hydropower facility which would likely be impacted from changes in reservoir operations. What are the potential impacts on 3-12

hydro power generation? Also, what are the energy demands associated with the pumping at the di version structure, Or with the sub-surface and surface storage areas for Alternative B? Given the

3-1 This comment expressing support for the lead agencies in their effort to halt the seawater intrusion problem in the Salinas Valley groundwater basin and noting that the DEIR/EIS a very well written and thorough document are noted. No further response is necessary as no environmental issues are raised.

3-2 The commenter's rating of the Draft EIR/EIS is noted. No further response is necessary because no specific environmental issues area raised. Responses to specific
comments are presented below.

3-3 The use of recycled water from the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) treatment plant via the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) is governed by a number of factors, including the availability of recycled water, irrigation demands, and the absence of any significant amount of
recycled water storage capacity. The total flow available from the plant varies, but is estimated to be approximately 21,000 AFY, based on flow for each month during the year. Irrigation requirements within the CSIP service area are at a maximum during June, July, and August, and are minimal during November, December,
January, and February. Based on the irrigation requirements within the CSIP service area and monthly capacity of the MCWRP, the average annual recycled water use is estimated to be approximately 13,300 AFY; therefore, this is the amount assumed for purposes of project evaluation to be generated for delivery in the CSIP area. For the most recent irrigation season, recycled water use was approximately 11,000 AFY.
The 1993 CSIP EIR estimated that the system could initially provide up to approximately 19,000 AFY of reclaimed water, but storage facilities would be required to allow storage of recycled water during the non-irrigation months of November through February for later use during the higher irrigation months. Storage of recycled water as part of the project solution was evaluated in Alternative B. Two types of storage facilities were evaluated: surface storage (i.e., Merritt Lake) and subsurface storage (i.e., injection and extraction of recycled water). These storage options have been shown to be costly and they present significant environmental issues, such as loss of significant farmland, lower crop yield as a result of recycled water use, and groundwater quality degradation. Further, as shown with the analysis of Alternative B, recycled water use and reoperation of reservoirs is not sufficient to fully halt seawater intrusion; diversion of river water is still required.
As flow to the MRWPCA treatment plant increases in the future, it is assumed that 9807O
additional recycled water will become available for use during the irrigation season. =

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-104 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

This increased level of recycled water availability is the basis for the projected increase to 16,000 AFY in recycled water use within the CSIP service area. It is
important to recognize that, while overall water demand in the project region is expected to decrease (due largely to conservation efforts and a switch to lower water demanding crops) by 2030, the demand in the northern Salinas Valley is expected to increase, in part due to urbanization allowed by the adopted general plans of the cities and communities in this area. Agricultural water use in the Basin is expected to decrease by 60,000 AFY by 2030, whereas urban demands are expected to increase by 40,000 AFY. While the Salinas area is acknowledged for its lowest per capita water use in California (expect San Francisco), a 5% per capita reduction in water use is projected by the year 2030 due to even greater conservation. Yet, despite this,
modeling for the project shows that seawater intrusion may not be halted in 2030
without relying on the combination of expanded use of recycled water in
combination with the project's diversion facility and some expansion of a delivery
system.

Regarding maximizing recharge from reoperation of the reservoirs, this is already included as part of the proposed project.
As to regulatory programs that further manage groundwater extraction, it must be acknowledged that, given the high level of conservation already practiced and
planned into the future, that reducing groundwater use without adding an alternative
supply results in either a substantial reduction in farm productivity or severe
restrictions on use of water in urban areas. The effects of restricting water availability are addressed in Alternatives C and D of the EIR/EIS.

As can be seen, while the comment provides for rationale consideration of alternatives that do not result in diversion of water from the Salinas River, more than a decade of planning has not resulted in any suitable options that can accomplish this without severely hampering the productivity of the region.

3-4 As described in Section 3.2.5, management measures are already in place in the CSIP area as a part of CSIP implementation. The MCWRA will continue to manage and limit pumping by those water users who receive direct water deliveries from the proposed project. This type of restriction will help to ensure the project's effectiveness in meeting its stated objectives. The hydrologic model evaluations presented in the Draft EIR/EIS include the assumption that pumping management will continue within the project delivery area.
Table 1-2 of the Draft EIR/EIS is a summary of existing and future water conditions in the Salinas Valley, including estimates of existing and future groundwater use. The estimates presented in Table 1-2 were deriyed from a series of evaluations of present and future land and water use practices, and include consideration of increased levels of conservation in both agricultural and municipal and industrial use categories.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-105 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

3-5 The commenter is concerned about the potential project impacts to steelhead and riparian habitat, and recommends that the lead agencies assess whether the project objectives could be met without the construction of the diversion structure and
impoundment of water. The impoundment and diversion of water are necessary components of the proposed project if it is to meet the objectives of stopping seawater intrusion and providing adequate water supplies. Please see response to Comment 3-3 regarding the limitations on the amount of recycled water available for delivery to the CSIP area to meet these objectives. Please see response to Comment 3-4 about conservation measures already being implemented. Although the proposed action could result in significant impacts to steelhead and riparian habitat, it has been identified as the environmentally preferred alternative among the alternatives being considered. Refer to Section 2.2.6 on page 2-7 of the Draft EIR/EIS for a discussion of the Environmentally Preferred Alternative. See also Master Response MR-9, however, regarding modification to the estimate of riparian habitat that could be affected by implementation of the proposed action. Please see
response to Comment 3-7 regarding the commenter's concerns related to impoundment-related effects on steelhead. Note that approval of the project will . require substantial mitigation for these impacts and the concurrence of NMFS (through Endangered Species Act consultation) that the impacts to steelhead are minimized and fully mitigated.

3-6 Please see Master Response MR-9.

3-7 The comment states that predation risk to outmigrating steelhead smolts has been underestimated. The commenter states that the salinity in the proposed impoundment would be different from that of the lagoon and that the
impoundment, because it would contain fresh water, would be conducive to
increasing the population of largemouth bass that escape from the reservoirs. As
stated on page 5.6-81 of the Draft EIR/EIS, however, predator populations are not likely to become established in the impoundment because it would be drained on an
annual cycle. Unlike the Tuolumne and Merced River examples cited by the commenter, the Salinas River does not provide year-round habitat for largemouth bass that can provide refuge areas when the impoundment is not in operation.
is Nevertheless, it is recognized that there is still a potential for predation to occur, and the Draft EIR/EIS includes provisions for monitoring for, and mitigating, impacts as described on pages 5.6-83 and 5.6-87. Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is ongoing and may include expansion and addition of mitigation measures if needed to find that the impact is minimized and fully mitigated. The recommendation presented by the commenter to include periodic lowering of the inflatable dams when monitoring suggests that steelhead are moving downstream and/or (if) predation densities get too high will be more fully explored in Section 7 consultation. See also response to
Comment 5-7.

Modeling for the proposed project is complex. In the past, various individual 280ZO 3-8
components have been examined and none have been found to be sufficient to halt seawater intrusion. Modeling has been conducted to examine various levels of E

recharge, use of recycled water, and diversion of river water needed to halt seawater intrusion, As explained in response to Comment 3-3, recharge is maximized under the project, as is use of recycled water (given environmental impacts associated with this use). As shown in the modeling for the proposed project with all components included, the project halts seawater intrusion under current water demand/hydrologic conditions, and may not (without additional expansions as explained in the EIR/EIS) halt seawater intrusion under 2030 conditions. It can be concluded, therefore, that elimination of any one of the project components would result in an inability of the project to halt seawater intrusion.
It also must be recognized that the project has a beneficial impact to groundwater quality, and the ability to halt ongoing pollution of the groundwater basin is tied to the ability of all project components to function together.
Modeling of the isolated effects of each of the project components would be costly, and given the marginal ability of all components together to halt seawater intrusion, would not result in information that would lead to removal of any of the project components and their associated impacts. Further, a reduction in groundwater .pumping of the magnitude contemplated with the project is not feasible without the project providing replacement water; otherwise, significant effects to agricultural productivity or urban land uses would occur as described under Alternatives C and D.(reduction in groundwater pumping without a new source of water is effectively
the same as these alternatives). Consequently, this type of modeling, in addition to being costly to conduct, would be for an infeasible project.. Please see Master Response MR-1.

3-9 Because the hydrologic modeling performed to evaluate the SVWP indicates that the proposed project may not fully halt future (2030) seawater intrusion, an expanded distribution system might be necessary for future project operations. This expanded
distribution system is described at a conceptual level and evaluated in the Draft
EIR/EIS at a level of detail corresponding to the information and projections available at this time. See pages 5.3-41 through 5.3-62 in Section 5.3 of the Draft EIR/EIS for a discussion of hydrology, reservoir levels, groundwater elevations, and seawater intrusion under the different project alternatives under projected future demand conditions. As noted in response to Comment 2-12, given the dynamics of the hydrologic system, the uncertajnties of whether future demands will equal the projected 2030 demand, and the limitations of modeling, it cannot be known whether or to what extent seawater intrusion would actually occur in 2030. It is
possible that the project as proposed, with deliveries only within the CSIP system, would continue to fully halt seawater intrusion in 2030. Therefore, it is appropriate to address this expanded system at a conceptual level. However, modeling does show the expanded system would remedy modeled shortfalls in halting 2030 seawater intrusion, which translates to positive impacts to groundwater.
If the monitoring program included in the project indicates that seawater intrusion has begun to advance landward in the future, further planning of increased deliveries of surface water from the SVWP and an expansion of the delivery system beyond the 02088

Salinas Valley Water Project E

2-107 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

CSIP area may be found to be required. If this expansion is needed in the future, more precise planning and environmental analysis of all potential impacts would be

3-10 required, including compliance with all applicable environmental statutes.
Since the public release of the SVWP Draft EIR/EIS in June 2001, the MCWRA and USACE held two public workshops, one at the Salinas Valley Fairgrounds in King City on July 10, 2001 and the other in Paso Robles on July 30, 2001, to help explain the potential impacts on recreation at the reservoirs as well as to receive public input on ways to reduce the severity of these impacts. Based on the outcome of these meetings and various public comments made on the Draft EIR/EIS,
mitigation measures have been added to the Final EIR/EIS to enhance recreational activities at the lakes. Please refer to Master Response MR-2 for an expanded discussion on new mitigation measures for recreation impacts at Nacimiento Reservoir. There are, however, no known measures that could fully mitigate the recreation impacts from the project while still allowing the project to operate in a
manner that results in halting seawater intrusion.

3-11 As acknowledged in the comment, growth-inducing effects of the project are indirect environmental impacts. In developing the analysis in Chapter 7 of the EIR/EIS on growth, all available general plans and general plan EIRs, as well as the Local Coastal Plan and other environmental documents addressing growth in the affected area, were reviewed. The information in these documents ranged, but the degree of specificity was limited. Chapter 7 reflects this information to the degree needed to convey the overall growth inducing potential of the project. Chapter 7 also aids the reader in understanding the growth inducing potential of the project by additionally describing what would occur if the project did not go forward. Patterns of land use change are indicated by where growth would be expected in the County (see Table 7- 1), the degree of anticipated agricultural land conversion is calculated, biological resources at risk are described, etc. The need for additional analysis of growth, on a project-by-project (or larger) basis is also described in the Chapter.

As to regulatory controls, the commenter is correct that the general plans and the local coastal plan contain regulatory controls that address growth related impacts. The analysis in the growth inducing impact chapter conveys the expected impacts of growth based on implementation of the various general plans, so effectively reflects impacts that will occur with regulatory constraints in place. The various general
plans contain numerous policies encouraging that growth occurs on non-prime farmland, that development occur as in-fill prior to developing in outlying areas, that traffic impacts are addressed with new development proposals, that water conservation is built in to new development, etc.
The MCWRA does not have any land use regulatory control, so its ability to impose regulations on new development is limited. However, as management of water resources are within the purview of the Agency, and in response to this comment, the following is added to page 7-11 of the EIR/EIS:

"The MCWRA will work with Monterey County and the cities and communities within the County to encourage maximum use of water 02089
5

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-108 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

conservation practices in new development, including the use of ultra low- flow water fixtures and drought-tolerant/low water demanding landscaping."
Additionally, the following text is added to page 7-11 of the EIR/EIS in response to this comment:

"As local jurisdictions consider development proposals, they should aggressively implement general plan policies and other zoning ordinances and programs that result in reducing potential environmental impacts, including impacts to agriculture, water use, traffic, air quality, and biology. While these
programs are not within the purview of the MCWRA or the USACE, they are reasonable requests that would help reduce potential impacts from land use conversion. These programs would be the responsibility of local agencies as part of their land use approval process."
These changes are added to Chapter 3.0 of this Response to Comments document. Please refer to Master Response MR-3.
Also, note that the State passed new legislation (effective January 2002) requiring fuller consideration of water availability when local jurisdictions are considering new development proposals.

3-12 The proposed reservoir reoperation would increase the potential for energy production at the Nacimiento Dam Hydroelectric Facility because more water could be released for electrical generation as a result of spillway modification. The only project feature (Preferred Project or Alternative A) that would create a demand for energy resources would be the pump station (six 200-horsepower pumps) proposed at the surface diversion site. The associated energy demand would not be substantial:

Under Alternative B more electrical power generation would be needed, as collector wells require more power and pumping would need to occur to convey water to storage fäcilities and through the distribution system. Because this alternative is no longer being pursued, details on energy use have not been determined.

Dear Mr. Smith:
The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary has reviewed the Draft Environmentäl Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project. The proposed action involves: modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam, reoperation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to store a higher volume of water in the wet season and allow higher releases of water in to the Salinas River during irrigation season
increased recharge of the groundwater basin through the higher irrigation season releases from the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs a seasonal diversion structure to move water from the Salinas River during the irrigation season for delivery to agricultural users reduction in groundwater pumping a potential expanded distribution system for diverted Salinas River water in the future if monitoring indicates that seawater intrusion has not been halted.
The Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is a Federally protected marine area offshore of California's central coast. We support the overall goals of the project in attempting to improve the freshwater supply for the region's critical agricultural industry and urban areas. However, since the Salinas River drains to the ocean, we have concerns regarding impacts on water quality. The Salinas Valley Water Project DEIR states the proposed construction and operation of the surface diversion facility would result in the loss of an estimated 32 acres of mixed riparian habitat. The DEIR further states that this loss would substantially decrease the value of this area for a number of wildlife species, which would 4-2
result in a less-than-significant impact. The Sanctuary is concerned with removal of riparian zone habitat as this could impair the ability of this area to act as a natural filtration device for sediment, persistent pesticides, nitrates, and other contaminants. An increased volume of chemical run-off is likely to occur without the riparian habitat in place, and mitigation measures for this effect must be included.

Salinas Valley Water Project AR 02091
2-110 Response to COnILIEIS un the EIR/EIS

Anadromous species, such as steelhead, which spend Sanctuary waters, may also be affected by part of their lives in this project. The Salinas River hosts.a small remnant steelhead run; the Sanctuary has concerns regarding the modification of critical habitat and the effect that may have on this migratory endangered species. Section 5.6-1 of the DEIR states "River conveyance with diversion facility in the Lower Salinas River may result in altered river flows and fish habitat and could potentially effect fish passage, particularly for steelhead using the Lower Salinas as a migration corridor. À diversion also has potential 4-3

due to entrainment of fish." impacts on fish migration as well as potential losses The Sanctuary recommends that the project incorporate mitigation measures as
outlined in the document for Alternative A, including maintenance of necessary minimum flows, fish ladders and screens so as not to affect the dwindling steelhead population during the period when the dam is raised.

4-1 The commenter's statement of support for the project's objectives is noted. No further response is necessary as no environmental issues are raised.

4-2 Please see Master Response MR-9, which expresses that subsequent to release of the Draft EIR/EIS, more accurate surveys determined that only 2.5 acres of riparian habitat would be adversely affected by the project. The same type of mitigation, replacement of habitat on a no-net-loss basis, would be required such that project impacts are reduced to below significant. The natural filtration provided by riparian habitat in the project area would not be substantially altered by the loss of this amount, especially following mitigation. Therefore, there would be minimal less- than-significant impact to water quality of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary as a result of the proposed surface-diversion impoundment.

4-3 The commenter supports incorporating into the proposed project the mitigation measures described in the Draft EIR/EIS to minimize and mitigate potential impacts to steelhead and fish migration. The lead agencies (the MCWRA and the USACE) would adopt all mitigation measures included in the Draft EIR/EIS for the proposed
project, including measures that are outlined for mitigating impacts to steelhead,
should they decide to approve this alternative.

Mr. Robert Smith, Regulatory Branch U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, San Francisco District 333 Market Street San Francisco, California 94105-2197
Dear Mr. Smith:
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Salinas Valley Water Project, dated June 2001. The Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) proposes to construct the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP) in Monterry . and San Luís Obispo Counties to balt the intrusion of scawater into the Salinas Valley groundwater basin. The proposed project includes modification of the Nacimiento Dam spillway; reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs; higher releases from Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs; construction of a seasonal diversion structure in the Salínas River, between Highway 1 and Blanco Bridge; transfer of water to the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP); reduction in groundwater pumping in the CSIP area; and a potential expanded distribution systemn for diverted Salinas River water.
South-Central California Coast (SCCC) steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), found in the Salinas River watershed, were listed as threatened on August 18, 1997 (62 FR 43937) and critical habitat was designated on February 16, 2000 (65 FR 7764) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 153] et seq.). The Salinas River sub-population of steelhead is at a 5-1

critically low level; babitat degradation, water diversions, and agricultural practices are a major factor in the decline of the steelhead population.
In reviewing the DEIR for the SVWP there are some questions and concerns that we wish to address. Most of the following comments and questions are referenced by page and paragraph of
the DEIR.

disagrees; historical data from before the Salinas Dam and the dams on the Nacimiento and San Antonio Rivers were built indicate steelhead were abundant. Spyder (1913) reported that steelhead entered al! the tributaries to the Salinas River in large numbets during high flows. Before the Salinas Dam was built io 1942, adult steelhead migrated upstream as far, or farther than Pozo, cast of San Luis Obispo. Afer the dam was built, adult steelhead migrated as far as 5-3

the dam in varying numbers, dependent on the amount of rainfall (Titus, et al., In Press). In 1946, a year the steelbead did not reach the dam, the estimated catch of stoclhead in the Salinas (cont'd)

River was 3,600 (White and Broderick, 1992). While bistoric escapement is unknown, apecdotal information implies that there were large runs in the Salinas tributaries. The Salinas River watershed is part of the designated critical habitat for SCCC steelhead, and as such is important for their recovery.
Page 5.6-18, peragraph 2 and 3, page 5.6-23, table 5.6-5, page 5.6-53, paragraph 1, and page 5.6-61, paragraph 1: NMFS is concerned that the proposed project may impact flows for steclhead migration. During NMFS Section 7 consultation with the Corps, we will assess the 5-4

flow data to determine if flows are adequate for steelhead.
Page 5.6-61, paragraph 2: NMFS has concern that the releases from the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs are based on flows from the Santa Margarita reservoir, which MCWRA has no operational control over. It is stated in the DEIR that operational criteria are based on managed flow at Paso Robles being 60 cfs, which is dependant on releases from Santa Margarita. Releases from Santa Margarita arc not stated to be coordinated with this project. 5-5

Salinas River Lagoon - Alternatives A and B Page 5.6-80: The DEIR states that the impoundment behind the diversion structure will be 4.5 miles long, This will affect smolt outmigration; in flows of less than 5 km/day juvendle fish tend to residualize, They are also subject to a higher rate of predation in slow moving open water, Effects on smolt outmigration need to be analyzed. 5-6

Page 5.6-83, paragraph 1: This paragraph states that impoundment impacts would not likely differ significantly from the lagoon. The salinity in the impoundment will not be the seme as the lagoon. Predators will be different, and are likely to include non-native, warm water species that escape from the reservoirs. These impacts need to be assessed. 5-7

5-1 The commenter's statement regarding the status of the South-Central California Coast steelhead (Oncorbynchus mykiss) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is
noted. This is consistent with the analysis contained in Section 5.6 of the Draft
EIR/EIS. No further response is necessary because no specific environmental issues are raised.

5-2 All fish screens installed as part of the proposed action will be designed to meet NMFS criteria. See pages 3-14 and 5.6-87 to 5.6-88 for discussions committing the project to these requirements.

5-3 The commenter disagrees with the statement in the Draft EIR/EIS that the Salinas run of steelhead does not now represent, and has not historically represented, a significant numerical component of the evolutionarily significant unit (ESU). The commenter notes that, while historic escapement is unknown, anecdotal information implies that there were large runs of steelhead in the Salinas River tributaries and that
the Salinas River watershed is important for the recovery of the South-Central California Coast steelhead. The anecdotal information provided by the commenter is hereby incorporated into the EIR/EIS text. This information does not alter the findings in the EIR/EIS with respect to the significance of project impacts. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of the Final EIR/EIS, Changes to the Draft EIR/EIS for revisions to Section 5.6 (Fish Biology) of the Draft EIR/EIS.

5-4 The effect of flow modification on steelhead was thoroughly examined in the Draft EIR/EIS (pages 5.6-56 to 5.6-70); the following determinations were made:
Altered hydrologic conditions in the San Antonio River, Nacimiento River, and Salinas River related to the preferred project (Alternative A) involve
relatively minor changes and do not alter the overall pattern of post-dam
hydrology.
Based on hydrologic model results, the preferred project may result in small net increases in potential migration opportunities for adult steelhead
migrating to the Arroyo Seco and juveniles and smolts migrating from the
Arroyo Seco.
The preferred project would result in a projected small net decrease in
potential migration opportunities for adults migrating to the Upper Salinas basin under the proposed action, but would be offset by a net increase in
potential migration opportunities for smolts. AR 02098

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-117 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

NMFS will review this issue during consultation with the USACE under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). It is not expected that NMFS's findings during Section 7 consultation with the Corps will differ from the conclusions presented above. However, should NMFS require any mitigation for steelhead in addition to that presented in the Draft EIR/EIS, additional measures would be presented as "reasonable and prudent measures" in the NMFS biological opinion, and compliance with such measures would be incorporated into the project.

5-5 For the purposes of impact assessment in the Draft EIR/EIS, it was determined that steelhead are unlikely to be able to negotiate the Salinas River channel upstream from the Nacimiento River confluence when flow upstream of the confluence is less than 60 cfs. At such times, releases from Nacimiento or San Antonio reservoir will have
no effect on the ability of steelhead to access potential habitat upstream from the
Nacimiento River and such releases are not proposed as part of the project. It is true
that releases from Santa Margarita reservoir are beyond the control of the MCWRA.
Releases from Santa Margarita reservoir are determined by the reservoir's operator, the City of San Luis Obispo, and are not coordinated with MCWRA operations. The effects of the SVWP have been evaluated given existing hydrologic conditions, and the cumulative impacts of the project have been considered in combination with those of the Salinas Reservoir (Santa Margarita reservoir) Expansion Project (pages 6-2 to 6-3 of the Draft EIR/EIS). As a result of the Salinas Reservoir Expansion Project, the SWRCB has required that fisheries studies be completed over the next 5 years downstream of the Salinas Reservoir to Highway 58 to better ascertain that project's impacts to fishery resources.

5-6 The commenter raises the issue of residualization of smolts in the proposed diversion impoundment at low velocities and higher potential predation rates at lower velocity flows. The Draft EIR/EIS contains full consideration of this issue. The commenter suggests that juvenile fish tend to residualize in flows of less than 5 km/day. This criterion is taken from studies of a series of large mainstem Columbia River impoundments and has questionable application to a single small facility on the Salinas River. The Draft EIR/EIS (see pages 5.6-81 and 5.6-82) concluded that the potential impacts of the impoundment on smolt migration, while not likely to differ significantly in type or degree from that occurring under present conditions in the Salinas River Lagoon, must be regarded as potentially significant. Therefore, the MCWRA has proposed a monitoring and mitigation program (see page 5.6-87) to identify and mitigate potential impacts. The Draft EIR/EIS identifies several potential enhancement actions, and it is possible that additional enhancement actions
may be identified during the Section 7 consultation for the project. Any additional
actions presented as reasonable and prudent measures in the NMFS biological opinion would be incorporated into the project.

5-7 The commenter states that salinity in the impoundment will be different from that of the lagoon and that predators will also be different and will include non-native, warm-water species that escape from the reservoirs. Lagoon water quality and aquatic species are discussed at length on pages 5.6-32 to 5.6-38 and 5.6-73 to 5.6-80, 06020
and in Appendix C. The Draft EIR/EIS analysis concluded that the potential §

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-118 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

impacts of the impoundment on smolt migration, while not likely to differ significantly in type or degree from that occurring under present conditions in the Salinas River Lagoon, must be regarded as potentially significant. Therefore, the MCWRA has proposed : monitoring and mitigation program to identify and mitigate potential impacts (page 5.6-87). See also response to Comment 3-7.

5-8 Please see Master Response MR-9. The revised analysis discussed in that response
found that because of the steeply sloping bank forming the channel sides throughout the impoundment area, the project would result in little loss of riparian vegetation.
Although vegetation on the banks would be flooded and may be lost, the vegetation near the top of the bank would not be expected to be altered. There should be little change in the width of the riparian zone. Although the impoundment area is
technically within the critical habitat designated for South-Central California Coast steelhead, the area serves as a migration corridor and does not presently support rearing juvenile steelhead. Based on water temperature monitoring conducted to date, the fact that the channel is relatively narrow through the impoundment reach, and the well developed riparian fringe, the impoundment is not expected to alter water temperatute conditions in the reach during the steelhead smolt emigration period. The greatest thermal effects would be in the relatively open, wide channel upstream from Spreckels; temperature downstream of Spreckels is moderated by cooler air temperature and more frequent occurrence of coastal fog.

Subject: Comments on the Draft EIR for the Salinas Valley Water Project * 2DDDD3 D67 The Department of Health Services has reviewed the Draft EIR for the Salina Valley Water Project and we offer the following comments.
Of the three alternatives discussed in the Draft EIR, we have specific concerns about the proposed subsurface storage of treated wastewater portion of the project presented in Alternative B. This altemative proposes to use 9,600 acre-feet per year of treated wastewater from Monterey Regional
Wastewater Treatment Plant, inject into the 400 feet deep aquifer during the wet season, and extract the stored water during the imrigation season for delivery io agricultural users [Part 2.2.2(5) of the report].
Part 2.4.2 of the report indicates,
"Implementation of Alternative B would result in the following significant and 6-1
unavoidable impacts: Potential migration of injected recycled water beyond the
designated 1,125-acre subsurface injection area, potentially resulting in adversely
affecting groundwater quality."

Furthermore, Part 2, section 5.4 of the report indicates that if the treated wastewater reaches outside the
1,125-acre area

*4 It would be a significant impaci and additional mitigation is not available to avoid it."

Page 5.4-30 of the report, Water Quality Impacts Domestic Use provides analysis performed to evaluate the impact of the proposed storage project on drinking water supplies. This section appears to focus only on the nitrate impact of the proposed storage on the aquifer and ignore other impacts. For example, there 6-2

appears to be no discussion of the projected iron and manganese concentrations in the extracted water,
which exceeds the State maximum concentration level for these elements. Also, several sections of Part 4
of the report indicate that the stored water will be delivered to agricultural and urban customers. 6-3

Although the term "urban customers" is not defined in the report, in Part 4, page 4-10, Water Treatment,
the report indicates that all water delivered to urban area customers would have to be treated to meet 6-4
drinking waler standards. Page 5.4-38 describes water treatment considered although i does not indicate the intended user of such treated water. Treatment to meet "drinking water standards" does not asure safe drinking water when the water source is wastewater.

The Draft EIR did not adequately address the actual and potential negative impacts of the proposed project on the local drinking water supply systems. The "urban customers" and the intended users of the treated water on Part 4 need to be defined.. Additionally, there are several water supply systems in the 6-5
vicinity of the proposed subsurface storage area. The Department is extremely concerned with the
proposed injection of recycled wastewater for aquifer storage because of potential degradation of the

AR 02101
Salinas Valley Water Projecr 2-120 Response to CommEnss Un IMe EIR/EIS

groundwater quality in the affected basin. The applicant is advised to refer to the Department's draft Groundwater Recharge Reuse Regulations, dated April 23, 2001, as a guideline for understanding the Department's concerns. Additionally, Section 13540 of the California Water Code also requires that the 6-5
Department of Health Services makes a finding of the proposed project will not impair the quality of water in the receiving aquifer as a source of water supply for domestic (cont'd)
purposes.

In order to ensure public health protection of the local domestic water users, the Department strongly recommends that the cumulative impacts of the proposed recycled water injection on the existing and 6-6
potential drinking water sources in the groundwater basin must be comprehensively addressed in the Final EIR. Additionally, we request that the Final EIR specifically addresses the following issues:

1. The report must define the project area and its vicinity. In this regard the term "vicinity" is defined as the area or a distance beyond which there will be no impact on the groundwater in the 6-7

affected basin at ANY future time. This may exceed the 500-foot non-potable buffer area discussed on page. 5.4-29, Water Quality Implication section of the report..
2. The report must identify ALL drinking water supply sources inside the project area, as well as those that are in the vicinity of the project area. The identification must be in form of listing, 6-8
also, illustration on a map of proper scale so that each source is recognizable.

3. The report must comprehensively address the actual and potential impacts of the subsurface stored treated wastewäter on the groundwater basin. The investigation of the potential impacts 6-9
must not only cover the 400 deep aquifer but, also, all other aquifers in the project area and its
vicinity.
It is also recommended that all communities, i.e., those defined in Item 2 above, whose drinking water 6-10
maybe potentially impacted by the proposed project, are informed of the project and that they have the opportunity to provide their input to the project proponent. :

In summary, the Department has serious concerns about the proposed subsurface storage of treated 6-11
wastewater portion of the project presented in Alternative B. If the proponent of the project plans to pursue Alternative B, including the subsurface storage, the Department recommends further study to determine the full impact of the storage on the local drinking water supplies.
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the EIR report. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please call mè at (831) 655-6933.

6-1 This comment summarizes conclusions in the Draft EIR/EIS regarding water quality impacts from the subsurface storage component of Alternative B. It should be noted that Alternative B is not the preferred alternative. No other response is necessary because no specific environmental issues are raised. Please see responses to Comments 6-2 through 6-11 below for discussion of specific issues raised by the
commenter.

6-2 Nitrate was used as a focus for groundwater constituents in the Draft EIR/EIS water quality analysis because it is conservative, meaning it does not change with time (it does not degrade and will remain) or travel through soil column. All other constituents in the groundwater are either conservative, like nitrate, or will degrade over time, such that their concentrations will be reduced. Testing of the recycled water and the groundwater in the project area has shown that only these two constituent categories are present. Because nitrate is considered a conservative constituent, it was used in the modeling to describe how other conservative constituents would behave in the aquifer as a "worst-case" condition.
Modeling results do indicate that three constituents -total dissolved solids (TDS), manganese, and iron-in the recycled water extracted from the (6,000-foot by 6,000- foot area) injection area would exceed the U.S. Environmental Projection Agency (USEPA) secondary drinking water regulations. However, the secondary standards refer to parameters that may adversely affect the aesthetic qualities of drinking water, such as taste, color, and odor. These standards are not established in response to health effects. Further, as described on Draft EIR/EIS page 5.4-32, under this alternative, the injected water would be extracted and used for agricultural irrigation
only, and not for drinking water. Potable reuse of recycled water has not been

6-3 contemplated as part of this project. See also response to Comment 6-4.

For the purposes of the Draft EIR/EIS, the term "urban customers" is defined as
those water users served by local municipalities. As stated on page 4-10 of the Draft
EIR/EIS, all water delivered to urban customers under Alternative B would have to
be treated to meet drinking water standards established by the California Department
of Health Services and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Urban
areas could include Castroville, Marina, Fort Ord and Salinas.

6-4 The water treatment described on the page referenced by the commenter (page 5.4- 38) would consist of treatment of water diverted from the Salinas River and stored in the surface facilities under Alternative B. This water supply would not contain any 02103

tecycled wastewater. To clarify this issue, the first sentence on Draft EIR/EIS page 5.4-38 is hereby changed as follows:
"Alternative B would include the proposed development of a water treatment plant to treat agricultural or urban-watet-supplies-water diverted from the Salinas River and stored in surface facilities, which would be
used to supply agricultural or urban users.
This change is also added to Chapter 3.0 of this document.
Recycled water stored in the aquifer would be for agricultural (non-potable) use only. Recycled water would not be supplied for urban or domestic use, such as drinking water. All existing pumping for domestic uses with the impact and buffer areas of the subsurface recycled water storage area would be replaced by a potable water system operated by the MCWRA. That system would provide groundwater pumped from outside the area of re-designation (described on page 5.4-32) to the existing customers within the re-designated area. It is estimated that approximately five

6-5 existing domestic users are located within the area of re-designation.
The definition of urban customers is provided in response to Comment 6-3. The lead agencies recognize that numerous additional steps would need to be taken to ensure that the subsurface-storage component of Alternative B, if it were to be selected, would function as described and intended. These steps include additional field studies, pilot studies, and modeling to ensure proper and reliable design of this component should it be selected as the preferred storage option for MCWRP excess
flows. See pages 5.4-32 and 5.4-36 of the Draft EIR/EIS for a description of some of the additional studies, testing, design, monitoring, and contingencies contemplated by the MCWRA to ensure that potential impacts on groundwater would be minimized or avoided if this component were to be implemented. Given the
uncertainties regarding the operation of this component, the Draft EIR/EIS identifies subsurface-storage impacts on water quality as potentially significant and unavoidable.

The SWRCB and other commenters raised several other questions concerning the analysis of effects of this component in the 1998 draft EIR, including long-term feasibility, maintenance costs, and modeling accuracy. In recognition of these concerns, the MCWRA subsequently presented Alternative A as the preferred project. Given that Alternative A is now the preferred project and Alternative B, which includes this component, is not, the MCWRA does not currently propose any additional study of this alternative and does not anticipate needing to acquire Department of Health Services (DHS) finding regarding the water quality associated with the subsurface storage component of Alternative B.

6-6 Cumulative impacts of the proposed action and alternatives were analyzed in Section 6 of the Draft EIR/EIS. The level of analysis in the document is sufficient to demonstrate the relative differences in impacts between this alternative and the proposed action (Alternative A). Because Alternative B is no longer being pursued 02104

Salinas Valley Water Project E

2-123 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

by MCWRA, no further analysis of cumulative impacts related to this alternative is required. See also response to Comment 6-6.

6-7 The operation of the subsurface storage facility proposed under Alternative B could create a public health concern by degrading existing potable water supplies in the vicinity of the area of contamination. This degradation would theoretically be contained within the area designated for injection and extraction purposes, including a proposed 500-foot buffer area (approximately 1,125 acres) as shown on Figure 5.4- 3 of the Draft EIR/EIS. It is not known whether the degraded area would migrate beyond this confined area and render other areas non-potable. However, because Alternative B is no longer being pursued as the preferred alternative, MCWRA does not currently propose any additional study of this alternative. Please see response to Comment 6-5.

6-10 The Draft EIR/EIS was distributed for public and agency review on June 8, 2001, and the public review period ended on August 28, 2001. The document was sent to officials of all agencies who might receive project water, including water from Alternative B. Additionally, the public was notified of the availability of the Draft EIR/EIS through newspaper notices and publication of a notice of availability in the Federal Register. During this period, all members of the public were given the opportunity to provide input Comment 6-6. to the MCWRA and the USACE. See also response to

7-1 A portion of the 220 acres of agricultural/open space land that would be inundated at the Merritt Lake surface storage site under Alternative B is currently under a Williamson Act contract. If implemented, Alternative B would result in the cancellation of Williamson Act contracts, Section 5.1 of the Draft EIR/EIS includes
a discussion of potential impacts of the proposed project and alternatives related to
the conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, and a significant unavoidable impact has been identified for Alternative B due to the conversion of agricultural land at the proposed Merritt Lake surface storage site and the WTP site. The fact that some of this land is under Williamson Act contract reinforces the
significance of this impact. It should also be noted that Alternative B is no longer being considered as the preferred alternative, and the development of the Merritt Lake surface storage site is not currently proposed.

7-2 Under Alternative A, the proposed action would convert approximately 0.1 acre of designated Farmland to non-agricultural uses for construction of diversion facilities and this land is not covered under a Williamson Act contract. Therefore, no effect on Williamson Act contract lands and no nearby properties under contract would be

Dear Mr. Meyer:
STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (SWRCB) COMMENTS ON
MONTEREY COUNTY WATER RESOURCES AGENCY'S (MCWRA) DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT/ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT (Draft
EIR/EIS)

SWRCB staff has reviewed the Draft EIR/EIS for the Salinas Valley Water Project. The preferred alternative identified in the Draft EIR/EIS includes 1) modification of the Nacimiento
Reservoir spillway, 2) reoperation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, 3) rediversion of the stored water at a point lower on the Salinas River, 4) blending the river water with water from the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) and delivery of this water to agricultural lands overlying the area of seawater intrusion, and 5) limiting groundwater pumping in the area served by the blended water delivery system. According to the Draft EIR/EIS, implementation of the preferred alternative will meet the objectives of 1) stopping seawater intrusion, 2) meeting current and future water resource needs, and 3) improving the hydrologic
balance of the Salinas Valley groundwater basin.

General Comments

Previously, in October 1998, MCWRA released a Draft Master EIR (Draft EIR) and Project Plan
for the Salinas Valley Water Project. At that time, MCWRA considered both surface and
subsurface storage for off-season flows from the MCWRP. However, the current Draft FIR/EIS only considers surface storage for water diverted from the Salinas River, and subsurface storage for off-season flows from the MCWRP, The Draft EIR/EIS notes that comments by the SWRCB on the previous Draf BIR were critical of the proposal to abandon designated beneficial uses of 8-I
the aquifer at the proposed subsurface storage site. The current Draf EIR/EIS still includes an
evaluation of the proposed subsurface storage of flows from the MCWRP, but does not provide
an explanation of why the proposal for surface storage of the MCWRP flows is no longer being considered.

Computer simulation of the effects of implementing the preferred alternative indicates that seawater intrusion can be stopped without utilizing the off-season flows from the MCWRP. However, because the performance of the system may differ significantly from the computer
simulations, additional phases of project implementation may be necessary to stop seawater
intrusion.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-129 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Mr. Bob Meyer 2 AUG 2 8 2001

As the project proceeds and more monitoring data becomes available, it will be easier to judge the success of the Salinas Valley Water Project. At that time it may become necessary to implement additional control measures including the use of off-season flows from the MCWRP. 8-2

We urge the MCWRA to closely monitor the progress of project implementation and, if necessary, pursue development of storage capabilities to ensure the maximum beneficial use of
this important resource.
In addition to any other permits and approvals that may be necessary to implement the preferred alternative, MCWRA must petition the SWRCB to add the proposed surface diversion facility as 8-3
point of rediversion to its existing water right permit. Also, depending upon the operation
under the preferred alternative, an additional permit for direct diversion may be required.
The EIR notes (5.6-87) that the surface diversion facility may have a significant impact on migrating juvenile steelhead. To mitigate for this potential impact, the EIR proposes monitoring program, developed in coordination with the Department of Fish and Game and the National Marine Fisheries Service, to determine if the effect is attributable to the surface diversion or the impoundment. If the monitoring shows that there is an incremental loss of steelhead, then actions elsewhere in the watershed will be considered to offset the losses. The actions would likely include channel modifications in the Aroyo Seco watershed to improve access to suitable spawning and rearing habitat. 8-4

This mitigation measure is adequate for the purposes of this EIR. However, the original construction of Nacimiento Reservoir permanently blocked a significant amount of steelhead habitat and has contributed to the long-term decline of steelhead in the Salinas River. The SWRCB has continuing jurisdiction over water rights in California and has a duty to protect public trust resources when feasible. The SWRCB could consider requiring modifications in the Aroyo Seco watershed as a condition of approval for a petition to add the surface diversion facility as a point of rediversion.
If you have any questions, please contact Tom Peltier at (916) 341-5353, or Paul Murphey at

State Water Resources Control Board
Division of Water Rights Edward C. Anton, Chief August 28, 2001

8-1 Numerous potentially significant environmental issues (e.g., impacts related to biological resources, cultural resources, land uses, air quality, and other issues) and
substantial costs are likely to be associated with the construction of surface storage
for off-season flows from the MCWRP. Because the MCWRA's project objectives can be met by the SVWP without this component, it has not been included in
Alternative A, the environmentally preferred alternative.

8-2 The MCWRA recognizes the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of project performance in an effort to facilitate the attainment of project objectives. The proposed action includes preferred monitoring program, which is described in Section 3.2.7 of the Draft EIR/EIS. The Draft EIR/EIS states that "the monitoring program would become an important tool for use in the future refinement of project operations," which may include the development of additional facilities such as an expanded distribution system and delivery area. If needed, MCWRA would continue to investigate opportunities to store off-season flows from the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects for use during times when stored water can be used.

8-3 The commenter notes that the MCWRA must petition the SWRCB to add the proposed surface diversion facility as a point of rediversion to its existing water right permit and that an additional permit for direct diversion may be required. The
MCWRA would secure all required permits, including SWRCB permits, prior to implementation of the proposed action. The EIR/EIS is intended to provide the environmental information needed for SWRCB actions, and the approval of the point of diversion is listed on page 1-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS as one of the actions
the document is intended to address.

8-4 The commenter notes that the mitigation proposed for potential impacts to steelhead is adequate for the purposes of the Draft EIR/EIS. This mitigation consists of monitoring, with subsequent actions if needed, potentially including
channel modifications in the Arroyo Seco watershed, if the project is found to have
an incremental effect on steelhead. The commenter also notes, however, that the
SWRCB may require modifications in the Arroyo Seco watershed as a condition of approval of the MCWRA petition to add a point of rediversion to its water right permit. The SWRCB position regarding this issue is acknowledged. Given that the commenter feels that the analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS is sufficient, no other
response is needed.

Dear Mr. Meyer:

SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT, DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT, SCH# 2000034007

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Salinas Valley Water Project. The preferred alternative
identified in the Draft EIR/EIS includes Nacimiento Reservoir spillway modification, re-operation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, water delivery via the Salinas River, placement of a pneumatic dam in the Salinas River to store the water near the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) pipeline, blending river and MCWRP water, water delivery to agricultural lands overlying the seawater intrusion area, and limiting groundwater pumping in the arca served by the blended water delivery system. According to the Draft EIR/EIS, implementation of the preferred alternative will meet the objectives of stopping seawater intrusion, meeting current and future water resource needs, and improving the hydrologic balance of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin.
The Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board Staff (Regional Board staff) recognize that seawater intrusion is a serious threat to water quality. Overall, we believe that preferred Alternative A is the superior option for halting seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. Regional 9-1

Board Staff have reviewed the subject Draft EIR and offer the following comments and questions:

Section 1.3, Table 1.2 (p.1-7) Estimated Existing and Future Water Conditions.
Assuming that average annual rate of Basin overdraft is less in 2030 than in 1995, why is seawater intrusion rate expected to be greater in 2030 than in 1995? Please elaborate on this issue. 9-2

Section 1.3, p.1-9, p.2
"…If seawater intrusion continues into the future due to increased demands in the coastal urban areas, an
expanded distribution system might be needed to deliver Salinas River Water to areas outside of the CSIP
area." 9-3
If an expanded distribution system is needed to mitigate continued seawater intrusion, is there sufficient
water in Lake Nacimiento, San Antonio and the Salinas River to feed the system? Has there been coordination with the Monterey County Planning Department to include these future increased demands in their General Plan update?

Section 2.2.1, item # 2, Re-operation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, p.2-2
"...San Antonio Reservoir will also be re-operated to store more water in the wet season and release it
during the irrigation season." 9-4
It is not clear how San Antonio Reservoir be "re-operated" to store more water without a spillway modification similar to the proposed Nacimiento spillway modification. Could the re-operation of the San Antonio Reservoir lead to increase in flooding potential downstream? Please clarify.

Section 2.2.1, item #3, Surface Diversion/Impoundment, p.2-2

Has the potential for sediment accumulation behind the seasonal diversion structure been addressed? If 9-5
so, what is the plan?

Section 2.2.2, item #5, Recycled Water Storage and Delivery, p.2-4
"..Under alternative B..An estimated 1,125-acre area, including the injection wells and a buffer, would be re-designated as non-potable in the RWQCB basin plan."
The Central Coast Regional Board's Basin Plan specifies that groundwater throughout the Region, except for that found in the Soda Lake sub-basin, is suitable for agricultural, municipal, and domestic water supply (i.e., existing beneficial uses are AGR, MUN, and IND). These beneficial uses are designated for 9-6
the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. Federal Regulations [40 CFR 131.10(h)(2)] does not allow States to remove designated beneficial uses, except under specific conditions. Modification of beneficial uses established in the Basin Plan would require. public hearings by the Regional Board and must consider Federal regulations, as well as public input and other factors. We recognize halting seawater intrusion is very important, but point out that changing the existing beneficial uses in a portion of the groundwater
basin (to non-potable) may be difficult.

Regional Water Board Permits for Proposed Projects

Currently, construction that disturbs more than five acres must prepare a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, which is required as part of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Construction Permit (Construction Permit). In March 2003, sites that disturb more 9-7
than one acre will require the permit. To fulfill NPDES regulations, the site owner should file a Notice of Intent for inclusion in the Construction Permit with the State Water Resources Control Board prior to
initiating construction.
The Regional Board must certify that any permit issued by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act complies with state and federal water quality standards. Section 401 9-8

Water Quality permit is necessary for all Section 404 permits, including reporting and non-reporting Nationwide permits. This office will review section 401 applications after the Section 404 permit process has begun.
Total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocations will be developed for impaired surface waters in the Salinas River Basin. TMDL documents will allocate responsibility for constituent loading throughout the watershed. Draft TMDL documents are anticipated by the spring of 2002 for Mercury in-Lake Nacimiento and Las Tablas Creek. TMDL documents for siltation, nutrients, pesticides and salinity are scheduled for 9-9
the Salinas River. During development of the TMDL source assessment and implementation plan, if Regional Board staff find constituent contributions from waste discharged may adversely impact beneficial uses or exceed water quality objectives, TMDL documents may require changes in Regional

Board permits and actions. Existing permits may provisions and recommendations. require modification to implement applicable TMDL (contd)
Currently, your agency is responsible for administering the Salinas River Channel Maintenance Program, a five-year Regional Army Corp 404 permit. The Regional General Permit goal is to reduce Salinas River flooding by dredging to control sandbars and vegetative growth. A major stipulation of the 9-10
Regional General permit is that all work will be in the dry or non-flowing channel. Will water be held back at the dam, as is currently the case, to allow the riverbed to dry before maintenance activities commence? Will maintenance activities cease or be modified? Please clarify.
This concludes comments from Regional Board staff on the draft environmental impact report. We may have more specific comments in the future as the project develops. If you have any questions please contact Amanda Bern at (805) 594-6197, Angus Lewis at -(805) 549-3691 or Eric Gobler at (805) 549- 3467.

LETTER 9

California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), Central Coast Region Robert W. Briggs, Executive Officer
August 30, 2001

9-1 It is noted that the RWQCB (Central Coast Region) considers Alternative A as the
superior option for halting seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. No further response is necessary as no specific environmental issues are
raised.

9-2 As noted in Section 3.2.4, overall (agricultural and urban) water demand in the entire Basin is anticipated to decline by 17,000 acre-feet per year (AFY) by 2030, but total urban needs are projected to increase from 45,000 AFY in 1995 to 85,000 AFY based on projected growth. A large part of this growth is expected to occur in the
northern end of the valley (especially Salinas), where seawater intrusion is a problem, Overall demand in the northern end of the valley is expected to be greater in 2030 than it is today. For this reason, seawater intrusion is expected to be greater in 2030 than in 1995 under "no project" conditions.

9-3 See pages 5.3-41 through 5.3-62 in Section 5.3 of the Draft EIR/EIS for discussion of hydrology, reservoir levels, groundwater elevations, and seawater intrusion under
the different project alternatives under projected future demand conditions. As
shown in this discussion, the project modeling indicates that there would be
sufficient water in the reservoirs and the Salinas River to meet demand, in
combination with anticipated deliveries of recycled water from the MCWRP. See also response to comment 3-9.
Future land use demand (urban growth) was estimated using Association of Monterey Bay Area Government (AMBAG) forecasts of future population estimates,
as modified through consultation with Monterey County, the County Local Agency
Formation Commission, and the cities in the valley, is presented in Section 7 of the
Draft EIR/EIS. This information represents a forecast of potential future population from which future water demand was estimated, and variety of economic, social, political, and environmental factors will influence whether it accurately depicts future population totals. The Draft EIR/EIS was provided to Monterey County Planning Department; and discloses the information requested by the commenter.

9-4 MCWRA operates Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs jointly. The operation and management of the two reservoirs are coordinated, such that change in operation in Nacimiento Reservoir would translate into changes at San Antonio
Reservoir. Therefore, releases from San Antonio Reservoir will be modified for
consistency with the reoperation of Nacimiento Reservoir. Without physical changes in San Antonio Reservoir, the amount, frequency, and schedule of releases from the 94420

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-135 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

reservoir will be achieved in coordination with modifications to Nacimiento
operations. The reoperation of the San Antonio Reservoir would not lead to an
increase in potential flooding downstream. Additional explanation is presented on
pages 5.3-12 through 5.3-16 of the Draft EIR/EIS.

9-5 It is anticipated that there will be some deposition of transported riverbed materials behind the dam and within the backwater inundation area during the diversion operation period. The anticipated period of diversion is during the irrigation season, and diversion is not expected to occur during the non-irrigation season, and
particularly not during the period of time when increased levels of turbidity are present in flood flows in the Salinas River.
The operation of the inflatable diversion dam from the fully inflated position to a deflated position at the end of each irrigation season will allow for a gradual return to
non-diversion conditions, thus minimizing the water quality impacts of accumulated
sediment anticipated while the dam is inflated. This will be accomplished by: 1)
constructing the diversion structure at an elevation equivalent to that of the river channel such that when the dam is deflated the lagoon is open to the ocean, and 2) controlling the gradual deflation rate of the diversión dam structure to a rate that minimizes the "flushing," or creation of a sudden surge of sediments. Any in-
channel work would be done during occasions when there is little or no flow in the
river. Spoil material displaced during maintenance activities such as fish ladder cleaning and removal of sediment accumulated upstream of the inflatable dam would have to be disposed of outside of the floodplain.

9-6 It is noted that changing the designated beneficial uses of water in the approved Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) Basin. Plan may be difficult and would require public hearings and consideration of federal regulations and other factors. As stated previously, because Alternative B is no longer being pursued as
the preferred alternative. As there are no specific comments on the environmental conclusions of the Draft EIR/EIS, no other response is warranted.

9-7 Before initiating any project construction activities, the MCWRA will file with the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) a notice of intent to comply with the terms of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) General Construction Permit, including preparation of the required Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan.

9-8 It is noted that the RWQCB must certify that any permit issued by USACE pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) complies with State and Federal water quality standards, in accordance with CWA Section 401. Such certification would be sought prior to any issuance of a Section 404 permit.

9-9 It is noted that total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocations will be developed for the Salinas River Basin and that TMDL documents may require that existing permits
be modified to implement applicable TMDL provisions and recommendations. The MCWRA will work with the RWQCB regarding any changes to permits or activities and will adhere to all future permit modifications as required by the TMDL process. LIIZO

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-136 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

MCWRA has already begun to develop "watershed approach" solutions, such as best management practices, in anticipation of upcoming TMDL listings. This does not alter the conclusions expressed in the Draft EIR/EIR.

9-10 MCWRA intends to continue to manage the subject channel maintenance program, but the program would be modified, as described on page 6-2 of the Draft EIR/EIS.
The commenter is referred to that discussion. In short, the flows from Nacimiento
and San Antonio reservoirs would be programmed to maximize recharge diversion,
and fish flows.

Reservoir releases would not be modified expressly for channel maintenance. However, channel maintenance would continue under the current program through vegetation removal outside the wet channel, toward the end of the irrigation season,
and during droughts when there is no water in the channel.

RE: Notice of Preparation for Salinas Valley Water Project Joint EIR/EIS
Dear Mr. Weeks:
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Notice of Preparation for the Salinas Valley Water Project Joint EIR/EIS. As San Luis Obispo (SLO) County has stated in the past, the proposal to improve the spillway and reoperate the reservoir at Lake Nacimiento could benefit both counties as a result of retaining more water in the lake and being able to utilize that water more efficiently. However, as we noted in our comments on your agency's 1998 Draf EIR, additional information or clarifications are needed in several issue areas, which will be reiterated
in this letter.

The two physical components of the project that would affect Lake Nacimiento, and thus, SLO County's interest in the proposed project, include:

a. b. Modification to the Nacimiento spillway; and, Reoperation of Nacimiento reservoir.
SLO County's focus in reviewing the Joint EIR/EIR will be to assure: 1) that the allocation of 17,500 AFY of water to serve water purveyors in this County per a 1959 agreement with Monterey County, has been acknowledged in the various analyses; 2) that impacts to the recreational aspects to the lake have been properly reviewed, given the importance of Lake Nacimiento to recreational interests in our County; and, 3) that traffic concerns on Lake Nacimiento Drive during construction have been addressed.
The comments that our county made on the 1998 Draft EIR are attached (dated December 15, 1998). Although Attachment A is a list of detailed, technical comments on the 1998 Draft EIR, the comments will still apply in our review of the Joint EIR/EIS. A summary of the comments
include:

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-138 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1. The Joint EIR/EIS needs to provide detailed information about lake level impacts resulting from the proposed project. The 1998 DEIR discusses lake level impacts resulting from reoperation as "changes in average monthly surface elevations.' The document needs to depict actual and theoretical lake levels with and without the project throughout the study period (1949-1994). Without that data, it is not possible to state how the project may affect SLO County's allocation reliability. Of most importance, is if the proposed reoperation results in longer periods of sustained minimum pool, then SLO County's allocation releases during drought periods may be compromised. The specific information is also required to provide: clear picture of what the impacts would be to the recreational use of the lake, which as discussed in the attachment, were minimized in the previous EIR. MCWRA is requested to clarify the project description by including the proposed release schedule in the Joint EIR/EIS. (See pages 2-5 of Attachment A).

2. The Joint EIR/EIS should discuss construction impacts associated with the spillway modifications. While the first project description stated that lake drawdown would not be necessary, it was silent on the anticipated construction method, which could impact SLO County's proposed intake structure and the water quality of the Nacimiento Water Project (NWP), depending on the timing of the proposed project. (See pages 1-2 of Attachment A).•

3. The Joint EIR/EIS needs to include a statement early in the document confirming that the
following issue areas include the cumulative effects of SLO County's allocation of 17,500 AFY of water: Hydrology and Flooding, Water Quality and Public Health, both Biology sections (as applicable), Visual Resources, and Recreation, and applicable altematives. It is imperative that the Joint EIR/EIS include the 17,500 AFY when analyzing the following: baseline conditions, proposed project, cumulative project, and no project altemative, because San Luis Obispo County's allocation is an existing
condition for your project. (See page 5 of Attachment A).

4. The Joint EIR/EIS should address the County Engineering Department's request for clarifications and additional mitigation concerning construction-related traffic impacts on Lake Nacimiento Drive. (See memorandum from Richard Marshall in Attachment A).
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Notice of Preparation. If you have any questions or need more information about the Nacimiento Water Project, please contact Mr. George Gibson in the County Engineering Department at 805/781-5252, or Ms. Nancy Rollman in the County Planning Department at 805/781-5008.

SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY
COMMENTS ON SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT (SVWP) DRAFT EIR

4, DECEMBER 15, 1998

The following comments are made on bebalf of San Luis Obispo County on the Salinas Valley Water Project Draft Environmental Impact. Report (DEIR). The comments are presented in the same order as the chapters and sections are found in the DEIR:

INTRODUCTION
REQUIRED APPROVALS
Please note that because the project is proposing to close Lake Nacimiento Drive at certain intervals during construction, an encroachment permit governing the circumstances under which the road may be closed, may be required from the San Luis Obispo County Engineering Department.

CHAPTER 3
PROJECT DESCRIPTION In various sections of the SVWP EIR the statement that, "modification of the existing spillway at Nacimiento Reservoir would require that tbe concrete ogee spillway crest be lowered approximately 8 feet, from elevation 800 to 792" (päge 3-19). The assumption is that, "construction would take approximately 12 months. The major part of the work would be completed during the August-November time period when the reservoir is at its lowest levels: therefore additional drawdown would not be necéssary." (page 4.5-21). Please clarify the assumption contained in the above project description by stating what the mnaximum lake level could be while still allowing construction of proposed spillway modifications at Nacimiento Dam. What conditions would the MCWRA place on the
contractor to assure that spillway modifications would be constructed within a four month
construction period, or from August to November, as specified? How would MCWRA assure that no additional drawdowns of Lake Nacimiento would be necessary to accommodate construction?

The DEIR does not describe the construction metbod for the spillway modifications and fails to document anticipated construction impacts. For example, will construction CZIZO

activities stir up sediments and pose a turbidity problem, either within the lake, or downstream? If so, over what time period would this occur? What is the anticipated start-up year for construction? Also, it is stated that a dewatering permit would be required (page 4.5-23) but the project description provides no details about what area(s) would need to be dewatered.

The SVWP EIR appears to support a conjunctive use approach which would use surface water supplies in wet years (preserving groundwater supplies) and rely on groundwater supplies during periods of sustained drought (page 3-39). How Lake Nacimiento would be operated under periods of sustained drought was of paramount importance in the San
Luis Obispo County Nacimiento Water Project (NWP) Draft EIR In fact, the major issue of significance in the NWP EIR was the cumulative impact of the San Luis Obispo Flood Control and Water Conservation Distriet's (SLOFCWCD) annual allotment during a sustained period of drought. The model prepared for the NWP EIR indicated that MCWRA bistoric operational release schedule plus the SLOFCWCD entitlement would bring the lake to minimum pool more quickly and would extend the time for replenishment. Please provide an operational release schedule in the project description. Please describe how the operational schedule supports the SVWP EIR statement that, "diversion would take place during normal and above normal water years, and would be reduced during below normal and dry years" (page 4.3-31). Also, provide further explanation and details about what condition would trigger a reduction in water released from Lake Nacimiento reservoir for future diversions. MCWRA's proposed release schedule is critical for SLOFCWCD to be able to assess reliability of its 17,500 AFY allocation. As discussed later in these comments, this information also is critical to more clearly understand lake level impacts that may affect recreational uses.
The EIR should discuss operational aspects of the project during "sustained drought". The SVWP EIR should provide additional, detailed information on how the SVWP project would be operated when Jake levels of 748° are reached, since that is a reasonable definition of drought as it pertains to this reservoir, based on the existing California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) agreement. If this information is contained in
separate report (Salinas Valley Integrated Ground and Surface Water Model [SVIGSM] Update: Final Report), it should be summarized and included in the body of the EIR
The amount of additional yield varies throughout the document and the backup materials. The DEIR states that "the proposed reoperation would provide up to 22,600 AFY" (page 3-22). Appendix A Task 2 Technical Memorandum dated September 17, 1998 states that additional yield resulting from the spillway modifications are estimated to be 35,000 AFY. The Draft Project Plan Report dated October 1998 states that the reservoir reoperations will "increase the annual average yield of the two reservoirs by approximately 25,500 AFY." Which figure is correct and in addition, which EZIZO
reopcration/yield figure was used in the hydrologic and visual evaluations of the DEIR? 5 Please confirm that for whatever the additional yield figure is, it is independent of the

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-142 Response to Comments On the EIR/EIS

SVWP EIR Comments
Page 3 December 15, 1998

SLOFCWCD allocation of 17,500 AFY.

CHAPTER 4
HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING
Figures 4.3-15 and 16 (page 4.3-21) indicate that with implementation of the proposed project, beneficial impacts to basin ground water and seawater intrusion would occur. Please confirm that this includes the SLOFCWCD allocation of 17,500 AFY. The DEIR
should include a statement a that potential cumulative impacts to seawater intrusion would
not occur, if the SVWP project is implemented, if that is the case.
Page 4.3-14 states that releases from Lake Nacimiento would "result in up to nearly 4,000 AF per month of higher total releases observed for the March through August period." Page 4.3-31 states that summertime storage in Lake Nacimiento would be lower, by as
much as 10,000 AF. These numbers are not consistent unless you define "summertime" as being 2.5 months. Please clarify.

RECREATION
The SVWP EIR states on page 4.9-1 that the Nacimiento reservoir was originally designed and is currently operated as a flood control and water conservation facility, providing a secondary benefit as a recreational facility. San Luis. Obispo County agrees with that characterization and included a similar description in the NWP EIR. Nonetheless, even as a secondary benefit, the recreational value of Lake Nacimiento is important to San Luis Obispo County and in that light, as the comments below will expound upon, it appears that potential changes to lake levels, which result in direct physical impacts to recreation, may have been minimized in the SVWP EIR
Page 4.9-12 of the DEIR states that, "For recreational activities, a widely accepted threshold is 730 feet as minimum elevation, below which recreational opportunities can
be substantially reduced...," requires justification. Please define "widely accepted" and include a copy of the Pete Soderberg letter (in response to the NOP) in the appendices. The NWP EIR documented that once lake levels reach 730-feet, significant impacts to recreational values would have already occwred. The SVWP. DEIR should include a
graphic figure showing the areas affected by lake level fluctuations at the approximate 730' level, so that the area which would become dry lake bed can be illustrated to the public. A copy of a figure provided by Monterey County Parks Department shows Lake Nacimicato under 740-720' conditions (attached Exhibit 1). At that point, the entire Las Tablas Creek is closed off and what is left of the lake is divided in half. The NWP EIR included a table entitled Lake Nacimiento Water Surface* Elevations at which Boat Docks Can No Longer Function" (attached Exhibit 2) which shows that impacts can be observed at the 760-foot elevation, ie, the use of boat launches is impaired, and that the
Heritage Ranch dock cannot be used below a 735-foot elevation. Clearly, physical impacts PGIZ0 to lake levels are occuring at higher elevations than 730 feet. It would also be appropriate to include a chart similar to the attached Exhibit 3 which shows what is occuring at E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-143 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

SVWP EIR Comments
Page 4 December 15, 1998
various elevations in the reservoir, to provide a frame of reference for the public.
The NWP a EIR used a significance threshold of 748-feet in the level of Lake Nacimiento
to evaluate when potentially significant impacts may occur to recreation (determined by a reasonable worse-case definition of drought based on the Fish and Game agreement). The use of two different thresholds a (730' versus 748") is a major inconsistency between the two EIRs which should be addressed. Although not required by law, both documents should be consistent in their treatment of impacts and mitigation measures. The letter
prepared by Joe Madruga on behalf of the Operations & Maintenance Division of the MCWRA stated that, "the Agency is in strong agreement with the proposed mitigation measure that water conservation measures be imposed when the lake level reaches 748-
feet." (contained as Attachment A to Monterey County Board of Supervisors Comment • Letter on the NWP EIR, dated October 14, 1997). If the MCWRA maintains a position that participants in the NWP water project should adopt mandatory water conservation measures when levels at Lake Nacimiento reach 748 feet (or some other appropriate level), then the SVWP should adher to similar mandatory conservation measures.
Regardless of what thresbold is deemed to be reasonable under CEQA, whether it is 760, 748, or 730, the SWVP EIR a should contain a graph or a spreadsheet that depicts the actual and theoretical lake levels with and without the proposed project throughout some historical study period, so that the public can see the lake level impacts resulting from the reoperation during normal rainfall years as well as dry and drought years. Attached Exhibit 4 shows Appendix D in the NWP EIR which provided this information (for 16 ½ year period) in the first three columns for the NWP. The other columns can be used to then illustrate certain conditions at different specific threshold levels. Also attached as Exhibit 5 is a figure from the NWP EIR which grapbically shows the lake levels with and without the project for a similar time period. Referring to lake level impacts as "changes in average monthly surface elevations" is too broad and general, and given the lake geometry at below-730 foot levels, may not provide a realistic picture of projected impacts.

Please clarify if SLOFCWCD's allotment is included in the model discussed on page 4.9-
13, (last sentence) which states, "The model predicted that under the Phase 1 scenario,
Nacimiento Reservoir would have a surface elevation of 730 feet or higher for 105 days (70% of total days, which represents a reduction of 5 days or 3% from the baseline conditions." Similarly, please clarify whether the SLOFCWCD release schedule (Exhibit 6) is included in the future (2030) "No-Action" conditions and subsequent phases (Table 4.9-9).
On page 4.9-15, it states that an increase in below-730' lake levels would occur five GZIZO
additional days (from May 1 - September 30). How many additional days would occur during less-than-average rainfall year or a drought? Please relate the "five additional E
days" to Table 4.6-13, on page 4.6-38, (Fisberies Biology section) which indicates that

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-144 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

SVWP EIR Comments
December 15, 1998 Page 5
under Phase I, average monthly drought releases when Lake Nacimiento reaches ät or below 689' increase by 2% to 3% (a total of 17 months over a 37 year period).

TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION
Please refer to the attached memorandum from the County Engineering Department.

CUMULATIVE IMPACTS
Page 4.13-4 states in the Hydrology and Flooding section that the SVIGSM assumed that the 17,500 AFY will be diverted for use by San Luis Obispo County, and "the analyses contained in Chapter 4 of this EIR considers the curpulative effects of possible diversion of San Luis Obispo's 17,500 AFY of Nacimiento Reservoir water." Please confirm that the sections in Chapter 4 that considered cumulative' effects include Hydrology and Flooding, Water Quality and Public Health, both Biology sections (as applicable), Visual Resources, and Recreation. It is not obvious to be reader that this has occurred until Section 4.13 which is Cumulative Impacts. To put this anotber way, it is imperative that the SVWP EIR include the 17,500 AFY when analyzing the following: baseline
conditions, proposed project, curnulative project, and no project, because San Luis Obispo County's allocation is an existing condition for your project.

CHAPTER 7
ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROPOSED PROJECT In Section 7.5.1, No Project - No Action Alternative, in the Recreation discussion, the analysis does not appear to assume that the NWP would occur since the conclusion is, "no reservoir reoperation would occur and thus the significant project recreational impacts would be avoided." Even if the SVWP is not pursued, it is the intent of the SLOFCWCD to draw 17,500 AFY of water from Lake Nacimiento per the 1959 agreement with
MCWRA. SLOFCWCD's intent to draw water from Lake Nacimiento with or without
reoperation of the Lake should be discussed in the No Project - No Action Alternative
under Recreation.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Nancy Rollman, Environmental Specialist

FROM: Riehard Marshal, Development Seivices Engineer ?kM/
SUBJECT: Draft Environmental Impact Report - Salinas Valley Water Project
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the subject report. I have reviewed the document with the managers of several divisions of the Engineering Department, and this memo presents our consolidated response. The primary area of concern to this Department is that of construction traffic impacts on Nacimiento Lake Drive.

1. On page 4.10-12, the report states that construction-related traffic impacts are summarized in Appendix D. My review of Appendix D indicates that it is a summary of quantities of traffic, but does not evaluate the impacts of that traffic.

2. The main text of the report indicates a potential impact due to the need for closures of the road across the spilway. Figures are provided on the frequency and duration of these closures, as well as the magnitude of potential traffic backups. However, it is not clear how the figures were arrived at.

3. If we assume that the figures mentioned in #2 are correct, the proposed mitigation measure (limiting closures tonon-peak times and days, and limiting the number and duration of such closures), is probably sufficient. The key to the measure's success
will be the notification to area residents of planned closures. We are especially concerned about the fairly large community of Oak Shores, and would encourage the establishment of a direct communication link with the Community Association there as part of the mitigation measures.

4 Our department is very supportive of the proposed mitigation measure related to

roadway damage due to construction traffic. We suggest the addition of only one minor point, that transit mix trucks not be permitted to spill concrete on the roads, LTIZO

which is particularly a concemn on the steep grade on Nacimiento Lake Drive. E
Please call me at 781-5280 if you need additional information.

LETTER 11

Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District Janet Brennan, Supervising Planner, Planning and Air Monitoring Division June 22, 2001

11-1 The Draft EIR/EIS has been amended to reference the "2000 Air Quality Management Plan for the Monterey Bay Region." Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document for the text changes to the Draft EIR/EIS.

11-2 The Draft EIR/EIS has been amended to indicate the District's approach to address a project's cumulative impact on air quality. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document for text changes to the Draft EIR/EIS.

11-3 The editorial revision suggested by the commenter has been made. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document.

11-4 The Draft EIR/EIS has been amended to reference the most current District CEQA
guidelines for thresholds of significance. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this
document. In comparison to the recently adopted District thresholds, the overall conclusions associated with both short-term and long-term increases of regional criteria pollutants and precursors within the North Central Coast Air Basin, as presented in the Draft EIR/EIS, would not change.

11-5 The analysis of short-term emissions in the Draft EIR/EIS has been revised based on the comment that the District does not have a threshold of significance for CO.
Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document. Analysis of short-term emissions has
been revised to exclude, based on the recommendation of the District, comparison of short-term construction-generated emissions of CO to a significance threshold.
However, short-term emissions of PM-10 would still exceed the District's
recommended thresholds of significance. As a result, the overall conclusions associated with the analysis of this impact, as presented in the Draft EIR/EIS, would
not change. Short-term increases in air pollutants associated with Alternative B
would still be considered significant.

11-6 This comment is consistent with the conclusions in the Draft EIR/EIS. Please refer
to page 5.11-14 of the DEIR, Table 5.11-5.

11-7 This comment is noted; however, a health risk assessment cannot be prepared at this time because the specific types of equipment and operational parameters associated with any proposed stationary sources of emissions have not yet been identified. The mitigation measures incorporated into the Draft EIR/EIS require MCWRA to coordinate with the MBUAPCD to determine if any proposed point sources could emit toxic and/or carcinogenic chemicals at levels that exceed applicable thresholds. 02142

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-161 E
Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

If determined to be necessary, the MCWRA wil prepare a health risk assessment to determine the potential health risks associated with the proposed point sources. If unacceptable health risks are found (and this is not expected based on the type of project being considered) necessary, MCWRA will be required to modify the project design, as necessary, to ensure
thresholds. that resultant risk levels do not exceed applicable

Re: Distribution of Drat Environmental Impact Report/Environmental.Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Waler Project

•Dear Gentlemen:

This Committee is distressed that the EIR/EIS has been inadequately circulated to agencies and individuals who are interested in and who will be directly affected by the impacts portended by the Project.
The Committee notes that there is no list of distribution of the document included within the document. The fact that the document has only been distributed to agencies within Monterey County and more recently to the Library in Paso Robles is a gross injustice. The Committee believes that this discrepancy must be corrected immediately in order to allow affected San Luis Obispo county, cities, agencies and residents to comment upon the EIR/EIS.

Also, as a matter of courtesy and currency, the EIR/EIS should be sent to the U.S. Senators and Representatives as well as the State Senators and Representatives.
The most glaring omissions are the cities and individuals 10 whom we assume the EIR/EIS was not sent. Although the Committee is informed that the San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District has 12-1
received a copy, the Commitlee firmly believes that these additional agencies, and others should receive copies immediately since they have a vested interest in the Lake operation:

The City of Paso Robles
The City of Atascadero
The Templeton Community Services District The San Luis Obispo County Planning Department The San Luis Obispo County Water Advisory Committee The City of San Luis Obispo
The San Luis Tribune Tribune
The Paso Robles Gazette
Public Libraries in Paso Robles, Atascadero, Templeion and San Luis Obispo

AR 02144

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-163 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

:

All of these agencies and individuals have an interest in the operation the Lakes and should have and opportunity to review and comment on the EIR/EIS. Due to the lack of distribution and the review time, it is also felt that the time to submit written comments should be extended for one month.
It is also imperative that a public forwm be held in this County since the local residences may feel a major impact 12-1

if this project goes forward.
The Committee would appreciate confirmation from your offices that additional copies of the EIR/EIS will be provided to those agencies, official and individuals listed in this letter as well as the date, time and location of the local hearing.

Sincerely,
NOEFlo

June 28, 2001

12-1 The Draft EIR/EIS received a very broad distribution in both Monterey and San. Luis Obispo counties and went well beyond the requirements of CEQA and NEPA, with approximately 200 copies of the document distributed. In compliance with CEQA regulations, the Draft EIR/EIS was distributed to the California Office of Planning and Research (State Clearinghouse), which distributed the document to selected State agencies and it was distributed to individuals and agencies who had requested receipt of the document. Also, a notice was also published in the Federal Register pursuant to NEPA regulations and the document was distributed to the
EPA and other federal agencies. In addition, the Draft EIR/EIS was sent to the San
Luis Obispo County Planning Department (4 copies), the Paso Robles Library (4 copies), various homeowner associations around the Nacimiento Reservoir, the San Luis Obispo County Public Works Department (Hydrology Section) (3 copies), and the City of San Luis Obispo (Utilities Department) (1 copy). Informational meetings were held at the Salinas Valley Fairgrounds in King City on July 10, 2001 and in Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County) on July 30, 2001. A formal public hearing on the document was held at MCWRA's offices in the City of Salinas on August 1, 2001. Notices for the public hearing were published in July 2001 in the following newspapers: The Monterey County Herald, the Salinas Californian, the King City Rustler, and the North County Tribune. The public review period started June 8,
2001 and ended August 28, 2001 complying with all public review requirements.

RE: Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Chair Johnsen:

San Luis Obispo County recently received notice of the availability of the Draft EIR/EIS for the Salinas Valley Water Project. As you may know, our county is in the process of developing a water delivery project using our water allocation from Lake Naçimiento. A Draft EIR was circulated in 1997 and based on public review and comiment, changes were mäde to the proposed alignment. At this time a revised Draf EIR is under preparation. We point this out because the issues surrounding these water projects are both complex and interrejated. As-a result, San. Luis. Obispo. County residents bave expressed an interest in fully understanding how your proposal to construct spillwey improvements and re-operate, the reservoir may affect lake levels and, in turn, both our water 13-1 allocation and recreational resources.

In response to those citizen concerns, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors wishes to formally request thet a public hearing be scheduled in the Paso Robles area to receive local comments on the DEIR/EIS for your project. While we appreciate the efforts of your staff tó' schedule a July workshop in King City the Board feels strongly that a public hearing in San Luis Obispo County is also needed. The spillway improvements and proposed re-operation of the reservoir are simply too important to county residents not to allow them a local opportunity to present their comments.

FROM: Walter Wong, Director, Environmental Health Division Waut, 4/**6
SUBJECT: Draft Environmental Impact Report for Salinas Valley Water Project

Surface runoff water from active farmland used for extensive cattle grazing and crop growing will be collected and impounded. In addition, reservoir water used extensively for body-contact recreational activities by humans will be discharged into this same impoundment. All of this impounded water will be applied without further treatment to food crop growing fields, with over 50% of those fields utilizing sprinkler irrigation, as opposed to drip or other means of root- zone application. The potential for harmful microorganisms such as E. coli, giardia and cryptosporidia in this impounded water is significant. We should carefully evaluate the risk of
applying this water through sprinkler irrigation of food crops.
Further, this impounded water of questionable microbiological quality is proposed to be blended with recycled water from the CSIP Project, which has been applied to food crops over the last 14-1
three years. Continuous, extensive testing of recycled water produced by the MRWPCA has demonstrated that recycled water applied to food crops has continually met drinking water standards with regard to microbiological constituents. All involved agencies and growers utilizing this recycled water continue maximum efforts to ensure the safety of applying recycled water to the County's food crops. This is a very important and high-profile use of recycled water in Monterey County. It is proposed that impounded water of questionable microbiological quality be applied through the same pipeline as the recycled water, and ultimately on the same
sprinkler-irrigated crops.

It may be possible through sprinkler irrigation of the impounded runoff water to transfer such
organisms as E. coli, giardia and cryptosporidia directly to edible parts of food crops. This may be of concern in and of itself. However, such an incident would cause serious public distrust of
the use of the recycled water from the municipal sewage treatment plant and potentially threaten this important program.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-170 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

LETTER 14

County of Monterey Health Department Walter Wong, Director, Environmental Health Division
July 8, 2001

14-1 Microorganism concentrations in the river are expected to be consistent with those
of other surface waters of California because typical agricultural and land use practices are employed within the watershed. It is noted on page 5.4-15 of the Draft EIR/EIS that the levels of total coliform bacteria in the Salinas River are anticipated to be relatively high based on the level of animal grazing, human recreation, and uncontrolled nonpoint-source runoff that takes place within the watershed. It should also be noted that the source of a significant portion of irrigation water in
California is untreated surface water. Such water is routinely applied through
sprinkler and other irrigation techniques without significant health and safety
implications.
The MCWRA is also concerned about the quality of Salinas River water for agricultural use, and proposes to obtain additional water quality data, including information regarding microorganisms, prior to project initiation.
In response to this comment, page 5.4-26 of the EIR/EIS is changed to add the following text after the discussion of Impact Alt A-6:
There is a potential that pathogens in the Salinas River could be diverted to the irrigation system and then applied to crops. A high percentage of irrigation water in California is applied under similar circumstances with no known adverse health consequences. Nevertheless, the MCWRA will develop additional data to determine if any unusual circumstances would create potential health hazards from use of
Salinas River water.

There is a remote potential that pathogens that may be in Salinas River water would be diverted and applied to crops. This could create a potential health hazard, but this is not known without additional data and consultation. For this reason, health hazards from use of diverted Salinas River water are considered potentially
significant (Alt A-6b).

page The following mitigation measure is added to 5.4-38:

Potential Health Hazards from Use of Diverted River Water (Alt B-6b).
The MCWRA will collect and analyze Salinas River water samples at the location where diversion is proposed. Once samples are analyzed, MCWRA will consult with the County Health Department and the California Department of Health Services to determine if water treatment is required. ZS LZO
E
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-171 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

If water treatment is required to protect the beneficial uses of diverted river water, MCWRA will provide for such treatment.

These changes are also listed in Chapter 3.0 of this document.

TO: Nancy Rollman, Planning

FROM: Christine Ferrara, Ullities Division Manager (/03
SUBJECT: Comments on Monterey County Water Resources Agency Draft EIR for Salinas Valley Water Project
Here are our Department's comments relative to the hydrology section of the MCWRA Salinas Valley Water Project EIRVEIS. These were compiled with the assistance of our Nacimiento project consultant, Boyle Engineering Corporation.
Page 2-7, Section 2.4.1 Applicants Preferred Alternative: Alternatlve A implementation of Alternative A would result in the following significant unavoidable impacts: Nacimiento Reservoir water level changes, which could affect sport fish reproduction and habitat (Sections 5.5, 5.9) ...Surface levels change substantially over the course of an average year 19-1

(Section 5.8) Reduction in lake levels at Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs to the degree that recreational opportunities are substantially affected during peak recreation season (Section 5.9)
Comment: Appears that the water levels of the two reservoirs will change significantly, is there a graph which depicts the historic and projected reservoir levels by month to illustrate the impact of the preferred altemative?

Effects of Aesthetic Value of Nacimiento Reservoir: Implernentation of Alternative A would result in an annual reduction of 16 to 28 feet in surface elevation compared to existing and 19-2
future conditions. Implementation of Alternative B will have similar impacts.
Comment: Where was it determined/calculated that the reservoir level would decrease by 16 to 28 feet? What is the decrease in surface elevation by month? Wil the minimum reservoir elevation be impacted (decreased) to facilitale additional water deliveries during period of less than optimal volumes within the reservoir?

without damage to the dam structure,
Comment: Has this been verified with DSOD and FERC?
Page 5.3-13, Figure 5.3-4
Comment: From this figure one might draw the conclusion that the reservoir levels would be maintained at a higher elevation due to the lack of a correlation between the reservoir level 19-15
(elevation) and storage cepacity. Il would be beneficial if reservoir elevations where included in the y-axis.
Page 5.3-12, Reservoir Re-operation
This would especially be evident during the late winter and early spring periods when lake levels have historically been maintained at elevation 777feet. During normal and heavier rainfall years, this has often meant a forced release of water from Nacimiento Reservoir that could have otherwise.been stored for conservation uses. 19-16

Comment: This should be emphasized to the public since the re-operation of the reservoir will provide MCWRA the ability to capture more water during the reiny season for use during the peak irrigation season and thus maintain higher lake levels.
Page 5.3-13, Nacimiento Reservoir Storage Levels - Alternative A and B
the average monthly reservoir storage levels in Nacimiento Reservoir would be lower than under existing conditions. The Nacimiento storage in the summer and winter period is approximately 50,000 AF and 20,000 AF, respectively, lower under the proposed action than the existing condition. 19-17

Comment: What is the corresponding change (decrease) in surface elevation due to the A decreased storage? A graphical representation of the decreased reservoir storage and surface elevation by average month would be helpful.

Under both Alternative A and B, the total annual volume of reservoir releases would not change substantially, and reoperation flows would be within the existing range of flows.

Comment: The figures identify period in which the surface tevel of the Nacimiento Reservoir will be well below 720', what is the minimum elevation the reservoir will be taken to? This is mportant for the design of the intake structure to enable San Luis Obispo County the ability 19-25
to utilize their water allocation as determined in the 1959 agreement. In addition, a graphical representation of the existing reservoir level and projected reservoir levels by month would provide a means to easily identity the impacts of the proposed project.

LETTER 19

San Luis Obispo County, Department of Public Works Christine Ferrara, PE, Utilities Division Manager
August 7, 2001

19-1 Revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS, and the results shown for Alternative A in the Draft EIR/EIS have been modified. See
Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0 for a description of the revised simulations and results. The revised modeling shows that effects of SVWP operations on reservoir elevations would be less than reported in the Draft EIR/EIS; in other words, the difference in average lake levels after the project would not be as substantial as shown in the Draft EIR/EIR; however, the significance thresholds would still be exceeded and the conclusions on impact significance presented in the
Draft EIR/EIS would be unchanged. See Figures 1-12 under response to Comment
19-22 for monthly model results produced using the revised modeling.

19-2 The Salinas Valley Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Model (SVIGSM) was
used to estimate changes in reservoir elevations that would result from implementation of the SVWP. See pages 5-1, 5.3-10, and 5.3-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS for description of the SVIGSM and assumptions used in the analysis. The results summarized in the impact statement on page 2-16 are described by month (i.e., average monthly changes) on pages 5.8-20 and 5.8-21. Revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS, and the lake level projections under Alternative A have been modified. See Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0 for a description of the revised simulations and results. The new model results show that under Alternative A, the average monthly surface elevation
at Lake Nacimiento during the recreation season (May-September) over the 46-year hydrologic period would be 6 to 6 14 feet per month less than under existing and future baseline conditions (rather than 16 to 28 feet). See Tables 5.8-5 and 5.8-6 in Chapter 3.0, which show the decrease in average monthly surface elevation to existing and future baseline conditions, respectively.
The minimum reservoir elevation, or dead pool elevation, would not be changed as a result of SVWP implementation.

19-3 As described in Section 5.9 of the Draft EIR/EIS, The peak recreation period lasts
153 days, beginning May 1ª and ending September 30t. Under existing conditions, the average number of 730-foot lake level days available during the peak recreation period at San Antonio Reservoir is 132 and at Nacimiento Reservoir, that figure is 112. Under the existing plus project and future plus project scenarios of Alternative A, the number of 730-foot lake level days available during peak tecreation period at
San Antonio Reservoir would average 77 and 81, respectively. For Nacimiento Reservoir, these figures would be 86 and 95, respectively. Therefore, the average 69170
F

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-188 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

number of days adversely affected by project operations during the peak recreation season at San Antonio Reservoir is 55 and 51, respectively, relative to existing conditions. For Nacimiento Reservoir, these figures would be 26 and 17, respectively. Please note that these values reflect the revised hydrology analysis. Refer to Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0.

19-4 As described above, revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS, and the lake level projections under Alternative A have been
modified. See Master Response MR-4 for a description of the revised simulations
and results. See Figures 1-12 under response to Comment 19-22 for monthly model results. The revised modeling shows 226 months out of the 552 months of the
simulation period for Alternative A when surface elevations in Nacimiento Reservoir
are greater than 760 feet (41 percent of months). This is in comparison to the 1995 baseline run, in which levels are greater than 760 feet in 273 months of the 552 (49 percent of months). The months when surface levels at Nacimiento Reservoir are shown to be greater than 760 feet are typically in March through May under Alternative A and February through June under the 1995 baseline simulation.

19-5 The hydrologic study period analyzed for the SVWP is the 46-year hydrologic period from October 1948 through September 1994. As described on pages 5.3-7 and 5.3-8
of the Draft EIR/EIS, this is the longest period for which adequate, consistent, and reliable information on hydrology (precipitation and stream flow) is available; groundwater-level data is also available for this period. The period includes years of
extreme hydrologic conditions, such as the critically dry periods of 1976-77 and 1989-1991, and wet periods. Using this period allows the analysis of the performance and operation of the proposed project through periods of extreme hydrologic conditions as well as "normal" conditions. Extending this period to the present day would not add climatic stresses that are not already being simulated in the 46-year hydrologic period.
The commenter suggests that using a shorter period (the most recent 10 years) rather than this 46-year period would provide more "realistic" results. By contrast, a 10- year period would not capture enough variation in hydrology to be adequately representative of long-term conditions. Using this shorter period in the modeling would, in fact, result in less reliable model output for the reasons described above and would add uncertainty regarding the impacts of the SVWP.

19-6 The commenter is correct in asserting that constraints to population growth should be considered in the EIR/EIS. The statement on page 5-1 of the Draft EIR/EIS is
intended to infer the projections are not constrained by water availability. Howevet, Section 7 of the Draft EIR/EIS more fully discusses the basis for the population
projections. The projections are based on AMBAG forecasts through 2020 and extrapolated to 2030. These forecasts are not constrained by resources, per se, However, they are based in large part on plans included in each of the general plans for cities and the County of Monterey for the region. The general plans each reflect the constraints unique to each jurisdiction, including agricultural land preservation
and other issues.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-189 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

19-7 The Nacimiento Reservoir diversions to San Luis Obispo County have been simulated as a monthly amount of 1,450 acre-feet (AF) per month for a total annual amount of 17,500 AFY. This diversion is included in every month of the simulation period, as long as the reservoir can meet the minimum flow requirement downstream of the dam. See also Master Response MR-10.

19-8 The proposed action would not conflict with the San Luis Obispo County General Plan (Nacimiento Area Plan) goal to "maintain and protect a living environment that
is safe, healthful and pleasant for all residents by conserving nonrenewable resources and replenishing renewable resources." The only physical changes that would occur in San Luis Obispo County as a result of project implementation would be the modification of the existing spillway structure at Nacimiento Dam and the fluctuation in the timing of releases of water from Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. These changes are not expected to create an inconsistency with the
Nacimiento Area Plan.

It is true that lake levels will fluctuate to the point that unavoidable impacts associated with recreational use of the lake and visual resources would occur, and
this is disclosed in the Draft EIR/EIS and would not result in wasteful use of non-
renewable resources.

19-9 We are assuming the commenter was referring to the San Antonio, not the Salinas, reservoir, as the Salinas reservoir is not operated along with Nacimiento, whereas
San Antonio is. The inflow to the reservoirs has been estimated based on the
streamflow gage records upstream of each reservoir, the data on daily lake levels observed at the dams, precipitation and evaporation data observed at the lakes, and the daily releases from the reservoirs. The 3:1 ratio of available space between the two reservoirs has been calculated based on the long-term inflow calculations. There are no additional precipitation stations that could provide data that has not previously been used.
19-10 Please see response to Comment 19-9.
19-11 There is no need to update the minimum flow requirements below the Nacimiento and San Antonio dams pending the reoperation of the reservoirs under the SVWP. However, additional release and flow requirements will be required in connection
with the diversion facility and its affects on steelhead. Please see page Draft EIR/EIS. 5.6-85 of the

19-12 Please see response to Comment 19-5. As described on EIR/EIS, the EIR/EIS analysis and the project have been developed over several page 5-1 of the Draft years. The SVIGSM is based on the 46 years of hydrologic data for the period from October 1948 through September 1994, and the baseline is a compilation of this data. The SVIGSM was developed over a period of several years and reflects this record. Changing the baseline to include information from 1994 to the present for the current EIR/EIS was unnecessary because the 46-year period used is a reasonable reflection of current hydrologic conditions that reflects the compilation, 02171

analysis, and averaging of physical, long-term scientific data. Updating the model would not provide meaningful new data, but would require time and expense, so it is
not warranted.

19-13 The reason that the Hydrology section of the Draft EIR/EIS evaluates impacts by phase and impact topic rather than by project component is because hydrologic impacts are evaluated and measured on a basin-wide scale and are inherently linked to multiple components. Please refer to page 5.3-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS for
additional information.

19-14 The MCWRA is in the process of reviewing the flood rule curve for Nacimiento Reservoir with the Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

19-15 Figure 5.3-4 has been revised as requested. Please see Chapter 3.0 for the revised version. The figure illustrates that the reservoir can store the most/highest amounts of water in the summer months when the probability of precipitation/inflow is the lowest. This does not imply that the reoperation of the reservoir would maintain reservoir levels that correspond to the storage levels in the figure.
19-16 The commenter is correct that the reoperation of the reservoirs would allow the MCWRA to capture more water during the rainy season for use during the peak irrigation season. As noted on Draft EIR/EIS page 3-11, the proposed reoperation could provide approximately 29,000 AFY of additional stored water that would be available for recharging the groundwater basin and diverting water.
19-17 Figure 5.3-6 depicts the average monthly changes in storage levels at Nacimiento Reservoir. The corresponding decreases in surface elevation at Nacimiento Reservoir are not shown graphically in the Draft EIR/EIS, but are shown in Table 5.8-5. Revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft
EIR/EIS, and the reservoir storage and surface-level conditions shown for
Alternative A in the Draft EIR/EIS have been modified. See Master Response MR- 4 for description of the revised simulations. Revised Table 5.8-5 is included in Chapter 3.0 of the Final EIR/EIS.

19-18 Please see response to Comment 19-17.

19-19 The 7,000-AF value for additional releases during April through August under Alternative A refers to Nacimiento Reservoir only. Total releases from both
reservoirs would result in up to 11,000 AF per month (during April through August)
being released above baseline conditions during the irrigation season. Figutes 5.3-8 and 5.3-9 in the Draft EIR/EIS show average monthly changes in reservoir storage under Alternative A (i.c., differences between the baseline and Alternative A) for the two reservoirs. As noted in response to Comment 19-1, Tables 5.8-2 and 5.8-5 showed the changes in average monthly surface elevations under Alternative A for San Antonio Reservoir and Nacimiento Reservoir, respectively (i.e., differences TLIZO
between the baseline and Alternative A). Revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS, and the reservoir levels shown for 5

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-191 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

A Alternative A in the Draft EIR/EIS have been modified. See Master Response MR-
4 and Chapter 3.0 for a description of the revised simulations and results.

The information the commenter is requesting on releases from Nacimiento
Reservoir under baseline conditions is presented in the following table:

Odtober November December January February March April Noy Juns July August September 1995 Boseline 2870 22490 12620 17060 21090 10560 8210 9960 22300 27340 21580 2380
1995 SVWP 11390 6330 8400 9540 15500 13180 9440 16510 30220 27690 18300 15650
Difference 8520 -16160 -4220 -7520 -5590 2620 1230 6550 7920 350 -3280 13270

19-20 For the purposes of the Draft EIR/EIS, the winter months are considered to be November through March. With implementation of the proposed action, surface elevation levels at Nacimiento Reservoir would be allowed to increase past the
current flood control rule curve of 777 feet during winter months. Elevations will be able to be maintained at 789 feet in January and February, 792 feet in December
and March, 794 feet in November, 798 feet in October, and 800 feet in all other
months.

19-21 The ability to pass the maximum PMF does not substantially alter the amount of water ultimately relcased from Nacimiento. Instead, it changes the timing of releases. More water can be held in the winter than current conditions allow. The
range of flows under the 1995 baseline conditions from Nacimiento Reservoir is 0
to 187,425 AF per month (approximately 3,120 cfs on daily basis) and under the 1995 simulations of the SVWP is 0 to 187,440 AF per month (also approximately 3,120 cfs on daily basis). Thus, the spillway modification and reoperation at Nacimiento Reservoir would not result in changes in the range of flows from this reservoir versus the baseline condition. In addition, the water released during April through August from both reservoirs (fuly has the highest average releases with 37,000 AF) would equate to approximately 620 cfs, which is within the normal range of flows for the Salinas-River throughout the year and below the 1,000 cfs threshold at which sediment transport begins (see page 5.3-62 of the Draft EIR/EIS).
19-22 Revised modeling has been performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS, and the reservoir storage and surface-level conditions shown for Alternative A in the Draft EIR/EIS have been modified. Results of the revised simulations are presented in Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0. In response to the commenter's request, Figures 1-12 are provided with this response to show monthly reservoir levels, storage volumes, and releases at Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs under
baseline and project conditions for both near-term and future scenarios of
Alternative A.

19-23 Please see response to Comment 19-22. Please refer to the table presented in
response to Comment 19-19 for information on average monthly releases from Nacimiento Reservoir under the proposed project.

RE: Comments on the Draf EIR/EIS for the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP)

Dear Mr. Myer:
On behalf of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors, the attached comments are made to address the Draft EIR/EIS for the Salinas Valley Water Project. The proposal to improve the spillway and re-operate the reservoir at Lake Nacimiento could benefit both counties as a result of retaining more water in the lake and being able to utilize that water more efficiently. However, as discussed in Attachment A, Attachment B, and the transcript of the Board meeting, all of which are enclosed, additional information or clarifications are needed in several areas.
These comments are submitted for your response and consideration.

Sincerely,

ATTACHMENT A

SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY
COMMENTS ON SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT (SVWP)
DRAFT EIR/EIS

AUGUST 21, 2001

The following comments are made on behalf of San Luis Obispo County on the Salinas Valley Water Project Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR/EIS). The comments are presented in the same order as the chapters and sections are
found in the DEIR/EIS:

INTRODUCTION
REOURED APPROVALS *
Please note that because the project is proposing to close Lake Nacimiento Drive at certain intervals during construction, an encroachment permit governing the circumstances under 20-1
which the road may be closed, may be required from the San Luis Obispo County
Engineering Department.

CHAPTER 3
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The 1998 SVWP EIR supported a conjunctive use approach which would use surface water supplies in wet years (preserving groundwater supplies) and rely on groundwater supplies during periods of sustained drought (page 3-39 of that document). The 1998 SVWP EIR states on page 4.3-31 that, "diversion would take place during normal and above normal water years, and would be reduced during below normal and dry years." Please explain why 20-2

this operational approach is not proposed in the subject 2001 EIR/EIS. Such an approach could help to mitigate visual and recreational impacts, which are classified as Class I impacts.

Please provide an operational release schedule in the project description or in the Hydrology and Flooding chapter. The EIR/EIS should discuss operational aspects of the project during
a sustained drought. The EIR/EIS does not adequately portray impacts during dry years or 20-3
during a drought period. The SVWP EIR should provide additional, detailed information on how the SVWP project would be operated when lake levels of 748' are reached, since that
AR 02188
Salinas Valley Water Projeci 2-207 Response to Commems on mne cIK/EIs

Salinas Valley Water Project EIR/EIS Comments

is a reasonable definition of drought as it pertains to this reservoir, based on the existing Califoria Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) agreement. If the MCWRA considers a 20-3
different water elevation level to constitute a drought condition, please include that in a
discussion. A proposed reoperation schedule that commits to reduced releases during dry (cont'd)

years should be included in the project description. At one of the informational workshops
provided by the MCWRA, the General Manager stated that "we will minimize impacts" and "we çan look at the operation schedule"; however, there is nothing described in the EIR/EIS
as to how that would be accomplished.

CHAPTER 5
5.3 HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING
The materials regarding anticipated lake level impact resulting from the project is unclear. 20-4
Please provide a graph illustrating simulated lake level impacts.
Further, this section cites several model updates and rule curves that were used to predict the impact of the proposed project. In numerous cases, the Draft EIR/EIS states that San Luis 20-5
Obispo County's entitlement in Lake Nacimiento has been taken into account, In the
reservoir modeling, during what hydrologic and operational conditions would deliveries of San Luis Obispo County's full entitlement not be made? How are deliveries to San Luis Obispo County affected by the proposed project (i.e. does the number of months where full 20-6
deliveries are unavailable increase as a result of the reoperation)?

Other comments on this chapter are provided in the attached memorandum from the County
Public Works Department.

5.4 WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH
Heritage Ranch CSD is not the only source of water quality data. San Luis Obispo County analyzed water quality from Nacimiento Lake. from 1993 to 1997. This data was electronically transferred to Kathy Thomasberg on July 20, 2001. Please revise Table 5.4-4 20-7

accordingly.

5.9 RECREATION
The SVWP EIR/EIS states on page 5.9-1 that the Nacimiento reservoir was originally designed and is currently operated as a flood coutrol and water conservation facility, providing a secondary benefit as recreational facility. San Luis Obispo Couty agrees with that characterization and included a similar a description in the Nacimiento Water Project (NWP) EIR. Nonetheless, even a as a secondary benefit, the recreational value of Lake Nacimiento is important to San Luis Obispo County residents and in that light, as the comments below will expound upon, it appears that additional information is needed to
better understand the potential changes to lake levels and subsequent impacts to recreation.
In addition, mitigation measures are possible to reduce/minimize impacts to lake levels.

Page 5.9-13 of the DEIR states that, "The Monterey County Parks Department uses a widely : 20-8

Salinas Valley Water Project AR 02189
2-208 Response to Commen.

Salinas Valley Water Project EIR/EIS Comments August 21, 2001 Page 3

accepted threshold of 730 feet as minimum elevation, below which recreational opportunities can be substantially reduced." Please include : copy of the Pete Soderberg letter (in response 20-8
to the NOP) in the appendices. San Luis Obispo County has never seen a copy of that letter and as was acknowledged in the EIR/EIS, there is a difference in threshold levels in the two (cont'd)
counties' EIRs.

The SVWP DEIR should include a graphic figure showing the areas affected by lake level fluctuations at the approximate 730" level, so that the area which would become dry lake bed can be illustrated to the public. A copy of a figure provided by Monterey County Parks Department shows Lake Nacimiento under 740'-720 conditions (attached Exhibit 1). At
that point, the entire Las Tablas Creek is closed off and what is left of the lake is divided in
half. Attached as Exhibit 2, is a table entitled " Lake Nacimiento Water Surface Elevations 20-9
at which Boat Docks Can No Longer Function" from the NWP EIR which shows that impacts can be observed at the 760-foot elevation, ie, the use of boat launches is impaired, and that the Heritage Ranch dock cannot be used below a 735-foot elevation. Clearly, physical impacts to lake levels are occuring at higher elevations than 730 feet. It would also be appropriate to include a chart similar to the attached Exhibit 3 which shows what is occuring at various elevations in the reservoir, to provide a frame of reference for the public.
The S.WVP EIR/EIS should contain graph or a spreadsheet that depicts the actual and theoretical lake levels with and without the proposed project throughout some historical study period, so that the public can see the lake level impacts resulting from the reoperation
during normal rainfall years as well as dry and drought years. A graphic which was presented in your agency's recent information workshops (July 10 and July 30, 2001) in a powerpoint presentation, may be a good source for this information. Attached Exhibit 4 20-10

shows Appendix D in the NWP EIR which provided this information (for a 16 ½ year period)
in the first three columns for the NWP. The other columns can be used to then illustrate
certain conditions at different specific threshold levels. Also attached as Exhibit 5 is a figure from the NWP EIR which graphically shows the lake levels with and without the project for a similar time period.
A relationship between Nacimiento Lake level and recreational "units" is presented in this section. Were other indicators that may affect recreational activity considered such as air 20-11
temperature, holidays coinciding with weekends, or overall economic indicators? In other
words, lake levels may not be the only factor affecting recreational activity at Lake
Nacimiento.

Please acknowledge that the summertime releases do not include San Luis Obispo County's entire allocation because we are taking our water over a period of 12 months, not just in the 20-12
summer. If this information was not included in the hydrologic model, then lake level
impacts may have been overstated.

This section concludes that no mitigation to recreational impacts is feasible. Please consider 20-13

Salinas Valley Water Project AR 02190
2-209 Response to Comm.....

Salinas Valley Water Project EIR/EIS Comments
August 21, 2001 Page 4

the following in terms of reducing/minimizing impacts to both visual and recreational
resources: 20-13

(A) Reduce diversion rates during below normal and drought conditions; and, (cont'd)

(B) Extending the public/homeowner association boat ramps to a lower elevation,
thereby allowing continued access to the lake for recreational activities.
We noted that in the formal comment letter on the NWP EIR, MCWRA stated that, "the
Agency is in strong agreement with the proposed mitigation measure that water conservation
measures be imposed when the lake level reaches 748-feet." (contained as Attachment A to
Monterey County Board of Supervisors Comment Letter on the NWP EIR, dated October 14, 20-14
1997). If the MCWRA maintains a position that participants in the NWP water project should adopt mandatory water conservation measures when levels at Lake Nacimiento reach 748 feet (or some other appropriate level), then the SVWP should adher to similar mandatory
conservation measures.

5.10 TRAFFIC AND CIRCULATION
The proposed mitigation measure to limit road closures at the dam spillway (Section 5.10.3) is sufficient. However, the key to the measure's success will be the notification to area residents of planned closures. This County is especially concerned about the fairly large 20-15
community of Oak Shores, and request that the mitigation measure include the establishment of a direct communication link with the Community Association at Oak Shores.
The Department of Public Works is very supportive of the proposed mitigation measure related to roadway damage due to construction traffic. One additional mitigation measure 20-16
needs to be included, that transit mix trucks not be permitted to spill concrete on the roads,
which is particularly a concern on the steep grade of Nacimiento Lake Drive.
On page 5.10.4, the discussion of "planned improvements" could be clarified. San Luis Obispo County is collecting traffic impact fees for cumulative impacts associated with the
major developments at Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores, based on the environmental analyses
for those projects. The fees will go toward major improvements of Nacimiento Lake Drive from Gateway Drive to Paso Robles. However, the rate of development in these areas (and 20-17

corresponding rate of cash flow) has slowed greatly from when the fee system was first developed, and there is not currently enough money in the fund for an improvement project,
nor is there likely to be for the foreseeable future. The improvement project could be
considered to be "planned" but not "programmed" at this point,
The mitigation measures spell out specific time periods for limiting two-way closures of . Nacimiento Lake Drive during the spillway modification. However, there is no comparable 20-18
limitation for one-way closures, and there needs to be, due to high number of people which
could be affected on certain days during the peak season. The following mitigation measure

AR 02191
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-210 Response to Comm

Salivas Valey Water Project EIR/EIS Comments August 21, 2001 Page 5

should be added: "One-way traffic closures shall not occur on Fridays or weekends during 20-18
the peak recreation season (May 1 through September 30), or during any morning and evening peak times (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM) on Monday through Thursday." (cont'd)

Further, the discussion on lane closures says that "prolonged closures may occur between 12 midnight and 5 AM" while Section 5.12 says "construction activities are anticipated to 20-19
occur…between the hours of 7 AM and 6 PM on weekdays and between 8 AM and 5 PM on weekends". These sections are in conflict.

CHAPTER 7
12 GROWTH INDUCING IMPACTS
The Draft EIR presents figures regarding employment percentages pertaining to agricultural 20-20
businesses affected by the proposed project. Employment figures also should be included pertinent to recreation related activities at Lake Nacimiento.

OTHER COMMENTS
Economic and Social Impacts
A number of comments were made at the July 30, 2001 workshop held in Paso Robles, regarding various economic analyses that should be done to address the following:

analyzing adverse impacts to tourism revenues and the local economy as experienced
by individuals, business and public agencies resulting from the physical and fiscal
results of the project; and,
20-21
O analyzing adverse impacts on property values at Lake Nacimiento resulting from changes to lake levels and views from properties and facilities at Lake Nacimiento.
The MCWRA should explain the context in which economic information is required under CEQA. (Section_15131) and NEPA, ifapplicable, and the crationale for why economic analysis was not included in the DEIR/EIS. If the proposed project results in economic or
social impacts which in turn result in a physical impact, that would need to be discussed in
the-DEIR/EIS.

ATTACHMENT B

Salinas Valley Water Project Draft EIR/EIS
Additional Comments

1. Why does the Draft EIR fail to include a project alternative describing a comprehensive urban and agricultural water conservation program? Reducing water demand could achieve the project goal of allowing more groundwater to remain in the north Salinas Valley area. The Draft EIR touches on an alternative that would be a regulatory approach to limiting water withdrawals, but it does not describe a water conservation program that 20-22

would reduce pumping. In fact, the Draft EIR reaches the unsupported conclusion that other "physical solutions" are unlikely to emerge from further study (p. 4-11). A program subsidizing urban and agricultural water conservation measures might achieve the project goals with less expense and fewer environmental impacts.

2. Is the Draft EIR based on an outdated hydrologic model? Many presumptions about each of the alternatives and its impacts are based on the hydrologic model. The model was 20-23
prepared years ago and has only been partially updated since that time. Using an outdated model results in inaccurate baseline environmental conditions for the Draft EIR.

3. Why does the Draft EIR use different versions of the hydrologic model to compare the environmental effects of different project alternatives? This may save money but it
makes it impossible for the decision-makers to accurately compare the impacts of the different alternatives.

4. None of the proposed alternatives address the problem of seawater intrusion in the Marina/Fort Ord area. The project is expected to benefit the Castroville portion of the groundwater basin, but the seawater intrusion problem also encompasses the area around the City of Marina and Fort Ord (now proposed for civilian re-use). The Draft EIR does
not consider the potential impacts of addressing only part of the seawater intrusion 20-25
problem. Page 1-9 states that "an expanded distribution system might be needed to
deliver Salinas River water to areas outside of the CSIP area". Where is a description of
that distribution system? Could this project aggravate the problem in the Marina/Fort Ord area? Will more Nacimiento releases be required later to address the Marina/Fort
Ord area?

5. The EIR references an expanded distribution system for "expanded deliveries" numerous
times throughout the document (päges 2-3, 2-17, 3-12, 23, 24, 5.1-7, 21, 5.2-9, 17, 5.3-
42, 5.4-23, 5.5-18, 39, 5.7-7, 12, 5.8-13, 23, 5.10-13). Where are these additional 20-26
releases described in detail and where would the water come from to allow for "expanded
deliveries"? If the water is coming from Lake Nacimiento, why aren't these additional

Page 1 of 2

AR 02202
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-221 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

impacts analyzed in the Recreation chapter?

6. Nitrate reduction is no longer proposed as a project component yet it continues to be a serious problem in the groundwater basin. The Draft EIR must address the consequences, if any, of failing to include nitrate management. Do high nitrate levels impact the ability 20-27
of this project to use a blend of new and reclaimed water? Will high nitrate levels require
the use of additional Nacimiento water in the future?

7: Monterey County is currently involved in an update of its general plan. Is a draft of this
plan available for public review? If so, the Draft EIR must consider project impacts, if any, associated with adopting the update. What planning mechanisms are in place to prevent new urban growth from defeating the purpose of bringing additional water to the
Salinas Valley? Looking at the issue from a broader perspective, how will moving water 20-28
to the north end of the valley affect delivery to the south part of the valley, in terms of
projected uses for agricultural and urban land uses and water demand in the south part of the valley? Where will additional water supplies come from to serve the southern end of
the valley?

8. Is MCWRA the proper lead agency? We have some indication that the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has paid for this environmental work and that the project is being proposed as a means of avoiding an adjudication by SWRCB. Also, the 20-29

proposed seasonal in-stream diversion will need to be permitted by SWRCB. Is it
possible that is SWRCB is really the appropriate lead agency for CEQA purposes?

9. The Draft EIR does not accurately describe San Luis Obispo County's plans and policies
for the Nacimiento Lake area nor does it document the historical use and the terms of our 20-30

water entitlement agreements. The preparers should meet with staff of the San Luis Obispo County Department of Planning and Building to correct these errors.

10. Should the Draft EIR be recirculated? Significant new information will need to be generated in order to respond to these comments and the comments of others. 20-31
Meaningful public participation will require the recirculation of the document.

TRANSCRIPT

Clerk: First hearing item this afternoon is Item D-1. This is request by the Planning Department to submit comments to Monterey County Water Resources Agency regarding the Draft Environmental Impäct Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project. Recommend approval and instruct the Chairperson to sign.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you, Ms. Rollman.

Ms. Rollman: Thank you. Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and Members of the
Board. I am Nancy Rollman, Environmental Specialist with the Planning Department. The Monterey County Water Resources Agency is proposing the Salinas Valley Project for which this Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared. The project is being proposed as means to stop seawater intrusion and to supplement water supply in the Salinas Valley in Monterey County. The proposed project as described in the EIR includes structural and program-based components located
at Lake Nacimiento and throughout Monterey County. These
include:

1. Nacimiento Dam spillway improvements that would create a larger spillway that could release more water during a large
rain fall;
2. Reoperation of both the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to store more water in winter and spring and to release more water during the irrigation season;
3. Increased recharge of the Salinas groundwater basin by increasing the irrigation season dam releases;
4 Construction of an in-stream diversion facility within the
Salinas River channel to impound river water from April through October for delivery to agricultural users; and
5. There would be a limitation on groundwater pumping in
areas where project water is delivered.
Staff reviewed this EIR with the following interests in mind: To
assure that the County's water entitlement of 17,500 acre feet per year has been reflected in their project, to assure that impacts to recreational'aspects of the lake have been analyzed to communicate a clear and concise picture of what those impacts would be, and for
traffic concen on Lake Nacimiento Drive during construction of

the spillway improvements. Staff has prepared a list of detailed,
technical comments which is found in Attachment A of your Staff
Report. These comments speak to our concerns regarding a lack of specific information on lake levels which could affect the reliability of our water entitlement, as well as recreational uses. Since the time that the Staff Report was prepared, additional comments have been formulated which staff has just distributed to the Board as Attachment B. These comments cover other broader issues. Staff
is recommending that your Board transmit three items in our
comments to Monterey County Water Resources Agency: Attachment A, which is contained in the Staff Report, Attachment B, which was just distributed, and the proceedings from this Board meeting. In this way the Water Resources Agency will respond to the comments in certifying the Salinas Valley Water Project Draft
EIR/EIS. That concludes staff's presentations and I would be happy to answer any questions, and I believe Christine Ferrara is on her way here. She is the Utilities Director from Public Works Department. She is also involved in reviewing this document.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you Ms. Rollman. When she does come, if we have questions for her, we will ask her at that time. At this time, any questions or comments for Ms. Rollman? Supervisor Pinard?
Supervisor Pinard: Yes. It seems like there is an underlying issue here that I'm not sure the EIR really has dealt with from Monterey County and that is what has caused this change in the overdraft situation. Basically, what I am referring to is the management of their own water that they import in, that they use from the basin, that they use for agriculture. I'm not seeing that there is much here about how they use whatever resources are available to them about recharging their own basin. We have tertiary treatment plants, we used all the latest 20-32
issues in some of our areas on trying to recharge groundwater basins. And, I'm not sure that this is really being reflected in what their EIR is saying. To put it another way, we know that water is scarce all over and it is imperative that everybody use every means possible to recirculate their own water as much as possible besides just taking it out of the ground. And, I'm not seeing that discussion here about tertiary plants, agricultural practices. It just seems to me that there is a lot of withdrawal of water from the Monterey County basin and now they are looking to the Nacimiento reservoir to be the answer to it when actually there may be a lot more of the internal practices that can affect that as part 1. Part 2 is if they haven't made these changes and they aren't making these changes,

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-225 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

what's going to keep this problem from getting worse in the future. And then they are going to be looking to Nacimiento, based on this EIR, based on other concerns and say well now you need to solve our problems again. And so, it's the future impacts of all of this that is under discussion. It's not just this little issue. For number one, it's not a little issue. But it is not just this isolated issue. The
implications I think are important everywhere and we need to be 20-32

held to the same criteria of conservation and best practices in (cont'd)
management. But, this issue.is coming up with Monterey County first and I am really concerned about what those implications are for them and then what they'Il be for us later on. I don't know if Christine heard any of that, but. I needed to kind of state that concern out there and put that on the record, because I think those are a lot of the essence of some of these questions that need to be out there and that certainly San Luis Obispo County is entitled to
the answers too.

Ms. Rollman: can take a shot at responding to some of that. The EIR which we didn't get into in our comment letter, the EIR has a great deal of background regarding what Monterey County is doing and they do have a reclaimed water project in process right now, which this project will add to. They haven't addressed water conservation and that is one of the comments that you see in Attachment B. But,
they also talk about a lot of future probable improvements to agricultural technology, which will help to reduce water usage in
that area.

Supervisor Pinard: Ok. The basic issue still is they're causing an overdraft of their own basin and what is causing that and how can they stop doing that so the situation that's occurring doesn't get worse. Because there's not that much more water in California to solve that
problem. Ok.

Chairperson Achadjian: Supervisor Bianchi.

Supervisor Bianchi: I would agree that probably there needs to be : segment dealing with agricultural water conservation, but haven't noticed the City
of Salinas going gungho on its water conservation, nor has there been any attempt by the City of Salinas to be little more rational in 20-33
its water use, guess is what I was going to say. I think that needs to be included in here as well, because eventually we keep adding cities and people and taking away the land on which to grow the food to feed them. So I think urban conservation use needs to be in

here as well. But, I was really pleased on item number 8, where it says the Draft EIR does not accurately describe San Luis Obispo County's plans and policies for the Nacimiento Lake area. And then, and I think this is a really good suggestion: The preparer should meet with staff of the San Luis Obispo County Department of Planning and Building to correct these errors. And I think an 20-34
initial offer of cooperation or a system of cooperation is really a good thing to have. Just talking with people does not mean that you are either giving in to them or you are going to hit them in the nose later. It just means that you want to talk to them to see whether you can come to some degree of understanding. So that's
my comment.

Chairperson Achadjian: Are there any further comments?

Supervisor Bianchi: You may hit them in the nose later, but that's another issue.

Ms. Rollman: And I could respond to that by saying that since we are submitting the proceedings from this meeting as part of our comments, that
your comments will be noted.

Supervisor Bianchi: Well, you don't have to put them all in:

Chairperson Achadjian: Ok, seeing no other lights, we go to the public at this time. Frank McKee, our first speaker and that is the only request to speak at
this time.

Mr. McKee: Mr. Chairman, members of the Board. First, a word about
Nacimiento itself.

Chairperson Achadjian: Mr. McKee, for the record, would you please give us your name.

Mr. McKee: Frank McKee. I am a resident of Templeton and a property owner at Nacimiento.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you.

Mr. McKee: Regarding Nacimiento, there are about 75,000 dams in the National Inventory of Lakes and Dams. Nacimiento is in the top one-half of one percent. Out of 75,000 dams, there is not more than 300 in the 20-35

entire United States that is larger than Nacimiento. There are 120,000 paid visits to both lakes where Monterey County collects
fees from families. There are at least 1,800 mail addresses around

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-227 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the lake in seven communities and those people contribute several thousand users of the lake. I was kind enough to get an answer
from the Assessor's office and they evaluate the property at
Nacimiento at $334,000,000. Real estate people tell me that a reasonable, fair-market value for those parcels around the lake is approaching $700,000,000. There is no question that Nacimiento
and San Antonio are major facilities - far more than most of us
realize in the national category.
Regarding the report, I will sort of reiterate some of the points that have been made here, but that report in essence is an umbrella report. It contains several projects which could stand alone, and they have been bundled for convenience. In reality, the bundle is to stop the seawater intrusion, provide all the water they need with virtually no curtailment of usage which now stands at 463,000 acre feet a year. And that's a flat number and they project 30 years from now it might go down a few percent. The modification of the 20-35

spillway is a flood control criteria. It does not add one drop of (cont'd)
water to the lake, because they are going it to drop it down and bring it right back to the same level. The impoundment along the 4 1/2 miles of the river is a project that could stand alone and they are doing that in conjunction with the Corp of Engineers. That's a self- sustaining project. The surface distribution of the water is a project. They have not yet diverted water from the lake and distributed it to the surface. So, there is whole bunch of self-
standing projects that, I consider the reoperation is not a project. Reoperation is a declaration on their part that they are going to use all the water they need to get the job done without taking anybody out, from pumping out of the ground unless the well itself is contaminated. Those are the only wells they are going to cut off.

Chairperson Achadjian: Mr. McKee would you summarize please.

Mr. McKee: Yes. So, in summary, I believe that the issue is not the 30,000 acre feet that they spend so much time on this report, but rather its a long term draw down of those lakes, That is the issue that I ask you to consider.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you sir. Supervisor Pinard.

Supervisor Pinard: Yes, question for Mr. McKee. Oh, Harry, go ahead.

Supervisor Ovitt: Well, I was going to ask him if he might take a seat up front here and let the other public speaker go and then we can ask questions of Mr. McKee. Because a have a series of them, I think he, Mr.
McKee is very modest. He lived at Nacimiento Lake. He was part
of the Nacimiento Water Advisory Committee and has not as long a
history as I've got with the lake, but a good view on it.

Mr. McKee: Mine is 30 years.

Supervisor Ovitt: know.

Chairperson Achadjian: Linda Hall.

Ms. Hall: Yes. Linda Hall. I just have one quick question and I'm wondering if staff could address the issue as to whether or not in this
conversation with Monterey and with this EIR, if you are also dovetailing with the requirement that's come down within the last
year or so at a State level for an EIR on the water in the entire 20-36

State of California. If you are, assume you are aware of that and if that does dovetail with this issue. Thank you.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you.

Ms. Rollman: I'm not aware of that.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you. Seeing no other requests to speak, bring it back to the
Board. Supervisor Ovitt.

Supervisor Ovitt: Well, I'll go ahead and let Ms. Pinard ask her question first because she wanted to ask a question of Mr. McKee.

Supervisor Pinard: Ok. Mr. McKee, if you would come back up to the podium.

Mr. McKee: Sorry, my broke.

Supervisor Pinard: Well, actually no, if there is something else that you think we need to know, would like to be sure that you have the time to state that, because this is our ability to have input into this process and if we miss something now, I don't to be coming back to someone later and saying well, gee, you know, this should have been brought
up then. So, question number one: Was there anything in addition
that you wanted to be sure to alert us to so that we can be sure it is
on the record.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-229 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Mr. McKee: Well, I want to reiterate that an awful lot of emphasis in this book is placed on that 30,000 acre feet. And, I just cannot believe that after 50 years of overdraft there is now 500,000 acre feet of saltwater in those aquifers. And, they're talking about solving that problem by diverting about 30,000 acre feet year and half of that goes into wells. It isn't gonna happen. I'm not a hydrologist, but common sense tells you that it isn't going to happen. But what is going to happen is they are going to draw down those lakes as long as they can to overt doing anything. Now, they have said that the 20-37

State might require 30-50% cut in their pumping. The Salinas Valley cannot stand a 30-50% cut in pumping. They have got to solve that problem. They would put half of the farmers out of business and that's not right. So, I just think that there is, if you will, a somewhat of a smokescreen to get everybody working on 30,000 acre feet when in reality their intent is to use the lakes to solve the problem at minimum expense and little impact on
Monterey County.

Supervisor Pinard: Ok, wanted, I'm really glad you articulated that, because I think that is a suspicion that I have shared in terms of that this seems to be an effort to make determinations that's going to come back to haunt a us in the end for a totally different reason. And, I'm hearing
you and your experience articulate it so much better, but I just have
that gut reaction to what I'm reading that all is not what it seems and your use of the word smokescreen is exactly right on.

Mr. McKee: Well, let me just close by saying that I have now followed this, as I have said for 30 years. I have been to several hundred meetings in Monterey County, not just a few. They are fine people. They are taking care of themselves, but there is no question in their mind and I think this report reflects it, that as far as San Luis Obispo County is concerned, it is a source of water and that's it.

Supervisor Pinard: For Monterey.

Mr. McKee: That's right.

Supervisor Pinard: Right. Thank you very much and Supervisor Ovitt had something.

Supervisor Ovitt: No, I think that is pretty much it, the only other thing I was going to ask Frank, in your conclusion, you were talking about the actual operation of the dam and I didn't know if you wanted to elaborate on that because, again, you were there, I think, when we set up the

8

AR 02211

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-230 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

operations committee and finally got Mr. Madruga and everybody together to talk about how we should operate that dam. When you look at what their proposed project is to, basically, it in essence lowers the spillway from the 800 acre feet to the 792. And then, their charts don't reflect, basically, the operation that we have now with the average water being, averages • I hate that word, but anyway I'm using it being at about the 700 and something level, 770, 780 level. I don't know if you just wanted to comment, I know you used to comment to me on it, so I might mention the fact that Frank spent a lot of time tending meetings at the Monterey County Water Advisory organization and would report back to me as to what was going on up there over the last eight years, at least
on that.

Mr. McKee: Well, in this case I have attempted not to dwell on those short-term levels, because I really consider them to be an interim thing. And, it whether they cut it off at 780 or 730, it really depends on a drought cycle. Basically, when they need the water, if it doesn't rain, there is a place they are going to get the water and that is those two reservoirs. It is as simple as that. And, if you read through this 20-38
report, there are 16 major references in this report to additional service distribution. And yet, they never quantify it. They never schedule. They never look at the mitigation of additional distribution. It is a nebulous thing. But, that's what's going to happen. So, I don't dwell, if you will Supervisor Ovitt, on the first 20 or 25,000 acre feet of water.

Supervisor Ovitt: I guess my point is that, and I brought it up with staff, is that is the talk at these various levels, one is the flood management level.

Mr. McKee: Right,

Supervisor Ovitt: Now that could be the first 110 or 150, depending on where we're at to date. But the operation curve, that's probably the best thing, but then the issue is, then they talk about the conservation level, but they never talk about the capability of water releasing, flood management, that they're also taking care of some of the conservation issues at the same time. There's never been the
blending, it's always been two separate areas.

Mr. McKee: Right. But it also says we will monitor the situation and make
additional releases as required. That's what you got to concern
yourself about.

AR 02212

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-231 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Supervisor Ovitt: And we have brought up the issue about, in a sense, about the fact that they don't talk about Marina and Fort Ord and that's those extra areas for redistribution that you're speaking of. 20-39

Mr. McKee: Right. They have their problems. They have people up there who feel more strongly than some of you folks do, believe me. mean,
it's major issue for them. And for us.

Chairperson Achadjian: Thank you.

Supervisor Ovitt: Thank you Frank.

Chairperson Achadjian: Mr. Ryan.

Supervisor Ryan: Well, if we're done with public, I wanted to recommend that we send the staff comments with the attachment that we received here,
this Attachment B that has another nine subjects that we're
covering there.

Supervisor Pinard: I'll second and I'd also like to make an addition. Frank mentioned a couple of areas that were saved nebulously. You know. Where it says additional distribution or an additional release may be
warranted. We need them to define what those circumstances are.
It can't, that is such a, mean that negates the whole EIR, that somebody in some office gets to say, well we just want more and that's exactly what he's talking about.

Supervisor Ovitt: If I might interject, were you talking about, its under Number 4 and probably the language could be added to that that would talk about 20-40
the expanded redistribution system.

Supervisor Pinard: [ would quote their own sentences, since staff is familiar with the EIR and ask them to please explain each of those. You got it a
little general in Number 4. But if you really want accountability
that you can hang your hat on later, then go through the EIR and quote the sentences that they say and could you please explain and analyze when this would be taken into account and how.

Supervisor Ovitt: The water captured by the downstream diversion situation was only to cover the distribution system that's currently there. Or was it to cover the expanded the distribution? And that's the question that I think is being asked. Do they have to come back and get more water in order to go to the expanded distribution.

AR 02213

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-232 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Ms. Ferrara: Christine Ferrara, Public Works Department. In their alternative, preferred alternative, proposed project, they are not proposing any additions to that distribution system, but in one of the alternatives that's proposed to the project, they do include an expanded distribution system. And think that's what Mr. McKee was referring to is that it's not very well quantified, that alternative needs some flushing out.

Supervisor Ovitt: Could we add that in around Number 4?

Ms. Ferrara: We could add that in. I also wanted to mention that within the next month, I'm going to be coming to this Board asking for an update of the safe yield analysis that we've done, looking at an eye with this County, 17,500 acre foot entitlement. And as part of that we'll be looking very carefully at what the proposed reoperations of that reservoir is, so not only do we put it in here as an EIR comment, but in a very practical sense, we've got 1o get details about that reoperation from Monterey, so that we're assessing our own impact on our own entitlement accordingly.

Chairperson Achadjian: Okay, before ! get to Supervisor Bianchi, we had a motion was,

Supervisor Bianchi: No, I wanted to add, I wanted to make sure that my words, 20-40
Chairperson Achadjian: Okay, let me bring that under discussion, because, don't know how clear this is going to be to the Madam Clerk and my feelings (cont'd)
are that we are going too far ahead of a motion and a second. So, there was a motion by Supervisor Ryan, seconded by Supervisor
Pinard.

Supervisor Pinard: With an addendum.

Supervisor Bianchi: Well I, this is under discussion.

Chairperson Achadjian: Wait, wait, give me a second here. Have you followed us so far Madam Clerk?

Clerk: Well, at this point you have a motion on the floor that's to, basically adopt the staff recommendations with the Attachment A and the Attachment B. Supervisor Pinard is asking for, she seconded the motion, asking for additional language to the motion, but I'm not real clear as to exactly what words you're putting
where.

11

AR 02214

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-233 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Supervisor Pinard: Alright, let's finish discussion and then we'll go back and reframe
the motion.

Chairperson Achadjian: Okay. Supervisor Bianchi.

Supervisor Bianchi: Mine is real simple. I just want to add the words at the very top line, the end of the, well, it's the beginning of the second line, would be describing a comprehensive "urban and agricultural water conservation program." That's it.
Chairperson Achadjian: Supervisor Ryan.

Supervisor Ryan: Yeah. Mine is in Number 6 and there is a question there, the Draft EIR must consider project impacts, if any associated with adopting the update of this EIR. And then it says to what planning mechanisms are in place to prevent new urban growth from defeating the purpose of bringing additional water to the North Salinas Valley and believe it's bit wider than that. I think that we need to know how moving this water to the north effects the delivery of water to the south part of the Valley. Because I believe that you're going to look at their present EIR and it's going to talk about the use of Nacimiento water to supply agriculture and urban
uses coming down that Salinas corridor and if they are now changing that water to the north Valley, how does that effect their 20-40
EIR and their projected usage of both agriculture and urban for the south part of the Valley. (cont'd)

Supervisor Ovitt: Would that be accomplished by just taking the word north out. This refers to the whole Salinas, the Salinas Valley is basically all of, everything from Bradley all the way to Monterey Bay.

Supervisor Ryan: I don't see the word north in there.

Supervisor Bianchi: It's the very first of the very last line of Number 6.

Supervisor Ryan: Oh, okay.

Supervisor Bianchi: First word of the last line.

Supervisor Ovitt: Yeah.

Supervisor Ryan: I don't know if you would or not. That would help it, but I think you're talking about some current use that they've identified this

12

AR 02215

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-234 Response to. Comments on the EIR/EIS

Nacimiento water for the south end of the County to meet their
needs and if they start moving that same water and identifying that for the north part of the Valley, then what are they backfilling their present EIR in the south with?

Chairperson Achadjian: Supervisor Pinard.

Supervisor Pinard: I just want to is finish up what Mike is saying and then add my own. There is no magic number here as to how many questions you can
ask. And so, rather than keep trying to bundle a question, yeah, take that one simply on its own. Because that gets to the issue of backfilling, and that's exactly what comes out of it when you start asking, identify what's the impact in the north. Well, if they shift it here, they've got a huge impact in the north, but they've shifled the water to the south, so you can't let anybody get away with playing, kind of that game where, what's the game I'm thinking of, where you put the pea under which one and say where are you following it. Oh, come on, somebody out there. Shell game, thank you. Thank you. Okay, so the question I had didn't need to be added to any one, it can stand on its own. And, what I'm suggesting is that this motion is not to get every word exactly the same, it's to give you the irection of each of the questions that we're trying to go for. And, as you massage these, you may actually see where the word north is in and you need to cover that. I'm not trying to undo 20-40
Mike's question. think it's very valid and needs to be there as its own question. And then also the one about the additional (cont'd)
distribution question is fair enough on its own question. We'll flush each of these out. And then also on Number 8, another one that
occurs to me, where you say the Draft EIR does not accurately describe San Luis Obispo County's plans and policies, well, it's not just plans and policies. There's also a whole series of history and agreements of historical use and those have weight. So, maybe that comes under policies, but sometimes the more words you throw in when you try and identify what has been past practice is this really important to do. So, again, I'll leave it to you to massage that, but think you need to be a little bit more liberal on the questions that you're asking. You can't ask too many in terms of protecting our interests. So, I would ask that those four, if it's agreeable, I don't hear any others, from the motion maker to add to the motion as direction to staff. The first concur? Mike?

Supervisor Ryan: Yes.

13

AR 02216

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-235 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Supervisor Pinard: Okay.

Chairperson Achadjian: Madam Clerk, before go any further, do you need any further
clarifications.

Supervisor Ryan: Like what the questions are?

Clerk: Okay, let's see if I've got at least an idea. How's that? The first one I heard Supervisor Pinard say was talking about, wanting a definition of what these additional releases are. Distributions, releases. The second one was Supervisor Bianchi adding language to Number 1, which is the comprehensive urban and agricultural water conservation program. The third one is if we're drawing from, bringing in additional water for the purpose of the north Salinas Valley, how is that effecting urban and ag for the south Valley, southern Valley, south or southern. And the last one is again, being much more liberal in how we use questions and addressing Number. 8 with the policies and plans for our County versus, I assume Nacimiento Lake, for the Nacimiento Lake area. Is that the last one? The last one I.was a little confused on.

Supervisor Pinard: Actually, the being more liberal in the questions was probably if something occurs to you afterward, the specific direction on that was to just to add in historical use and agreements. 20-40

Clerk: So the fourth one was historical use and agreement. (cont'd)

Supervisor Pinard: Right.

Clerk: Thank you,

Chairperson Achadjian: Also have received direction from the Counsel that we send a copy
of the proceedings that took place here today. I don't know if that
has to be part of the motion or direction. Part of the motion.

Clerk: Also the letter that is drafted for your signature needs to be amended also so it will need to be retyped, because it only addresses Attachment A and you now have this Attachment B.

Chairperson Achadjian: Okay, Supervisor Ryan. Sending a copy, would that be part of your motion?

Supervisor Ryan: Yeah, that's be part of the motion.

14

AR 02217

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-236 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Chairperson Achadjian: And the second concurs?

Supervisor Pinard: Yes.

Supervisor Ryan: And one other thing on 6. On the south end of the Valley, they identified current use of that water, if we're moving it to the north
end and utilizing it, as it's currently used in the south end, and identified as some long-term water for south end, is it going to
change.

Chairperson Achadjian: Any further discussion on the motion? Supervisor Ovitt?

Supervisor Ovitt: Let me offer a suggestion on where to put that language. The one on the redistribution system that was the first one. You go into Item Number 4, four, sixth sentence down, it says the Draft EIR never considers a potential impacts of addressing only part of the seawater intrusion problem and in that case I was going to put in there, or make the suggestion that it would be either like an i.e. in paragraphs or parenthesis that it would be the expanded redistribution system, because it's not including impacts of addressing the other parts of the problem and the other part of the solution to the seawater intrusion was the expanded distribution system, if I recall. And again, in that expanded distribution system, ' is the Marina/Ford Ord, ties it all together. It's all in that same 20-40
area, is what I'm trying to say. So the language you're talking about can be put in there and address everything you're talking (cont'd)

about.

Supervisor Pinard: Well, Harry, the only thought is that sometimes if you start getting one paragraph down to 15 different lines and then the thought often gets lost. Sometimes keeping your sentences, and that's why I was going to keep the distribution question really simple, just make them answer it.

Supervisor Ovitt: Yeah, but Number 4 basically, when you're talking about the Ford Ord/Marina area is talking about a majority of that redistribution
area.

Supervisor Pinard: Yeah, I just, I want to be sure they don't start hiding behind lengthy questions and lengthy paragraphs and let's make sure they answer that it one, because it came up both from Mr. McKee and from a lot of us in terms of what's going on. Where it's heading.

LETTER 20

San Luis Obispo County, Board of Supervisors
Khatchik H. "Katcho" Achadjian, Chairperson
August 21, 2001

20-1 It is noted that an encroachment permit may be required for work along and closure of Lake Nacimiento Drive. MCWRA will attain all necessary permits prior to implementation of the proposed projects and will adhere to all permit conditions.

20-2 The operational alternative to the proposed project, Subsurface Diversion and Increased Use of Recycled Water (Alternative B), is essentially the project proposed previously by the MCWRA and evaluated in the 1998 draft EIR. Both the proposed project (Alternative A), which is described in Chapter 3.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS, and
Alternative B (described in Chapter 4.0) would include the diversion of surface water during normal and above-normal water years and more reliance on groundwater during dry years when surface water supplies are unavailable due to reservoir water elevations dropping below the outlet works. Hence, both involve a "conjunctive use" approach. Alternative A and Alternative B would have the same impacts on visual resources and recreation because water surface elevations at Nacimiento and
San Antonio reservoirs would be affected to about the same extent under the two alternatives. However, Alternative A is the preferred action because it would have fewer environmental impacts, overall, than Alternative B and would also achieve the project objectives of stopping seawater intrusion and providing adequate water
supplies.

20-3 A drought is not identified by an elevation level that is reached in a reservoir but by climatic conditions such as precipitation and runoff into the reservoirs. Under the
SVWP, the operations of the reservoirs in periods of drought would be conducted in order to maximize the stream recharge component of the project and to meet water right obligations. Surface water diversions and recreational opportunities would likely be curtailed when there is a prolonged drought condition that results in low reservoir levels.

Operation of the SVWP in dry years would depend on a number of factors,
including results of groundwater monitoring, level of demand for water, and amount of recycled water available to meet water demand in the CSIP area. Because the MCWRA is unable to anticipate these various factors, specific operations cannot be specified at this time.

20-7 Table 5.4-4 has been amended to include the additional data provided by San Luis Obispo County and is included in Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS.

20-8 In response to the commenter's request, a copy of the Pete Soderberg letter (in response to the 1998 NOP) is included in Appendix B of this Final EIR/EIS.

20-9 The exhibits presented by the commenter are applicable to the proposed project and are herein incorporated to the Draft EIR/EIS. As depicted in the comment attachments (Exhibits 2 and 3), recreation opportunities are substantially diminished based on boat ramp availability at the 730-foot elevation level. Further, at 730 feet elevation, less than half of the maximum surface area of the lake is available. This further substantiates the conclusions in the Draft EIR/EIS that the project's increase in lake level reductions is a significant impact to recreation and visual resources.
Please see Master Response MR-2:
20-10 Please see responses to Comments 19-1 and 19-24. Please refer to response to comment 19-22 regarding the graphical representation of monthly reservoir flows at Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs under baseline and project conditions.
20-11 Although the proposed project has the potential to affect lake levels at Lakes Nacimiento and San Antonio, it would not affect other factors influencing recreation
(i.e., air temperature, holidays, economic indicators). Therefore, the Draft EIR/EIS
only evaluates how changes in lake levels resulting from project implementation
would affect recreational activities at the aforementioned lakes. However, please also see Master Response MR-2.
20-12 Please see Master Response MR-10.
20-13 Please refer to Master Response MR-2. Note that reducing diversion rates during
below normal periods would result in an insufficient amount of water to meet the
objective of halting seawater intrusion. During droughts when water levels in the lake fall below the outlet works, no diversion will occur, but at that point lake levels
will be far below 730 feet and the recreational/visual impact will result.
20-14 Please see response to Comment 3-4 or see Master Response MR-5.
20-15 MCWRA will be required to attain an encroachment permit for construction work near the dam spillway. Note that all two-way closures are proposed to be limited to 15 minutes, 4 times a day (see page 5.10-18 of the Draft EIR/EIR. All public notification requirements included as part of permit conditions will be strictly
adhered to. The Community Association at Oak Shores may request project-specific information from MCWRA as needed.

20-16 The commenter's request to include an additional mitigation measure that prevents transit mix trucks to spill concrete roads is noted. However, it is impossible to GATZO
E
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-241 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

guarantee that transit mix trucks would not spill concrete on the project roadways during construction activities. The Draft EIR/EIS includes mitigation measures for construction-related safety hazards from tracking of mud or gravel, which would require the construction contractor to clean paved roads leading to and from the construction site during the construction period. The mitigation measure would also apply to concrete spills on roadways.
20-17 It is noted that San Luis Obispo County currently collects traffic impact fees for projects at Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores, which are intended for roadway improvements along Nacimiento Lake Drive, and that the fund is not capable of implementing any roadway improvement projects at this time, nor in the foreseeable future. This does not alter the conclusions in the Draft EIR/EIS.

20-18 The commenter's request to include an additional mitigation measure that addresses one-way traffic closures is noted. The following mitigation measure has been added to the EIR/EIS (see Chapter 3.0 of this document). Page 5.10-18 of the DEIR/EIS is revised to include:

Construction-Related Road and Lane Closures (Alt A-1, Alt A-3, Alt B-1, Alt
B-5).
One-way traffic closures shall not occur on Fridays or weekends during the peak recreation season (May 1'* - September 30th), or during any morning or evening peak times (7-9 AM and 4-6 PM) on Monday through Thursday.
20-19 Typical construction activities would occur between 7 AM and 6 PM. However,
there are times when it is more practical to perform construction activities during nighttime hours. In these instances, construction activities that may require prolonged closures, defined as closures longer than 15 minutes, would be limited between 12 AM and 5 AM.

20-20 The commenter is requesting employment data pertinent to recreation-related
activities at Lake Nacimiento. According to Water World Resorts, there are total
of 120 recreation-related jobs (60 full-time and 60 part-time) at Lake Nacimiento
Resort (Heath, pers. comm., 2001). In addition, there are approximately 70 recreation-related jobs in the local area, including Monterey County parks personnel.
For a more detailed discussion, please see Master Response MR-6.

20-21 Please refer to Master Response MR-6.

20-22 Please see Master Response MR-5.
20-23 The commenter questions whether the model used for the Draft EIR/EIS analysis is outdated and notes that it been only "partially updated," but does not specify in what sense the model may be outdated. The Draft EIR/EIS evaluation is not based on is an
outdated model. The model is up to date and provides a solid foundation for prediction of the Basin's hydrology. The model simulates conditions based on the
46-year hydrologic period from October 1948 through September 1994 that ecEZO
§

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-242 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

represents a wide range of hydrologic and climatic conditions. Extending the hydrologic period an additional six years from October 1994 to September 2000 was not deemed necessary because projected land and water use estimates used in the analysis have not changed, and review of the extra hydrologic data indicated that incorporating the data into the extensive set of data already being used in the model analysis was not warranted. The purpose of using the model is to assess the impacts of the SVWP under a wide range of hydrologic and climatic data, which the existing model accomplishes with the 46-year hydrologic period. See also response to Comment 19-5, Master Response MR-1 and Master Response MR-4.
20-24 Please see Master Response MR-1.

20-25 The preferred alternative is intended to halt seawater intrusion to all areas of the
Salinas Valley, including the Marina/Fort Ord area. As noted in Figures 5.3-22, 5.3- 23, 5.3-51, and 5.3-52, the SVWP would benefit the Marina/Fort Ord area in the
same manner as the Castroville area.

The expanded distribution system is described and evaluated at a conceptual level in the Draft EIR/EIS (see pages 3-23 and 3-24 for a preliminary description). If
monitoring of project effectiveness were to indicate that an expanded distribution system is necessary in the future to meet the project objectives, more detailed
analysis of monitoring data would be conducted to determine where an expanded distribution system would be placed to achieve optimum benefit. At that time, a project level environmental analysis would be conducted to assess the impacts and effectiveness of different distribution system alternatives and describe in greater detail the location of the distribution system. Given that the need for such a system is highly speculative, and may never be needed, additional detail and analysis at this time is not warranted. See also response to Comment 3-9.

It must also be noted that the project's "impacts" on seawater intrusion are only beneficial. Thus, if the project were not as effective as modeled in some areas of the
basin - and this Is not expected the "impact" would be that the beneficial effects were not as great as hoped. But in no cases would adverse impact to groundwater quality be expected.
20-26 Please see response to Comments 3-9 and 20-25 regarding the expanded deliveries. The effects of conditions under expanded deliveries are evaluated in Section 5.9. See
the references to future (2030) conditions. For example, Tables 5.9-8 and 5.9-10
provide information on reservoir surface elevations under 2030 conditions with and
without the project. The recreation impacts summarized on pages 2-16 and 2-17 apply to both the existing and future SVWP scenarios. As can be seen, 2030 conditions slightly reduce the magnitude of impacts to recreation (and visual resources), as more of the diverted water would be composed of recycled water than current conditions (because more recycled water would be available).

20-27 A nitrate management workplan to stop nitrate contamination in the Basin is not
included as part of the current project but is the subject of separate planning efforts by the MCWRA. Section 4 of the 1998 Draft of the Salinas Valley Water Project 02224

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-243 E
Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Nitrate Management Program outlines the five-year program MCWRA is currendy
using. At the end of this first five-year period, the program will be evaluated for its effectiveness. It is during this time that strategic planning for the next five-year
phase of nitrate management will begin.

It is not anticipated that nitrate management will affect the long-term use of recycled water such that more water from Nacimiento would be needed in the future. As
shown in Table 5.4-9 of the Draft EIR/EIS, nitrate concentrations in recycled water
are lower than the Salinas River, and together the concentrations are far below existing well concentrations and drinking water standards.

20-28 The information presented in the Draft EIR/EIS represents the best information available at the time of its preparation. At that time, Monterey County's General Plan Update was in preparation and not available for public use. Because Monterey County subsequently released for public review a first draft of its general plan update
on December 18, 2001, (6 months after the Draft EIR/EIS was released)
information provided in this update need not be incorporated into the Final EIR/EIS. According to $15125(a) of the CEQA Guidelines, "An EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time of the notice of preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time environmental analysis is commenced, from both a regional and local perspective. This environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines
whether an impact is significant. It is also important to note that while the General
Plan Update for Monterey County is available for public review, the EIR for the General Plan has not been completed and the General Plan is only a draft (Anderson, pers. comm., 2002). Until it is adopted, the potential growth resulting from the plan cannot be relied upon.

As to the issue of "moving water to the northern end of the valley," the south end of the Salinas Valley, like the north end, relies on groundwater, and the basin is recharged by water in the Salinas River, including releases from Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs. As described on page 5.3-8 and 5.3-48 of the Draft EIR/EIS,
modifications in releases from these reservoirs from reoperation will increase
groundwater levels in all areas of the Basin (including the Upper Valley Subarca,
which is the south valley). This would provide for a better balance of groundwater in the south valley area. In other words, more water would be available for beneficial uses, including agriculture.
20-29 MCWRA has the discretionary authority to approve the Salinas Valley Water Project. As such, it is the appropriate CEQA Lead Agency. The SWRCB is a Responsible Agency under CEQA due to its permitting authority for water rights for the project,
as well as its oversight over seawater intrusion.
20-30 The Draft EIR/EIS describes those policies in the San Luis Obispo County General Plan, Nacimiento Area Plan, that are applicable to the proposed project, including Policy 1 for the Environment and Policy 18 for Public Services. Please refer to 5.1-4 of the Draft EIR/EIS. page 02225

20-31 The commenter has requested considering whether the Draft EIR/EIS should be recirculated for additional review based on the generation of "significant new information". Recirculation is not needed. is

As evidenced by this document, the Draft EIR/EIS generated a substantial number of comments and the responses have resulted in generation of a large amount of new information. But the question is whether this should be considered significant new information that requires recirculation.

NEPA Requirements

Section 1502.9(c) of the Council on Environmental Quality NEPA Regulations hold
that : supplement to a document (which is the same, in this case, as recirculation) must be prepared under the following circumstances:

(ì) The agency makes substantial changes in the proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; or

(ii) There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action and its
impacts.

CEQA Requirements
CEQA is much more specific in identifying the kind of information that would require recirculation for additional public review. CEQA Guidelines $15088.5 describes the conditions under which recirculation is required. Provided below is the relevant discussion from the Guidelines.

"(a) A lead agency is required to recirculate an EIR when significant new information is added to the EIR after public... (review of the draft EIR).. but before certification. As used in this section, the term "information" can include changes in the project or environmental setting as well as additional data or other information. New information added to an EIR is not "significant" unless the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate
or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the project's proponents have declined to implement. "Significant new information" requiring recirculation include, for example, a disclosure showing that:

(1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or
from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented. 9CZZO
E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-245 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance.

(3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different
from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the environmental impacts of the project, but the project's proponents decline to adopt it.
(4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and
conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded…
(b) Recirculation is not required where the new information added to the EIR merely
clarifies or amplifies or makes insignificant modifications in an adequate EIR.

Is Recirculation Required?
In considering the CEQ NEPA Regulations, it can be concluded that supplement, and therefore recirculation for public comment, is not required. There are no substantial changes in the proposed project. None of the environmental circumstances surrounding the project have changed. And, while there is a large amount of information that amplifies on the impacts of the project, none of the information provided by this commenter, or any other commenter, results in a change in the significance of any identified impact. Thus, based on NEPA, a supplement (which would require recirculation) is not warranted.
Consideration of the CEQA Guidelines leads to the same response. While there are numerous comments on significant environmental impacts, no new significant environmental impacts are identified by this or any other commenter. Information
is added to amplify on previously identified significant impacts, but this information
does not change the significance or make more severe a previously identified impact. A number of additional alternatives and mitigation measures are identified in comment letter 20 and in other comments throughout this document. However, in
no case has a suggested new, feasible alternative or mitigation measure, considerably
different from others previously analyzed, and which would clearly lessen the impacts of the project, been identified and rejected by the lead agency. A number of new alternatives and mitigation measures are suggested by commenters, and in each case the feasibility and ability to lessen enyironmental impacts is considered. In some instances, new mitigation has been added to the EIR/EIS; in others, a new alternative or mitigation is considered but rejected for one or more of the following
reasons: (1) environmental impacts would not be lessened, (2) the mitigation or alternative is not feasible for cost, legal, or technical reasons, or (3) the alternative or mitigation is not feasible because it would substantially hamper the ability of the project to meet its primary objectives of halting seawater intrusion. For these reasons, it is concluded that recirculation is not warranted under CEQA.
suggests that the MCWRA may not be using a variety of means to 20-32 The commenter
meet its water needs, but this is not an accurate portrayal. For instance, substantial 47ZZ0

conservation is practiced in the region (see Master Response MR-5). Added to that, the MCWRA completed Phase 1 of its long-term goal to halt seawater intrusion on April 15, 1998. On this date, the MCWRP, consisting of the CSIP and the Salinas
Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) became operational and began producing recycled water for use in irrigated crops. During calendar year 2000, over 11,000 AF of recycled water was used for irrigation in lieu of groundwater pumping. However, additional supplemental water is needed to halt seawater intrusion. The purpose of the SVWP is to provide that additional supplemental water supply to halt seawater intrusion. See also responses to Comment 3-4. Regarding the use of Nacimiento Reservoir, please also see Master Response MR-6.
Regarding "implications" to San Luis Obispo County, MCWRA has an agreement that up to 17,500 AFY of Nacimiento Lake water is for San Luis Obispo County's diversion for beneficial uses, and this project would not alter that agreement. Please see Master Response MR-10,
20-33 The Salinas Valley, and particularly the City of Salinas, has a very low per capita water consumption rate compared to that of other arcas of the state. Please sce
Master Response MR-5 for more information on water conservation in the Salinas
Valley.
20-34 Please refer to response to Comment 20-30.
20-35 The commenter's statements regarding property values surrounding Nacimiento Reservoir and San Antonio Reservoir are noted; please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a discussion regarding project impacts on regional and local economics and
property values.

As for the statement regarding the project components, the project requires all five
physical/programmatic components (modification of the Nacimiento spillway; reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs; Salinas River recharge, conveyance, and diversion, distribution/delivery of water; and delivery area pumping management) to meet the objective of the proposed project of halting seawater intrusion; none of the aforementioned components could individually halt seawater intrusion. Thus, they are considered as one project.

Also, please refer to MR-9 concerning the impoundment.

Also, please refer to response to Comment 3-8 concerning how all components of the project are needed to accomplish project objectives.
20-36 While it not entirely clear, it appears that the commenter is referring to the 1995 Monterey Agreement, which was designed to facilitate water transfers among contractors of the State Water Project. In September 2000, the Third District Circuit of Appeals ruled that the EIR prepared for the 1995 Monterey Agreement was invalid and that DWR, as the lead agency under CEQA, must prepare a new Monterey Agreement EIR based on the provision and transfer of "real" water and not "paper" water as had been done in the previous EIR. 02228

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-247 E

Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The Monterey Agreement has no bearing on the proposed project and is not considered in this EIR/EIS.

20-37 The results from the hydrological model used to evaluate the proposed action indicates that seawater intrusion would be halted with the proposed diversion, continued recharge of the Basin, and use of recycled water in the short-term and,
potentially, in the long-term although an expansion to the delivery system could be required in the future. Please refer to Section 5.3 (Hydrology and Flooding) for a complete description of hydrological impacts.
No information is provided that refutes the conclusions of the hydrologic analysis.
20-38 If an expanded distribution system is necessary in the future to meet the project objectives, a more detailed analysis of monitoring data will be conducted to
determine where an expanded distribution system would be placed to achieve
optimum benefit. At that time a project level environmental analysis will be conducted to assess the impacts and effectiveness of different distribution system alternatives and describe in greater detail the location of the distribution system. Please see the discussions on pages 3-23 and 3-24 of the Draft EIR/EIS concerning why a future delivery system is only conceptually planned and evaluated at this time.
20-39 The preferred Alternative addresses impacts on all areas of the Salinas Valley, including the Marina/Ft. Ord area. As noted in Figures 5.3-22, 5.3-23, 5.3-51, and 5.3-52 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the SVWP would halt seawater intrusion in the
Marina/Fort Ord arca. Please see response to Comment 20-25.
20-40 No further response is necessary as no environmental issues are raised. Proposed wording changes to the County's comments on the Draft EIR/EIS were incorporated into their comment letter and responded to in response to Comments 20-1 through 20-39, above.

Dear Mr. Smith,
The Monterey County Parks Department has reviewed the Draft Environmental Impact Report /. Environmental Impact-Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project, dated June 2001, and has the following comments:

Table 5.8-2 shows the proposed change in average monthly surface elevation at Lake San Antonio will be 31 feet. This represents a reduction of over 100,000 acre-feet. This condition would result in the North Shore launch ramp being marginally suitable and most of the shoreline camping areas being high and dry. Attendance would decrease 21-1

dramatically (50%- 70%) and direct revenue losses would be expected to exceed $500,000 to $700,000. In addition, the South Shore facility would suffer losses in the 25% 40% range with direct revenue losses of up to $300,000. Revenue losses at Lake San Antonio alone could exceed $1,000,000 for the parks operations. The concession operator would also experience severe revenue losses. Mitigation measures should be considered to offset these losses.

Table 5.8-5 shows the proposed change in average monthly surface elevation at Lake Nacimiento will be 21 feet. This represents a reduction of approximately 66,000 acre-feet. This will result in many of the private launch ramps becoming non-serviceable late in the summer and will result in lower visitations and revenue losses in the range of 20% - 30%. 21-2

This could reduce parks revenues by as much as $200,000. The concession operator would suffer significantly greater losses. Mitigation measures should be considered to offset these losses.

AR 02230

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-249 Response 1o Comments on the EIR/EIS

Section 5.9-3 Mitigation Measures and Residual Impacts states that it would not be feasible to mitigate for the reduction in the number of 730-foot lake level days at either 21-3.
Lake San Antonio or Lake Nacimiento. We propose that potential mitigation measures were not given serious consideration and need to be re-evaluated in consultation with the Monterey County Parks Department, the concessionaire at both Lake San Antonio and Lake Nacimiento, and the landowners around Lake Nacimiento.

Section 5.6 Fish Biology states that the project with alternates A and B will have a less- than-significant impact on the fisheries at Lake San Antonio and potentially significant impacts on the fisheries at Lake Nacimiento. We question the conclusion that lower lake 21-4
levels of 32 feet and 21 feet respectively and increased releases of 100,000 acre feet and 66,000 acre feet respectively can have less-than-significant and only potentially significant impacts on the lakes fisheries. We also question the degree to which mitigation measures were given serious consideration and recommend that additional mitigation measures be
considered.

There appear to be gross inconsistencies between the various tables and descriptions of the amounts of additional water to be released from the lakes. With respect to the reoperation of the reservoirs, additional release figures are listed in numerous sections. 21-5
These figures don't seem compatible with the amounts stated as additional water needed. In addition, the projected lake levels don't seem compatible with the amounts projected to be released from the lakes. The correlations between the amounts of additional releases, the resulting projected lake levels, and the additional water to be introduced into the CSIP and groundwater basin needs to be reevaluated.

Sincerely,

John Pinio

Re: DEIR/DEIS, Salinas Valley Water Project
Dear Mr. Smith,
Upon reviewing this document, based on my education, experience, and knowledge, the proposed improvements will not be effective in stopping intrusion. My real concern and the purpose of this letter, has to do with what is nothing short of significant fiscal chaos that would result from the reduced water levels as set forth in Table 5.8-5.
These proposed levels are nothing short of "economic homicide" for lakeside 22-1
communities, including the Village of Heritage Ranch. Property values reportedly will be reduced in excess of $100 million in exchange for a project that cost some $16 million and designed to gain a mere average 27,000 acre feet of water per year. This exchange is, from an inclusive fiscal perspective, clearly upside down!
While it may be true that CEQA does not require consideration of fiscal impacts from a proposed project, to turn a blind eye to what is a so clearly a significant fiscal impact on the property owners and businesses in San Luis Obispo County would be a major travesty.
would also comment regarding the issue of water use priorities (flood, conservation and recreation), the irrefutable and inescapable fact remains that for many years, entire communities, as well as significant commerce now exist due solely-to the presence of 22-2

Lake Nacimiento. This must be recognized and considered within the approval process
for this project.
It is therefore requested that on behalf of those impacted by the proposed reduction in
water levels. that any re-operation plan incorporate a minimum elevation of 740, 22-3

22-1 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a discussion of the economic and property value effects of the project at both Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio. It is important to note that the objective of the project is to halt seawater intrusion, in basin that produces over $2 billion in agricultural crop value annually and in an area where more than 150,000 people rely on groundwater. Please see Master Response
MR-1.

22-2 The operation policy for Lake Nacimiento was recommended by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency Reservoir Operations Committee and adopted by the MCWRA Board of Directors on April 24, 2000. The water use priorities established by the Reservoir Operations Committee, aside from flood storage capacity, are conservation and recreation. The importance of recreational uses of Nacimiento Reservoit was acknowledged and covered in great detail in the Draft EIR/EIS. The Draft EIR/EIS analysis concluded that making the conservation releases necessary to halt seawater intrusion and meet demand for water would significantly affect recreation, The MCWRA would attempt to mitigate the impact of reservoir reoperation on recreation to the extent possible. Mitigation to reduce the impact is included in this Final EIR/EIS. See Master Response MR-2 for additional discussion.

22-3 The commenter's request that any reoperation plan incorporate a minimum elevation of 740 feet is noted. The hydrologic model indicates that lake levels would be required to fall below the 740-foot level, substantially below in some years, to meet the objectives of the project. Thus, the request to hold reoperation to a 740-foot level is not a feasible mitigation measure. The revised modeling performed since completion of the Draft EIR/EIS shows that effects of SVWP operations on reservoir elevations would be less than reported in the Draft EIR/EIS; however, the significance conclusions presented in the Draft EIR/EIS have not changed. See Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0 for a description of the revised simulations and results.

P.O. Box 930 WATER RESOURCE Salinas, CA 93902-0930 AGENCY

Subject: Salinas Valley Water Project: Draft Environmental Impact Report/Draft Envirormental Impact Statement (DEIR/DEIS)
DearWyr. Meyer:
The Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) congratulates the MCWRA and the ACOE on the publication of the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP) DEIR/DEIS. This important document includes much useful information, and it represents the next step in a lengthy and complex process to achieve the objectives stated in the opening chapter: (1) to halt seawater intrusion, (2) to provide adequate water supplies to meet 2030 needs, and (3) to improve the hydrologic balance in the Salinas groundwater basin.
The MCWD hereby provides the following written comments on the DEIR/DEIS:

1. It is doubtful that the proposed project will halt seawater intrusion. As stated numerous times throughout the, document, the proposed project - which includes delivery component that provides Salinas River water to only the agricultural users within the Castroville. Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) area (approximately 12,000 irrigated acres as shown in Figure 3-3) - has been designed to halt seawater intrusion in the Salinas groundwater basin. The text on page 2-1 states seawater intrusion is to be halted by hydrologically balancing the basin. Intrusion is seen in Figures 1-2 and 1-3, and encompasses an area far greater than the CSIP area. Delivery to the CSIP area will not 23-1
likely hait intrusion; and, in particular, these planned deliveries will have an insufficient effect on intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area. Figure 1-3 which depicts the extent of
intrusion in the critical 400° aquifer distinctly shows there are two primary areas along
the coast where intrusion enters the basin: one near Castroville, and one near Marina.

The most recent intrusion data (1999) prepared by the MCWRA and as seen in Figures 1- 2 and 1-3, indicates significant movement of saline water from the Monterey Bay in the Marina/Ft Ord area from earlier data. The amount of (1999) movement may be

AR 02235
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-254 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Mr. Bob Meyer August 27, 2001
Page 2

attributable to the fact that monitoring and data collection in prior years did not include the Marina/Ft Ord area as comprehensively as it did the CSIP area. Nevertheless, the Agency's 1999 data clearly indicates there is a real and possibly urgent problem in the Marina/Ft Ord area. Decreasing pumping in the CSIP (Castroville) area may help the overall groundwater basin begin to recover thereby decreasing intrusion in the basin, but
if the project is implemented as designed, with only delivery to the CSIP area, the 23-1
Marina/Ft Ord area will not receive the level of protection required to halt intrusion. As a (cont'd)
result, the wells that currently provide 100% of the Ft. Ord potable water supply will be in danger of contamination.
On page 7-5, the document states, "Further, more municipal/industrial growth is expected in the Salinas/Marina/Ft Ord area, where seawater intrusion is a more
immediate issue, than in more southerly areas of the Salinas Valley.' We would agree with this statement and note that while decreasing pumping between Salinas and the coast should improve the situation in the 400° aquifer for the Salinas area, this project would do little to control or halt intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area.

Page 2-3, states that, "...hydrologic modeling shows that the project may not halt seawater intrusion in the long-term future (2030). If this were to occur, additional
distribution capacity will be created in a new pipeline and water would be delivered 23-2
outside the CSIP area to ensure project objectives are met and seawater intrusion is halted." We suggest that the available data clearly indicates that the project will not halt intrusion today in the Marina/Ft Ord area, and that the Agency will be ill-advised to delay the expansion of the delivery system by any amount of time, much less 30 years.
Page 2-3 also states, "The hydrologic model used for the project shows that seawater
intrusion would be halted in the short term, but may not be fully halted in the long term 23-3
(2030). Seawater intrusion is not halted through deliveries to only the CSIP area in the long term. An expanded delivery system and expanded deliveries would be necessary to halt seawater intrusion in the long-term future.' We request that the hydrologic model used for the project be specifically run to depict how this project would halt seawater intrusion in the short term in the Marina/Ft Ord area.

Page 5.2-9 states, "This expanded distribution system would parallel the existing CSIP
pipeline from the proposed diversion facility to a new turnout point, as displayed in Figure 3-3. Where the document discusses an expanded distribution system for the 23-4
it project (Alternative A), it indicates a parallel pipeline in an easterly direction to Highway
183, and then presumably south toward Salinas (see Figure 3-3 Legend: "Parallel
Pipeline (If needed))". Figure 4-1 (Alternative B) more appropriately indicates the

location of potential pipeline alignments that would be required to move diverted Salinas River water to areas of distribution in Salinas, Marina and Ft Ord. Page 4-9 states that
Alternative B includes three delivery options: - Maximize agricultural deliveries, 2 - 23-4
Maximize Urban Deliveries, and • Combination of Agricultural and Urban Deliveries. We believe that delivery option 2 or 3 would be needed and designed to deliver diverted (cont'd)
water to the Marina/Ft Ord area to ensure intrusion is halted in this area.
Page 3-23 states, "...without the preferred project the current groundwater problems in the basin are projected to continue in the future. Therefore, preferred project water is 23-5
needed to offset groundwater pumping in order to meet the stated project objectivelneeds..." We generally agree with this statement. Project water is needed to help achieve the stated objectives. We disagree with the preferred project's delivery area.
Page 3-23 continues, "It is MCWRA's strategy to target delivery of diverted SVWP water so •that it is (sic) has the greatest potential to efficiently meet the proposed project's objectives/needs. This would best be accomplished by making deliveries in the northern area of the Basin and correspondingly reducing withdrawals from the 180- and 400-Foot 23-6

Aquifers in that area.' We would agree that it is critical to carefully target the diverted SVWP water so that it has the greatest potential to meet the project's objectives/needs. We strongly disagree with the proposed CSIP delivery area. The project's delivery system should be designed now as part of the preferred project to halt the advance of seawater intrusion toward the Salinas and the Marina/Ft Ord areas.

Page 3-23 continues, "...the MCWRA determined that most or all of the primary project objective could be met by delivering water to agricultural uses already using a combination of MCWRA recycled water and groundwater." We request to see output 23-7
from the hydrologic model that demonstrates that most or all of the intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area would be halted by delivering diverted SVWP water to the CSIP
system.

Page 3-23 continues, 64 While the SVIGSM indicates that seawater intrusion will be halted by the project (in conjunction with the CSIP deliveries) based on (1995) demands, with a projected increase in water demands (primarily associated with urban 23-8
development) in the north valley area in the future, seawater intrusion may not be fully halted based on 2030 projections. For the year 2030, the modeling indicates seawater intrusion may be 2,200 AFY with surface water deliveries only to the CSIP area. This is substantially less than the 10,500 AFY of intrusion that would occur without the project"

AR 02237

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-256 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Mr. Bob Meyer August 27, 2001
Page 4

Again, we request hydrologic model output that demonstrates intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area 180' and 400' aquifers would be halted based on 1995 demand. While the reduction of nearly 8,000 AFY of intrusion would be significant, the remaining 23-8
(modeled) 2,200 AFY does not come close to meeting project objectives. And, these gross numbers do not address the need to halt intrusion along the entire coast line, (cont'd)
specifically in the Marina/Ft Ord area.
Page 3-24 states, "...The project could potentially halt intrusion in 2030 with deliveries only within the CSIP system.…..However, SVIGSM modeling does demonstrate that the
delivery of an average 18,300 AFY of SVWP water in combination with recycled water to .CSIP and agricultural uses outside of the CSIP area would fully halt seawater 23-9

intrusion. We believe that in order to meet the project objective of halting intrusion, this level of diversion and the incorporation of an expanded delivery system - outside the CSIP area (as identified as Phase 2 during the Public Hearing) - will be required. The longer the Agency waits to come to this conclusion, the more irreversible the damage will be in areas of the basin's aquifers.
2. The Preferred Monitoring Program is insufficient. On pages 3-25 and 3-26, the preferred monitoring program is briefly described. It states, in part, "...the MCWRA is proposing to tailor, and supplement where necessary, existing monitoring efforts…Monitoring will occur over time. It will determine if the proposed project is
successful in halting seawater intrusion based on current demands and in the future, with deliveries to only the CSIP area. If the SVWP is not successful at meeting project objectives, additional facilities (e.g., expanding the distribution / delivery area) would be considered at a future date.' As stated above in our preceding comments, the MCWD believes that the preferred project (Alternative A) as proposed and described in this 23-10
document would fail to achieve the primary objective: to halt seawater intrusion in the basin. The coastal monitoring program is an integral component of any SVWP alternative. Current, accurate information about the status and location of intrusion must
be available to all water users in the basin. We believe •that the "tailoring" and "supplementing" of the existing monitoring will have to be significant to produce a strong program that is capable of providing accurate, comprehensive information about
intrusion all along the coast and as far inland as is necessary. Only such a complete and
integrated monitoring system - that fully includes the Marina/Ft Ord area - will be capable of providing reliable data to be used to help determine the need for additional facilities or management strategies. As an enhanced monitoring program is essential to the success of the SVWP, it should be more fully described in the DEIR/DEIS.

3. The hydrologic modeling conducted in support of the preparation of the DEIR/DEIS is not sufficient. At the bottom of page 5-1, the document provides three reasons why the SVIGSM was not updated to do reruns of Alternative B. Paraphrasing the three reasons, the documents states that (1) impacts on the reservoirs and river are similar to Alternative A; (2) its costly to do model runs; and, (3) Alternative B is no longer the preferred alternative, and the model's accuracy is sufficient to compare Alternatives A and B.
Further, on page 5.3-11 the document states, in part, "Nevertheless, the results of the 1998 EIR modeling of Alternative B compared with hydrologic conditions defined using the same model yield generally the same relative level of change as would result from using the updated model. 23-11
Before this project can be supported as the preferred project to halt seawater intrusion in the basin, it must be demonstrated that the project is capable of halting intrusion. Not merely in gross, basin inflow-outflow calculations, but demonstrating intrusion will be halted across the entire coastal/basin interface. Ultimately, the Agency must not be persuaded to opt for the least expensive alternative without convincing data that demonstrates that once implemented it will completely solve the problem. The water users in the Salinas Basin can not afford to wait to learn whether or not the proposed preferred project -- delivering diverted Salinas River water to only the CSIP area -- can achieve the primary objective of halting intrusion. This is an especially imperative issue for the water users in the Marina/Ft Ord area. Without a delivery system to provide diverted water to the Marina/Ft Ord area to be used to reduce the amount of ground water pumping in this area (as in the CSIP area to the north, between Salinas and the coast) intrusion is likely to continue its inland movement in the 180' and 400' aquifers. This would have significant and costly impacts on MCWD operations for our Marina and Ft Ord customers, who pay Zone 2/2A assessments, and who, presumably, will be asked to help pay for this SVWP.

4. MCWD Allocation. Page 7-9 states that MCWD has access to 4,400 AFY of Basin
water. The 1996 Annexation Agreement and Groundwater Mitigation Framework for Marina Area Lands identifies: 3,020 AFY as MCWD's limit of potable groundwater 23-12
from the Basin for land in the Marina area outside the former Ft Ord Military
Reservation; to be increased by 920 AFY if the Armstrong Ranch is annexed into the
Zones; and further increased by 500 AFY if the Lonestar property is annexed into the
Zones. The EIR/EIS should likewise clarify this 4,440 AFY total possible MCWD
allocation.

In summary, the MCWD supports a Salinas Valley Water Project that (1) can obtain the required permits for all components, (2) can be reliably operated in accordance with stated procedures, (3) includes a delivery system that delivers new supplemental water supplies to targeted areas designed to uniformly halt seawater intrusion along the coast, (4) hydrologically balances the basin, (5) provides adequate water supplies to meet 2030 needs, and (6) is supported by equitable assessments or charges based on demonstrable cost-benefit analysis among participants.
Our primary concern is that the SVWP described in this DEIR/DEIS will not achieve the majority of these objectives or benchmarks. When the MCWD annexed into Zones 2/2A in 1996 by signing the Annexation Agreement and Groundwater Mitigation Framework for Marina Area Lands, along with the MCWRA, City of Marina, Armstrong and Lonestar, the District voluntarily agreed to limit its groundwater extractions in the basin and to •conserve and help manage the basin's water resources. In exchange for this voluntary limitation and commitment, and the $2.45 million in required annexation fees which were dedicated to the Basin Management Plan (BMP) process, the MCWRA agreed to a BMP that includes benefits for the Marina area, including consideration of the Marina area for a Basin alternative to groundwater pumping in the Marina area. Three years prior to that, in 1993, the US Army annexed the lands of the former Ft Ord into 23-13

Zones 2/2A at a cost of over $7 million and agreed to take no more than 6,600 AFY from the Salinas Basin. In that agreement, the County committed to providing the Ft Ord lands a replacement water supply system to provide a long-term, reliable water supply and protection for the residents and property owners of the former military installation.
The DEIR/DEIS does not seriously consider the Marina/Ft Ord area for a BMP/SVWP alternative to groundwater pumping as called for in the 1993 and 1996 annexation agreements. Rather, the Agency has described a project that will provide distinct direct benefits to the CSIP growers, and, hopefully identifiable benefits to the Salinas area in slowing or halting intrusion in that portion of the Pressure Area. MCWRA's strategy as stated in the DEIR/DEIS is to put this project in-place in the Castroville area now and wait for years as a more comprehensive monitoring program is completed to see if seawater intrusion is halted. It is doubtful that this project will halt intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area as can be seen by overlaying the DEIR/DEIS Figures 1-2, 1-3 and 3- 3. Clearly, reduced pumping in the CSIP area will have an insufficient effect to the south. In order to halt the southern intrusion front, pumping in the 180' and 400' aquifers will need to be curtailed and/or a supplemental source of water supplied, specifically to replace or augment the existing Ft Ord wells.

The Marina/Ft Ord area has been identified by the County as an area of great economic importance. The redevelopment of the former military installation lands depends primarily on the availability of a reliable, sustainable source of water. Without such a water source, the thousands of new housing units, the hundreds of thousands of square feet of new educational/commercial/industrial space, and the thousands of new jobs planned for the former installation will be jeopardized.
Finally, by focusing on the proposed project components as described - (Nacimiento Spillway Modification/Reservoir Reoperation, River Diversion, and CSIP Delivery) - as the solution to seawater intrusion in the basin; as the means to balance the basin
hydrologically; and, as the source of water supply to 2030; we believe the Agency sends an incorrect message to the public: that this relatively inexpensive project will be 23-13
sufficient to achieve these objectives. Hydrologic balance may be achievable in the Castroville area, but that has never been the objective of the BMP process. The Agency (cont'd)
has historically sought to design, build and operate a project that would protect all basin water users. Certainly, the documented presence of accelerating intrusion in the Marina/Ft Ord area, the more than $10 million paid to the Agency which enabled the BMP/SVWP, the voluntary commitments in the Marina/Ft Ord area to limit groundwater extractions (the only such voluntary commitments in the entire basin), and the critically important role this area is slated to play in the County's economy, all argue for an SVWP that provides a complete solution. We can not wait many more years while more square miles of irreplaceable aquifer storage is polluted to conclude that the Marina/Ft Ord area must be included in a comprehensive solution.
The MCWD respectfully requests that the MCWRA consider moving forward with the SVWP and that the Agency commit to immediately designing, evaluating and incorporating an expanded delivery system, identified as Phase 2 during the Public Hearing, that will bring supplemental water to where it is perhaps needed most: the Marina/Ft Ord area. The MCWD can not support a project that does not include delivery
of supplemental water to this area.

LETTER 23

Marina Coast Water District
Michael D. Armstrong, General Manager August 27, 2001

23-1 Please see response to Comment 20-25. As discussed, the SVIGSM shows that seawater will be halted under short-term conditions in the entire basin, including
Marina/Fort Ord, and that the system may need to be expanded to extend deliveries in the long term. It is acknowledged that this is based on modeling, which is a predictive tool. However, there are no other tools available to better evaluate the ultimate fate of intruded seawater, and the commenter offers no substantial evidence to support the conclusion that seawater will not be halted.
23-2 Please see response to Comment 20-25. The expanded delivery system would be proposed to be implemented at such time that monitoring of SVWP performance it indicated that it was not effective in stopping seawater intrusion (if such a result were found), based on an extensive monitoring system (see Section 3.2.7 of the Draft EIR/EIS).

23-3 Please see response to Comment 20-5. Because it would be speculative at this time to design a distribution system based on unknown future conditions, only a conceptual system is considered in this EIR/EIS.

23-4 The commenter's preference for delivery option 2 or 3 under Altemative B is noted. As discussed above and previously, it would be premature to commit to any specific delivery options if seawater intrusion is not halted in the future. Hydrologic
modeling shows that seawater intrusion is halted in the short term and may not be in the long term. The modeling calculates the fate of over 300,000 AFY in the Salinas River and determines seawater intrusion would be halted, with 1,000 AFY flowing in the groundwater basin out to the ocean. In the long-term (year 2030), modeling shows that seawater intrusion is predicted to occur at a rate of 2,200 AFY without an expanded distribution system. However, it needs to be recognized that these are modeled results only and both results (short term and long term) show that the project operates on the margin of whether seawater intrusion would be halted. Given this conclusion, it would be imprudent to commit to design and construction of a system that further expands deliveries when it is not known if an expanded system will be needed and, if so, where. Hence, the MCWRA is committing to an extensive monitoring system (see Draft EIR/EIS Section 3.2-7), the purpose of which is to determine project success and any needed adjustment, including an expanded distribution system. See also response to Comment 20-25.

23-6 Please see responses to Comments 20-5 and 23-4.

23-7 Figures 5.3-20, 5.3-21 (short term), 5.3-49 and 5.3-50 (year 2030) show the data from the modeled output results that reflects both annual average and modeled hydrologic
information on the fate of seawater intrusion. The attached tables show the same
information that is included in the figures. Raw data output from the models is
available for review at the MCWRA offices, 893 Blanco Circle, Salinas.

23-8 Please refer to response to Comment 23-7.

23-9 Please see responses to Comments 20-25, 23-2, 23-4, and 23-7.
23-10 The MCWRA will redesign the current monitoring network to maximize ground water data accuracy and minimize data collection efforts. A consultant has produced a report that was received by the MCWRA Board of Directors in 2001 that proposes a phased implementation of a new network. Also considered are data needs and MCWRA resources (staff and funding). With the implementation of the SVWP, the current ground water network would be refined (engineered to better represent the ground water profile); this could mean expansion, or the elimination of some redundant wells to be coupled with the addition of other wells.

23-11 Alternative A was not identified as the preferred alternative in place of Alternative B solely as a result of cost issues. Aspects of some of the Alternative B components presented potential regulatory and operational barriers and placed in question the feasibility of those components and the success of future operations and maintenance. See, for instance, comment letters 6 and 9. Monitoring of the effectiveness of Alternative A would be conducted before and after implementation
to determine whether expansion of the delivery areas would be necessary in the
future. Please refer to response to Comments 23-1 and 23-4 concerning the precision of modeling.
•23-12 The Draft EIR/EIS has been amended to clarify the total possible MCWD allocation. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document.
23-13 The latest information available to date suggests that Alternative A would halt seawater intrusion. There is no evidence to the contrary in this or any other comments submitted on the Draft EIR/EIR. It is also acknowledged that modeling
is predictive and that results show success, but marginally. This is why a monitoring program is also proposed. Please see Master Response MR-1 and response to Comments 20-25, 23-1, 23-2, and 23-4. This is not to suggest the MCWRA will stop its planning efforts aimed at halting seawater intrusion. It does suggest, however, that the best available information shows Alternative A will halt seawater intrusion
(although an expanded distribution system may be needed).

Re: Draf Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Proiect, SCH #2000034007

Dear Sirs:
This firm is general counsel to the Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee (NRWMAC). These written comments are submitted by NRWMAC on the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas SCH #2000034007 (the DEIR), under the provisions Valley Water Project (the Project), of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), California Public Resources Code, the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) and associated regulations (collectively, the Governing Statutes). NRWMAC hereby incorporates by reference its various oral and written comments on various previous versions of the DEIR and the
Project.
NRWMAC applauds the action of the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) in developing plans for better management of the Salinas River Basin. Unfortunately, numerous fatal flaws doom the DEIR to inadequacy. Principally, the DEIR fails to honestly and accurately take account of impacts of the Project on northern San Luis Obispo County (SLO) and the region surrounding Lake Nacimiento (the Lake).
In particular, it is timely and appropriate to make the modifications to the Lake Nacimiento spillway contemplated by the DEIR and the Project description. NRWMAC supports these modifications.
The fundamental misguided and legally unacceptable element of the Project is the so- 24-1
called "reoperation" of Lake Nacimiento. This fatuous and oft-used euphemism for

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-263 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

drastic reductions in lake levels at Nacimiento will have dramatic and legally indefensible 24-1
adverse environmental and economic consequences for the communities around the Lake and for Northern San Luis Obispo County, (cont'd)

Another fundamental flaw dooms the DEIR and the Project. The DEIR fails to fully consider and discuss another project alternative that would greatly enhance available water resources in Monterey County. This alternative is construction of additional impoundment and recharge areas along the Salinas River in Monterey County (the 24-2

Conjunctive Use Alternative, or CJA). Employing the CJA would result in substantial enhancement of stored water in the Salinas Basin during the winter months. It would also aid in moving management of the Basin toward a Safe Yield position.
Finally, the DEIR and the Project ignore an obvious and appropriate (indeed, legally required) approach to mitigation of the myriad Project. Such a course of mitigation adverse environmental impacts of the is possible and if the Project is implemented it must 24-3
be adopted under the Governing Statutes. This mitigation would be a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. Such a program would result in conservation of water resources and some element of mitigation of the substantial adverse environmental impacts on Nacimiento and northern San Luis Obispo County. Lake

As. will be detailed below, in light of the many clear and fatal flaws in the DEIR and the Project-concept, the Governing Statutes and settled California and federal law require that the DEIR be withdrawn and substantially revised.
During the revision period, a careful and honest study of the full range of adverse consequences of the Project must be undertaken by the MCWRA. NRWMAC believes that such an evaluation may demonstrate that the central goals of the Project can be achieved by eliminating the reoperation of Lake Nacimiento element of the Project, and substituting for it a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County,

1.0 Public Services The DEIR inaccurately states that "the proposed action would not have a measurable effect upon or result in the need for new or altered governmental services for fire
protection. See p. 1-12. In fact, the Project would greatly increase the need for SLO to provide fire protection services to residents and other operations surrounding the Lake. 24-4
Depletion of local water resources from the Lake would render non-furictional, or dramatically decrease the functionality of existing infrastructure for fire protection around the lake, necessitating that SLO put in place appropriate protective measures.

2.0 Utilities
The DEIR inaccurately states that "the proposed action would not result in a need for new, or alterations to existing, communication systems, sewer systems, or solid waste disposal practices.' See p. 1-13. In fact, the Project would dramatically reduce the availability of potable water to residents and other operations around the Lake, requiring replacement of these services and making available of additional water resources.
The DEIR acknowledges that Lake Nacimiento is already a drinking water supply, and is a potential supply for larger areas of San Luis Obispo County. See. P. 5.4-13. But, as with many of the adverse environmental impacts on San Luis Obispo County and the
Lake, the DEIR downplays the importance of the Lake as a water supply. 24-5

Furthermore, the DEIR declines to offer obvious mitigation for loss of potable drinking
water supplies, which would result from the Project. Mitigation is possible and if the Project is implemented it must be adopted under the Governing Statutes. This mitigation would be a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. Such a program would result in conservation of water resources and some element of mitigation of the substantial adverse water resources and related utilities impacts on Lake Nacimiento and San Luis Obispo County.

3.0 Inexcusable Delay of Action by MCWRA The DEIR attempts to depict a crisis situation regarding seawater intrusion, requiring implementation of the Project to offset the crisis. See pp. 1-1 and ff. In fact, the MCWRA and its predecessors have delayed and procrastinated for decades taking proper local action to stem seawater intrusion. Such prior action could have obviated the drastic
consequences propoged by the Project.
The DEIR notes at p. 1-2 that the seawater intrusion problem is over 50 years in the
making (1946 State DPW Report). Better management in past decades would have 24-6
obviated the need for the Project with extreme and unacceptably high impacts in San Luis Obispo County.
The MCWRA has not made a reasonable attempt to operate the Salinas Basin in a Safe Yield balance. In fact, the MCWRA has not undertaken a diligent and appropriate study to determine the Safe Yield of the Basin. To permit the MCWRA to implement this Project at this time would reward this pattern of failure of sound management and neglect by the MCWRA and its predecessors, insulating them from past inadequate practices at the expense of the residents, wildlife, endangered species, natural and human habitat, and the economy of San Luis Obispo County.
Conservation by agricultural users, by domestic and municipal users, and better management of intruded areas, purchasing of out of area water, etc. all could have mitigated the "problem" identified by the DEIR. AR 02246

None of these steps have been taken: In particular, failure to institute metering and appropriate pricing of agricultural water in Monterey County are clear errors of management by the MCWRA. To this day, such water usage metering and fair pricing are still not being done.
The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in 1996 recognized this 24-6

failure of management and proper action by MCWRA when it initiated proceedings to (cont'd)

adjudicate the Salinas Basin. The Project is, among other things, a thinly veiled, and
highly ill considered, last minute attempt to forestall this adjudication.
NRWMAC notes that agricultural deliveries from the well-designed Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP) began in April 1998 and are laudable advances. But more should have been done, and much earlier.

4.0 Effects on Aesthetic Value of Lake Nacimiento
The DEIR acknowledges this impact. See p. 2.16. However, it substantially downplays this impact and declines to offer obvious mitigation. Mitigation is possible and if the Project is implemented it must be adopted under the Governing Statutes. This mitigation would be a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. Such a program would result in conservation of water 24-7

resources and some element of mitigation of the substantial adverse Aesthetic impacts on Lake Nacimiento.

5.0 Effects on Recreation at Lake Nacimiepto
The DEIR acknowledges this impact. See p. 2.16. However, it substantially downplays this impact and declines to offer obvious mitigation. Mitigation is possible and if the Project is implemented it must be it adopted under the Governing Statutes. This mitigation would be a program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. Such a program would result in conservation of water 24-8

resources and some element of mitigation of the substantial adverse Recreational impacts on Lake Nacimiento.

6.0 Effects on Species and Habitat at Lake Nacimiento
The DEIR acknowledges this impact, and notes the wintering of Bald Eagles and other Sensitive Species at Lake Nacimiento. See p. 5.5-10. However, it substantially downplays the adverse impacts of the Project on these and other species, and declines to offer obvious mitigation. The substantial reduction in Lake levels contemplated by the reoperation of the Lake would reduce babitat for these species and inevitably adversely effect species well being. 24-9

Mitigation is possible and if the Project is implemented it must be adopted under the Governing Statutes. This mitigation would be program of agricultural water conservation, water metering, and appropriate water pricing in Monterey County. Such a 02247

of the substantial adverse Species and Habitat impacts on Lake Nacimiento, (cont'd)

Another stark flaw in the DEIR is its failure to list the area around Lake Nacimiento as among the Sensitive Biological Resources affected by the Project. See p. 5.5-13. This 24-10
flaw must be corrected in a redrafted DEIR.
At a minimum, the DEIR must be withdrawn and revised to provide for mitigation of the Project by acquisition and development of habitat sufficient to replace habitat, which will be lost or damaged by reoperation of Lake Nacimiento. 24-11

7.0 Domestic Water Use The DEIR provides a detailed account of domestic water use in Monterey County. See
Pp. 5.4-30-37. But the DEIR ignores domestic water use of affected waters at the Lake and in Northern San Luis Obispo County. Under well-settled California law, domestic and recreational water use, and the aesthetic and species-enhancing uses of surface waters of the State, are recognized beneficial uses of water. Yet, the DEIR all but ignores the 24-12
validity and importance of these water uses within the Lake region and Northern San Luis Obispo County. As noted above, domestic water supply to the Lake region and the north county area would be substantially and permanently impacted by the Project. The DEIR must be substantially redrafted to take account of and study these impacts, and provide appropriate mitigation.

Conclusion
In conclusion, in light of the many clear and fatal flaws in the DEIR and the Project concept, the Governing Statutes and settled California and federal law require that the DEIR be withdrawn and substantially revised in order to accurately, and in a legally sufficient manner, take account of the adverse environmental impacts of the Project. 24-13

LETTER 24

Nacimiento Regional Water Management Advisory Committee (via WSP Environmental North America) Edward L. Quevedo, Esq. August 28, 2001

24-1 The commenter does not indicate the basis for stating that the reservoir reoperation component of the SVWP is "legally unacceptable" and that the impacts of this component would be "legally indefensible." The EIR/EIS meets the requirements
of CEQA and NEPA regarding disclosure of impacts. The EIR/EIS describes the anticipated benefits and potential impacts of the proposed project, including impacts on recreation fish biology, terrestrial biology, visual resources, and traffic at Lake Nacimiento. The lead agencies' decisions regarding project approval will take these factors into consideration. Where feasible mitigation is available to reduce the impacts of the project, such mitigation is included in the EIR/EIS. See Master Response MR-6 for a discussion of the potential economic effects of the project. See Master Response MR-2 for a description of mitigation that has been considered to reduce the effects of the proposed project on recreation.

24-2 The commenter suggests the EIR/EIS is flawed because it did not address a new alternative that is being suggested in this comment. The suggested alternative is vague and appears to borrow from elements of alternatives previously considered by the MCWRA. It includes recharge, which is included in the preferred alternative and construction of impoundments, which were considered in Alternative B and in the 1998 Draft EIR (See Master Response MR-8). There is no discussion of how the water would be delivered from the channel to the impoundments, the quantities, and how this would balance the basin. Further, without any details it is not possible to determine what the environmental impacts of this alternative would be, how those
impacts would compare to the other alternatives considered, and if the objectives of the project can be met. No other response can be provided.
The preferred project, Alternative A, is a is a conjunctive use project. It includes recharge of the groundwater basin as well as diversion of river water.

24-3 Please see Master Response MR-5.

The commenter makes reference here and throughout this comment letter to
"Governing Statutes," but does not reference which statutes are relevant to the comments. Without a more specific reference, no response can be provided.

24-4 The commenter does not explain how the fluctuations in lake levels, which occur under current conditions but would be more frequent and pronounced with the project, would render fire protection resources non-functional. If this were the case, USZZO

these resources would be non-functional under existing conditions. No other response can be provided without additional information. See also response to
Comment 162-7 and Master Response MR-2.

24-5 San Luis Obispo County provides communities, such as Heritage Ranch, water from its annual allotment of 17,500 acre-feet from Nacimiento Reservoir. The proposed project will not affect that allotment. See Master Response MR-10 regarding this issue. Regarding conservation, please see Master Response MR-5. Regarding "Governing Statutes", see response to Comment 24-3.
24-6 This comment, regarding the timing of the MCWRA's efforts to address seawater intrusion and hydrologic balance in the Basin, do not raise any issucs related to the adequacy of the Draft EIR/EIS analysis. Therefore, no further response is required.
Please refer to Section 1.3 on pages 1-4 through 1-9 of the Draft EIR/EIS for a summary of the evolution of the SVWP, particularly in the last two decades. See
Master Response MR-1.
It bears noting that the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs were constructed by the predecessor to the MCWRA primarily to aid in halting seawater intrusion and for flood control and was a first step in solving a problem identified long ago. The MCWRA completed phase of its long-term goal to halt seawater intrusion in April 1998. As noted by the commenter, in April 1998, MCWRP, consisting of the CSIP
and the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) became operational. During calendar year 2000, over 11,000 AF of recycled water was used in lieu of
groundwater pumping. Additional supplemental water is still needed to halt seawater intrusion, and the SVWP is proposed to provide that additional supplemental water
supply.

24-7 The Draft EIR/EIS identifies a significant and unavoidable impact to visual resources at both reservoirs as result of reservoir reoperation.
The commenter proposes mitigation measures such as water conservation, water
metering, and appropriate water pricing. Please see Master Response MR-5.

24-8 Please see Master Response MR-5 regarding conservation as mitigation for lake level impacts and Master Response MR-2 regarding mitigation for recreational impacts.

24-9 The Draft EIR/EIS adequately addresses the project's effects on bald eagles and other sensitive species at Nacimiento Reservoir. The Draft EIR/EIS acknowledges that the project could result in a very slight decrease in the food availability for bald eagles but that this impact would be less-than-significant. Potential impacts on other sensitive species in the project are were also determined to be less-than-significant.
CEQA' and NEPA do not require mitigation for impacts that are determined to be less-than-significant. Therefore, no mitigation is necessary to mitigate impacts to bald eagle or other sensitive terrestrial species. In addition, there are no sensitive fish species in Nacimiento Reservoir. See also response to comment number 21-4. Regarding "Governing Statutes," see response to Comment 24-3. "GCO 59220

24-10 The habitats surrounding Nacimiento Reservoir were not listed as sensitive biological resources because they are common locally and statewide. The biological resources associated with the area around Nacimiento Reservoir, including the plant and wildlife species that characterize this area, are described in the Draft EIR/EIS (page 5.5-9 and 5.5-11). The habitats in the vicinity of Nacimiento Reservoir include annual grassland, blue oak woodland, and chaparral.
Terrestrial habitats surrounding Nacimiento Reservoir would not be significantly affected by the proposed project. As described in the Draft EIR/EIS, the proposed spillway modification and reoperation would not increase the high water level (i.e., area of innundation) at Nacimiento; rather, it would allow storage of higher (within the historic range) water levels for longer periods of time. Because the lake level would not be increase, impacts on terrestrial habitats surrounding the lake would be
less-than-significant. Likewise, impacts on wildlife that depend upon these terrestrial
habitats would be less-than-significant.

Subject: Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environment Impact Statement, Salinas Valley Water Project, Monterey County, California

Dear Mr. Smith:

The Montercy Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) supports the
Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP).
We are proud of our partnership with the Monterey County Water Resources Agency that has resulted in the successful Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, which are now
supplying over 11,000 acre-feet of recycled water each year to help reduce seawater intrusion. The new water supply that would be provided by the SVWP is needed to
finally eliminate seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley.

The SVWP will also help assure the long-term availability of recycled water for use in 25-1

urban areas where water shortage problems also exist.
The MRWPCA submits the following comments on the Draft EIR/EIS:

General Comments
1. Use of recycled water as part of any of the alternatives needs to take into account the need to provide a portion of the recycled water produced by the Salinas Valley Reclamation Plant (SVRP) for urban uses. MRWPCA, in cooperation with the Marina Coast Water District, is planning an urban reuse project with projected demands of 1,500 AFY by 2005, and 3,000 AFY by 2010. Recycled water to supply the urban reuse demand is included in the terms of the 1992 Agreement between 25-2

MRWPCA and the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) for

Joint Powers Authority Mamber Entities: Boronda County Sanitation District, Castroville Service Area 14, County of Monterey, Del Rey Oaks, Fort Ord, Marina Coast Weter District, Monterey, 02253

construction and operation of the MCWRP, An amendment to this Agreement that 25-2

will further clarify the quantities and timing of urban uses will likely be approved in October 2001. (cont'd)

2. Little is mentioned in the EIR/EIS regarding the impacts of major flows, and flooding, from the Salinas River on the facilities that comprise the preferred alternative (Alternative A). As an essential element of this alternative, the diversion structure and the nearby pumping station would be heavily impacted by a major flood, such as recently occured in this location in 1995. Presumably debris and silt would inundate the area immediately upstream of the diveraion structure, and the
station, and would likely clog the fish screens and pump station intake 25-3

pump structure. It would take time to clean and repair these facilities before the system
would again be operable. A late season flood would leave little time before the start of the normal peak irrigation season in the spring. This needs to be taken into account, to ensure that the growers in the CSIP area continue to receive adequate water deliveries to maintain their crops.

3. Once the preferred alternative is operational, there should be an immediate reduction in the amount of water that has to be provided to the CSIP by the existing supplemental wells. This would improve the local seawater intrusion situation in the CSIP area, and particularly in the immediate vicinity of these wells. However, this 25•4
will also impact the sodium absorption ratio (SAR) of the water provided to the growers, since the SAR of the diverted river water will presumably differ from the SAR of the wells. This needs to be addressed, as the growers have a high concern for the SAR of the water supplied to on the soil. them, because of its effects on crop productivity and

4. No mention is made of treating the river water before diverting it into the CSIP under Alternative A. With many growers using drip irrigation systems, it is essential that the water they are supplied contain negligible amounts of suspended solids. The
Salinas river water appears to often have much higher levels of turbidity and 25-5

suspended solids, including appreciable amounts of algae, than either the recycled water or well water the CSIP growers are currently receiving. This is shown in the data and discussion on pages 5.4-10 through 5.4-16. This needs to be addressed and, if necessary, treatment facilities should be included in this alternative.

Comments on Specific Pages of the EIR/EIS
Page 1-7: Foomnote to Table 1-2 indicates that approximately 13,300 AFY will be
delivered by the MCWRP. There is no indication of how this quantity was determined. 25-6

operational data of the MCWRP. unless the recycled water plant is operated in the winter 25-6

months, and plant modifications are constructed. (cont'd)

Pages 2-2 and 2-3 (Regarding the Surface Diversion/Impoundment and Delivery components): It would be desirable in this section of the document to describe the concept of blending of the diverted river water with the recycled water, so as to provide a homogeneous blend of the two waters to all users of the CSIP. This would be responsive 25-7

to grower concerns regarding variations in water quality from turnout to turnout, and also would help provide more stabilized SAR for the water that is delivered. This
information is included elsewhere in the document, but is not summarized or mentioned
in this section.

Pages 2-4 and 2-10: Under the description of Recycled Water Storage and Delivery for Alternative B, we believe the storage of recycled water through injection into the 400 ft.
aquifer is not the best choice of storage locations. We believe storage in the 180 ft. aquifer, in the already heavily intruded area near the intersection of Highway 1 and 25-8

Molera Road, is a more desirable and feasible location. We believe obtaining permits and approvals from the regulatory agencies would be much casier in this location. In addition, injection in this location may not require a redesignation of the aquifer as non- potable, because it is already heavily seawater intruded.
Page 3-12: The maximum the delivery of recycled water from the SVRP, when the design flow of 29.6 MGD is reached, will be approximately 60 cfs. This is slightly 25-9

higher than the maximum flow of 50 to55 cfs cited in the report.
Page 3-14: The screen (slot) opening of 0.175 mm in the fish screen seems extremely small to avoid continuous plugging, given the amount of sediment and other solids 25-10
present in the Salinas river water.
Figures 3-7 through 3-9: It would be easier to understand the design intent depicted in these figures, if the profiles and sections shown in Figures 3-8 and 3-9 were referenced to 25-11

cut sections shown on Figure 3-7.
Page 3-22: The second paragraph discusses controls that would be involved in operation of the pump station. These controls would have to be integrated into the controls currently associated with operation of the CSIP, so that delivery of recycled water and 25-12

diverted river water into the CSIP can be properly controlled. Also, as noted in the comment above, it would be desirable to provide for controlled blending of the river water and recycled water to produce a homogeneous blend.
The third paragraph indicates that "it is anticipated that irrigation practices will change to provide more flexibility in operation." No explanation is provided for this 25-13
expectation, and we are not aware of any intent on the part of growers to change current irrigation practices.

Those records indicate that the total (recycled+well water) annual average CSIP demand will only be about 19,050 AFY. Also, as noted in the comment above, we are not aware of the basis of the projection of 13,300 AFY of recycled water. Operational records indicate that 25-14

an
average of only about 12,700 AFY of recycled water can be produced and utilized by the CSIP, unless storage facilities or other modifications to the SVRP are constructed.

Increased pumping from supplemental wells will increase seawater intrusion. It would seem that increased river diversions, rather than increased pumping, would more effectively achieve the project objective of halting seawater intrusion. 25-16

It is not clear whether the future 42-inch pipeline to serve the expanded CSIP distribution system would be interconnected to also receive recycled water. This should be clarified, and the impacts on delivery of recycled water to the existing CSIP should be 25-17

should be included in these alternatives, if this level of recycled water supply will be
required.
Pages 5.4-20 and 5.4-21: The text states that blending recycled water with Salinas river water will greatly improve the quality of water being delivered to the CSIP. However, no comparison is made to the current quality of the blended water, comprised of recycled water and well water. This data needs to be shown to justify this statement. •25-23

Table 5.4-9 shows only one set of data. However, the quality of the Salinas River
water surely varies scasonally, and perhaps annually as well. This table needs to be expanded to show the range of constituent concentrations over all 12 months of the year. 25-24
It also needs to account for the projected monthly changes in blending percentages of recycled and river water, in order to have a true understanding of the quality of water that will be delivered to the CSIP growers..

LETTER 25

Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency Robert S. Jaques, Director of Engineering Planning and Technology
August 28, 2001

25-1 The commenter's support of the proposed project is noted. No response is
necessary as no specific environmental issues on the Draft EIR/EIS were raised.

25-2 The MCWRA has entered into agreements with the MRWPCA and the Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) regarding recycled water supplies from the SVRP. The agreements presently provide MCWD with up to 300 AFY of recycled water that is available during the summer irrigation season. The remaining portion of the recycled water supply to MCWD is to be provided during the non-irrigation season, requiring storage by MCWD, This non-irrigation season supply of recycled water is consistent with the proposed operation of the CSIP project, wherein recycled water is to be blended with diverted Salinas River water during the irrigation season. The proposed use of recycled water for urban irrigation purposes by the MCWD is consistent with these planned uses.

25-3 The proposed diversion structure would be an inflatable structure that could be raised and lowered in a very short period of time (hours). The in-stream portion of the structure, when deflated, would lie flat on the streambed and would not cause the
collection of debris carried by flood water. The pump station and other facilities controlling the air bladder of the diversion structure would be located one foot above the 100-year floodplain as delineated by FEMA. If flooding caused debris to clog the fish screens and pump intake, the MCWRA would conduct manual cleaning prior to operation of the diversion facility, and this can occur in a very short
timeframe. If flooding were to occur, there is a high likelihood that diversions of surface water for irrigation would not be needed in the near term (due to ample rainfall); in such a case, there would be sufficient time for cleaning of the fish screens to occur before diversions were resumed.

25-4 Table 5.4-9 shows estimates of the water quality of the blended water that would be delivered to agricultural users under the preferred alternative (Alternative A). The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of the recycled water is 4.68 (5.7 adjusted SAR),
whereas the SAR of Salinas River water is 1.05 (1.13 adjusted SAR). It is estimated
that the SAR of the blended water would be 3.05 (3.63 adjusted SAR). As outlined in Table 5.4-1, permeability is a problem when adjusted SAR levels are 6.0 or higher. The blended water would be well below this value, however. Adjusted SAR levels for specific ion toxicity from root absorption, which affects mostly tree crops and woody ornamentals, should be below 3.0. Annual crops are found to be insensitive to this route of SAR exposure. See also response to Comment 25-23 below.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-277 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

25-5 The MCWRA is also. concerned about the water quality of the Salinas River for agricultural water, and is proposing to obtain additional water quality data prior to project initiation. Although not included in the project at the present time, treatment could be incorporated if it is found to be necessary. See also response to Comment

25-6 14-1, which adds this potential mitigation measure to the Draft EIR/EIS.
As noted in response to Comment 3-3, the total flow available from the plant varies, but is estimated to be approximately 21,000 AFY, based on flow for each month during the year. Irrigation requirements within the CSIP service area are at a maximum during June, July, and August, and are essentially zero during November, December, January, and February. Based on the irrigation requirements within the CSIP service area, the average annual recycled water use is estimated to be approximately 13,300 AFY; therefore, this is the amount assumed for purposes of project evaluation to be generated for delivery in the CSIP area. For the most recent

25-7 irrigation season, recycled water use was approximately 11,000 AFY.
One of the significant benefits of the proposed project is that it improves the consistency of blended water quality for all users in the CSIP area, given that all water would be blended at the point at which the diverted river water is pumped into the CSIP pipeline and mixed with the recycled water. The penultimate sentence in item 3 on Draft EIR/EIS page 2-3 has been modified as suggested by thie commenter. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of document. See also response to Comment 25-4 regarding SAR in the blended water.

25-8 Because the 180-foot aquifer is already intruded in the subject area, there was concern that withdrawal of injected water would also result in withdrawal of high TDS water, so the 400-foot aquifer was selected. Please note that because there are
numerous uncertainties regarding the operation of the subsurface storage component of Alternative B and numerous potential impacts associated with Alternative B that are not associated with Alternative A, the MCWRA is no longer pursuing Alternative B, and Alternative A is its preferred project. The MCWRA is therefore unlikely to develop this project concept further. See also response to Comment 6-5.
25-9 The commenter's correction of the maximum amount of recycled water delivery is noted. This difference does not substantively affect the operations or effects of the proposed project, and would not alter its environmental impacts.
25-10 The screen opening is based on NMFS criteria for protection of steelhead smolt. Air
backwash facilities are included in the diversion facility layout to provide the ability
to clean the fish screens on a regular basis.
25-11 As suggested by the commenter, Figures 3-7, 3-8, and 3-9 have been revised such that the profiles and sections of the proposed diversion structure shown in Figures 3-8 and 3-9 are referenced to the cut sections shown on Figure 3-7. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document

25-12 The second paragraph on page 3-22 of the Draft EIR/EIS has been revised based on the commenter's suggestions. Please refer to Chapter 3.0 of this document. 02259

Salinas Valley Water Project E

2-278 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

25-13 Changes in cultural irrigation practices have already occurred in the project area in the last few years due to the provision of recycled water to the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) service area. It is anticipated that irrigation practices will once again a change as a result of the proposed project by introducing another alternative water source to the CSIP service area. The surface water provided by the impoundment area proposed under Alternative A would encourage a reduction in groundwater pumping, which is the ultimate cause of seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley aquifers.
25-14 Based on information in Farm Water Report (October 1998), the CSIP area has an
annual demand of approximately 30,000 AFY. This is consistent with estimates of 2.5 acre-feet/acre use considered for this area.
25-15 Recycled water deliveries to the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project have increased from about 7,500 acre-feet in Fiscal Year 1998-1999 to about 11,000 acre-feet in Fiscal Year 2000-2001. Total urban water needs for the Salinas Valley are anticipated to increase from 45,000 acre-feet per year in 1995 to 85,000 acre-feet per year in 2030 (a 90% increase ) based on projected growth. A sufficient quantity of additional flow from urban areas to the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project will occur
to provide the additional 5,000 acre-feet of recycled water for use in the Castroville
Seawater Intrusion Project service area.

25-16 Supplemental pumping from private wells would be utilized only when deliveries of blended surface water and recycled water would not be sufficient to meet irrigation
needs. Even with the supplemental pumping, the Alternative A is still expected to
halt seawater intrusion.

25-17 The 42-inch pipeline contemplated for future expanded deliveries of SVWP water would be interconnected with the existing recycled water delivery system (i.e., the CSIP delivery system). The hydrologic model for the SVWP demonstrates that the delivery of an average of 18,300 AFY of SVWP water in combination with recycled water to CSIP and agricultural uses outside of the CSIP area would fully halt seawater intrusion in 2030. If it is determined that such an expanded delivery system is needed in the future, impacts on the delivery of recycled water to the existing CSIP system, would be analyzed at that time. If necessary, the expanded distribution system would be designed and constructed so that it would not adversely affect operation of the existing CSIP system.
25-18 As in Figure 3-3, an arrow is shown in Figure 5.3-33 to show the general location of
expanded deliveries, if such deliveries are needed. The dotted lines in the latter
figure show watercourses.

25-19 Please see response to Comment 25-8.

25-20 The signs shown for the recharge values in Figure 5.3-5 are reversed. For example,
the peak irrigation season recharge values should be shown as positive rather than 097ZO
EE

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-279 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

negative because recharge is higher with Alternative A compared with baseline or
existing conditions. See Revised Figure 5.3-5 in Chapter 3.0 of this document.
25-21 Please see response to Comment 24-14.
25-22 The requirements for future storage of recycled water are noted. In terms of the potential need for expanded deliveries in 2030, we note that the potential need is 15,900 AFY of the 25,600 AFY the MCWRCP is projected to be producing, and it is not known if storage is required for the 15,900 AFY alone. Importantly, this is not the currently proposed action, but is identified so that decision makers are aware of what could be required in 2030 if seawater intrusion is not halted. Additional environmental review would be required if expanded deliveries are needed.
In terms of impacts if storage of recycled water is needed in the future, Alternative B identifies impacts of storing water.
25-23 Table 5.4-9 shows the estimated water quality of the blended water (recycled plus Salinas River) under the SVWP. It is difficult to estimate the quality of delivered
water under present operations. The quality of this water can vary greatly within the CSIP area because of the locations of the groundwater wells used to supplement the recycled water supply. One benefit of blending the recycled water with the river water is to produce water that is of better quality than pure recycled water and of greater consistency than under present practices.
To halt the intrusion of seawater and future degradation of the groundwater used in the blended water in the CSIP area requires the elimination or substantial reduction of the pumping of groundwater. The use of river water will help not only to recharge the groundwater basin, but also to continue to provide very good quality water to agricultural users within the CSIP service area.
25-24 It should be noted that the surface diversion would be utilized only during the irrigation season (April to October), not year around. The Draft EIR/EIS reflects available water quality data. Even if it varies at different times of the year, the blended water is shown to be of sufficiently good quality that it is expected that water quality standards would be met over the entire irrigation season. Also, please see response to Comment 14-1.

However, the estimated increase is approximately 0.5 foot. It should be noted that groundwater recharge already occurs in this subarea and that most of the focus of Alternative A would be to raise the groundwater levels of the Pressure and East Side Subareas. It is not anticipated that the project operations would have any appreciable impact on the operation of the City of Soledad wastewater facilities.

Subject: Draft EIR/EIS on Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Mr. Meyer:
Thank you for requesting comments from the City of Salinas on the EIR/EIS for the proposed Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). We have reviewed the document. In general it appears to be a thorough and well thought out report on the potential environmental impacts of the proposed project and alternatives. There are a few comments, as follows:

1) Water quality and public health. A major concern to the City with any alternative is its effect on the water quality and resulting public health impacts. The EIR/EIS indicates that the present situation of groundwater overdraft and salt water intrusion in the Salinas Valley Ground Water Basin will not continue. This is an important 28-1

component of sustaining long-term water availability for both the citizens of Salinas, and the surrounding agricultural areas so important to the City's economy.

2) Water quality and public health. The City shares concern about any alternative that may have a potential'adverse impact on potable water quality. Recycled water option(s) appear to create this possibility, although it is not clear what affect this could have on City of Salinas water supplies. It would be helpful to discuss who 28-2

affected parties might be, and possible mitigations (additional treatment?) to reduce potential impacts.

3) Land use. Regarding the impacts of reductions in cultivated acreage (Alternatives C, D, E), even with no direct conversion of prime farmland to non-agricultural uses, 28-3
there appear to be likely urban growth implications. Additional discussion should be provided on these potential impacts.

Thank you again for the opportunity to comment.

28-1 The commenter confirms the importance of the project objectives. No response is necessary, as this comment does not raise any issues on the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS.

28-2 Under both alternatives that include the delivery of recycled water, in combination with surface water, to the CSIP area (Alternatives A and B), the delivered water would be for agricultural (non-potable) use only. Recycled water would not be supplied by the SVWP for urban or domestic use, such as drinking water. The SWRCB and others have expressed concerns regarding the operation of the subsurface storage component of Alternative B and its possible effects on potable uses. As contemplated, operations under Alternative B would ensure that all existing pumping for domestic uses with the impact and buffer areas of the subsurface recycled water storage area would be replaced by potable water system operated by the MCWRA. That system would provide groundwater pumped from outside the area of re-designation (described on page 5.4-32) to the existing customers within the re-designated area. It is estimated that approximately five existing domestic users are
located within the area of re-designation. The MCWRA recognizes that additional evaluation would need to be completed to ensure that this component of Alternative B would function as described and intended. Please see response to Comment 6-5 regarding this issue. Note that Alternative B is not being pursued as the preferred
alternative; Alternative A is.

28-3 As discussed in Section 5.1 of the Draft EIR/EIS, Alternatives C, D, and E would
not include any physical components, and thus would not directly convert prime farmland to non-agricultural uses. The commenter suggests that the EIR/EIS should provide additional discussion on the potential urban growth implications associated with this conversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses. This discussion is already provided for Alternatives C, D, and E in Section 7.2.2 of the
Draft EIR/EIS on pages 7-5 through 7-8.

City of Salinas Comments To The Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement For The Salinas Valley Water Project SCH#2000034007

The City of Salinas (City) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments.as they pertain to the Draft EIR/EIS for the proposed Salinas Valley Water. Project (SVWP). We have reviewed the document and have a few comments, which range from general comments to specific comments. They are as follows:

General Comments

• The City supports the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) and their efforts to reduce or halt seawater intrusion in the northern end of the Salinas Valley. With the seawater intrusion first being identified by the State of California in 1946 as described in Bulletin Number 52, it has been a long 29-1
time coming to a potential solution. The Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) was the first attempt to stop seawater intrusion, and while it may have slowed the seawater intrusion, it continues to move inland. Therefore, a complete long-term solution for both agriculture and urban areas should be considered to eliminate seawater intrusion and nitrate pollution to improve water quality and water quantity.
The City Storm Sewer System has a drain located at the Salinas River south of Davis Road. The proposed SVWP appears not to have an impact on the existing drain. However, due to the fact that the drain has been there and in 29-2
service for many years, if the proposed SVWP should create a problem for the drain in the future, any and all costs related to a solution should be paid for by the project and not by the City.
The City Industrial Waste Treatment Facility (IWTF) is located adjacent to the Salinas River on the east bank, north of Davis Road. Again, the proposed SVWP appears not to have an impact on the existing facility. However, due to the fact that the IWTF has been there and in service for many years, if the 29-3
proposed SVWP should create a problem for the facility in the future, any and all costs related to a solution should be paid for by the project and not by the
City.

Although, within the SVWP there is a clear "intent" on the part of agriculture to reduce or eliminate groundwater pumping in the CSIP in-order to reduce or halt seawater intrusion, there is no clear commitment, such as to destroy wells in the CSIP area in exchange for surface water. Therefore, agricultural

groundwater pumping may still occur in conjunction with water being provided 29-4
to agriculture by both the CSIP and SVWP. (cont'd)
Consider a discussion on the financial impacts throughout the entire Salinas Valley for the benefit of the SVWP. 29-5

To follow the Team's mission, the SVWP should include and address nitrate issues, as well as seawater-intrusion.

Page 1-9,"..distribution to agricultural sectors only (no urban deliveries)." a This is a clear statement that the urban areas receive no additional water from the SVWP. 29-7
This statement will be topic of discussion when it comes time to determine who is going to pay for this project.

Page 1-9, "If seawater intrusion continues in the future due to increased demands in the coastal urban areas, an expanded distribution system might be needed to deliver Salinas River water to areas outside the CSIP area. This statement is grossly inaccurate by blaming the "coastal urban areas" for "ALL" the future seawater intrusion. While agriculture will continue to utilize the wells in the CSIP area by continuing to pump groundwater in the Pressure and East Side sub-basins. Even with the SVWP agriculture has not committed to destroy any existing wells in the CSIP area. 29-8

Who receives water and benefits from the "future... expanded distribution
system?" Who would pay for the "expanded distribution system?" How much water from the "expanded distribution system" would be avallable to the City's benefit? The above statement should be modified to read as follows: "If seawater intrusion continues in the future due to increased groundwater pumping demands in the coastal areas, an expanded distribution system might be needed to deliver Salinas River water to areas outside the CSIP area. It

has not been determined who would fund the building of the expanded distribution system and/or receive water from the system."

Page 1-9, "A nitrate management workplan to stop nitrate contamination in the Basin is not included as a part of the current project but is the subject of separate planning efforts by MCWRA. The nitrate management program was initially developed as part of the Salinas Valley Water Project, Project Plan 29-9
Report Draft, October 1998." Due to the fact that the "nitrate management program was initially developed as part of the Salinas Valley Water Project* combined with the fact that the wells within the City are being polluted by nitrates, the City believes the project requires MCWRA to incorporate and address nitrate
issues.

1.5.2 Population & Housing Vs. 1.5.4 Public Services

• 1.5.2 Page 1-12, "The proposed action would not directly alter the distribution or density of a population, nor would it create a demand for additional housing." Furthermore, ...,and no project features would alter growth plans or support additional growth beyond what is currently planned." 29-10

. 1.5.4 Page 1-12, "As previously noted, the proposed action has the potential to induce growth by providing additional water supplies, which would create an additional indirect need for public services."
These two statements on the same page appear to contradict themselves and should be consistent from one section to the next. The water required for the proposed SVWP is to benefit agriculture only. Therefore, the SVWP provides no benefits or actual water "lo induce growth" in the urban areas.

2.1 Overview - Need For Action
Page 2-1, "The SVWP represents the local consensus approach to protecting the Basin's groundwater resources." To date, there has been no effort made by the MCWRA or any agency to conclude that there is a consensus for the SVWP This statement should be modified to more accurately reflect the true view 29-11
of agriculture in the northern part of the county. Example: "The SVWP represents the attempt by the MCWRA and agriculture in the northern part of the county to develop ai local consensus approach to protecting the Basin's groundwater resources, for agriculture only." 1ZZZO

2.2.1 Proposed Action and Applicant's Preferred Alternative (Alternative A) - Description
4. Delivery Page 2-3, "Hydrologic modeling shows that the project may not halt seawater intrusion in the long-term future (year 2030):" Ard "..additional distribution capacity will be created in a new pipeline and water would be delivered outside the CSIP area to ensure project objectives are met and seawater intrusion is halted.' 29-12
With the SVWP modeling indicating it may not halt seawater intrusion and
the statement being silent as to who will receive the water, the City suggests that the MCWRA consider the SVWP expanded distribution system at this time, and provide additional water to be made available-for the urban areas.

5. Pumping Limitations - Page 2-3, "In areas where project water is
delivered, groundwater pumping would be limited to peaking capacity and
deliveries during drought."

- An expanded discussion of how this will differ from the current operation 29-13
as it relates to groundwater pumping in the CSIP area should be included
A clear definition and a full explanation as to what constitutes a drought is necessary in order to understand the operational criteria that will be incorporated into the SVWP

7.2.3 Proposed Action Implementation & Growth-Inducement
Page 7-8, ",...is not based on whether it is delivered to agricultural users ör urban uses. Both of the uses draw the same water from the same
groundwater basin. Reducing withdrawal of groundwater in the northern Salinas Valley, whether through replacement of agricultural or urban pumping, has the same effect." The City does not agree with this statement, and believes it to be
misleading, While the wells that provide water to the City draws from the 29-14
400' and 900' aquifer's, agricultural wells are mostly in the 400' aquifer with some undestroyed wells in the 180' aquifer. Furthermore, as reported in the MCWRA Ground Water Extraction Summary Reports (1995-98), based on the annual average of total amount of groundwater pumped, agricultural lands in the Pressure and Eastside Zones pump nearly 600% (nearly 6 times more) more water than water pumped by the urban areas within the same Zones. Therefore, this is an extremely misleading statement. It should be corrected to reflect the actual reality and
conditions of the area, and clearly state that agriculture uses considerably
more water than urban areas, thereby, agricultural pumping has

considerable more effect on groundwater than urban areas, not that 29-14
"…agricultural or urban pumping, has the same effect." |(cont'd)

Page 7-9, "It can only be said that less, and possibly far less, of this population growth would occur without the project." This statement completely contradicts the statement made in 1.5.2 on Page 1-12, which states; "The proposed action would not directly alter the distribution or density of a population, nor would it create a demand for 29-15

additional housing." Furthermore, ..,and no project features would alter growth plans or support additional growth beyond what is currently planned." For constancy, the statement made on Page 7-9 in 7.2.3 Proposed Action Implementation & Growth-Inducement should reflect the statement made in 1.5.2 on Page 1-12.

Final Statements:

The SVWP appears to be the second attempt at slowing seawater intrusion, 29-16

with CSIP being the first.
Who will pay for this project still requires clarification. 29-17

• Consider doing the expanded distribution system now, instead of later. 29-18

The Nitrate issue is an Important component missing in the SVWP and must be included. 29-19

With a "True" commitment from the agricultural community to reduce pumping to a certain level (a targeted goal) with or without the water from the project, combined with the destruction of wells in the CSIP area, would certainly make 29-20

an impression on the public and would assist in building support for the
SVWP.

City of Salinas Public Works Department
John K. Fair, P.E., Public Works Director/City Engineer August 23, 2001

29-1 No response is necessary as no specific environmental issues on the Draft EIR/EIS were raised. Nitrate contamination in the basin is the subject of separate planning efforts by the MCWRA and are not part of the SVWP.

29-2 It is anticipated that the SVWP would have no impact on the City of Salinas drain. The impoundment area ends just south of Blanco Bridge. However, if the SVWP
were to have recognizable impact, the MCWRA would work to correct the impact.
29-3 It is anticipated that the SVWP would have no impact on the City Industrial Waste Treatment Facility. The impoundment area ends just south of Blanco Bridge.
However, if the SVWP were to have a recognizable impact, the MCWRA would work to correct the impact.

29-4 As described in pages 3-24 and 3-25 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the MCWRA would manage groundwater pumping in all areas receiving SVWP water. In response to the commenter's statement about destroying agricultural wells, wells would still need to be used in drought years, when the amount of surface water available for blending with recycled water is not high enough to meet water demand. This was included in the modeling assumptions for the project.

29-5 Pages 7-6 and 7-7 of the Draft EIR/EIS include a discussion of the potential financial and socioeconomic impacts on the agricultural industry in the Salinas Valley upon implementation of any of the no-project alternatives, No-Action/No-Action (Alternative C), No Action/Total Demand Management (Alternative D), and No
Action/State Adjudication (Alternative E). MCWRA has attempted in the past to
conduct economic impact analysis of providing/not providing waster to the Salinas Valley, but has found insufficient data availability to conduct even a marginally
accurate analysis.
29-6 The MCWRA is presendy implementing a staged approach to nitrate management separate from the SVWP. Please see response to Comment 20-27.

29-7 A Cost Allocation Committee composed of community stakeholders has been
established to address the issue of distribution of cost for construction, operation,
and maintenance of the SVWP. Their duty is to establish a cost distribution system
based on benefits received from the project as determined by an engineer's report required by Proposition 218. Ultimately, the outcome of the committee's work will 02274

Salinas Valley Water Project E

2-293 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

be approved or disapproved in a Proposition 218 ballot process. No additional response is necessary, as this comment does not raise any issues on the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS.
29-8 The MCWRA does not "blame" all future water demand on coastal urban areas, but notes that the coastal urban areas are projected to be the source of increased demand for water in the future. As indicated on page 7-5 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the shift in future agricultural land uses in the Salinas Valley (25% more vineyards and decrease in all other crops) coupled with water conservation and cropping patterns would result in a net reduction by 2030 of 60,000 AFY of water for agricultural uses. Therefore, the Draft EIR/EIS does not attribute any of the future increase in water demand to agriculture. Nevertheless, the commenter's suggested changes to the first full paragraph on Draft EIR/EIS page 1-9 have been incorporated. See Chapter 3.0 of this document.

Please see response to Comment 29-4 regarding the destruction of agricultural wells.
The commenter's questions about who would receive water from a future expanded delivery system and how the system would be funded - if it is needed - cannot be answered at this time. The necessity of expanding the delivery system would depend on the success of the SVWP as determined through long-term monitoring following
project implementation. The hydrologic modeling of the proposed SVWP indicates that it may not fully halt seawater intrusion in the future based on year 2030 projections of population and water demand; however, see response to Comments 23-2 through 23-4 concerning modeling. Therefore, the MCWRA can determine only that an expanded distribution system might be necessary for future project
operations. Because of these uncertainties, the expanded distribution system is
addressed programmatically in the Draft EIR/EIS. If this expansion were needed in the future, more precise planning and environmental analysis would be conducted. Please see response to Comment 3-9.

29-9 As noted in response to Comment 29-6, the MCWRA is presently implementing a staged approach to nitrate management.. The project is not "required" to include elements that are not proposed, unless it would not function without them. Such is not the case here. Also, please see response to Comment 20-27.
29-10 The SVWP is proposing to deliver project water only to the CSIP area, which serves agricultural users. However, the proposed action would halt seawater intrusion to the Salinas Valley groundwater basin, which serves both agricultural and urban users.
Seawater intrusion to the Salinas Valley threatens the water supply for both agricultural and urban users. Hence, solving this problem removes a potential obstacle to growth in urban areas that could ultimately be affected by seawater intrusion, including the City of Salinas. While water would be delivered to agricultural areas only, it affects the same basin underlying urban areas and benefits groundwater quality for both agriculture and urban uses. Consequently, delivering water in accordance with Alternative A would remove : significant obstacle to SZZZO growth but would not directly alter the pattern of growth. E

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-294 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

29-11 The comment is inaccurate: The Draft EIR/EIS text beginning in the last paragraph on page 1-8 and continuing on page 1-9 describes the process through which the proposed action was developed over time. As noted, the project was developed through a collaborative process and with much public input and has been developed to resolve public concerns while meeting project objectives. The history of this process is also presented in the 1998 SVWP DEIR. As described, the process to develop the project has been long, at times contentious, and has never satisfied all parties. The proposed project solves seawater intrusion and has gained wide, though
not total support.
29-12 The MCWRA will base any potential expansion on an analysis of monitoring data and the ability of the SVWP to halt seawater intrusion. Please see responses to Comments 3-9, 23-2, and 29-8.
29-13 A drought is considered to be a condition in which conservation releases from the reservoirs, coupled with treated water deliveries, are not sufficient in volume to meet irrigation needs in the CSIP area. The current operation of the MCWRP is to use as much recycled water as can be treated over a 24-hour period and then supplement that water supply with groundwater pumping from wells in the area. Pressures in the system are monitored, ensuring that adequate water supply is provided at the required pressure, first from the recycling plant and then from the supplemental wells. It is not uncommon for the recycling plant to be in operation at the same time that wells are pumping. As part of the SVWP, water impounded behind the diversion structure would become another component of deliveries that would be
second in priority to recycled water, with wells third in priority and being used only as needed to supplement the water from the other sources.
29-14 The passage from Draft EIR/EIS page 7-8 that is quoted by the commenter was intended to convey the idea that groundwater pumping to meet urban demands would have substantially the same effect on the Basin as an equivalent amount of groundwater pumping to meet agricultural demands. In the context of the material presented in Section 7.2.3- -qualitative discussion of effects of the SVWP on halting seawater intrusion and thereby removing an obstacle to growth-a reduction of a given amount of groundwater pumping, regardless of whether the groundwater is being pumped to supply urban or agricultural users, would have the same effect.
29-15 Please see response to Comment 29-10. Note that the project would remove an obstacle to development and growth as expressed in local general plans and by AMBAG, but would not provide infrastructure that would alter the pattern
development. of

29-16 Since 1998, the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, consisting of the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) and the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP), have supplied the Cästroville area with tertiary-treated recycled water to use for agricultural irrigation in lieu of groundwater pumping. Additional supplemental water is needed in order to halt seawater intrusion. The purpose of the Salinas Valley Water Project is to provide that additional supplemental water supply to halt seawater intrusion. 02276

29-17 Please see response to Comment 29-7.
29-18 See the discussion of the uncertainties surrounding the need for the expanded delivery system in response to Comment 29-8. Modeling of the SVWP indicates that the project, as proposed, can halt scawater intrusion under existing conditions by delivering water in the CSIP area; therefore, an expanded system would not be needed in the short term. It is not certain that the expanded delivery system would be needed in the long term (year 2030); the need for an expanded system would be based on monitoring of system performance over time.

Re: Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR/DEIS) Salinas Valley Water Project
Dear Mr. Smith and Mr. Meyer:
The undated notice on the noted project mailed on June 11,2001 contains in part the following:

Proposed action
(1) modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam and (2) "reoperation" of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to store higher volume of water in the wet season and allow higher releases of water into the Salinas River during the irrigation season.

Abstract
Unavoidable significant impacts would occur to visual and recreational resources at Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs as a result of short-term and operations -. long-term project

Given the above proposed action and abstract please consider the following:
1. Proposed actions (1) and (2) can and will likely affect on a long term basis property values and building options in San Luis Obispo County by setting new standards for 30-1
property improvements along and near the shoreline of Lake Nacimiento reservoir.
2. Major modifications to the existing spillway will seriously impact all traffic over the Nacimiento Dam for a considerable time span. All types of emergency service to the 30-2
north shore of Nacimiento and the lands between the two reservoirs will be impacted. 30-3

Given the above, why is there no plan or opportunity for oral comments in San Luis Obispo County where the major impact on Nacimiento reservoir is located and where the major impact on local property owners will occur? Further, why are no copies of 30-4
the preliminary reports available for review at no cost in San Luis Obispo County where most of the impacted people reside?

Gentlemen:

This letter is in response to the DEIR and your verbal presentation regarding the Alternate B proposal to modify the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoir operation. We
oppose this proposal for the following reasons:

1. We believe the re-operation of the reservoirs is a procedure and not a project. Emphasis in the draft report an additional 30,000 acre feet /year release. This appears to be politically motivated for the benefit of the State Water 120-1

Resource Control Board and will not solve the seawater intrusion problem and provide all the water that the Salinas Valley users desire without curtailment of well pumping.

2, When we retired and moved to Oak Shores to build our bome, the lake was the biggest factor in drawing us to this area. If/when the lake goes dry (which will occur if your proposal is carried out) except in a very heavy rain producing year, our reason to be here is gone, not to mention the decline in our property value. The County Assessor Office values the lake region at. more than $333,000,000. 120-2
At the present time, the local realtors consider the fair market value for the same area to be near $700,000,000. What will happen to these figures with a dry lake?*
3. The babitat for the fish, eagles and other species found at the lake will be greatly affected. The Bald Eagle, especially, has made a great comeback in recent years. There are now three nesting pairs known to be at Lake Nacimiento. Your 120-3

proposal will leave their fisheries dry and will have an impact on all species of fish residing in the lake, leaving the eagle with nothing to fish for.

Surely, there must be other alternatives available to accomplish the needs of everyone. How much water would be saved if the farming community went to a drip system to water their crops? We have seen the farm sprinklers running in a downpour of rain.

Monterey County charges us $75.00 for permits so that we may use our boat and jet ski. There is also a charge for having a dock on the lake. We also pay property tax for 120-5
having a slip in which to moor our boat. Shouldn't our rights also be protected for these
charges?

August 24, 2001

120-1 The reasons the MCWRA has proposed the SVWP are explained in Chapter 1 of the Draft EIR/EIS, and are summarized in Section 1.1, Objectives and Need for the
Proposed Action. Without the SVWP, seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley will continue. As & result, the salinity of Salinas Valley groundwater will continue to be degraded, forcing the abandonment of wells and affecting the agricultural productivity and economy of the valley. Because this comment does not raise any specific issues about the Draft EIR/EIS analysis of environmental effects, no further response is required. It is noted that projects are considered discretionary actions, and because of this the EIR/EIS is being prepared. If it were not a project, it would be exempt from CEQA and NEPA.

121-1 The commenter's concerns regarding how the reservoit will operate are noted. No environmental issues are raised and no other response is warranted.

121-2 The Draft EIR/EIS addresses cumulative and growth-inducing impacts associated with the proposed project in Chapters 6.0 and 7.0, respectively. Cumulative projects were included in the hydrologic model, including the County of San Luis Obispo's allotted diversion from Nacimiento Reservoir of 17,500 acre-feet per year (see
Master Response MR-10). The model also accounts for the expected future increase
in urban water use.

Re: Salinas Water Project EIR

Dear Bob Meyer:
We know that Lake Nacimiento was built to protect from flood- ing, water for irrigation, and recreation. Providing methods to prevent seawater intrusion was not documented to my under-
standing.
The propósed modification to the Nacimiento spillway is an essential component of project that would allow the lake to store more water in the winter, however, "the reoperation! would take all of that potential new water, and more in the long term up to Salinas.
By redefining the reoperation to allow only additional irriga- tion releases when the previous winter lake levels exceed the current flood rule curve levels at Nacimiento on January lst, and then release an amount equal to that additional amount stored, the intent of project description would be
met and lower lake levels woula be avoided.
As you can see with the above opinion, the lake would be operated much as it has been in the past, except in wet years 123-1
when additional water can be stored, additional water would •' be released during the irrigation season. water were captured If no additional then the releases would be made•as they have been historically and no diversion would be made.

IE: Draft: Environmental Impact Report Salinas Valley Water Project Sch# 2000034007
Preface: I was raised by my parents; on a cattle and citrus ranch. This was the Bishop Ranch-Goleta Ca.
tractor's, At 13 years of age i had a checking account. I leamed to pull & spray weeds, drive truck's &
herd cattle ( owned my own horse & cattle ) fixed fence, branded cattle-vaccinated. Goleta County Water District Thought they incumbered the ranch. The ranch owners provided well tests & where able to prove; that the ground water basin was their's. The ranch later provided their own water co. and developement! The last 25 years of my experience has been in public works construction. In

order this time we have evolved to the point of saving anything; the red legged frog, the lisard-a change
paid for at just one bridgel This "Draft" as we say in the trade; Cookie cut or a "canned specification" You check listed & paid all the professional fee's so that your "lead agency" can again approve. Keep in mind litigation; No agency needs the exposure and delay (cost's)
Issue: You have failed to provide a low level (safty net )elevation of the lake; of which you feel intitled too. 126-1
You are not "partnerring" with the county of San luis Obispo: This agency is in need of water for the respective needs of San luis Obispo-North county: On my last trip to the lake; I noticed that Lake Nacimiento was drafted 3 to 1 of Lake San Antonio! 126-2
.* Lowering Lake Nacimiento during the summer season beyound normal level will expose more rock to people using the lake. By lowering the lake; you create a smaller surface area-boats are closer
to each other. Look at some of the following web sits that when you say "recreation-significant & unavoidable". County of Montery-Lake San Antonio www.co.monterev.ca.us/parks/park 004.htm Lake Nacimiento www.tcsn.net/bherndon/nacimiento.htm Oak Shores Community Assciation http://fp.tcsn.net/osca Oak Shores Realty www.oakshpresrealty.com Comments: 1. I spoke with United Water Conservation District, Santa Paula, Ca. They use Lake Piru (recreational lake) the Santa Clara River, diversion dam and ponds to reverse salt water intrusion on the farming 126-3

area of the Oxnard plains. THEY RELEASE THEIR WATER AFTER LABOR DAY. 2, The County of San luis. Obispo has hired Cleath & Assc. of SLO to study the ground water basin 126-4
of Paso Robles. Currently the county has an allocation (building) where the starting time is 2003. 3. The growth of residential developement around Lake Nacimiento has the acceptance of seasonal
allocation, changes to the lake level since the dam was built. This proposal (SVWP), the county of SLO 126-5

126-1 MCWRA's license for water rights entitles it to store 377,900 AF and release 180,000 AFY from Lake Nacimiento. The proposed project would operate within these entitlements. For information on the low elevation and San Luis Obispo County's
entitlement, see response to Comment 19-4 and Master Response MR-10.
126-2 The high water level will remain at its present elevation of 800 feet and the low water levels are no lower than presently experienced during dry or drought year conditions. Therefore, the potential for boating hazards as result of reservoir reoperation under
Alternative A would not be substantially different than under existing conditions.

126-3 The MCWRA has reviewed the approaches used by the United Water Conservation District and other water agencies that have developed projects to stop seawater intrusion into coastal groundwater aquifers. The SVWP was plänned with consideration both for the methods found to be successful elsewhere and the
specific conditions of the Salinas Valley and the Salinas River. Because of the presence of migrating steelhead and other aquatic habitat, water must be released to meet CDFG in-stream flow requirements below Nacimiento and San Antonio dams, and cannot be impounded during the winter months below the dams. The timing of releases from Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs must also take into
consideration the opportunities to recharge the groundwater aquifers through the streambed. See also response to Comment 129-2.
126-4 This comment does not raise any issues regarding the environmental analysis presented in the Draft EIR/EIS. No further response is necessary.
126-5 This comment does not raise any significant environmental issues regarding the proposed project. No further response is necessary.
126-6 Nacimiento Reservoir became operational in 1957. The purpose of the reservoir was
to provide more groundwater recharge to the Salinas Valley because of the seawater intrusion problem identified 10 years earlier. San Antonio reservoir was added in 1964 for the same purpose. The Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project was implemented in 1998. All are intended to halt seawater intrusion, but the problem has persisted. The SVWP is intended, and modeling shows it will be effective, to
halt sweater intrusion by providing an alternative water source to groundwater
pumping. 5

It is not clear what the commenter means in questioning why "allocations" have not
been implemented. Please refer to Master Response MR-8 for discussion of the tbSZO

Dear Mr. Smith:

We have reviewed the Draft EIR/EIS Report for the proposed Salinas Valley Water Project. Although this project as proposed, as stated quite eloquently by the Lake Nacimiento area property owners during public testimony at hearings on this Draft Report, will have a devastating effect on the property values in San Luis Obispo County, the sales tax revenue of the Paso Robles area, and the property tax revenue of San Luis Obispo County govemment, we intend to focus our comments on the specific areas contained in the Draft Report thai require further • clarification and discussion:

1. The stated purpose of this project is for the County of Monterey to avoid a State adjudication of the Salinas Valley Water Project, currently underway, to remedy a saltwater intrusion and basin overdraft (p1-8). The project alternatives presented do not analyze' a full range of reasonable alternatives to the use of Nacimiento Lake water to 127-1

present saltwater intrusion as required in an EIS (40 C.F.R. 1502.13 & 1502.14).

2. The Draft EIR refers to additional projects that would be needed to accomplish the project goals if the proposed structural or program-based components fail. However, the Draft EIR/EIS indicates that it is likely that seawater intrusion will not be halted through this 127-2
project (p2-3). It is reasonable to analyze impacts of possible additional distribution projects during this EIR/EIS.

3 The overdraft and seawater intrusion problem has been known since as early as 1946, It is unclear from the' Draft EIR/EIS what circumstances have changed that require modification and reoperation of Nacimiento Lake.

In addition, we fully support the comments submitted by the Board of Supervisors of San Luis Obispo County. The economic impacts of the loss of recreational use of Lake Nacimiento cannot be too strongly emphasized and may ultimately cause the project to be challenged in the courts. 127-4
We belleve it is in the best interest of the County of Monterey to seek an alternative that will not reduce the lake levels to the point where recreational activities must be curtailed.

Thank you for your consideration and response to these comments.

127-1 The purpose of the proposed action, as stated on page 1-1 of the Draft EIR/EIS, is to address the critical issues facing the management and longevity of the water resources of the Salinas Valley groundwater basin by meeting the objectives of (1) •stopping seawater intrusion, (2) providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future (year 2030) needs, and (3) improving the hydrologic balance of the basin. State adjudication of the basin is likely outcome if the SVWP is not implemented. The proposed action was developed over the course of several years and has evolved from and represents the culmination of years of planning, engineering, and public involvement. The MCWRA considered numerous alternatives in the course of
developing the proposed action and identifying the range of alternatives to be analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS (the proposed action, or Alternative A; Alternative B; and three different no-action alternatives). Consistent with the requirements described in the NEPA CEQ Regulations, the Draft EIR/EIS includes and evaluates a range of reasonable alternatives, identifies and discusses alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study, and provides information that will allow reviewers to evaluate the comparative merits of the proposed action and alternatives. The alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study are described in detail; along with the reasons they were not pursued further, in the 1998 SVWP Draft EIR; this discussion was incorporated by reference into the Draft EIR/EIS, as indicated in Section 4.3. See Master Response MR-8 for a discussion of the alternatives that were previously considered but eliminated from further consideration due to environmental, economic, and/or technical feasibility issues. Because the
commenters do not suggest any other alternatives that they believe the lead agencies overlooked, it is not possible to respond further to this comment.
127-2 It is stated on page 2-3 of the Draft EIR/EIS that the hydrologic model used for evaluating the project "shows that seawater intrusion would be halted in the short term, but may not be fully halted in the long term (year 2030)" (emphasis added). It is acknowledged that there is possibility that the SVWP would be unable to stop seawater intrusion in the long term in the CSIP area. If this were the case, it is expected that an expanded delivery system and expanded deliveries would be needed to halt seawater intrusion over the long term by providing more water to be used in lieu of groundwater within a larger area. This expanded distribution system is addressed programmatically in the Draft EIR/EIS. As described in the Draft EIR/EIS, if this expansion is needed in the future, more precise planning and environmental analysis would be required. Future environmental review would
include, but would not be limited to, an evaluation of impacts on hydrology, habitat, water quality, wetlands, aesthetics, cultural resources, and air quality.

Attn: Gentlemen

I have been a property owner at Heritage Ranch for approximately 5 years. My fiancée and I are currently in escrow on another home in Heritage Ranch. We have planned to make Lake Nacimiento our home for many years. I strongly feel that Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) has not researched the negative impact this project is going to have on property owners on the Lake and around the Lake. Property is a valuable asset and the thought that the value of my property could drop 20% to 30% is a 128-1
fact of life that I will not stand to watch with out a fight. This plan will not only affect property owners; it will affect small businesses in the area. Lake Nacimiento generates a lot of out town guests. I, as a small business owner will also be impacted. I ask you to please reconsider the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). The economic impact to the landowners is far too harsh. We own the land and respect the water, please respect the

129-1 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on the economy and property values near Nacimiento Reservoir.

129-2 As part of the process for developing responses to comments on the Draft
EIR/EIS, the MCWRA has contacted various water entities in the Ventura area,
including the City of Oxnard Water Department and the United Water Conservation District. Like the MCWRA, these entities are planning projects with goal of halting seawater intrusion.

The City of Oxnard Water Department is planning stages for a water recycling project that wil treat wastewater to a tertiary level with a reverse osmosis component to provide a water supply for agricultural and industrial users. Part of the plan also includes injecting some for the treated water into the groundwater basin to provide a
seawater intrusion barrier.

Since 1998, as part of its efforts to halt seawater intrusion and restore hydrologic
balance in the groundwater basin, the MCWRA has been operating a similar water recycling project, consisting of the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project (SVRP) and the CSIP. These two projects are collectively called the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects and have been supplying water for agricultural use in the northern portion of the Salinas Valley to offset groundwater pumping that has historically occurred in the area experiencing seawater intrusion. The amount of tertiary-treated water delivered in Fiscal Year 2000/2001 was 11,000 AF. All the water produced by the SVRP was delivered to the CSIP to help stop seawater intrusion.
The Freeman Diversion Improvement Project constructed by the United Water Conservation District incorporates facilities for fish passage. The surface diversion facility for the SVWP would also incorporate fish passage facilities.
Nacimiento Dam was built as the initial phase for solving seawater intrusion in the northern portion of the Salinas Valley. The delivery of recycled water in the CSIP
area was implemented as an additional phase. Although the recharge of groundwater through current conservation relcases from Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs and the delivery of recycled water to the CSIP area have reduced seawater intrusion and improved overdraft conditions, additional action is needed to address these continuing problems. The SVWP would serve as the next phase in these efforts by providing additional water for streambed recharge and distributing additional water to the north Salinas Valley, where it would be used in lieu of an equivalent amount groundwater.

imports without curtailment of basin water pumping from non-contaminated wells. Comments are presented in the same order as Draft EIR/EIS chapters and sections.

INTRODUCTION The Draft EIR/EIS reads as an umbrella report of several projects that can stand alone. If the final draft as certified by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors continues to
document Alternative A, B and-C in an open ended fashion; then the impacts and mitigation of all factors for all alternatives as defined by CEQA, etc.,should be fully 130-1

developed prior to implementation of the selected components.

The report provides no time line or reliability statements for abatement of the seawater problem to the satisfaction of the State Water Resources Control Board beyond the fact that conditions will be monitored and additional measures will be taken (pg.5.3.41). 130-2

The draft report does not establish any time line that will show when basin pumping has been stabilized (no over-draft) or reliability that Basin conditions can be stabilized by the modest increased releases detailed under Alternative A. 130-3

CHAPTER 2
Potential impact of expanded surface distribution is referred to in about sixteen articles throughout the draft report. Estimates of timing and scope of releases to supply reservoir water to this expanded system is not adequately defined or evaluated. It 130-4

appears to be beyond the scope of this EIR/EIS. The MCWRA should declare how impacts and mitigation caused by an expanded distribution will be investigated.
This draft provides no insight on how the end user surface distributions in Monterey County of reservoir additional releases will be monitored and reported. Surface deliver 130-5
to end users should be reported separate from historic ground water recharge releases.

2.2 Proposed Action and Alternatives The re-operation of the reservoirs does not appear a to be a project, but rather an open- ended declaration that additional water will be released on an as needed basis.
Undefined release of reservoir water for future expanded surface distribution appears well beyond the scope of the defined releases under Alternative A. 130-6

If the above is not the intent of MCWRA to distribute more surface water than evaluated
in this report, then there should be a clear statement to that intent with full
environmental analysis prior to any future expanded surface distribution efforts. That
means that re-operation of the reservoirs should be limited to the amount consistent
with alternative A or B impacts and mitigation as defined in this documant.

If the MCWRA intends to exercise the right of full release beyond impacts outlined in
this report; there should also be impact and mitigation statements for total release to minimum poll plus the 17,500 AF reserved for San Luis Obispo County (SLOCo). 130-7

2.4 Summary of Significant Unavoidable Impacts The document now states that some impacts are not mitigable. This conclusion is because of selective choice of components and practice by the MCWRA.

A. The modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam is to satisfy flood control criteria. Flexibility of water releases after the spillway modification is not
restricted to flood control and conservation; more flexible scheduling can be used as well to mitigate recreational, visual impact, impound fish biology. 130-8

B. The impoundment of water along 4.5 miles of the Salinas river is a separate project in cooperation with the USACE. Capture of more river water in the flood channel for recharge could very likely be accomplished to minimize additional releases from the reservoirs.

C. The surface distribution of water to those locations where the wells have
been contaminated by seawater is a separate project. The water could be transferred from Salinas Basin wells remote to the contaminated sector, thereby mitigating the impacts of additional reservoir releases.

CHAPTER 5
The report as drafted appears to be heavily biased to impacts in Monterey County and fails to investigate, analyze or mitigate significant impacts in SLOCo. Some items that are declared insignificant appear to be so bécause of failure of MCWRA to investigate.
If it is accepted that the citations in this document and the CSIP EIR regarding the 130-9
expanded distribution system do satisfy CEQA etc. requirements and adequately define
impacts and mitigation in Monterey County; then the same degree of investigation and mitigation should be give to all the same factors in San Luis Obispo County including Fish Biology in the Reservoirs, Recreation and Environmental Justice . This means full and equal disclosure for both counties that would be impacted by all viable alternatives.

5.3 HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING
Under Alternative A. Re-operation of the two reservoirs is presented in the report as a
•consolidated procedure. Gross analysis and selective mitigation in this draft is tailored to a specific release plan for Nacimiento with limited analysis for San Antonio. To 130-10
insure that impacts and mitigation are compatible to the implemented project there should be a plan a to measure releases specific to the selected component and declared
water use to facilitate public as well as agency monitoring.

Does the MCWRA consider re-operation of the reservoirs an open-ended standard operating procedure, that is, not a project? If so, then impoundment release to reservoir minimum pool during drought conditions should be evaluated as part of the 130-11
re-operation. Expanded surface distribution during drought should be evaluated for impact and mitigation to the same level of detail that is provided for the initial defined releases under alternative A.

The expanded deliver system noted in this draft is in new areas outside the ÇSIP service area (pg. 5.3.42). Is it within CEQA guidelines that Alternative A mitigating measures can be referred to in the SCIP EIR and not investigated in this draft? 130-12

5.7 CULTURAL RESOURCES The cultural, social and economic impact on permanent communities in San Luis
Obispo County are totally omitted from this draft. The potential additional draw-down of
reservoir waters for expanded surface distribution does not consider, define impact or
provide mitigation for the social economic system in SLOCo. There is no definition
time line or quantifying data related to the potentially draconian procedure referred to as "additional releases as necessary". Therefore the impacts cannot be assessed. 130-13
The aggregate fair market value of development contiguous to Lake Nacimiento is estimated near $700 million. There are over 1800 permanent mail addresses with three US mail carriers. There are full time employees serving seven communities. Public utilities and public works serve these and resort facilities. There are several private year round businesses that serve the lake region. The gross impact on this entire system is either glossed over or not evaluated._No mitigation for loss of jobs, property values and recreation benefits to lake area stakeholders is presented.
5.9 RECREATION Recreation may be subordinate to Flood Control and Conservation as a Beneficial use
of Nacimiento and San Antonio waters; it is never the less a Valid Use. Each
beneficial use is entitled to full investigation for impact and mitigation for all alternatives proposed by the project. This draft repc does not give comprehensive treatment to Recreation.

Fair description of Nacimiento and San Antonio as major retirement and recreational facilities to the central coast region of California is not provided. For example: 130-14

A. About 75,000 dams are cataloged in the US National Inventory of Dams. Nacimiento Impoundment is in the upper one-half of one percent of that list. San Antonio impoundment is listed below Nacimiento. Collectively the two reservoir
are likely in the top 25 impoundments in the US.

B. On average, 120,000 annual paid visits to both lakes are recorded by Monterey
County. Thousands more users access the lake through seven lakeside
. communities. Nationally, 72 percent of all boaters live within 50 miles of the lake
of their choice. AR 02557

130-1 Impacts of all five alternatives are described in detail in the Draft EIR/EIS.
Alternative A has been selected as the applicant's preferred alternative.
130-2 The SWRCB has not specified a particular timeline for documenting success in halting seawater intrusion and protecting Salinas Valley water resources, but
documented progress toward addressing seawater intrusion will be looked upon favorably by the SWRCB. As proposed, Alternative A would halt seawater intrusion under current modeled baseline agricultural demands. The effectiveness of the project will be evaluated. A monitoring program is crucial to the evaluation of the success of any implemented project. Once the project and monitoring program are in place, status reports would be generated to present the results of monitoring and the location and rate of seawater intrusion, similar in nature to the reports the MCWRA is currently producing. It is at the discretion of the SWRCB to determine whether the efforts at halting scawater intrusion through project implementation are sufficient to preclude State adjudication of the basin.
130-3 The goal of the SVWP is to halt seawater intrusion by reducing pumping demands in the coastal regions of the Salinas Valley using diverted Salinas River water and recycled CSIP water. Once the project is operational, the hydrologic balance should be reestablished (i.e., no additional overdraft will occur). Refer also to response to Comment 114-4 and Master Response MR-1 regarding certainty in estimating project
results.

130-4 Because the hydrologic model indicates that the proposed project may not fully halt seawater intrusion based on year 2030 projections, an expanded distribution system might be necessary for future project operations. This expanded distribution system is addressed programmatically in the Draft EIR/EIS. As described on page 3-24, diversions in the Salinas River would be increased from 9,700 AFY to 18,300 AFY. The impacts of this additional diversion are discussed in each of the relevant technical areas of the Draft EIR/EIS. For instance, Section 5.8 depicts existing and future (2030) modeled conditions of lake levels and 2030 conditions include the additional diversion. If this expansion is needed in the future, more precise planning
and environmental analysis would be required.

130-5 As more detailed information on the specific operations of the surface diversion
facility is developed, consideration will be given to metering the amount of water pumped by the surface water diversion facility. Also, some estimate can be made of È
the amount of water recharged to the groundwater basin. However, a comparison 02558

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-574 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

with historical groundwater releases will not be made since groundwater recharge has been influenced by a variety of factors in the past.
130-6 The commenter's contention that the reoperation component of the project seems to be "an open-ended declaration that additional water wil be released on an as needed basis" appears to refer to the Draft EIR/EIS discussions of the potential need to expand the water delivery system and increased water deliveries in the future (2030) if monitoring determines that seawater intrusion has not been halted. Please see response to Comment 127-2 regarding this issue. If Alternative A or B were B
implemented, reservoir reoperation would consist only of the amount analyzed in detail in the Draft EIR/EIS. Future expanded deliveries would require further detailed environmental review. Finally, all releases shown for Nacimiento and San Antonio are within existing MCWRA water rights.
130-7 Please see Master Response MR-10.
130-8 All the proposed components of the SVWP must be implemented in combination for the MCWRA to be able to meet the project objectives of stopping seawater intrusion, providing adequäte water supplies to meet current and future (year 2030) needs, and improving the hydrologic balance of the basin. For this reason, the
components have been presented as a single project; splitting them up and addressing them separately would amount to project segmentation, which is prohibited under CEQA because an evaluation of pieces of a project may fail to fully encompass the extent of impacts that could result from implementation.
(A) The spillway modification will allow more water to be captured behind the dam in the wintertime than is currently allowed by the DSOD and FERC. This project will benefit all who live along the shores of Nacimiento and reside in the Salinas Valley. Please see response to Comment 47-6 for discussion of why this element alone will not achieve the project objectives. (B) The re-operation of the reservoir releases to a diversion structure on the Salinas River at mile 5 will create an
impoundment area. The impoundment area is restricted in size to the holding capacity of the existing levees and the height of the diversion structure. Additional
water cannot be impounded because of these limitations. Refer also to response to
Comment 103-4. (C) The commenter's suggested mitigation is unclear. It appears as though the commenter is suggesting that groundwater from an area where seawater has not yet intruded be delivered to the area of groundwater intrusion and used in its place. Removing water from one part of the groundwater basin rather than another will not lower the total amount of groundwater extraction, and therefore will not
assist in halting seawater intrusion or improving the hydrologic balance of the basin by reducing groundwater overdraft.
A standing committee of the MCWRA (Reservoir Operations Committee) meets
monthly to discuss reservoir releases. This is a venue whereby some adjustments
to releases (and lake levels) can be addressed on a real-time basis. While the priorities of the committee are toward flood control and water conservation, they have historically and will continue to consider recreation also.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-575 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

130-9 Impacts to both fish biology and recreation in San Luis Obispo County, through the
evaluation of impacts at Nacimiento Reservoir, are included in the Draft EIR/EIS. Both CEQA and NEPA require consideration of impacts where they are significant. To that end, the EIR/EIS focuses neither on Monterey nor San Luis Obispo counties, but instead on the environmental issues significandly affected by the project. The EIR/EIS identifies a number of significant effects in San Luis Obispo County (at Lake Nacimiento) because the analysis focuses on environmental issues with changes in lake levels. The commenter does not identify specific impacts that should have been evaluated that were not; categorized impacts are identified but not the rationale for why significant impacts were not addressed.
130-10 It is unclear why the commenter refers to "[g]ross analysis and selective mitigation
tailored to a specific release plan for Nacimiento with limited analysis for San Antonio." The modeling performed for the project evaluation treated Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs as separate components and considered the capacities and flood rule curves of each in order to simulate how the system would function in
a coordinated fashion. The Draft EIR/EIS shows model results for each reservoir
separately.

As to public monitoring, the comment is unclear. MCWRA Reservoir Operations Committee meetings are open to the public and are a forum by which to establish reservoir release decisions. Further, any mitigation required as part of project approval (if the project is approved) would be tracked through a mitigation monitoring program that is available for public review.
130-11 Please see response to Comment 130-6. Years of drought conditions are part of the hydrologic period used for project modeling for both current and future (with expanded distribution) conditions. Therefore, the results shown in the Draft EIR/EIS include effects during drought conditions. Specific operations under future expanded deliveries would require further detailed environmental review.
130-12 This comment is unclear. It is probable that the reference to the "SCIP EIR" is intended to be the "CSIP" EIR (Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project). Even so, the comment is unclear and no further response is possible.
130-13 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on the economy and property values of northern San Luis Obispo County. These are not "cultural" resources as defined by NEPA and CEQA. Cultural resources are
historic and prehistoric items that meet specific definition and criteria.

130-14 It is noted that recreation is an important use of Lakes Nacimiento and San Antonio.
It is fully evaluated in the Draft EIR/EIS. Please see Master Response MR-2 for a
discussion of mitigation measures for recreation impacts at Nacimiento Reservoir.

RE: Response to Draft EIR/EIS, Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Mr. Smith:

As a property owner, a recreational user of Lake Nacimento, and as a developer, I have many concerns regarding the Proposed Project and the analysis provided in the EIR/EIS. In general, there has not been enough specific information regarding various aspects of the project to allow me or other more informed individuals to adequately understand all the potential impacts associated with the proposed project. However, as required by law this is our opportunity to respond, and I urge you to consider my comments.
I own approximately 1,900 acres surrounding what is known as Dip Creek. I purchased this property last year because of the recreational value and scenic beauty that it provides. Numerous friends and family members use the Lake Nacimento recreational facilities on a regular basis. Therefore, my concern about the future recreational use of the lake and potential impacts to property values is understandably significant.
The following discussion summarizes my concern regarding the proposed project based on the information that has been provided in the EIR/EIS.

OVERVIEW
As will be discussed further in this response, The Proposed Project cannôt be expected to solve all downstream water difficencies experienced by Monterey County. Therefore, the proposed improvements and revised operational parameters need to be implemented in 131-1
consideration of downstream conservation, acquisition of new water resources for the Salinas Valley and the interests of the property owners and recreational users of the Lake.

AR 02561

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-577 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

As stated in section 1.2.1, aquifer pumping and recharge rates must be brought into 131-1
balance. When considering drought years or extended periods of low rainfall, it is clear that Nacimento Lake cannot provide all of the necessary water resources to prevent Or (cont'd)

arrest saltwater intrusion. Additionally, increased demand for water for new
development needs to be analyzed more thoroughly since there appears to be no 131-2
mitigation measures directed at minimizing this impact.
Lake Nacimento is a finite supply of water. The recreational use and economic factors associated with the lake are important and require analysis that not been folded into the document. If balance is the objective, then more analysis should be included in the 131-3
document to address alternatives for balancing the needs of down stream uses and public
and private interests of San Luis Obispo County residents and lake users.

REOPERATION SCHEDULE
All of the impacts associated with the Proposed Project on Lake Nacimento will be defined by the Proposed Reoperation Schedule which is not included in the document. In order to understand the impacts to our property interests and those of Heritage Ranch and
other lake communities, we need more specific information about the schedule. This
request is based on the lack of adequate information available to the public upon which to
evaluate the recommendations in the document. Furthermore, reduced release rates during dry years as anticipated within document need to be provided to the public so we can understand the entire scope. Also, how the release schedule is tied to water conversation measures downstream is very critical. This information would allow me 131-4
and others directly affected by the proposed project to make an informed response.
Coordinating release rates with downstream saltwater intrusion and additional consumptive use is a complex undertaking. Increased releases from the lake can be part of the solution; however, it would not be wise to rely on the lake as the ultimate solution. At best, it can be argued that it is an interim solution that will have long-term impacts as well as immediate short-term impacts to the residents and users of the lake. Therefore,
we are asking that a more complete analysis of the interrelationship of the release schedule with water conversation and reduce demands for new development be provided.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
As you have heard as several public information meetings, there is a significant concern that the Proposed Project will negatively impact property values as well as business interests at the lake. The Heritage Ranch Owners Association derives revenue from recreational users of the lake. Reduced revenues due to decreased use of the lake will
have a direct impact on the association dues paid by every single property owner within 131-5
the community. This is a wide-ranging impact that has not been addressed within the document. Considering that the lake will not solve all downstream needs, how much of
an economic. impact should the residents of Heritage Ranch and other lake communities
endure to partially mitigate downstream needs. Here the question of balance, equity and

:

AR 02562

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-578 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

fairness needs to be explored. The county of San Luis Obispo will lose property tax revenue, Monterey County will lose recreational revenue and the public needs to be able to evaluate if a revised operational schedule can mitigate these apparent impacts.
Please provide an analysis of the economic impacts to San Luis Obispo County from 131-6
reduced property values resulting from the unpublished revised operational schedule and then provide at least two altemative release schedules that would reduce the impact to
property owners and recreational users.

LAKE LEVEL ANALYSIS
The EIR/EIS does not contain enough information for the public to be able to analyze how they will be impacted by reduced water levels during operational year. Providing exhibits showing the lake level at various times of the year would provide a graphic tool
that can assist the public in evaluating and/or suggesting alternatives that could be viable
for consideration.

It is evident that the Proposed Project will impact recreational facilities at the lake. Launch ramps will not be usable during extended release periods and consequently both recreational users and residences will be harmed. A mitigation measure for this 131-7•
eventuality should be the extension of boating ramps for the existing recreational facilities and the cost of that being born by the Project. While this is a mitigation measure, the ultimate operational schedule could avoid these impacts if significant releases were deferred until after Labor Day, for example. At any rate, insufficient information has been provided to the public upon which to base an informed decision. We request that the EIR/EIS preparer provide maps. of lake levels as it relates to the proposed and suggested operational schedule for public review.
WATER CONSERVATION AND DOWNSTREAM CONSUMPTION
It may be fair to conclude that downstream consumptive use for both agriculture and
development has exceeded the safe yield of existing ground water and Nacimento recharge capability. This EIR/EIS should address and make recommendations for an aggressive conservation effort for downstream users. To ignore the extractive use as an integral part of the solution is inexcusable. If the condition is as serious as described and balance being goal, insufficient information has been provided for the public to understand how conservation will be integrated directly with lake discharges. The
recharge capabilities presented by the lake and the conservation measures exercised 131-8

downstream are inextricably linked and should be presented as "The Project".
We request that the EIR/EIS preparer and the County of Monterey provide information and analysis of the dependency of downstream conservation and lake discharges as the
mitigation to saltwater intrusion.

AR 02563

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-579 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

CONCLUSION I understand and appreciate the opportunity that increased release rates from Lake Nacimento will benefit downstream users in Monterey County. also think that the document does not fully analyze alternatives that may be implemented to safeguard the recreational and property interests of those with a long-term vested interest in Lake Nacimento. It is simply not adequate to say that Monterey County will seek a balance without providing enough information for the public to evaluate the adequacy and potential impacts associated with those future actions. The information that I have requested would assist me in more fully understanding the project, its impacts and possible mitigations.

LETTER 131

David B. Weyrich August 27, 2001

131-1 The modeling conducted to evaluate performance of the SVWP indicates that it would halt seawater intrusion in the near term but may not address the problem under additional future (2030) water demand. The commenter offers no information
to support the claim that the project will not meet this objective. The success of the SVWP in both the near term or the long term depends on implementation of all of its components, which have been developed and evaluated with consideration for
current and future conservation efforts, the potential for feasibility of numerous
other options, and the current uses of Nacimiento Reservoir. Regarding
downstream conservation, see Master Response MR-5 for description of the water
conservation measures being implemented in the Salinas Valley. The commenter suggests that the MCWRA acquire "new water resources" to meet project objectives. The MCWRA® created Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to provide water supply to meet conservation (groundwater recharge) needs, as well as to provide for flood control, and the SWRCB granted the MCWRA the right to the use of 180,000 AFY of the water stored in the reservoirs to provide for this beneficial use.
Although Nacimiento Reservoir has become an area of residential development appreciated for its recreational and aesthetic amenities, the water supply of the two reservoirs remains the MCWRA's primary water supply to be used for groundwater recharge, in combination with recycled water already being produced as part of the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, to address the immediate and long-term need to halt seawater intrusion and bring the groundwater basin into hydrologic balance. The MCWRA has not fully utilized this existing water resource to meet these intended uses and must explore fuller utilization, as permitted by its water right license. As patt of the process of project development, the MCWRA explored the possibility of constructing dams in other locations but found these options to be infeasible. Please see Master Response MR-8 for a discussion of the other alternatives previously considered by the MCWRA to halt seawater intrusion.
131-2 Future land use demand (urban growth) was estimated using Association of Monterey Bay Area Govemment (AMBAG) forecasts of future population estimates as presented in Section 7 of the Draft EIR/EIS. This information represents only forecast of potential future population from which future water demand was estimated, and a variety of economic, social, political, and environmental factors will influence whether it accurately depicts future population totals. Water conservation is part of the existing culture in the Salinas Valley and will continue into the future.
Please refer to Master Response MR-5 for a discussion on water conservation efforts currently in place for both urban and agricultural interests in the Salinas Valley.

131-3 Please see response to Comment 131-1. Please refer also to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on the economy of northern San Luis
Obispo County.

131-4 Specific operational parameters for releases and downstream diversions would be based on real-time conditions and cannot be specified at this time. The approach used in the project evaluation ensured that the Draft EIR/EIS analysis encompassed the likely effects of project operation without engaging in unrealistic speculation regarding specific operations that would depend on actual conditions. The modeling conducted to evaluate effects of the SVWP was based on general operational parameters that ensured the maintenance of required in-stream flows for fisheries; maximized storage during winter within the constraints of a new-flood rule curve;
maximized delivery for streambed techarge; and maximized delivery during the irrigation season, within the planned limitations of the downstream storage and delivery facilities, to meet the assumed constant level of demand for agricultural water during April through October. Irrigation would begin as early in April as possible, considering potential constraints to meet steelhead passage requirements. The results therefore reflect the general average trends in, and maximum effects on, water releases and reservoir surface elevations that may be expected to result from SVWP implementation. The modeling does not, however, reflect the more specific operational decisions that would be developed by the agency within the maximums represented by the project modeling. In actual operations, diversion amounts would vary month to month depending on water availability, recharge rates, and other factors. Projections of more specific month-to-month or week-to-week releases of water from the reservoirs would be determined by the Reservoir Operations Committee of the MCWRA based on real-time water-demand, climatic conditions, recharge rates (which affect the amount that needs to be relcased to travel 100 miles to the diversion facility), and lake levels. Please see, also, responses to Comments
131-1 and 131-2 and Master Response MR-1.

131-5 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on the economy and property values near Nacimiento Reservoir.
131-6 Please see response to Comment 131-1. See Master Response MR-6 for discussion of requirements with regard to addressing economic effects in CEQA and NEPA analyses. As noted in the Draft EIR/EIS, project impacts on recreation would be significant and unavoidable. Please refer to Master Response MR-2 for discussion of new mitigation measures to reduce project effects on recreation and Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0 for discussion of reduced lake level effects. The
proposed reoperation schedule was designed to meet the objectives of the project. At the scale of analysis performed for the Draft EIR/EIS (46 years of hydrologic data, over 300,000 AFY passing through the watershed, targeting halting of seawater intrusion 100 miles from Lake Nacimiento), it is unrealistic to attempt to specify day- to-day operational nuances that could alter project effects on recreation or visual resources. The analysis is designed to capture the general patterns of water releases and identify the likely extremes (e.g., in surface elevations) that may be expected 5 under project implementation, assuming the projected water demand and I repeat of hydrologic conditions similar to those represented in the 46-year hydrologic record, 02566

and given the limitations of modeling. There are no alternative operation schedules at this scale of analysis that would reduce these impacts and still meet the project objectives.

Re: 6/2001 DEIR/S Salinas Valley Water Project
Written Comments

The current DEIR/S effort is far superior• to past EIR efforts. Support is given for the *preferred action" described on pg 3-4, section 3.2. The document has, however, serious omissions that render it legally. inadequate.
As.a co-author of the 4/11/2000 scoping comments submitted by Sierra Club and reprinted in the 6/2001 SVWP DEIR/S,
Please respond with adequate detail to each issue raised in the scoping comments. In order for the public, agencies, and decision makers to make informed decisions,it is absolutely necessary that (finally, after repeated requests) all relevant; available information regarding the WRA wells used for sea water intrusion (SWI) testing and a fair, representative disclosure of past tests results be made public. In the past, Sierra Club purchased from WRA information about the location, description and sample results from agricultural wells used by WRA for chloride and TDS sampling. It appeared that most of the wells sampled met drinking water standards and did not exceed 500 mg./ chloride (well Tocations were depicted in prior DEIR, and a11 were located in the so-called 132-1

SWI areá depicted on DEIR/S Figures 1-2, 1-3. See also DEIR/S pg 2-1 regarding 24,109 acres supposedly "underlain" by SWI. See also the author's vague discussion on DEIR/S pg 5-1 citing "46 years of hydrologic data" and "reasonable reflection" of "compilation, analysis, and averaging of physical, long-term scfentic data."] Averaging and compiiation are fine, but the public again demands disclosure of the supporting raw data,
It's also understood that WRA has never collected groundwater samples from Marina or the former Fort Ord (even though DEIR/S Figures 1-2, 1-3 create the impression that SWI exist today under both locations [northwestern portions of Ord' and all of Marina]). Please clarify this issue. WRA was given in 6/98 by members of the public, data collected by Army regarding chloride and TOS levels from. dozens of monitoring weils installed to identify the existence of the boundaries of toxic groundwater plumes under the former military base. Again, the vast majority of wells and sample results met drinking water standards and did not exceed 500 m9/I chloride. Please disclose groundwater quality data from the former Fort ord and confirm or deny that there ds no test data from 132-2

the 180 and 400 ft aquifers under Marina. (Please note: MCWD has used 3 deep wells since the 1980's; coincidently about the time

opinion can.be seen as merely wishful fantasy that some could use to create the allusion of an "avallable" 40,000 AFY "needed" to "accommodate" the so-called "future needs" of urban growth. The breathtaking 90% growth of urban over the next 30 years, projected on DEIR/S 7-2,3,4, is challenged and rejeeted as unrealistic given the constraints on such rampant development in Monterey County. 132-5
Note that a projected 3%/yr growth rate would exceed the rate of growth that resulted in the San Jose area and East Bay eliminating agriculture, exhausting local water supplies, creating traffic deficiencies most severe, and seasonal smog conditions. In contrast to the opinion that ag water use will decrease, it can be opined that, e.g., continued conversion of dry farn gräzing land to vineyards, and new winery operations will maintain or increase the productive use of Salinas growndwater supplies in the future by the now $2 Billion a year Agriculture Industry.
Please update and clarify the 1997 AMBAG quote mentioned on DEIR/S P9 7-2. The majority of growth minded advocates that sit on AMBAG thought, in the year 1997, that the then proposed WRA project to take Salines River water from weils located in the river from the Highway 68 bridge to the Firestone Business Park and ship it off to grow new cities on the former Fort Ord, the so-called Armstrong Ranch north of Marina [please note Measure E approved by Marina voters], and to so-called Rancho San Juan. north of Salinas, would be approved.. [See #future phases" in prior WRA DEIR]. The project was not approved. The EIR was not completed. And the DEIR failed to' provide any 132-6
adequate proof that the project was even remotely feasible, e.g., the one test well failed to produce an adequate yfeld even though only tested one weekend; no consideration was given.to the Tong term destruction caused by direct extractions from the river for urban growth in areas that do not have sufficient groundwater for the "envisioned" urban growth.
Finally, thank you for using our idea of a monitoring program to measure the success of the proposed project in conjunction with past projects (e.g. CSIP) and related efforts (e.g., ongoing conservation by agriculture), see DEIR/S pg: 3-25. However, no specific details are disclosed or anlyzed; this is inadequate. This 1s another abvious reason that current chloride and TDS levels must be disclosed, so 132-7

that future tests results can measure the hoped-for success. of our collective efforts.

Thank you for opportunity to respond to the draft environmental document prepared by EDAW for the Monterey County Water Resources

LETTER 132

Debra J. Mickelson
August 28, 2001

132-1 The MCWRA has on file the data utilized to establish the presence of seawater intrusion into the 180- and 400- foot aquifers in the Salinas Valley and has made this data available to the commenter. This is evident by the comment. The data shows seawater intrusion, defined as chloride concentrations of 500 mg/l, over more than 24,000 acres overlying the 180-foot aquifer and more than 10,500 acres overlying the 400-foot aquifer. The California Department of Water Resources has documented
seawater intrusion in the Basin since 1946 and this has been documented repeatedly since. See pages 1-2 and 1-3 of the Draft EIR/EIS. The Statc has initiated adjudication of the Basin due to the persistence of this problem. Further, the MCWRA also has on file the most recent groundwater quality work completed for the former Fort Ord site, which confirms the MCWRA data regarding seawater intrusion in that portion of the aquifer. These data are also available for public
review.

132-2 Please see response to Comment 132-1. Note that a number of the wells represented in the 1998 data were shallow wells (above the 180-foot aquifer) drilled to test groundwater for hazardous materials from past Army activities.
132-3 Please see responses to Comments 3-3 and 25-6.
132-4 The provision of "irrefutable proof' of future conditions is not a CEQA or NEPA requirement, and is not possible. The projections referred to by the commenter are for 2030. Water demand is based on expected agricultural conservation, conversion to urban uses (which generally uses less water per acre than agriculture), and crop types. Project operations and effects for assumed 2030 conditions have been addressed at a general level of detail in the Draft EIR/EIS, in part because of the
uncertainty of conditions that would occur more than 25 years in the future, as stated
in the Draft EIR/EIS. The project that is analyzed in detail in the Draft EIR/EIS was designed to address current conditions. The analysis does not rely on the assumptions of the future conditions questioned by the commenter, and the correctness of these assumptions would not affect the project that would be approved based on the Draft EIR/EIS analysis. Furthermore, if water demand should increase in the future as assumed by the commenter (but is not expected based on extensive analysis by the MCWRA), there would be more need for the SVWP. It is unclear what the commenter's point is in terms of the adequacy of the
Draft EIR/EIS analysis. No additional information is required.
132-5 Table 7-1 of the Draft EIR/EIS provides growth projections for communities within Monterey County. These projections are based on forecasted population figures AR 02571

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-587 Response to Comments on ne EIR/EIS

provided by AMBAG. AMBAG's forecasts extend to the year 2020, and MCWRA staff extrapolated chese figures to the year 2030 to coincide with the hydrologic model for the proposed project. For more information, refer to Master Response MR-3.

132-6 The quote from AMBAG cited on page 7-2 of the Draft EIR/EIS is clear. The SVWP is the currently proposed project that would implement the cited "BMP" process. The commenter also refers to the project currently identified (generally) as Alternative B in the EIR/EIS. This is not the preferred alternative.

132-7 As stated on page 3-25 of the Draft EIR/EIS, the MCWRA is in the process of
conducting a thorough review of the existing groundwater monitoring network and •making recommendations for its refined use in measuring the success of the project. This is an ongoing task. Modifications to measure the success of the project will not be identified until the EIR/EIS process is complete. Also, please see response to Comment 132-1.

Re: Environmcmtal Impact of Salinas Valley Water Project

wish to express the concerns of muny land/homeowners at Lake Nachniento ahout the impacts of the water level changes in the Salinas
Valley Water Project proposals.
Concerns are varied:

1. The wonderful variety and abundance. of wildlife and vegetative habitat are bound to be affected. 133-1

2. The visual impacis will be drastic. 'The "clayish" type mud of that basin 133-2
3. makes walking for humans and animals slippery and dangerous. The recreational enjoyment and monetary impacts of rocreutional use will be drastically altered. 133-3

4 Most waterfront owners have been given a Nlood level map when 133-4
purchasing. If water level is altered much 1 know of many whosc property välues will be drastically altered, know many who are dead sct on sucing. 133-5
5. The Oak Shores Community Association parking lots, at lcast, where marina and homcowners community building & offices arc located, would be underwater. 'The ramps would not function. When levels were down, 133-6
there would not be cnough room for the docks. It scoms there is a compromise. To capture more water when the capability is there would he extremely prudent. But to so drastically impact one particular area by releasing more than the additional capabilities hardly scems fäir, like a "double whammy". There are other avenues which 1 have read that could be considered that would spread and lower the impact. 133-7

Dear Mr. Weeks:
We own a home at Lake Nacimiento and were shocked to learn, recently, of the Salinas Valley Water Project proposal, and the potental impacts it will have on our home, and on the environment around Lake Nacimiento.
First, I am amazed that primary stakeholders, such as those people who live on Lake Nacimiento, were not formally informed of this project and the impacts it will have on 11$. As the EIR states, the project will have significant visual impacts, and will 134-1
severely impact the recreational uses of the Lake. As a primary stakeholder, it is
at' infurlating that we only learned about this proposal through happenstance.
Now that we are aware, and have read the EIR (as best as a layperson can), we have geveral comments.
1. No where in the EIR does it address the economic impacts to property owners 134-2 and, conversely, the impact to San Luis Obiepo County which derives significant income from the taxes collected on lake property.
2. The EIR says there will be no impact to the Bald Eagle population at the Lake, but provides no explanation for this. If the fish population de negatively affected, as 134-3
the EIR says it will be, than it would certainly be expected that the Eagle population would be affected as well.
3. The EIR dismisses the use of recycled water to solve, the saltwater intrusion problems of Monterey County. Why? In that recycled water has been found to be safe, and is being used throughout the State for agricultural uses, why is 134-4

Monterey County so unwilling to consider its use for solving its saltwater intrusion problem? All water is recycled water, after all.
4. The EIR does not state that less water will be taken from the reservoirs in drought years. Therefore, it is assumed that in drought years the Lakes will be drained to accommodate the Salinas Valley Water Project, with no regard to the fact that it 134-5
will devastate the ecosystem of the Lakes. This could have disastrous results.

AR 02575

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-591 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Page Two

Also, the EIR makes mention of the need to accommodate growth in the Salínas Valley. Does thig refer to the growth of agriculture, or the anticipated need for additional housing in the Salinas Valley because of the southward migration of 134-6
Silicon Valley? If the growth referred to in the EIR is not the growth of agriculture, than why the need to re-operate the reservoirs at all?
It seems to me that the water Board is operating on very old information when it refers to the "operational priorities" of the reservoirs. The reservoirs were created in the mid 1950's when agriculture ruled this part of the world. That is no longer the case. In the 50 years since then, property has been developed around the Lake with NO opposition from the water interests. A huge industry has been developed around the recreational uses of the Lake. A Bald Eagle population has flourished 134-7
and grown. And, several kinds of fish have been introduced to the area, and now support a huge population of birds and other wildlife. The reservoirs may have been created for one reason, but they no hold multiple purposes that must be considered as part of an EIR process.
Everywhere else in California, conservation is key. It is how we are solving the energy crisis in California, and it is always the first consideration for dealing with a limited supply of natural resources. Yet, in the Salinas Valley, there is a perceived "unlimited supply" of water in the reservoirs that can be taken at will simply because they staked claim to it nearly half a century ago. The use of recycled water, 134-8
and/or the introduction of drip irrigation systems, would go'a long way toward providing more fresh water to solve the saltwater intrusion problems without taking a single drop of additional water from the reservoirs. This should be Alternative A, but it is not even considered.

The Salinas Valley Water Project proposal needs a lot more work. The people who own property on and around the Lakes need to be included. San Luis Obispo 134-9
County needs to be included. The Bald 1 gle population neede to be considered. 134-10
Finally, the EIR needs to address what happens in a drought yeat, or when there is lese than average rainfall. 134-11

134-3 Please refer to response to Comment 2-10 for information on potential effects to bald eagles.

134-4 The premise of this comment is incorrect. Since 1998, the Monterey County Water
Recycling Projects, consisting of the CSIP and the SVRP, have supplied the Castroville area with tertiary-treated recycled water to use for agricultural irrigation in lieu of groundwater pumping. Over 11,000 AFY of recycled water was used to irrigate crops in this region last year. The continued (and expanded) use of recycled water is an important component of the SVWP.
134-5 Please see response to Comment 20-3 regarding operations during drought conditions. Please refer to Master Response MR-7 and response to Comment 24-10 for information on potential effects on terrestrial wildlife.
134-6 MCWRA is the public agency charged with the long-term management and conservation of water resources in the Salinas Valley. MCWRA does not control the end-use of the water it manages. It is MCWRA's strategy to target delivery of diverted SVWP water so that it is has the greatest potential to efficiently meet the proposed project's objectives/needs. This would best be accomplished by making deliveries in the northern area of the Basin and correspondingly reducing
withdrawals from the 180- and 400-Foot aquifers in that area. Please refer to Master
Response MR-3.

134-7 The primary purpose of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs has always been for

MCWRA.
We (attached) believe this project would be more cost effective for MCWRA to fund and divert the salt water intrusion from their own back yard. The property losses at Heritage Ranch and Oak Shores alone will exceed a half a billion dollars. Some here are multiple home owners and will be greatly affected by this project. When Paso Robles area merchants understand the impact this project will have on their businesses, the residents directly involved with property losses will not be the only 135-1
parties to enter a class action law suite. There are four major retail boating shops, many repair shops, gas stations, grocery stores, fairgrounds, Walmart, Target and the town of Paso itself that will feel the impact and I guarantee will do something about it. MCWRA could be paying out two billion or more by the time this county and it's residents are finished. Much more money than their most expensive proposal. MCWRA speculates this project will work and without guarantee. When and if this project fails to rectify the problem, what and when will the next EIR proposal be. MCWRA can not legally cause this county, businesses and/or it's residents hardship or losses without 135-2
compensation. We suggests MCWRA get together, sharpen their pencils and re-evaluate this project and the long term affects it will have on their neighbors. The time MCWRA spends in court over the next several years, their project could be completed without incident.

Dear Mr. Smith;
This letter is in opposition to the SVWP. We are property owners at Lake Nacimiento. We spend most of our free time enjoying our lake. We moved here two years ago to live a "slower* life and have not regretted our decision. However, we are very concerned about the proposed Salinas Valley Water Project. The decrease of the lake will leave this lake a virtual mud hole.

Our opposition to this project is in regards to several concerns. Our main concern is the loss of property values. The property values have increased greatly around the lake. With the water decrease suggested in this 137-1
proposal our property values would plummet. In addition to this there is the revenue from the weekenders and boaters that support the small community of Paso Robles and surrounding areas. Not only does this support 137-2
San Luis Obispo county but Monterey county receives monies from lake usage permits and camping. Another concern is the wildlife that lives around the lake. Especially the nesting bald eagles that share the lake with us. 137-3

What kind of studies have been made regarding the impact of the three areas of concem? Wil this proposal benefit the greater good or only a small number of Salinas Valley farmers?
Please consider this proposal carefully and weigh all concerns listed above and others that we have not even touched upon.

As a property owner at Lake Nacimiento, I have many concerns over the proposed plans by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency.
First and foremost, while I sympathize with the salt-water intrusion problém, I believe there are many other solutions that the Monterey County Water Resources Agency could
implement that would solve the salt-water intrusion problem more efficiently and 138-1
effectively than the proposals in the EIR dated June 2001. i plan to direct these
comments to the Monterey County Water Resources Agency and County Board of Supervisors in a separate letter.
In response solely to the EIR for the Salinas Valley Water Project dated June 2001, please accept the following comments and concerns to be
addressed in the revision of the report.
1) The exact information and guidelines on the depletion of water from Lake Nacimiento and San Antonio is very vague. These specific guidelines should be
clearly defined by the following criteria:
Defined calendar of release periods Exact percentage or volume ranges of water releases per week or month (a defined time period) Exact criteria in Monterey County that would require specific releases of water ( i.e. if a 138-2

specific measurement of _Monterey County water table is then
should be released over a time period of weeks.
Any extenuating circumstances at Lake Nacimiento and San Antonio that would require deviating from the existing guidelines.
Any extenuating circumstances within Monterey County that would require deviating from the existing guidelines

2) The exact information on the impact during the construction period on the dam
is very inadequate. Please address the following criteria: The estimated range of the time to begin and end all aspects of construction or 138-3
changes to the dam and spillways. The.maximum level of water that will be allowed to stay in the lake during this time
period of changing and re-constructing the dam and spillways.

Dear Mr. Meyer,

am writing to express my opinion as a property owner in the Oak Shores area. I am against any projects that would have a negative impact on the visual and recreational value of Lake Nacimiento and Lake San Antonio. If the SVWP results in the decrease of the average surface elevation of up to 28 feet then I feel this certainly has a severe and significant negative impact 139-1

on these two lakes.

The DEIR also does not address the economic and property value issues which are. extremely important to those property owners around these two lakes. I have enjoyed for over 20 years the recreational aspects of Lake Nacimiento. My wife and myself saved for many years to accomplish dream of being able 139-2

to own property at Lake Nacimiento. To lose the monetary value and recreational benefits of owning this property after having worked so hard for it for such a long period of time greatly disturbs me.
To have this project implemented by individuals that don't have an investment in the area and furthermore don't even live in the area is not fair. 139-3

These lakes provide a great asset to the community, and help with the bonding of the family unit, which is so important these days in our society, but not at the water levels as suggested by this project.
I urge you to protect these lakes and leave them as they are.

'Comments to Salinas Valley Water Project EIR:
I would like the opportunity to present my concerns regarding the Salinas Valley Water Project Environmentel Impact Report SCH# 2000034007 daled June 2001 for the Monterey County Water Resources Agency.
1) The spillway modification that is proposed in the EIR is being designed to be able to pass PMF (probable maximum flood) WITHOUT the assistance of a flood pool. These 140-1
structural changes are larger than necessary. (See page 3-7 under Preferred Structural Change to Spillway).
2) • With the new PMF rule curve, Federal law states that the existing reservoirs must operate with a flood pool of 167,900 acre-feet This is an increase of 50,000 acre-feet 140-2
above our present flood pool requirements.
3) The spillway being described in the EIR consists of cutting the existing spillway eight (8) feet deeper (800 ft. - spilway elevation currentty will be reduced to 792 ft.) Also, sides of the spillway chute need to be raised approximately 10 feet with the proposed changes in 140-3

order to accommodate increased flows. Also in the proposal is a rubber dam or radial gates which would allow a raise in the spillway height back to the present elevation (up 8 ft.)
4) Missing in this EIR, is an allemative to the proposed modifications (i.e. a minor spillway modification of only 3 to 4 ft. depth? side walls?, no radial gates?, no rubber dam?), which would address the additional 50,000 acre-feet change in the present flood pool and a cost analysis showing the difference between such a minor spillway modification 140-4
and the proposed changes which could significantly alter the flood protection that we've all been paying for during the last 40 years. (See page 3-10, Section 3.2.1; Construction and Cost.)
5) The EIR also states that with the proposed spillway modifications, there will be an additional 29,000 AFY available for release above and beyond the historical figures the EIR states that the add. 29,000 AFY would be utilized for re-charge and diversion 140-5
downstream.• I seriously question the veracity of this assumption. We've been told by

AR 02593

Salinas Valley Water Project .2-609 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the MCWRA that re-charge from the dams through the summer conservation releäses is already at maximum levels, so the only benefit for additional water releases is for diversion downstream. The additional water releases needed for diversion to the Salinas Valley Water Project should only be 9,700 AFY. (see Page 3-11, Section 3.2.3, Salinas River Recharge, Conveyance & Diversion.)
In closing: If this is the case, the spilwey being proposed in the EIR is grossly over-sized. 140-5

downstream. This raises more questions and creates serious flood control issues for population centers (cont'd)

140-1 The spillway modification will enable the MCWRA to increase the capacity of the spillway in order to be able to pass a significant storm or PMF. The modification of the spillway will not enable the MCWRA to increase the maximum level of the teservoir above 800 feet and will not allow the MCWRA to operate the reservoir in the winter/early spring without flood pool capacity (i.€., available storage capacity in the reservoir to hold additional inflow to the reservoir from a storm). The reservoir
would be operated with available storage, as presented in Figure 5.3-4 on page 5.3-12 of the Draft EIR/EIS. Please see response to Comment 140-4.

140-3 This comment does not raise any issues regarding the environmental analysis; no
further response is required.
140-4 The purpose of the Nacimiento dam spillway modification is to pass the PMF, as noted in response to Comment 140-1. If a spillway modification were constructed that could not pass the PMF, the MCWRA would have to operate with lower reservoir levels in winter and early spring in order to pass the PMF. Those lower levels would reduce the amount of water available for conservation releases and
hinder the ability of the MCWRA to meet the project objectives. In addition, because reservoir levels would be lower than estimated in the Draft EIR/EIS
analysis, recreational uses would be affected even more than shown in the analysis.
The dam and spillway modifications will not alter the flood protection of the area
around Nacimiento Reservoir, and will increase the protection downstream. There is
no need to consider other alternatives to the 8-foot spillway modification as no
impacts related to this size (versus a different size) are raised.

SUBJECT: Salinas Valley Water Project EIR
Dear Mr. Meyer:
As property owners for the past 20 years at Heritage Ranch, Lake Nacimiento, we are very concemed about the impact the above referenced water project would have on our property values. We purchased property at Lake Nacimiento 20 years ago with the understanding that this was lake was for recreational purposes. We have enjoyed our time and experience so much that we purchased a second 141-1
piece of property several years ago with the hope of constructing a larger bome for our retirement years. It was our understanding that the water level at Lake Nacimiento would be maintained to accommodate all launch ramp facilities.
Modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam would benefit everyone and allow more water to be stored in the lake during the winter. The dam modification would then allow for the release of water 141-2
when the previous winter lake levels exceed the current flood rules, with water levels. being maintained at the necessary level to ensure ramp access.
We urge you to consider the impact the DEIR as written would have on this beautiful lake and surrounding properties.

Dear Sir,

I just had a quick comment and question:
Since I am soon to become a landowner on Lake Nacimiento. I have reviewed the DEIR. The bottom line is that Montery county is looking to get more water but the residents'(part
or full time) of lake Nacimiento do not want to have their lake levels lowered.

It would appear to me that a SIMPLE WIN-WIN solution would be to alter the lake Nacimiento Dam to hold water at a higher level level 820 feet. perhaps making the nominal lake

t This is WIN for Montery county water in that they have a right to fill the lake to 825 ft of elevation I'm certain the additional 20 ft will yield far more water than iowering the lake from its present level by an additional 20 ft 142-1
(sort of the "martini glass effect" the glass holds 50+% of the volume) in that the top 1/2* of
This ls WIN for the Lake Naciemiento residents if the spillway is increase in capacity the lake level can remain higher in wet months the draw down will. be slower in dry months while still achieving more volume to MCWRA
In this case the dam may have to be reinforced to support the water load with the lake level at 825 ft and the spillway would have to be widened to account for 100 year flood type events of heavy rains late in the season
Why is this not an option being reviewed? (it appears to satisfy both groups needs)
any insight would be helpful

thank you' for your help

Subject: Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Gentlemen:

I have had an opportunity to review the subject document. I offer the following general comments relative to the document as a whole, as well as comments relating to specific sections of the document.

Problem Definition and Obiectives

The subject report states that one of the objectives of the proposed action is to stop seawater intrusion and
to do that "aquifer pumping and recharge rates must be brought into balance. The rest of the then report
deals with solutions which increase the recharge rates. There is little or no discussion regarding solutions which relate to the overdraft conditions which are caused by aquifer over-pumping. There is a brief 146-1
reference to "pumping limitations in areas where project water is delivered" and" Delivery Area Pumping Management, " but no explanation of what that means, how it would be carried out or what the affect would be. This needs to be explained.
In addition, there is no is discussion of other measures to reduce the problem of over-pumping. There needs to be analysis of the effects of an area wide water conservation program including mandatory requirements for new irrigation methods, crop management programs, well drilling restrictions and other programs .which could reduce the need for additional water. It is noted that in Chapter 4.3, conservation is listed as an alternative that was considered and rejected. It is further stated the rational for rejection was included in the October 1998 DEIR. A review of that document revealed that "Although the capital costs associated with this alternative would have been low in comparison to other alternatives, the.indirect economic effects 146-2
on agricultural practices and support industries would have been devastating to the local and regional economies...Although not quantified, it is generally accepted that the relative reduction (between 30 and 50%) needed to stop seawater intrusion and balance the Basin would have sever economic and social impacts, and indirect environmental impacts on prime farmland productivity.' While it was not considered prudent to continue pursuing this alternative for total balancing of the basin, some combination of these
programs in conjunction with the preferred action should be considered. It could go a long way to increase the viability of the project. To proceed with this project without dealing with the real cause will not correct the problem (as the report notes in the Potential Expanded Delivery System Section). Additional water will be required by the year 146-3
2030. To keep relying on increased water supplies without trying to decrease the demand is irresponsible.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-625 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS
AR 02609

To not include alternatives or project elements that address reducing the demand in this DEIR/DEIS is not consistent with the intent or requirements of CEQA and NEPA. 146-3

To use the diverted Salinas River water only in the CSIP delivery area does not appear to help to eliminate • 146-4
pumping or stop sea-water intrusion in the areas to the south. Some discussion is required to explain how is
this project will have a benefit in those areas.

Recreation
The report states that the reservoirs were constructed to provide the primary benefit of water conservation and flood control 'and that recreational resources are secondary. While they may have been constructed and financed with that goal, the State License for Diversion and Use of Water at Nacimiento, issued in August of 1955, gave Monterey County a right to use the water for the purpose of irrigation, domestic, municipal, industrial and recreational uses". In addition, when the MCRWA filed an application for a 146-5
permit to divert additional water in 1996, they stated "water under this application will be used for the purpose of recreation at the reservoir and will also be released for percolation...". When that permit was finally issued in March of this year it stated the purpose of use to be the same as the original license. Nothing in the original license or recent permit purports to give one use a priority over the other. It should also be noted that water conservation and flood control is not mentioned at all.
submit to summarily describe the impacts on the recreation and visual resources at Lake Nacimiento as
"significant and unavoidable" because the Agency sees recreation as secondary is unconscionable.

Recreation (including visual resources and fisheries) was created by Monterey County and has been 146-6
enjoyed by millions of people over the past 45 years. To significantly impact that rêsource without an adequate analysis or evaluation of the mitigation measures is wrong! There are mitigation measures which can be developed which would decrease the impact on recreation significantly. See the following comments on reoperation.

Reoperation

The report states that the Lake "can be reoperated to release less water in the wet season and release it
during the irrigation season." If that is what this project proposes then there would be little impacts on the
lakes. But the reoperation doesn't do that. It provides an opportunity to store more water in the wet season for release in the irrigation season, but if the wet season isn 't wet the additional irrigation water is released anyway. The "it" water isn t used.
By redefining the reoperation to only allow additional irrigation releases when the previous winter lake
levels exceed the current flood rule curve levels (i.e. elevation 777.3 at Nacimiento on January Ist) and then by only that additional amount, the intent to the description above would be met and lower lake levels would be avoided. 146-7

The spillway modification will allow for significant amounts of additional water to be stored during the winter. The fact that during some years additional water will not be stored and as a result would not be released should not have a significant effect on the ground water basin as explained in the report section, Drought Contingency Planning. The conjunctive use theory states "Conjunctive use takes advantage of surface water supplies during periods of availability and preserves groundwater supplies for use during periods of drought or other periods when water supplies are not available. Here, we are only considering the proposed additional water that may not be available, not all of the water which would occur in a sever drought condition.
As you can see, with the above scenario the Lakes would be operated much as they have been in the past, except in wet years when additional water can be stored it would then be released during the irrigation season. If no additional water is captured then the releases would be made as they have been historically
and no diversions would be made. This more than likely would not result in significant and unavoidable
visual and recreational impacis and would still allow for increased ground water levels.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-626 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS
AR 02610

The modeling that was used for the analysis of the preferred action must be re-run using this approach so a 146-7
realistic comparison can be made as to the overall effect and to show that mitigation is, in fact, available!!
Operational Policy

The operational policy that creates an empty space in the Nacimiento Water Conservation Pool that is three times that of the San Antonio Water Conservation Pool empty space on November 1" of each year, needs to be reviewed. When the San Antonio Flood Rule Curve was revised in the summer of 2000 the conservation pool empty space was increased by 60,100 acre-feet. By using the current operational policy, that means that required conservation pool empty space in Nacimiento would need to be increased by 146-8
180,300 acre-feet. That exceeds the volume of the reservoir. What occurs is that excessive releases are made from Nacimiento to try to establish the 3 to 1 ratio just because the Flood Rule Curve at San Antonio was changed. Nothing has changed in terms of the amount of inflow to either Lake, so why should Nacimiento be penalized with lower lake levels? The rational for this needs to be explained or the policy abandoned.

Economic Considerations

The reports states that "Annual revenues generated by recreational activities at both Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, although not considered environmental or physical effects subject to CEQA, are presented here as background information for the decision-makers to consider during their review." If the
economic impacts were used to evaluate and reject the conservation alternative (see Project Definition and 146-9
Objectives discussion above) why then were they not used in this report to evaluate the project effect on the Lake neighborhood and the County of San Luis Obispo? The reduced Lake levels will have a significant and unavoidable impact on the economics of the area and need to be discussed.

Document Format

This is easily one of the most confusing and misleading documents I have ever read. In the Summary
Section the Proposed Action and Alternatives are referred to as Alternative A thru E. But then in Chapter 146-10
3 and 4 there are no references to Alternatives at all. The page footers refer to the Proposed Alternative, Preferred Alternative and Preferred Action, what happened to Proposed Action?. Chapter 4.0 is entitled Description Of Alternatives To The Preferred Action, but the page footer is Alternatives Including the 146-11
Preferred Action. Is the North Valley Storage explained in this chapter a potential component of the Alternative A?

Specific Comments

Chapter 1.4.1 - "No subsequent CEQA or NEPA review would be required for the proposed action after the certification of this EIR/EIS". The proposed action is Alternate A. What about Alternate B and some of the elements defined which may be implemented in the future to deal with year 2030 demands? Will another EIR de 146-12
required or is the project action going to be redefined to include Alternate B?

Chapter 1.5.4 -
Fire Protection will be effected by the proposed action. Lower lake levels at Nacimiento will effect the two boats operated by the Fire Department in terms not being able get as close to lakeside structures. When levels are below elevation 730 they won 't be able to launch. These are significant items relating to public 146-13
safety.

Chapter 2.2.1 -
1. The modification of the spillway has the potential to allow the reservoir to store a higher volume of water throughout the wet season. If it doesn't rain sufficiently, the increased capacity is 146-14

worthless.
AR 02611

Salinas Valley Water Project . 2-627 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

5. Pumping Limitations. Here and in Chapter 3.2.5 pumping restrictions and limits are only discussed as they relate to areas that receive project water directly. What about limitations and/or 146-15
restrictions on pumping in other areas? After all, that is what has created the problem initially
and continues to increase it.

Chapter 2.3 & 2.4 - "Reduction in lake levels at Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs (short and long Term) to the degree that recreational opportunities are substantially affected during the peak recreation season" is a Significant and Unavoidable Impact... and Mitigation is not available or feasible. This is not true. As stated above, by redefining the reoperation the impacts can be mitigated so that they are not significant. 146-16
While the increased releases may be less than anticipated with this project they will be more than they have been historically and will still have a beneficial result on ground water recharge. This can be shown with
a new model run.

Chapter 3.2 - "The preferred action would be implemented as single project, with the potential future phase to expand the delivery area.' It is very unlikely that each project component will be constructed simultaneously. 146-17
Therefore, a phasing plan needs to be adopted within this document that requires the Modification of the. Nacimiento Spillway to be completed before the Reoperation or Salinas River Recharge, Conveyance and Diversion components are allowed to become operational.

Chapter 3.2.1 - The GEI, Inc.Study mentioned was reviewed by the Reservoir Operation Committee in preliminary draft 146-18
form some years ago. The Report was finally presented to the ROC at the August 9, 2001 meeting. As far as I know, the Final GEI Report has never been formally accepted by the MWRA Board.
The statement "The additional storage gained at Nacimiento would be released for Basin recharge and diversion later in the year." is misleading and not true. The releases would be made even if there is no 146-19
additional water gained. This needs to be clarified, or as discussed previously the reoperation needs to be redefined to agree with the statement.
Chapter 3.2.2 -
As stated above, general recreation is not a incidental benefit. It is required by the State License. 146-20

The reports states the preferred reoperation would result in approximately 29,000 AFY of additional stored water. If the Diversion is only going to use 9,700 AFY initially and as much as 18,300 AFY by 2030, why 146-21
are the lake levels going to be lower? Seems to me they should be going up by 10,700 to 19,300 AFY. This need to be explained more fully and in greater detail.

Chapter 3.2.3- "Approximately 172,000 AFY would be released... an increase of 30,000 AFY compared with baseline conditions." Again, if the Diversion is only a maximum of 18,300 AFY why the increase of 30,000 AFY? 146-22
Explain.

The diversion gates will only be raised from April 1 to May 30 ( think that should be October 30) and will be lowered from November 1 to March 30. Why? With the large capital expenditure for this structure, why wouldn 't it be used to divert some of the winter flows that run into the Ocean? The diverted water could be 146-23
pumped to some recharge ponds or storage ponds for use during the irrigation season, thereby relieving some of the demand on the Reservoirs. Explain why this is not considered.

Figures 5.3-5 & 5.3-34.- These figures show a combined annual average change in reservoir releases of 53.6 acre-feet for the peak 146-24
irrigation season for the Existing Plus Alternative A and 59.0 acre-feet change for the Future plus
AR 02612

**

Alternative A. Where do these quantities come from? They do not even come close to the 9,700 or 18,300 acre-feet per year diversions recited elsewhere in the document.
If these are the actual anticipated increases in releases, then the balance of the document is totally misleading, untrue and unclear. The figures need to be clarified or the report needs to be rewritten to 146-24
verbally explain the project clearly. There needs to be included a graphical representation of the historic releases versus the proposed releases of the various alternatives so that a clear understanding of the (cont'd)
differences can be seen and the data can be verified.
This concerns holds true for Figures 5.3-8 and 5.3-37 also. How can you have an increase in releases of 15,000 acre-feet in May and June from Nacimiento alone when the diversion is 9700 acre-feet from both Lakes for the whole year? Most confusing!!! Needs explanation. 146-25

Page 5.3-42 - The report states "The is basic premise of the project, however, is that the diversions would continue during
normal and above normal water years; however, the rate of diversion would be reduced during below
normal water years, and potentially halted during dry and critical water years". This statement needs to 146-26
be quantified. What is the definition of normal and above normal, below normal, dry and critical water years? How much diversion for how water is in storage at the beginning of the irrigation season need to be defined. If this is done in accordance with the scenario as set forth in the general comments earlier in this letter, and based upon an analysis that would lessen the effects on the lake levels, the proposed significant effects could be migrated and would no longer be unavoidable.
A statement at the bottom of this page implies (and the General Manager concurred) that the Baseline and Future Baseline data was developed based on no releases being made in September and October but the
Alternative data assumed releases during those months. If this is the case, the data is flawed. The 146-27
cessation of releases in September and October has only occurred during the last few years and should not have been applied over the total past historic time period. An analysis using this premise would give di storted information relative to lake level differences and could affect other aspect of the data as carried from year to year. The baseline criteria needs to be revised based upon actual historic operation and included in the report for review.
Chapter 9.2 Organizations and Persons Consulted - I find it interesting that out of all of the people contacted only 5 were from San Luis Obispo County and 4 of those were from County Agencies. What about all of the other San Luis County Agencies and many individuals who have a stake in the reservoir by virtue of owning property, having an interest in the 146-28

domestic use of the water, having a business that relies on the Lakes or an interest in some other way. Those people should have been contacted or at the very least notified of the EIR Process thru the NOI just as is required for Public Agencies.

hope you find these comments beneficial towards your completion of the final EIR/EIS. The report needs to be completely revised in order to correct the discrepancies, inaccuracies and totally confusing aspects. To try and respond to the various comments with an addendum, appendix or à different document will only confuse the issues more and potentially lead to additional and significant problems for your Agency in the long term.

LETTER 146

Norman E. Flowers
August 24, 2001

146-1 Recipients of the surface water delivered as part of the SVWP would use this water
supply in lieu of pumping an equivalent amount of groundwater. Therefore, the water provided through the SVWP would serve both to recharge the Basin and to substitute for groundwater that would otherwise be pumped, helping to bring the Basin into balance. Please see Master Responses MR-1 and Master Response MR-5 regarding water conservation practices being implemented in the Salinas Valley.
146-2 Please refer to Master Response MR-5 for information on water conservation
measures practiced in the Salinas Valley. MCWRA agrees that water conservation is a critical component of halting seawater intrusion and is part of the irrigation and urban culture of the Valley.

146-3 Please refer to Master Response MR-5 for information on water conservation measures practiced in the Salinas Valley. Reduction of demand on the order needed to halt seawater intrusion was considered in the EIR/EIS and the magnitude of needed reduction is not economically feasible. Alternatives D and E of the EIR/EIS
essentially address the amount of demand and reduction needed and the resultant
impacts.

146-4 Please see Master Response MR-1 and response to Comment 20-25.
146-5 The comment is correct in that recreational use is one of the purposes of the State License for Diversion and Use of Water at Nacimiento. However, priority is given
to releases that provide maximum groundwater recharge for the entire Salinas Valley. This priority release has also been adopted by the MCWRA Board of Directors.
As to flood control, this was one of the purposes behind construction of the dam when it was financed by Monterey County, but flood control is not, technically, a "use" of water. As to water conservation, MCWRA has accomplished the application of irrigation water rights through groundwater recharge and other
conservation practices.

146-6 Please see Master Response MR-2.
146-7 Modeling completed for the EIR/EIS considers all water-year types that have historically occurred (over 46-year period), so is considered reflective of expected future conditions. With spillway modifications in place, the reservoirs will be capable of holding more water in wet years, when the flood control rule curve dictates release schedules. Both this additional (re-operated) water and dryer year conditions were

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-630 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

evaluated in deriving the project, The commenter's proposed scenario would not provide a sufficient quantity of water to meet the objectives of the project. Please see response to Comment 74-2.

146-8 The release schedule for both Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs is reviewed
by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency Reservoir Operations Committee
on a monthly basis. Based on the operations policy developed for the reservoirs by the committee, the operations ratio is defined as the ratio of empty space in the conservation pools of San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs, with San Antonio as the numerator. This ratio is 1 to 3. Reservoir releases are made in such a manner that the ratio is reached prior to halting releases from both reservoirs at the onset of
the rainy season. The Reservoir Operations Committee can review the policy duting its monthly meetings. Also, please see Master Response MR-1.
146-9 Potential project alternatives may be eliminated from consideration if preliminary evaluation indicates that environmental, economic, and/or technical issues would
render them infeasible. Consistent with CEQA and the NEPA CEQ Regulations, the Draft EIR/EIS did not evaluate economic effects of the SVWP as environmental effects in themselves, but information about the economic effects of the project on the local recreation industry has been included in this Final EIR/EIS to assist in the
understanding of the extent of physical effects of the project. Please tefer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of the project's effects on the local economy in northern San Luis Obispo County.

146-10 The editorial comments on the Draft EIR/EIS provided by the commenter are
noted. It is acknowledged that the document is complex, but no substantial evidence has been presented to support the contention that it is misleading. These are not comments on the impacts of the project, Please also see Comment 3-1, which
a provides a contrary view on the format and readability of the document.

146-11 The North Valley Storage component described in Chapter 4.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS is proposed under Alternative B, not the preferred action (Alternative A). The footer on the page is mistitled, but the chapter and discussion are consistent.
146-12 Alternative B is no longer being pursued by MCWRA as the preferred alternative. The impacts associated with Alternative B were presented in the Draft EIR/EIS for comparative purposes with all other alternatives. Because this alternative is not being considered for implementation, no additional actions will be pursued by
MCWRA for Alternative B.

If an expanded distribution system is necessary in the future to meet the project objectives, a more detailed analysis of monitoring data will be conducted to determine where an expanded distribution system would be placed to achieve optimum benefit. At that time: project level environmental analysis will be
conducted to assess the impacts and effectiveness of different distribution system alternatives and describe in greater detail the location of the distribution system.

146-14 The commenter is correct in noting that the increased storage capacity will provide no additional benefit during dry years. Please see response to Comment 146-7.
146-15 Pumping limitations to address seawater intrusion outside the delivery area are addressed as Alternative D, "Total Demand Management", Please see the description of this alternative on page 4-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS and a discussion of impacts, of this alternative throughout the document.

146-17 Please see responses to Comments 146-6 and 146-7.
146-17 Modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam would increase flexibility of reservoir operations by allowing modifications to the existing flood rule curve to store water during late winter and spring months. This flexibility would enable.
implementation of reservoir reoperation to the degree needed to meet the targets for downstream recharge and diversion. Therefore, the spillway at Nacimiento Dam would need to be modified before the project would be fully effective.

146-18 The GEI study was completed in July 2001 and made some recommendations concerning the PMF. The study was sent to DSOD and FERC for review and comment. The GEI report must go through several other reviews before it can go to the MCWRA Board of Directors for action. This is not envisioned until mid-
2002.

146-19 Section 3.2.1 is not intended to describe the whole reoperation that would occur with implementation of the proposed action. It merely describes that portion of the reoperation that would be possible given modification of the dam and spillway. No change to the text is needed. See also response to Comment 146-7.
146-20 Please see response to Comment 146-5.
146-21 Please see Master Response MR-1.
146-22 Please see Master Response MR-1. Note that this release is within the MCWRA's water rights license for release of 180,000 AFY.

146-23 The following sentence was erroneously omitted from the bottom of page 3-12 of the Draft EIR/EIS:

"May 30 - October 31 - Gates raised, water impounded to El. 9.0, bypassing up to 20 cfs through the fish ladder with the Salinas River Lagoon closed or up to 15 cfs with
the lagoon open, and diverting up to 85 cfs."
This correction is included in Chapter 3.0 of this document, Changes to the Draft EIR/EIS. 5
The commenter is suggesting that the proposed project be modified to divert water at the surface diversion facility in winter months while it is available and store it in 02616

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-632 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

recharge ponds or storage ponds for use during the irrigation season. However, in
order to minimize potential impacts to steelhead, listed as an endangered species,
duting spawning season, the in-stream diversion facility can only be operational from April to October. The project would not be permittable by the National Marine Fisheries Service if water was impounded year round and steelhead migration was impeded. Therefore, it would not be feasible to store water in the impoundment area and divert it to storage ponds during the winter months.
Further, seawater intrusion is occurring within the 180-foot aquifer and the 400-foot aquifer in the pressure area of the Salinas Valley. In the Pressure area (see Figure 3-2 in the Draft EIR/EIS), relatively impermeable clay layers are prevalent. Clay layers overlie the 180-foot aquifer and separate the 180-foot aquifer from the 400-foot aquifer. Therefore, recharge of the 180-foot and 400-foot aquifers via percolation recharge ponds would not be efficient.
146-24 Please see Master Response MR-1. After release of the Draft EIR/EIS, values shown in the figures referenced by the commenter were found to be incorrect. See Master Response MR-4 and Changes to Section 5.3 (Hydrology and Flooding) in Chapter 3.0 of this document for the corrected figures.

146-25 Please see Master Response MR-1. Note that the majority of releases recharge the groundwater basin. A small amount (9,700 AFY) is diverted for irrigation.
146-26 A water year is the period of October : through September 30 of the following year. For purposes of the modeling and description of project operations, a water year is considered "normal" when there is the accumulation of approximately 13.5 inches of rain at the Salinas Airport. The amount of water collected in the reservoir during normal and above-normal water years is greater than in below-normal water years. Since more water is available, potentially more water can be released for diversion at
the diversion structure. During below-normal water years, there is less potential to
release water to the diversion site, and during very dry years, it is possible that no
water at all may be released. The MCWRA Board of Directors through the MCWRA Reservoir Operations Committee will establish a release schedule each
spring for flow from the reservoirs to the diversion site given specified elevations of the lakes. For more information, refer to Master Response MR-1.
146-27 Baseline conditions are not meant to replicate historical conditions. The baseline model runs are developed for the purpose of assessing what would occur in the future should existing conditions, including current reservoir operations, and land
use and water demand projections be carried forward. This allows for a more accurate basis of comparison with the model results for the proposed action, in order , to determine changes attributable to the project, than could be achieved by comparing historical conditions with project conditions. Since 1996, releases have been curtailed for 6 weeks during September and October to allow the Salinas River
channel to dry out so vegetation and sand bar removal can occur for flood control, 5 as allowed by Clean Water Act Section 404 Permit No. 223095. If the practice of ceasing releases were to continue with the project, modeling has found that seawater 02617

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-633 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

intrusion would not be halted. Therefore, the project assumes no cessation of flows. Without the project, current practices are assumed to continue.

Re: DEIR/EIS for the SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT
SCH# 2000034007

Dear Mr. Weeks and Mr. Smith:
On behalf of our clients in the Salinas Valley, please consider this a response to the DEIR/EIS dated June 2001 for the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP) released by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (Agency or MCWRA). Our clients' comments regarding the technical, historical, engineering, economic, other shortcomings, and omissions and errors of the DEIR/EIS are contained in the enclosed memoranda of Dr. Peter Reinelt and Dr. David Hornbeck. Their respective résumés are also enclosed. This letter supplements our letter of July 30, 2001 to Mr. Curtis Weeks.

The Agency is in a uniquely conflicted position that militates in favor of designating a truly and institutionally un-conflicted entity as the lead agency under CEQA. This (1) contractual and (2) structural conflict may explain why' the "Alternatives" section of the DEIR/EIS is less than clear and is in need of substantial revision and additions according to the EPA's comments, i.e., the 147-1

AR 02619

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-630 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

SVWP DEIR/EIS comments Page 2 8/27/01

Agency is already invested in securing the Preferred Alternative at the cost of neglecting a thorough basis upon which lesser or different alternatives* can be found to be more meritorious under all of the circumstances.
The EIR/EIS fails because it does not meet the standards set forth in 40 CFR Section 1502.14. The section provides as follows:
Sec. 1502.14. Alternatives including the proposed action.
This section is the heart of the environmental impact statement. Based on the information and analysis presented in the sections on the Affected Environment (Sec. 1502.15) and the Environmental Consequences (Sec. 1502.16), it should present the environmental impacts of the proposal and the alternatives in comparative form, thus sharply defining the issues and providing a clear basis for choice among options by the decision maker and the public. In this section agencies shall: (a) Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives, and for alternatives which were eliminated from detailed study, briefly discuss the reasons for their having been
eliminated. 147-1

(b) Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in • (cont'd)
detail including the proposed action so that reviewers may evaluate
their comparative merits. (c) Include reasonable alternatives not within the jurisdiction of the lead agency. (d) Include the alternative of no action. (e) Identify the agency's preferred alternative or alternatives, if
one or more exists, in the draft statement and identify such alternative in the final statement unless another law prohibits the expression of such a preference. (f) Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.

There are numerous fundamental problems with the DEIR:

1. The Agency contracted away its independence before it started acting as a lead agency and as a consequence, it cannot act as a Lead Agency under CEQA (Delegation)
2. 3. The DEIR is a supplement (Supplement) Material omissions (Omissions)

In order to settle litigation commenced by Tanimura & Antle, Inc. (a strong and vocal proponent of the SV.WP and substantial landowner in the seawater intruded area) and Chris Bunn against the Agency (T&A and Bunn v. MCWRA, Monterey County Superior Court, No. M 46013), the Agency entered into an agreement (the T&A Agreement) prior to the preparation of the DEIR/EIS, which provided in part as follows:
The SVWP Directive shall include, without limitation, the following
elements:
147-2 ****
(2)(b) The proposed Program shall include a clear statement that the Agency will use its Best Efforts to pursue approval and
implementation of the Preferted SVWP. (i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Best Efforts" means reasonable diligence and reasonable efforts under the totality of the circumstances, including cost considerations. Indifference and
inaction do not constitute Best Efforts. Futile action(s) are not
required. (Attached to Exhibits 14 and 17.) The effect of this Agreement is to destroy the neutrality of the EIR process. The Agency can no longer be a lead agency because it cannot act in an objective fashion. The Agency is contractually prevented from actively investigating appropriate alternatives to the preferred project as determined by the T&A Agreement. The necessity for the Agency's

independence is described in detail by the Court of Appeals in Planning Conseryation League v. DWR (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 907. Judge Richard Silver of the Monterey County Superior Court when presented with the.T&A Agreement made the following statement:
COURT: But I don't think that you can agree in advance as to what the CEQA will be of a preferred alternative. [Sic.]
Hearing Transcript, Action M 46013, May 25, 2001, page 5 at lines 15 through 17, as corrected.
The more appropriate state agency to act as the lead agency is the State Water Resources Control Board or the Department of Fish and Game.
The limitations on the Agency imposed by the T&A Agreement are compounded by the particular nature of the Agency's decision making body. Under its organic act, the County Board of Supervisors acting as the Agency's Supervisors makes final decisions. Water Code, Uncodified Act 5064, § 15. The Supervisors are, 147-2
however, precluded from acting without the approval of the Board of Directors (cont'd)
in most situations. Act § 52. Thus, the Directors are the primary decision- makers for the Agency. The Directors, in turn, are selected* based on certain
enumerated criteria, the gist of which is that the Directors are selected based on their affiliation with certain agricultural and other interests, generally aligned geographically (i.e., Northern dominated). Act §8 48, 49. At this time and at all times relevant, the Chair of the Board of Directors is Steve Collins. Mr. Collins. additionally, is the chair of several Agency Committees, including the Basin Management Committee and the Finance Committee. Mr. Collins, as Chair of the Agency, appointed Bob Antle, a Tanimura & Antle principal, onto the Basin Management Plan (BMP) Committee. Mr. Antle was one of the two public members appointed to the BMP Committee. This BMP committee plays a unique environmental compliance role under the T&A Agreement with the Agency and is in charge of the SVWP process at the Directors' level. T&A Agreement, Part I(C)(3) (before Preferred SVWP is modified, consultants must obtain approval of BMP Committee). Based on his public filings and the sworn declarations of his employer, Mr. Collins is an officer of a major Northern grower that owns.or controls substantial lands (5K acres) in the critically seawater intruded area that generally comprises the 12,000 acre Agency Zone 2B. FPPC 700 filings and April 19, 2000 Declaration of Edward Boutonnet in Orradre y. MCWRA, Monterey County Superior Court No. 115777 (Exhibits 5 and 7). The Tanimura & Andle organization appears to own or control approximately 2K of the other acres in that area. Mr. Collins, as Chair, holds a special position of trust and confidence with the County Supervisors. Act § 71(c).

SVWP DEIR/EIS comments Page 5 8/27/01

Whether by happenstance or design, the expected level of healthy skepticism or at least objectivity on the part of the Agency decision makers - led by Chair Collins may not exist at this time. The proposed Preferred Alternative is a project that appears to be just as beneficial to Mr. Collins' employer's interests by virtue of his land control and ownership as it is to the T&A and Bunn interests party to the T&A Agreement. The usual skepticism or healthy antagonism between a public 147-2
agency's Board and a developer (T&A and Bunn) is absent in this instance. Such (cont'd)
a situation makes the objectivity of other public interests that much more critical and entitles to greater weight their misgivings or reservations about the Preferred Alternative or the DEIR/EIS supporting the developer-sponsored alternative.
Even if the conflicts created by the T&A Agreement and Mr. Collins' situation
are not specifically prohibited under CEQA's standards for a lead agency, the better course is to designate truly objective entity to bear the substantial responsibility of bringing the EIR/EIS to conclusion.
Supplement to 1998 DEIR

The SVWP was described in a (Master) DEIR released on or about October 28,
.1998. Comments critical of it were received. The present DEIR sets forth the prior DEIR process and incorporates the prior DEIR and its related technical appendices. DEIR/EIS 1-8; 1-13. The current DEIR, however, fails to respond to the criticisms and comments leveled at the prior DEIR.
147-3
The current DEIR is in substance a supplement to the prior DEIR. It republishes all of the sections of the prior DEIR by incorporation and adds additional (sometime irreconcilably contrary) data and analysis. As a supplemental DEIR, however, the current DEIR fails to identify the ways in which it differs or how it had added (ör subtracted) from the prior DEIR. The memorandum from Dr. Reinelt lists many of the discrepancies between the two editions of the DEIRS, all
of which should have been identified and addressed in a separate explanation or section that compared and contrasted the two editions of the SVWP DEIRS.
Material omissions

The DEIR fails to include and/or reference a series of documents and facts. A
list is set forth below, which includes materials referenced herein. The materials are enclosed with this commentary except as otherwise indicated. Among the more blatant omissions are a series of letters this office sent to EDAW in care of 147-4

Water Code

The DEIR/EIS states that the water uses in agricultural will be reduced because of conversation practices and changes in crop patterns. The DEIR assumes that this reduction in water use belongs exclusively to the Agency and can be used as the Agency chooses. The parties who are either reducing water use or have undeveloped land in the Salinas Hydrological Basin as defined by the USGS may choose to change their irrigation practices, land usage, reliance on groundwater and/or crops over the next thirty years. This conserved water may not be available for the needs of the North. The State Legislature has recognized the rights of landowners to do this in Water Code sections 1011 and 1011.5'.
Many parties who are saving water through conservation or have unexercised water rights have appropriately made the allegation that they have water rights. See Save Our Peninsula Committee v, September Ranch Partners (2001) 87 147-5

Cal.App.4th 99 (upholding in part failure of EIR: in Monterey County). The Water Code guarantees people who save water through conservation practices that they have the right to use the conserved water as they choose. The Agency at the SWRCB recognized that people who conserve water have this right. June 28,' 2000 hearing, partial transcript and summary transmitted to Agency in a letter of April 19, 2001 (Exhibit 12). The DEIR/EIS assumes that the conserved water will remain in the basin and the urban areas in the North can use the conserved
water for the . purposes of further development. There is nothing in the law which guarantees the Northern Urban Areas this right. The DEIR/EIS should
discuss in detail what might happen to the urban areas in the North if this conserved water is not available to them.

Demand Management
The DEIR/EIS dismisses the concept that salt-water intrusion can be stopped through demand management. The Agency does not know what a reasonable use for water is for agricultural land throughout the Salinas Valley. Responses of the Agency to Third Set of Special Interrogatories (Nos. 89. et seq.) in Orradre y, MCWRA, Monterey County Superior Court No. 115777 (May 19, 2000*. The
current assessment system of the Agency does not give credit to 147-6
water
conservation so the Agency has not had any reason to study or ascertain reasonable water uses under varying conditions and crops. The study done in connection with the Greenbook indicates through model runs, however, that there would be no salt-water intrusion if the 1905 condition existed in ESUs 1 and 3
with existing development conditions in the rest of Salinas Valley. (Exhibit 6.) The ESUs are the Economic Study Units developed by the Agency to better

define the Salinas Valley. See the Agency's Historical Benefits Analysis (or HBA). • ESUs 1 and 3 are at the mouth of the Salinas Valley and along with ESU 4 are the areas most threatened by salt-water intrusion.

It is well known that there is extensive double and triple cropping and furrow and flood irrigation in ESU 1 and 3. The DEIR makes no analysis of the need for this project if.all growers in the North were required to have more efficient irrigation practices, on-site storage reservoirs and double and triple cropping is reduced. The only data in existence are the Model Runs prepared in the Greenbook. The Agency for unknown political reasons has refused to prepare such model runs with the SVIGSM. See previous discussions on the leadership of the Agency.
In 1995 the Agency settled litigation resulting from the imposition of assessments and upper pumping limits with the promise of the preparation of an EIR. Salinas Valley Water Coalition v. MCWRA and SWRCB, United States District Court, Northern District of California, No. C-93 20870 JW, Order of May 24, 1995. It is our understanding that pursuant to the settlement of this litigation that one of the requirements of the settlement was that before additional assessments and 147-6
upper limits could be considered there had to be a CEQA analysis. This understanding is supported by an Agency memorandum of January 27, 1997 that (cont'd)
discusses the settlement in context of the Agland Report (a predecessor of the HBA) and how water demand options would be analyzed in the EIR for the Basin Management Plan (BMP), the precursor of the SVWP. (Exhibit 2). Since 1995 there have been extensive studies that developed tools and knowledge which make it possible to do a thorough hydrological and economic analysis to demonstrate the extent of demand management that is needed in order to stop the salt-water intrusion problem in the Northem part of the Valley. See the Agland Report, the HBA/EBA, the SVIGSM modeling results, and the Greenbook produced by this office. No analysis with these readily available methods and data' is made in the DEIR/EIS of the possibility the problem can be partially or completely solved through Demand Management. Instead the DEIR/EIS concentrates only on the "Big Bucket" solution.
The County has basic problem--there is a limited amount of water in the SO- called Eastside. One cannot pump water on reclaimed land next to the 'ocean at the levels at which it is being pumped without causing salt-water intrusion. This
problem has been well documented for the last 70 years.
The Agency's solution for the last 50 years has been the "Big Bucket" solution. The "Big Bucket" solution contemplates the building of ever increasing reservoir storage and collecting the flows during the winter and spring 100 miles South of

the problem overdraft area in the Pressure and Eastside. The difficulty has always been conveying this water to the problem area. Pipelines could physically solve the problem but are expensive. Using the Salinas River to convey the water to the overdrafted aquifer is only partially effective because the transmissivity of the aquifers in the Pressure area does not allow the water to migrate to the area fast enough to replace the water pumped during the peak irrigation season. The result is a cone of depression and seawater intrusion. Attempting to convey water by the Salinas River for diversion results in the problems discussed in this letter and the attached memoranda.
At a minimum the Agency should prepare model runs with the current data 147-6
available showing different demands scenarios for ESU 1 and 3. Once these (cont'd)
model runs are made there will be different alternatives for the public to analyze. It could be that a localized physical solution to seawater intrusion could be developed which would have minimum impact on the rest of the Salinas Valley. The solution could consist of a combination of solutions including crop reduction, modification in irrigation practices, construction of on-site reservoirs, and allowing the land adjacent to the ocean to go back to its natural condition. The
SWRCB developed such a program in the Napa and Imperial Valleys and the Courts of California confirmed the programs in People y, Forni (1976) 54 Cal.App.3r4 743 and Imperial IrrigationDistrict v. SWRCB (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 548. There is no reason why such alternatives should not be presented as an option in this DEIR/EIS considering the environmental damage contemplated by the recommended project.

Schuller Memo

This office provided to the DEIR/EIS writers through the Agency a copy of a June 2000 memorandum from the SWRCB that explained the SWRCB's role in and conclusions about the seawater intrusion problems near Castroville. (Exhibit
15). The memorandum specifically described the range of alternatives the SWRCB was considering and which were more likely, Not only is that memo 147-7

conspicuously absent from the DEIR/EIS, the discussion of state adjudication contradicts the memorandum. Part 4.2.4 et seq.
Pending. Litigation
Presently pending is a lawsuit that implicates the SVWP, as initially mentioned above, T&A et al v MCWRA and related cross-action, Monterey County Superior Court No. M46013. That lawsuit, inter alia, raises the issue of the 147-8
effect of the T&A Agreement on the environmental review process of the SVWP and that agreement's suspension of portions of Agency Ordinance 3790. The

AR 02627

lawsuit is not challenging the DEIR/EIS per se, but the results of the lawsuit may affect the environmental review process leading to the EIR/EIS.

The Agency has in its agreement contracted to suspend a portion of Ordinance 3790 that (1) prohibits new water wells from being drilled in the seawater intruded area and (2) mandates the destruction of certain wells so as to prohibit continued reliance on pumped water. Part II.. A and B of the agreement. Ordinance 3790 is by its own terms a component of the Caströville Seawater Intrusion project (being contemplated in the CSIP EIR) and the Board of Supervisors found that its enforcement was critical to the operation of the CSIP. Ordinance 3790, IT D, E, F, and H. See also report to the USBR (Exhibit 8, 147-8

including Ordinance 3790). As Ordinance 3790 will not be enforced, the CSIP |(cont'd)
will by definition lack a component and thus not be in lawful operation. If the CSIP has ceased operating, the Agency has no right to collect Valley wide assessments for the northern seawater intrusion projects. The costs of the non- operating projects will instead be borne by the water payers in Zone 2B. The cessation of Valley-wide assessments for the projects, into which - literally and figuratively the SVWP will feed, may undermine those projects' financial viability. If the CSIP is not properly in place due to a lack of funds, the SVWP will be wasteful and potentially will cause all of the environmental effects detailed without any of the benefits to be realized. The DEIR should discuss how the suspension of parts of Ordinance 3790 will impact the continuing ability of the' Agency to keep the non-SVWP water recycling projects online and what effect a loss of a portion of the financing for those projects will have on the effects of the SVWP.

Third Party Liability
The DEIR fails to. recognize and evalúate an alternative to the preferred alternative. It does not analyze if the repair, modification, or re-operation of the existing seawater intrusion projects (CSIP and SVRP) are feasible. The DEIR states that the problems to be resolved with respect to seawater intrusion is quality, not quantity, i.e., the SVRP is producing enough recycled water for the CSIP's use but its quality is lacking. Our clients raised the water quality issue before the Board of Supervisors in 1998, but the Board ignored those concerns 147-9
and formally accepted the recycling project, thus legislatively determining that the water quality was sufficient. See our February 9, 1998 letter (Exhibit 4). The obvious solution to the late admitted water quality problem is to modify the existing projects to add or change the .process SO that either appropriate quality water is produced or the blending is uniform. It is likely that the designers, consultants, and builders of the projects bear some or all of the responsibility and presumably the costs thereof would be shouldered in part by those responsible

third parties. Further, making the change would create little ör no collateral environmental effects and the same benefits would be realized. For whatever 147-9
reasons, however, the DEIR/EIS is entirely silent about the possibility of fixing the identified problem instead of creating a new and potentially environmentally (cont'd)

damaging new project to work around the problem.

SWRCB
There are three issues involving the SWRCB apart from the SWRCB'S June 2000 memorandum (Schuller memo), as set forth below.

Storage Permit
The EIR suggests that the only permit needed from the SWRCB is a Diversion Permit. It appears from the EIR/EIS that the Agency is proposing to develop a reservoir wherein it will store approximately 20,000 ac feet of water for a period of more than 30 days. Section 657 and 658 of the Regulations of the SWRCB provides as follows:
Regulation of water means the direct diversión of water to a tank or reservoir in order that the water may be held for use at a rate other than the rate at which it may be conveniently diverted from its source. For licensing purposes, refill, in whole or in part, held in tank or reservoir for less than 30 days shall be considered regulation
of water. 147-10

Storage of water means the collection of water in a tank or reservoir during a time of higher stream flow which is held for• use during a time of deficient stream flow. For licensing purposes all initial collections within the collection season plus refill, in whole or in part, held in a tank or reservoir for more than 30 days shall be considered water diverted for storage except as provided in Section 735(c).

Title • 23 CCR §§ 657, 658. predecessor and the SWRCB at The correspondence between the Agency's the time of permitting for the Nacimiento dam reflects that the Agency specifically abandoned its right to storage in the Nacimiento. Reservoir for later diversion. (Exhibit 1). The EIR/EIS should explain how the Agency plans to avoid obtaining a storage permit in connection with this project from SWRCB.

AR 02629

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-640 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Messrs. Weeks and Smith
SVWP DEIR/EIS comments Page 12 8/27/01

The EIR/EIS needs to explain the process required to obtain the permit for storage and thé projected time frame in which it would be granted. It is likely 147-10
that under normal circumstances, by the time the Agency applies for and is (cont'd)
granted a permit, the seawater intrusion situation will be more severe. To the
extent that the proposed project will be delayed because of the permitting process, that delay should be taken into account in considering all of the alternatives in the EIR/EIS.

Zone 2 to Zone 2A.

The Agency at a contested hearing obtained a permit to Store additional water in Nacimiento. However, the permit limited the place of use of the water from Nacimiento to the narrow Agency Zone 2, "excluding all lands annexed to Zone 2 after November 4, 1965." Page 2, I 4 of the permit. It can be assumed that the water stored in Naciemento over which the Agency is claiming jurisdiction cannot be used outside of Zone 2. This issue is of concern to the Marina Coast 147-11
Water District. See April 6, 2001 letter from Marina Coast to Agency. (Exhibits 10 and 11). There should be a full discussion in the DEIR/EIS of how water stored in Zone 2 over which the Agency has jurisdiction can be used outside of Zone 2.

Evidence of the 30% to 50% water reduction issue

There does not appear to be any evidence in the record supporting a Valley wide reduction of 30-50% of the available water. DEIR/EIS 4-11. In fact the evidence from the SWRCB is just the opposite. See SWRCB letter of August 16, 2001 stating that no records existed to reflect the "consultation(s)" between the Agency and it on the water use reduction issue.
The Agency, for its part, responded to our request for information by saying it 147-12
would give a substantive response at "the end of the month." Cf. 40 CFR § 1506.6(f). Based on the Agency's declining to timely provide documents or state that no documents exists to support that portion of the DEIR/EIS, our clients requested an extension of time in which to make comments after the Agency disclosed its documents or lack thereof. The Agency has declined to respond to
the request.

Water rights

The DEIR/EIS makes no reference to the SWRCB's database of wäter rights, known as WRIMS. A public query of WRIMS brings up the permits, Statements of Water Diversion and Use, and licenses for flows of the Salinas River. In

addition, our clients submitted to the Agency and to the SWRCB (and specifically advised EDAW by letter in early 2001) a binder of material drawn principally from the public records of Monterey County and the State of our clients' pre- 1914 water rights. (Exhibit 9). None of this information is in the DEIR/EIS. (conrd)

Historical

The Historical discussion is at best incomplete. The importance of a complete historical discussion with a through engineering discussion will explain why the salt-water intrusion problem came into existence in the first place. In fact, the County Board of Supervisors of Monterey County in 1944 lauded destruction of the "swamps" in Monterey County:
The [Reclamation] district is a distinct asset to the County of Monterey as it has brought under cultivation a large area of swamp land (Report on Reclamation District 1665, 1944, p. 19).
The analysis done in the Greenbook established that the destruction of •the 147-14
"swamps" caused Monterey County's salt-water intrusion problem. Dr. Reinelt prepared a recent history of the Salinas Valley in response to an economic study and engineering analysis recently prepared by Northwest Economic Associates (NEA) and Mr. Lydell Melton, one of the authors of the DEIR/EIS. The report dated July 2, 2001 is one of his- Memoranda. The Board of Directors of the Agency rejected the reports of NEA and Mr. Melton. However, the General Manager of the Agency used the conclusions from the rejected reports in a report to the Board of Supervisors supporting proposed assessments and his report was accepted by the Board of Supervisors in a recent assessment setting hearing. The administrative process to challenge the assessment has commenced.
The DEIR/EIS does not include among its alternatives or as a component of mitigation of any of its option the restoration of the slough or wetlands area near Castroville. It is not necessary or even appropriate that all of the Castroville area be returned to natural conditions, only the portion of the land which most 147-15
significantly contributes to seawater intrusion. Moreover, there is precedent for returning land to natural or near natural conditions. In the San Francisco Bay, the Port of Oakland was required to create wetlands before it could obtain Dredging Permits.
The comments prepared by Dr. Hornbeck and Dr. Reinelt and the analysis made in the Greenbook give a brief description of the scope and extent of the Historical Geography in the Salinas Valley. Once the Historical Geography of the Salinas Valley is understood it will become easier to assess financial and environmental | es0

impacts of the proposed solution to the salt water intrusion problem and avoid the environmental mistakes made by well meaning people in the past. The Salinas 147-16
Valley is unique for California because it has 250 years of recorded history that (cont'd) will give guidance as to how to constructively deal with the environment over the next 250 years. It would be tragic if the Nation's, State's, and Local policy makers were denied this Geographical History when it makes decisions in connection with the project described in the DEIR. Possibly something can be learned from the past mistakes.

SVIGSM

The shortcomings of the SVIGSM are set forth in detail in prior letters to the Agency (December 31, 1997 and October 26, 1999). (Exhibit 3). Most of these problems have never been addressed by the Agency. The Agency's detailed update of the SVIGSM in certain geographical areas while not responding to the 147-17
modeling concerns of other geographical areas has resulted in an inequitable and suspect engineering model. In addition, a full error analysis to determine the accuracy of the SVIGSM in accordance with rècommended standard practices has never been performed.

Conflicts

Under NEPA, the preparers of an EIS must be free of conflicts, i.e., that they have "no financial or other interest in the outcome of the project." 40 CFR § 1506.5(c). As a initial matter, it appears that the Tanimura & Antle company may be both a preparer and a person interested in the outcome by virtue of its' principal's role under the T&A agreement explained above and its role as the de facto proponent or applicant of the project.
More pointedly, the EIR/EIS may suffer from a prohibited conflict by way of Lyndel Melton of the RMC firm, one of the specifically listed preparers of the 147-18
DEIR/EIS. Mr. Melton is to be the beneficiary of a nearly $200,000 contract from the Agency for support in the so-called Cost Allocation Committee (CAC) process for the SVWP. If the DEIR/EIS is delayed or otherwise does not proceed to the preferred alterative, the CAC process becomes pointless. In other words, it is in Mr. Melton's financial interest to defend the DEIR/EIS as presently prepared in order to reap the benefits of the $200,000 contract. The contract is scheduled to come before the Agency's Board of Directors on Monday, August 27, 2001. While Mr. Melton may not have had a financial interest in the outcome of the project while the DEIR/EIS was prepared, he appears to have one (or will shortly) while the final documents are prepared.
AR 02632

The need to explore' all of the options in the public forum suggests that the 147-19
DEIR/EIS should be recirculated once all of the areas raised by our clients and others are addressed. In addition to the important CEQA and NEPA concerns, (cont'd)
the Agency faces the additional hurdle of a landowner vote under (California) Proposition 218 for project approval. The last (and so far only) Proposition 218 vote of the Agency, the so-called "Challenge *98" project, was defeated by a 2:1
margin across all lines of geography and urban and agriculture divisions. The purpose of "Challenge 98" was in part to fund further work on the salt-water intrusion problem, and base assessments on acreage at the same rate per acre throughout the Salinas Valley. The overwhelming support for "Challenge 98" came from the agricu|tural landowners in ESU and 3. Even the residents of the Cities of Salinas and Marina rejected the proposed assessment. There was no organized opposition to the vote. To our clients, it appeared that Project '98 (not 147-20
a project under either CEQA or NEPA) was pushed ahead on an Agency driven timeline with no room for the serious and thoughtful consideration of opposing viewpoints and objections with disastrous (for the Agency) results. The current proposed project has a greater level of public review because of CEQA and NEPA, but only if those processes are followed both in letter and spirit, resolving any disagreements about the requirements in favor of greater disclosure, public participation, and the assurance of actual objectivity. Ignoring the legitimate and important objections or questions of its constituents or other public entities is no longer an option for the Agency.
Employees of the Boutonnet and Tanimura & Antle business organizations were Directors of the Agency when it conceived and created the original CSIP/SVRP project. Now a different set of employees of the same business organizations have developed a correction plan to their original project because of their concern about the quality of water produced by the CSIP/SVRP project. A 147-21
careful analysis of data suggests the new project will have a limited impact on the salt-water intrusion and 'the quality of water in the municipalities. At a minimum there should be a thorough Federal and State review of the new project sO another project is not required a few years from now to correct the deficiencies of the second project.

Conclusion

Dr. Hornbeck and Dr. Reinelt discuss important historical and economic facts describing how the salt-intrusion problem developed and the agricultural history of the Salinas Valley. The facts about the bias and conflicts of the Agency Board and its consultants are undisputed. The project recommended in the DEIR/EIS causes significant environmental damage to correct mistakes made in a previous
AR 02633

project developed by the same Agency. The preferred project in the DEIR/EIS as designed may have limited impact on the salt-water intrusion problem or. the municipal water supplies. The parties politically controlling the Agency have caused the seawater intrusion problem and have limited economic interest in solving the salt-water intrusion or solving the water quality problems of the municipalities. The voters of the Salinas Valley understand what is going on and have rejected any new assessments to finance further work on salt-water intrusion projects. The Agency has prepared a DEIR/EIS to obfuscate solutions to the salt- water intrusion issues and the municipal water quality problems. The real purpose of the DEIR/EIS is to use it as a tool to continue searching for further funds from the State and Federal Agencies to correct the problems of the first project because the Agency knows the local electorate will not support a solution in an election. The State and Federal Governments at a minimum should require a DEIR/EIS, which completely examines the alternatives. Once the EIR/EIS is prepared the Federal and State Governments can determine if they intend to continue financing projects, which have been and will continue to be repudiated by the landowners of the Salinas Valley at the polls. However, the voters of the Salinas Valley might even support new projects if they believe the project makes
sense.

Please also consider these comments a specific individual request for notice under •NEPA and CEQA of any further changes, responses, or recirculation of the a EIR/EIS documents and a request for copies of all of the comments submitted. 147-22

1011. Appropriated water rights: cessation or reduction in use: forfeiture: transferi reversion of rights
(a) When any person entitled to the use of water under an appropriative right fails to use all or any part of the water because of water conservation efforts, any cessation or reduction in the use of the appropriated water shall be deemed equivalent to a reasonable beneficial use of waler to the extent of the cessation or reduction in use. No forfeiture of the appropriative right to the water conserved shall occur upon the lapse of the forfeiture period applicable to water appropriated pursuant to the Water Commission Act or this code or the forfeiture period applicable to water appropriated prior to December 19, 1914. The board may require that any user of water who sceks the bencfit of this section file petiodic reports describing the extent and amount of the reduction in water use due to water conservation efforts, To the maximum extent possible, the reports shall be made a part of other reports required by the board relating to-the use of water. Failure to file the reports shall deprive the user of water of the benefits of this section. For purposes of this section, the term "water conservation" shall mean the use of less water to accomplish the same purpose or purposes of use allowed under the existing appropriative right. Where water appropriated for irrigation purposes is noi used as a result of temporary land fallowing or crop rotation, the reduced usege shall be deemed water conservation for purposes of this section. For the purpose of this section, "land fallowing" and "crop rotation* mean those respective land practices, involving the nonuse of water, used in the course of normal and customary agricultural production to maintain or promote the productivity of agricultural land. (b) Water, or the right t0 the use of water, the use of which has ceased or been reduced as the' result of water conservation efforts as described in subdivision (a), may be sold, leased, exchanged, or otherwise transferred pursuant to any provision of law relating to the transfer of water or water rights, including, but not limited to, provisions of law governing any change in point of diversion, place of use, and purpose of use duc to the transfer. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the completion of the term of a water transfer agreement, or the right to the use of that water, that is available as a result of water conservation efforts described in subdivision (a), the right to the use of the water shall revert 10 the transferor as if the water transfer had not been

<Text of section operative until Jan. 1, 2007>
(a) The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the growing water noeds of the state require the use of water in an efficient manner and that the efficient use of water requires certainty in the definition of property rights to the use of water. The Legislature further declares that it. is the policy of this state to encourage conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater supplies and to make surface water available for other beneficial uses. The Legislature faL recognizes that the substantial investrents that may be necessary to implement and maintain a conjunctive use program require certainty in the continued right to the use of alternate water supplies. (b) When any holder of an appropriative right fails to use all or any part of the water as a result of conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater involving the substitution of an alternate supply for the unused portion of the surface water, any cessation of, or reduction in, the use of the appropriated water shall be deemed equivalent to a reasonable and beneficial use of water to the extent of the cessation of, or reduction in, use, and to the same extent as the appropriated water was put to reasonable and beneficial use by that person. No forfciture of the appropriative right to the water for which an altermate supply is substituted shall occur upon the lapse of the forfeinare period applicable to water appropriated pursuant to the Water Commission Act or this code or the forfeiture period applicable to water appropriated prior to December 19, 1914. The state board may require any hoider of an appropriative right who sceks the benefit of this section to file periodic reports describing the extent and amount of the reduction in water use due to substitution of an alternate supply. To the maximum extent possible, the reports shail be made a part of other reports required by the state board relating to the use of water. Failure to file the reports shall deprive the user of water of the benefits of this

(c) Substitution of an alternate supply may be made only if the extraction of the alternate supply conforns to all requirements imposed pursuant to an adjudication of the groundwater basin, if applicable, and meets one of the following conditions: (1) Except as specified in paragraph (2), is from a groundwater basin for which the operating safe yield is not exceeded prior to the extraction of the alternate supply and does not cause the operating safe yield of the groundwater basin from which the alternate supply is obtained to be exceeded. (2) Is from the Eastern Sän Joaquin County Basin, as described on pages 38 and 39 of the Department of Water Resources Bulletin No. 118-80, for which the operating safe yield is exceeded prior to the extraction of the alternative supply, if all of the following requirements are met: (A) The conjunctive use program is operated in accordance with a local groundwater management program that complies with the requirements of this section. (B) The groundwater management program establishes • requirements for the extraction of groundwater and is approved by a joint powers authority that meets the requirements of subparagraph (C). (C) The joint powers authority includes each water agency overlying the contemplated points of groundwater extraction and cach water-agency that will share in the benefits to be derived from the local
groundwater management program. (D) By either of the following methods, the overdraft of the ground water basin underlying the point of extraction has been reduced prior to the commencement of extraction: (i) Elimination of a volume of existing groundwater extractions in excess of the proposed new extraction.

(g) This section does not apply in any area where groundwater pumping causes, or threatens to cause, violation of water quality objectives or an unreasonable effect on beneficial uses established in a water quality control plan adopted or approved by the state board pursuant to, and to the extent authorized by, Section 13170 or 13245, which designates areas where groundwater pumping causes, or threatens to cause, a violation of water quality objectives or an unreasonable effect on beneficial uses. (h) This section shall not be construed to increase or decrease the jurisdiction of the state board over groundwater resources, or to confer on the state board jurisdiction over groundwater basins over which it does not have jurisdiction pursuant to other provisions of law. (i) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2007, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, which is enacted before January 1, 2007, deletes or extends that date.

" In response to our clients' inquiries about the reasonable and/or beneficial use of water on a geographic basis in the Salinas Valley, the Agency responded under penalty of perjury (Curtis Weeks verifying) by, inter alia, objecting to the questions based on third party privacy and trade secret privileges. The Agency nevertheless stated that it did not have in its possession information needed to respond to the question(s), it having only a, single source of information; DWR Bulletin 113-3, that bears on the reasonable and beneficial use of water in the Valley. A
complete copy of the questions and responses is available from this office and presumably is available from the Agency as well.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-647 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

LETTER 147

Patrick J. Maloney
August 27, 2001
[It is noted that the commenter submitted a letter to MCWRA on July 30, 2001. That letter is addressed in response to Comment Letter 175.]

147-1 The commenter states that the alternatives analysis is unclear. However, because the commenter does not explain why the analysis is unclear, it is not possible to provide further response.

The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS does not adequately analyze alternatives because the MCWRA "already invested in securing the Preferred Alternative," and, as a result, committed to the project prior to completion of the necessary environmental reviews under CEQA and NEPA. With respect to the alternatives analysis, the commenter also states that the "EIR/EIS fails because it does not meet the standards set forth in 40 CFR Section 1502.14," which provides the substantive criteria for alternatives analyses under NEPA. However, the
commenter provides no examples from the Draft EIR/EIS of how that document's. alternatives analyses fails to comply with NEPA and with Section 1502.14. Consequently, it is not pössible to provide further response.
The commenter states that the alternatives analysis needs to be revised according to the comments of the EPA. Please refer to response to Comment Letter 3, which provides our response to comments received from EPA.

147-2 The commenter claims that an agreement made in the course of T & A and Bunn v. MCWRA, Monterey Superior Court, No. M 46013 (T & A Agreement'), committed the MCWRA to a course of action prior to the completion of review under CEQA.
The T & A Agreement expressly recognizes that "existing environmental laws require the MCWRA to set forth alternatives to the Preferred SVWP alternative, and to describe and analyze the environmental impacts of such alternatives." In hearing
cross-complaints on motions for demurrer in Tanimura & Antle v. MCWRA, the Honorable Richard M. Silver reviewed the section from the T & A Agreement at issue, and concluded that it was not contrary to CEQA.
The Court: Let's just look at what [the T & A Agreement] says. T It says, the SVWP directive shall contain a clear statement of SVWP primary and secondary objectives, that's all. It says, the proposed program shall recommend a description of a specific preferred project alternative for the SVWP. Well, CEQA requires people to list project
al ternatives and they may indicate within that which is a preferred.
That sentence there is in no way contrary to CEQA that I know of.

Transcript of Proceedings, January 30, 2002, Tanimura d Antle et al. v. MCWRA, Action M 46013, page 31 line 27 to page 32 line 8
(emphasis added).
The commenter states that the State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") or the California Department of Fish and Game ("CDFG") are more appropriate lead is agencies than is the MCWRA. Under CEQA, the lead agency is the public agency with the principal responsibility for carrying out or approving a project subject to CEQA. Pub. Res. Code 21067. In this case, the MCWRA would be principally responsible for the design, construction, and operation, of the Project. Consequently, the MCWRA is appropriate lead agency. SWRCB and CDFG are more appropriately characterized as either "responsible agencies" or as trustee agencies. To the extent that SWRCB and CDFG have permitting authority over an aspect of the Project, they are responsible agencies. Pub. Resources Code Section 21069 (stating that a responsible agency typically has permitting authority or approval power over some aspect of the overall project for which lead agency is conducting CEQA review). In contrast, even if CDFG has no permitting or approval authority over a project, CDFG can still be considered : "trustee agency" because it has jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by a project which are held in trust for the People of the State of California 14 C.C.R. Section 15386.
The commenter states that the MCWRA Board of Directors will be the primary decisionmaker on the project, that some of the Board's Directors ate associated with a development company that may benefit from the project and that, consequently, the MCWRA will not analyze the project with sufficient skepticism. CEQA, however, does not prohibit a lead agency from association with the developers of a project. In fact, CEQA's definition of a "lead agency" may require that the developer of a project will be the lead agency, if that developer is a public agency. 14 C.C.R. Section 15050(a). Moreover, for projects of this magnitude, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, as well as the MCWRA Board of Directors, is fully engaged in the process. Various committees made up of public membership have been established to work through issues and come to consensus. The process is inclusive of all that want to participate and is not guided by a few individuals or groups. The MCWRA encourages all interests in the development of a solution to solve the seawater
intrusion problem in Monterey County.

The commenter states that individual members of the MCWRA Board of Directors are conflicted with regard to the project. This comment does not relate to a direct or indirect change in the physical environment and so is not a cognizable claim under CEQA. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response.
147-3 The commenter states that Draft EIR/EIS fails to satisfy the requirements for a supplemental EIR under CEQA. The Draft EIR/EIS is an independent, stand- alone environmental document; it is not a supplement to the 1998 Draft EIR. A supplemental EIR may be prepared if, subsequent to the certification of an EIR, substantial changes are proposed in the previously analyzed project, substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken, or there is
new information of substantial importance affecting significance conclusions or ÷

mitigation related to a project analyzed. Pub. Resources Code Section 21166. The 1998 Draft EIR was not certified and therefore could not provide the basis for a supplemental EIR. References within the Draft EIR/EIS to the 1998 Draft EIR do not render the Draft EIR/EIS a supplement to the 1998 Draft EIR. Rather, the
Draft EIR/EIS relies upon certain sections of the 1998 Draft EIR, along with
numerous other documents, to support the analysis within the Draft EIR/EIS.
The commenter suggests that CEQA required the MCWRA to respond, within the Draft EIR/EIS process, to comments raised with regard to the 1998 DEIR. As a stand-alone document, the Draft EIR/EIS has undergone review and comment independent from the Draft EIR/EIS. Response to Comment 12-1 describes the public review process that the Draft EIR/EIS underwent. The commenter has not suggested how the public review process for the Draft EIR/EIS has been inadequate under CEQA or NEPA.

147-4 The commenter states that MCWRA fails to include necessary documents and facts. However, neither CEQA nor NEPA require that an EIR/EIS consider evidence unless that evidence is relevant to the impacts or effects of the proposed project. The commenter does not identify how this material is relevant to the contents of the Draft EIR/EIS or how the conclusions of the Draft EIR/EIS are in error because of the absence of this material. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further
response.

147-5 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS incorrectly assumes that the urban areas in the northern Salinas Valley can use water that becomes available through conservation practices. The Draft BIR/EIS makes no such assumption; by contrast, the express goals of the proposed project are to make water available to reestablish
hydrologic balance in the Basin and halt seawater intrusion.

The commenter states that the proposed project unacceptably relies upon water that is made available through conservation efforts because the rights to use that water are held by other parties. The commenter provides no evidence that the proposed project relies upon water rights held by other parties. In addition, the Water Code sections cited by the commenter are not relevant to the water resources at issue, as those Water Code sections apply to only to surface water, whereas the water that will
be conserved is groundwater
147-6 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS dismisses the concept that salt-water intrusion can be stopped through demand management and that the Draft EIR/EIS
contains inadequate support for that dismissal. The Draft EIR/EIS does not dismiss demand management as a strategy that can partially solve the salt-water intrusion problem. The analysis of alternatives D & E fully evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of attempting to resolve the seawater intrusion problem only through
demand management.

Moreover, the modeling for the preferred alternative included a 5% decrease in water consumption for agricultural water use as a result of changes in cropping patterns that were projected to the year 2030 and increased irrigation efficiencies. The 5

2-655 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS 02639 Salinas Valley Water Project

modeling assumed a similar 5% level of increased water conservation was assumed
for all municipal and industrial water uses within the Salinas Valley. The commenter is referred to both Master Responses MR-1 and MR-5 for a discussion of the reasons that demand management through water conservation is inadequate to halt seawater
intrusion.

The commenter also criticizes what it terms the "Big Bucket" solution of increasing storage in the southern portion of the watershed and moving that water north to areas of sweater intrusion. For a response to that comment, please see Master Responses MR-1 and MR-5.

147-7 The commenter states that a June 2000 memorandum from the SWRCB describes
alternatives relevant to the seawater intrusion problems near Castroville. However,
with the exception of a recommendation to assist MCWRA in funding the present
EIR/EIS, the June 2000 Memorandum focused on SWRCB funding options and
does not recommend EIR alternatives. Accordingly, it is unclear how the June 2000
Memorandum casts doubt on the MCWRA's selection of alternatives for the Draft
EIR/EIS. In addition, the commenter does not identify how the Draft EIR/EIS' alternatives discussion is inadequate under CEQA or NEPA.

The commenter states that the June 2000 memorandum is inconsistent with the
Draft EIR/EIS' discussion of state adjudication. The June 2000 memorandum
states that the SWRCB recommends diverting legal funds targeted toward adjudication, in hopes the proposed project would help develop a local solution to seawater intrusion. The Draft EIR/EIS' analysis of adjudication as one alternative discusses the advantages and disadvantages of that strategy, and is consistent with
the June 2000 memorandum's preference for development of a local solution to seawater intrusion.

147-8 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS fails to consider the impact of TeA et al. v. MCWRA. However, the commenter does not explain how the outcome of the litigation could affect the impacts of the proposed project. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response. Moreover, the outcome of that lawsuit is speculative, and, consequently, the Draft EIR/EIS cannot provide analysis of its
impact. However, regardless of the final outcome of the case as a whole, the judge
has already concluded that the T & A Agreement does not affect the MCWRA's
compliance with CEQA (see response to Comments 147-2).
The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS fails to consider the impact of the T&A Agreement's suspension of a portion of Ordinance 3790. The comment does not address the impacts of the proposed project and, consequently, it is not possible
to provide further response.
147-9 The commenter states that because the Draft EIR/EIS does not recognize that the quality of the available water is more of problem than the quantity of available water, the Draft EIR/EIS fails to evaluate whether the repair, modification, or re- operation of the existing seawater intrusion projects (CSIP and SVRP) are feasible. The Draft EIR/EIS includes substantial evidence indicating that the quantity of 5

Salinas Valley Water Project 0t970

2-656 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

water available is more of an obstacle to halting seawater intrusion than is the quality of the available water. First, the quality of recycled water produced by the CSIP and the SVRP is already suitable for the agricultural crops grown within the CSIP service area when the recycled water is blended with groundwater (as currendy done) or with surface water (as proposed). Second, agricultural entities have used all of the recycled water produced by SVRP and delivered to the CSIP. Third, the CSIP/SVRP does not produce enough water to halt seawater intrusion. Fourth, there is not currently a large enough population base to produce sufficient quantities of wastewater to treat and deliver to the intruded area to meet project objectives. Consequently, the Draft EIR/EIS properly focused upon alternatives addressing the
quantity of available water.
147-10 •The commenter states that the permitted storage capacity required by the proposed project exceeds that of the MCWRA because the MCWRA abandoned its right to storage in the Nacimiento Reservoir for later diversion. The MCWRA disputes this contention and, in any event, it does not represent a physical impact that is the subject of CEQA. The MCWRA will store and release water at Lake Nacimiento
for use as part of the SVWP under the terms of its existing water right permits and
licenses.

147-11 As noted above in the response to Comment 147-10, the MCWRA intends to use its existing water rights to store and release water needed for the SVWP. To the extent any changes are required in those water rights, the MCWRA will seek appropriate revisions in its water rights from the State Water Resources Control Board. Such changes do not represent physical changes in the environment and so are not appropriate subjects of the Draft EIR/EIS. All physical impacts of the delivery of water from the SVWP have been addressed in the Draft EIR/EIS.
147-12 Please see Master Response MR-1. As described the 30 to 50 percent reduction assumption is in part based on a presentation and supporting analysis in 1993 to the
SWRCB.

147-13 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS makes no reference to the SWRCB's
database of water rights. This comment does not explain how, or if, the absence of
such a reference affects the Draft EIR/EIS' analysis. Consequently, it is. not possible to provide further response.
147-14 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS' historical discussion is incomplete and, as a result, there is no explanation as to why the salt-water intrusion problem
came into existence in the first place. Neither CEQA nor NEPA require a historical
discussion of the events leading up to a project. Consequently, it is not possible to
provide further response.

147-15 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS improperly omits from its alternatives the restoration of the slough or wetlands that are near Castroville. However, the commenter does not explain why the omission of this alternative renders the Draft
EIR/EIS' alternatives discussion inadequate under CEQA or NEPA. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response. 5

1.:

147-16 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS' discussion of historical geography is incomplete and, as a result, there is no explanation as to why the salt-water intrusion problem came into existence in the first place. Although evaluation of the historical causes of seawater intrusion in the Basin is of interest, the SVWP must address the problem of seawater intrusion and groundwater overdraft within the current context. Neither CEQA nor NEPA require a historical discussion of the events leading up to project. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response.
147-17 The commenter states that the SVIGSM is inadequate. The present version of SVIGSM, which is used in assessing basinwide and geographic area impacts of the SVWP, is a tool that has undergone peer review scrutiny in many public workshops held by the MCWRA prior to the preparation of the Draft EIR/EIS. The model as it is currently structured is more than adequate to assess the impacts of the SVWP on the basin and geographic areas as presented in the Draft EIR/EIS without the need for further revisions or analysis of model components. This comment does not address specific concerns related to the SVIGSM as it has been used in the EIR/EIS
and does not address the environmental impacts of the project. Please see Master •
Responses MR-1 and MR-4 for further discussion of the hydrologic modeling.

147-18 The commenter states that EDAW, Inc. is conflicted and therefore should not
prepare the Draft EIR/EIS. EDAW, Inc. is the consulting firm responsible for preparation of the EIS and reviewed all information developed for the document.
EDAW signed an Environmental Impact Statement Disclosure Statement on
October 11, 2001 and submitted it to the Corps of Engincers, expressing that the company had no conflict of interest. Further, the commenter does not explain why a contract to provide services in connection with a project is a conflict under either CEQA or NEPA. If that argument were correct, every contract to prepare an EIR or EIS would create a conflict.

147-19 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS should be recirculated. CEQA requires recirculation only when new information is added disclosing that: (1) the project or the project's mitigation would result in a new significant impact; (2) the severity of an existing significant impact would substantially increase; (3) a feasible alternative or mitigation measure was not adopted that is considerably different from the mitigation measures adopted, that would clearly lessen the project's and impacts; or (4) the draft EIR was fundamentally inadequate.
Although information has been added to the Draft EIR/EIS that will amplify and clarify the Draft EIR/EIS' discussion, none of the information meets the criteria for
recirculation under CEQA. While there are numerous comments on significant environmental impacts, neither this nor any other commenter identifies any new significant environmental impacts, and the information does not change the significance or make more severe a previously identified impact. In no case has the lead agency considered and rejected a new, feasible alternative or mitigation measure* 5
that is considerably diffetent from others previously analyzed, and that would clearly lessen the impacts of the project. In some instances, new mitigation has been added 02642

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-658 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

to the EIR/EIS. In others, new alternatives or mitigation is considered but rejected for one or more of the following reasons: (1) environmental impacts would not be
lessened; (2) the mitigation or alternative is not feasible for cost, legal, or technical
reasons; or (3) the alternative or mitigation is not feasible because it would
substantially hamper the ability of the project to meet its primary objectives of halting seawater intrusion. For these reasons, it is concluded that recirculation is not warranted under CEQA.
Under NEPA, the final Draft EIR/EIS will be republished with any changes. NEPA requires a supplemental EIS only when there are substantial changes in a proposed action. In the case at hand, any changes to the proposed action were presented and analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS. Consequently, NEPA does not require: supplemental EIS. Please see, also response to Comment 20-31.
147-20 The commenter states that under Proposition 218, the residents of the Salinas Valley must approve the funding for the project. However, the commenter does not explain how this affects the analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response.
147-21 The commenter states that the project will not accomplish its objectives and that it has not undergone sufficient. federal and state review. The commenter does not substantiate why the project will not accomplish the objectives, or explain in what ways the MCWRA's distribution of the Draft EIR/EIS to state and federal agencies does not comply with the provisions of CEQA and NEPA that are specifically intended to obtain such searching review by federal and state agencies. Consequently, it is not possible to provide further response.
147-22 No response is necessary, as the commenter raises no significant environmental issues.

147-23 This is legislative water rights text and not a comment on the EIR/EIS.

COMMENTARY AND QUALIFICATIONS OF DAVID HORNBECK, JR.
TO

DRAFT EIR/EIS for the SVWP

AR 02644

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-660 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

I have reviewed the "Cultural Resources" portion of the Salinas Valley
Water Project EIR/EIS pages 5.7.1-5.7.17 and offer the following
observations concerning the Section.
The Overview is broad and general and does not address the issues at hand either historically or geographically. The main problem is that it focuses on anecdotal and minor historical events rather than on the historical geography
of the Salinas Valley. The authors of the EIR/EIS leave the impression that
not much happened during the late 18th and 19th centuries throughout the 148-1

Salinas Valley. While this may be somewhat true from a historical view,
from a geographical perspective (what was happening on the land) a great deal of landscape changes occurred. In fact, it can be argued that the Salinas Valley in the 19th century was a representative example of the agricultural
development for all of California.

In connection with these comments I did preliminary research on two
questions: 1) The nature and type of irrigation in the Castroville area prior to 1910 and 2) The nature and extent of agricultural development in Salinas
Valley south of Gonzales prior to 1900.
The nature and type irrigation in the Castroville area prior to 1910
I have found a number of references to irrigation. The first in a secondary
source by John C. Manning "Résumé of Ground Water Hydrology in Salinas Valley, Monterey" in Guide Book To the Geology of the Salinas Valley and the San Andreas Fault, Association of Petroleum Geologist.
1963, p 107 states: 148-2

Severe drought conditions in the latter part of the 19th century encouraged a return to irrigation agriculture. In 1890 there were
60 flowing wells around Castroville near the mouth of the
Salinas River, and at Salinas a number of wells were being pumped by windmills. But it was not until 1897 that large scale
AR 02645

SVWP DEIR/EIS PAGE 1
Salinas Valley Water Project 2-661 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

pumping for irrigation began. The introduction of electric power along with efficient deep-well pumps prior to 1920 and the introduction of vegetable growing in 1924 stimulated intense interest in ground water development.
The agricultural census reports that Monterey had 891 irrigated acres in 1889, 6,675 irrigated acres in 1899, and 15,056 irrigated acres in 1909. In
1909, total acreage supplied by. irrigated water from pumps was 5,282, the remaining acreage was supplied from gravity-stream flow. The County Assessor reports that during the 1890's there were approximately 9,000 acres of gravity fed irrigation and 1,825 acres supplied from wells north and
south of Salinas.

The first claim for water from the Salinas River began in 1877. by C. Abbott,
who used the water to grow alfalfa for his dairy in the area south of Salinas.' 148-2

A few tracts of land were watered prior to this time by small gravity-fed ditches from wells either flowing or pumped by windmills as part of the
Monterey County's growing dairy industry.
"Many of our citizens procure water from the surface spring by the aid of the windmill, which seems to answer every purpose, at less expense, and a greater certainty of a regular supply," wrote the County Assessor in 1859.
In 1877-78 the County Assessor reported 2 irrigation ditches and 1,000 acres of irrigated land. In 1879 he reported 2 irrigating ditches and 800 acres and in 1880-1882 he indicated that Monterey County had 6 miles of
irrigation ditches.

The nature and extent of agricultural development in Salinas Valley .
south of Gonzales prior to 1900. 148-3

Agricultural development of the Salinas Valley and in particular the area south of Gonzales was always dependent on irrigation water. The reason
AR 02646

Salind VARep RYEF'Froject 2-662 PAGE 2 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

that the area south of Gonzalez has not figured previously in the water usage
history of the Salinas Valley is that it is assumed little agricultural
development occurred after both Missions Soledad and San Antonio were
secularized in the early 1830's. The prevailing view is that mission land was
divided into Mexican Ranchos, which were primarily livestock operations.
Thus, according to this view, nothing agriculturally important happened in terms of water usage. It can be easily documented that there were more that 40,000 head of cattle in this area along with sheep and horse which
consumed a great deal of water.
Setting aside for the moment the livestock question, the notion that the missions after secularization were instantly converted to private stock
ranches is completely false. Both Missions San Antonio and Soledad were operated as government owned and operated commercial farms until 1845.
Products from these farms were sold to support the military and add to the state treasury; ongoing maintenance of the mission's fruit trees, vineyards, gardens, grain fields and livestock were an integral part of the economy prior 148-3
to U.S. acquisition of California.
The former mission lands continued to be an important part of the Salinas Valley's economy after 1850. For example, the County Assessor of Monterey reported in 1859 60,000 vine grape. In addition he wrote:
Our Prolific soil and the progress of horticulture by our people must soon produce a quality of fruit not to be excelled in any country. The orchard at San Juan has produced this year about one thousand five hundred quintals of fruit (apples and pears). At the camello there are about forty pear trees. At San Antonio
in the southern part of the county, much attention has been
given to the fruit trees and vines; also, at the "Soledad" some
beautiful gardens have been laid out, where the grape is
cultivated with marked success.. Experiments have been made

AR 02647

Salin&lY WRIBFARIEIProject 2-663 Response to Comments onPAOEIR/EIS

in wine-making, with good success. The wine produced this
season will be about five hundred gallons.

In 1863, the County Assessor reported the production of 1,200 gallons of wine and in 1864 grapevines totaling 85,275. In 1870 he wrote: "There were in this county but two distilleries on a small scale, a producing an insignificant
quantity of wine and brandy. This year a large distillery has been erected."

The agricultural census of 1860 reported 700 gallons of wine produce and in
1870 the census reported 5,200 gallons of wine produced in Monterey County. The census also reported 81,203 vines and 5,908 gallons of wine in
1900.

Commencing in the early 18th Century Monterey County was one of the 148-3

largest wine producing counties in California. By .1930, the agricultural
census indicated that 65 farms reported 8,689 non-bearing vines along with
83,959 bearing vines that produced 500 tons of grapes.

Along with the continuous development of vineyards in the upper Salinas
Valley throughout the 19th century, livestock played an important role,
particularly sheep (raised for wool) in the 1860s, along with wheat, barley,
oats, corn, peas and beans. Vegetable gardens were planted on an increasing
number of farms after the 1870s.

As illustrated from the very brief discussion above, which is based on
primary documents, the development and expansion of agriculture in the
area south of Gonzales was dependent on the availability of water.

To insure an accurate picture of the agricultural development of the Salinas Valley during the 19th century, a detailed evaluation of primary documents. is
essential. I recommend the following: 148-4

LETTER 148
David Hornbeck, Jr.
August 27, 2001

148-1 It may be true that the Salinas Valley is representative example of the agricultural
development for all of California, as the commenter is suggesting; however, this is
not a comment on the environmental impacts of the project.
148-2 This comment, which discusses the nature and type of irrigation prevalent in the Castroville area prior to 1910, does not raise any specific environmental issues regarding the Draft EIR/EIS for the proposed SVWP. As shown, very little of the County (15,056 irrigated acres vs. 1.3 million mostly irrigated acres today) was irrigated compared to current conditions. No further response is necessary.
148-3 This comment, which discusses the nature and extent of agricultural devclopment in the Salinas Valley south of Gonzales prior to 1900, does not raise any specific environmental issues regarding the Draft EIR/EIS for the proposed SVWP. No further response is necessary.
148-4 The list of reading materials the commenter recommends for further understanding of the agricultural development of the Salinas Valley during the 19th century is noted. This comment does not raise any specific environmental issues regarding the Draft EIR/EIS for the proposed SVWP. No further response is necessary.

MEMORANDUM
Comments on 2001 SVWP Draft Master Environmental Impact
Report/Statement (EIR/EIS)
Hydrological Analysis Requires Clarification Throughout the planning process for the 1998 DEIR, 26,000 AFY of water deliveries to. northern lands were needed under current Alternative B to halt seawater intrusion (SWI) with 1995 baseline conditions. Now with the 2001 DEIR, only 9,700 AFY of water deliveries to northern lands are needed under Alternative A to halt seawater intrusion with 1995 baseline conditions and reservoir reoperation under Alternative A "slightly different" from Alternative B. This is a striking difference in less than 3 years and requires detailed clarification as to how this dramatic change in analysis is possible. The 149-1
only changes to the analysis of the two alternatives appear to be 1) Minor modifications have been made to the SVIGSM which actually increase the amount of estimated seawater intrusion under no-action with 1995 baseline from 8,400 AFY in the 1998 DEIR to 8,900 AFY in the 2001 DEIR. 2) The slight difference in reoperation. 3) The small difference in the location of the diversion. 4) The large difference in the quantities of water delivered.
The following issues need to be clarified 1) First, a better and consistent accounting of water is needed. This document contains numerous estimates of water quantities that vary from one place to another in the text (see errors and omissions section below for many specific references). a) For example, Figures 5.3-5 and 5.3-34 which quantify the flow of water under different conditions contain many errors and inconsistencies. In Figure 5.3-5, the signs are wrong on the recharge flows for the Bradley 1o Soledad and Soledad to 149-2

Spreckels reaches. The correctness of the signs on the recharge flows for the
Spreckels to ocean reach should be checked. Also, for the non-peak part of this figure, the flows of water do not add up. Either Spreckels to ocean recharge should be -0.5 or ocean outflow should be approximately -7.2.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-686 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

b) Of major concern is the accounting of recharge north of Spreckels. It is our understanding that water that percolates from the river north of Spreckels does not result in recharge of any of the economic aquifers (180-foot, 400-foot; or deep). It is also, our understanding that the SVIGSM is a 3-layer model in the northern valley. How is water that percolates to the non-economic perched aquifer 149-3
accounted for within the model? The diversion pond in Alternative A will clearly recharge this non-economic aquifer. How much fresh water is lost from the pond to this aquifer?
c) Water-balance diagrams like those used in the HBA (which differentiate between
stream recharge, subsurface flows, and changes in fresh groundwater) would help clarify water flows, if in addition, perched aquifer flows are somehow added to 149-4
that type diagram. 2) The main difference in reoperation between Alternatives A and B appears to be the increased release of water under Alternative A during the September/October time period, which previously has been reserved for channel clearing operations to improve flood control. The effect of releasing water during this time period also allows less water to be released in November, which presumably is currently released for flood control purposes. This information is inferred from comparison of Figures 5.6-13 and 5.6-15 in the 2001 DEIR which show the average monthly flows at Bradley for both alternatives (note reservoir releases for Alternative A are provided in 149-5
the 2001 DEIR but not for Alternative B). a) This difference in reoperation increases recharge upstream of Spreckels from 300 AFY in Alternative B to 3,300 AFY in Alternative A, a net gain of 3,000 AFY. This difference does not seem to be enough to offset 16,300 AFY lower deliveries
in Alternative B.
b) The only other difference is in stream recharge north of Spreckels, but as
discussed above this should not affect the conditions in the economic aquifers. 3) In general, the hydrological analysis should be expanded to show the relative contribution of each component of each alternative. While it is understood that ordering of implementation will affect results, the initial contribution of each 149-6
component should be analyzed. This analysis is needed so that it is possible to evaluate other potential combinations of elements such as in the incremental alternatives presented below. 4) Have 1995 baseline conditions concerning land and water use been changed? For all areas or only in particular areas? Please present land and water use by subarea and for Zone 2B.
5) The DEIR on p. 5.3-8 states that the hydrology study period from 1949 to 1994 "is the longest period that adequate, consistent, and reliable information is available on
hydrologic data (precipitation and streamflow), as well as groundwater levels." Is 149-8
this true (i.e. adequate, consistent, and reliable data is not available for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000)?

History
The history section of the DEIR fails to mention the critical factors which have prevented the construction of a system to convey water from the reservoirs to overdrafted areas in 149-9
the northern valley even though all have agreed that this is a necessary component of a

structural •solution since Bulletin 52 in 1946. The two key factors which prevent projects from being approved are 1) detrimental physical effects to the fresh water of some party, and 2) cost.

The recent history of the 1991-1992 EIR process illustrates this point. The proposed alternative in the draf EIR had three components: 1) a diversion structure delivering water to northern agricultural areas, 2) a well field in the Buena Vista area delivering water to northern cities, and 3) the reclamation (SVRP) and delivery (CSIP) of water-to
northern agricultural interests.
The first component was eliminated from the final EIR because it was detrimental to Nacimiento reservoir levels and there was a large outcry from property owners around the reservoir, especially since drought conditions already prevailed. The second component was included in the final EIR (with reduced deliveries) but was never built because of the opposition of land owners in the Buena Vista area who were threatened by lower groundwater levels. (Since that time the HBA showed that this area receives some of the greatest increase in groundwater levels from the reservoirs; see Figure 1-6 of April 1998 Final Report or Figure 13 of February 2000 Update.) The third component was eventually built because it was not detrimental to anyone's fresh water. However, the 149-9

•water quality of the SVRP is now perceived to threaten the long-term viability of farming in the CSIP area (see Tanimura & Antle letter in Appendix A of DEIR or IAS Laboratories February 2001 report).
The 1998 draft EIR WAS opposed by northern agriculture interests both because of the high cost they would bear, and because those in Zone 2B did not want any more low quality reclaimed water (storage of winter SVRP flows).
At the time the reservoirs were constructed, the southern valley was provided assurances that any future conveyance system needed to halt SWI distribution would not be paid by the whole valley but only by the area benefited,1,2 However, when the SVRP/CSIP project was built to slow the rate of seawater intrusion, the southern valley was assessed because it was claimed that the south received most of the benefits of the reservoir and
the project is necessary ".to restore equity in the distribution of Zone 2A water supplies (MCWRA ordinances 3635 and 3636).' The development of the HBA report, however, clearly shows that the North receives most (approximately 70%) of the benefits from the reservoirs, and in fact, almost all of these benefits accrue to the Pressure Area.

1 Dirwiler, Cortlandt D., The Political Economy of Water Use Transfer and Integrated Water Resource Management in the Salinas Valley, California, Dissertation in Agricultural Economics, University of California, Berkeley, 1966, p. 125. "It was acknowledged that a surface distribution system might have to be developed in the future in the event that sea-water intrusion should continue. lt was stated, however, that such facilities would be paid for not by a Valley-wide tax, but, rather tax in the specific area of benefit only." Salinas Californian, September 21, 1963. "Will distributions systems be needed for some areas to make fullest use of the water? Yes, if sea water intrusion continues, however, the supply must be developed before it can be distributed." "Who will pay for these distribution systems? The areas benefited by the distribution system."

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-688 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Corrections to this report would raise the ratio beyond 80%. Therefore, southern interests, after originally being assured that they would not have to pay for additional projects to halt seawater intrusion and then being assessed for the SVRP/CSIP based on false claims, are not interested in paying for any projects to stop seawater intrusion. Any 149-9

project which has negative physical impacts on south valley interests or assesses southern interests to pay to solve seawater intrusion will not be supported.
Current Proposed Project Alternative A The current "preferred Alternative A" project was proposed by interests within Zone 2B (Tanimura & Antle, Alternative Basin Management Project Salinas Valley Ground Water Basin, April 1999) and includes a variation of the diversion component originally eliminated between the 1991 draft EIR and the 1992 final EIR. As such, it is not surprising that it addresses the concerns of those in the northern Pressure area: it is low cost, it improves the quality of Zone 2B water by mixing reclaimed water with diverted surface water, and it reduces seawater intrusion. In fact, the main delivery option evaluated in the 1999 Tanimura & Antle proposal was designed to "replace" all reclaimed SVRP water with higher quality diverted water.
Since essentially the same diversion component had been previously rejected due to the 149-10

concerns of Nacimiento property owners regarding the significant lowering of reservoir
levels, Tanimura & Antle attempted to address this obvious concern and "minimize potential impacts" by including a 90,000 AF "minimum pool constraint" for Nacimiento reservoir in their proposal. However, the MCWRA DEIR instead uses the historical 22,000 AF minimum pool of the previously rejected 1991 draft EIR and further indicates that 26% of the time Nacimiento reservoir levels would fall below 22,000 AF (or equivalently 689 feet elevation) with Alternative A (Table 5.9-11). During the peak
recreation season this increases to greater than 30% of the time (Table 5.9-9).

The four major physical effects, which are likely to impede adoption of this project in its
current form, are
1) Nacimiento reservoir levels, 2) Increasing the frequency and magnitude of drought conditions in Upper Valley and Forebay, 3) Water quality concerns related to the commitment in this DEIR of Zone 2B to accept greater quantities of reclaimed water over-time until in 2030 approximately 80% (or 16,000 AFY, p. 3-24) of applied water is reclaimed water from the SVRP (even in the face of the Tanimura & Antle proposal to replace all current SVRP water), and 4) Impacts on the steelhead fishery.
These and other specific issues with the DEIR are discussed in detail the following paragraphs.

Water Conservation Recharge vs. Flood Control The DEIR is misleading with respect to the tradeoffs between water conservation, flood control, and recreational uses of the reservoirs. In general, in any multi-use reservoir 149-11
there are tradeoffs between uses or goals. The decision process by which the MCWRA

8/23/01 Peter Reinelt AR 02673

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-689 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

has balanced these tradeoffs is unclear and the DEIR appears to deny that these tradeoffs
exist: "The baseline conditions as simulated in the SVIGSM assumes that the reservoirs
are operated based on the historical MCWRA operating criteria, i.e., (i) to maximize recharge along the river, (ii) minimize outflow to the ocean, (iii) minimize seawater intrusion, and (iv) minimizing flooding downstream (DEIR p. 5.5-32)." The historical operation of the reservoirs actually does none of these because there are clear tradeoffs berween maximizing recharge and minimizing flood control. The MCWRA should be
forthright about its process of balancing competing uses.
"While the MCWRA is concerned about the safety of the dam structure, its goal is also to minimize the impacts of downstream flooding in a large flood event. As such, the MCWRA is currently using a more conservative rule curve than the DSOD and FERC
curves…(DEIR p. 5.3-5)." The rule curves are presented in Figure 5.3-1. This, choice to create more flood storage capacity than required reduces the quantity of water that can be stored for the above listed conservation goals.
"Under the current [channel maintenance] program, the MCWRA reduces flows from Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs at the end of summer / beginning of fall for a period of 6 weeks, and the river is permitted to dry out (DEIR p. 5.5-8)." "Removal of 149-11

flow obstructions [under this program] is intended to reduce flooding potential to lands adjacent to the river (DEIR p. 5.5-8)." This choice to dry out the river to enhance flood control also reduces the quantity of stream recharge for the above listed conservation goals. In fact, the increased releases in September and October under Alternative A "…accounts for the majority of increase in flows (DEIR p. 5.5-31)."
On the other hand, downstream flooding is not minimized by the operation of the reservoirs. The reservoirs could be maintained with much lower levels of water leaving greater capacity to catch flood flows.
The HBA results suggests that the flood control benefits of the reservoirs are much greater than the water conservation benefits, even though the HBA vastly understates the benefits of slowing seawater intrusion by $1.3 million per year by our calculation.
At the present time without any structural project, the reservoirs could be reoperated to increase recharge by increasing releases in September and October and by storing water up to the FERC and DSOD rule curve. These elements should be analyzed in greater detail through an expansion of alternatives as discussed below.
Alternatives D and E are not reasonable or credible The assumption that demand would be reduced uniformly by 30 to 50% Basin-wide to halt seawater intrusion under the Total Demand Management or State Adjudication 149-12
Alternatives is simply not reasonable or credible. Reasonable alternatives should be developed in accordance with CEQA and NEPA CEQ.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-690 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

An economic study commissioned by the MCWRa' which examined nine alternative policies to reduce SWI by non-structural means, demonstrated that a uniform pumping reduction would be the most economically damaging policy. How is it in any way reasonable or credible to assume that the county or state would impose the most economically damaging policy to halt SWI if a structural solution is not built?
The development of the SVIGSM by experts with community participation clearly shows that pumping in the North causes SWI to a vastly greater a extent than pumping in the South no matter how the analysis is performed. Various numbers have been put forth, depending on model version, for the ratio of how current North VS. South pumping at current levels of development affects SWI: 13, 14.4, or 18, to one. If one interprets the historical cause of SWI as the effect of initiating pumping up to current levels, rather than cutting from current levels, the ratio is greater than 68 to one. While the stäte-of-the-art SVIGSM is not perfect and could be improved as is true for most any model, the point is nevertheless inescapable that pumping in the North contributes vastly more to SWI than. pumping in the South.
In fact, the least-cost nonstructural solution to halt SWI is to reduce pumping only in the North with no reductions in the South. This result was proved in detail in the Agland report, which was not politically popular with northern interests. This result does not change for any new economic data or new version of the SVIGSM. The simple explanation for this result is that the economic benefits lost to reduce SWI by each acre- foot would be greater in the South than in the North. Although the North generally produces greater economic benefits than the South per acre-foot of groundwater pumped, this ratio is not enough to overcome the 14.4 to ratio of the SWI caused by pumping 149-12

that same acre foot of water. Therefore, the least-cost (to the Salinas Valley economy)
nonstructural solution to halt SWI is to reduce pumping only in the North where it is most effective in line with all structural solutions. "It is MCWRA's strategy to target delivery of diverted SVWP water so that it has the greatest potential to efficiently meet the proposed project's objectives/needs. This would best be accomplished by making deliveries in the northern area of the Basin and correspondingly reducing withdrawals…..in that area (DEIR p. 3-23)."

Even the Cost Allocation Advisory Committee (CAAC) meetings in connection with
1998 DEIR developed an assumption for an adjudication outcome of non-uniform pumping reduction ratios based on the 14.4 to SVIGSM result. Unfortunately, the CAAC did not take into account the economic consequences of these pumping reductions in the formation of this assumption. According to the DEIR (p. 4-13) this non-uniform pumping reduction concept is also under consideration by the SWRCB. This non-' uniform pumping reduction was also developed in more detail in the 1998 SVWP Draft Project Plan Report (see p. 6-7 and 6-8 of that report). In that report, the assumption was that total reductions would have to be approximately 10%. This is vastly different from 30 to 50%. It is a relatively simple matter to check this assumption with the SVIGSM and then interpolate pumping reductions at the same ratios upward or downward with a

1995.

few SVIGSM runs to determine the' reduction percentage needed to halt seawater intrusion.

As these non-uniform pumping reductions are under consideration by the SWRCB and
the CAAC, this informative analysis should be performed.
Calculations based on interpolation of SVIGSM model runs performed by Stetson 149-12
Engineering indicate that SWI could be eliminated with either a 50% reduction over only ESUs 1 and 3, or a 40% reduction over the Pressure and East Side areas. Since these
areas are mostly truck crops with an average of two crops per year (HBA Appendix A), the likely result would be retaining crops in those seasons with the combined lowest
water use and highest revenue per acre. The net result may be cropping reductions less than water reductions. If the incremental alternatives discussed below were adopted, the needed water reductions would be smaller.

No Analysis of the Reoperation and Conservation Components of Alternative E The State adjudication outcome in Alternative E includes both reservoir reoperation and conservation. These components of Alternative E are not analyzed in the remainder of
the document. This should be corrected.

Changes 1o more efficient irrigation technologies is especially important in the Pressure area north of Spreckels because any percolation from irrigation does not return to the economic aquifers. Policies that encourage increasing the rate of change to more efficient irrigation technologies, such as drip, should be considered.
Even conservation that results in some reduction of double and triple cropping may have 149-13
a place among the mix of components for the final solution to halt SWl. The Agland report calculates that the first 10% to 25% of SWI could be reduced through reductions in pumping at a cost of 0.1% to 0.2% of Salinas Valley farming net revenues, respectively. This cost rises to 1.5% for 50% reduction of SWI and a maximum of approximately 8% if SWI was completely halted by reducing pumping by 50% in ESUs 1 and 3. This sort- of analysis should be included in the DEIR in conjunction with environmental effects so that the public çan make a decision based on all important impacts.
Two reasonable reoperation scenarios are presented following a request for clarification on spillway modification; whether the second scenario would fall under Alternative E
depends on whether spillway modification is required independent of a lower rule curve.

Spillway Modification Please clarify whether "spillway modifications at Nacimiento are necessary in order to safely pass the PMF (DEIR p. 3-4)" or whether "the current accepted rule
curve….accommodate[s] existing spillway capacity (DEIR p. 3-10).
"These costs will be financed apart from the capital costs for the other componenets of 149-14

the SVWP preferred alternative (p. 3-10)." Since this is a separate project consider the
following reasonable alternative reoperations of the reservoirs.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-692 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Two Other Incremental Alternatives Deserve Consideration
With an eye towards the factors that have caused projects to fail, two other alternatives, which should incrementally reduce overdraft and seawater intrusion, deserve consideration.
1) Reoperate Nacimiento reservoir according to the FERC rule curve and increase
releases during September and October so the river reaches Spreckels. Under this
alternative a) recharge would increase; b) reservoir levels would increase from use of 149-15
the higher rule curve but decrease from increased releases, the net effect may have little influence on flood control and recreational water levels; c) channel clearing operations would be confined to drought periods; and d) the cost would be minimal. 2) The second alternative would be similar to the first but with spillway modification included. This more costly alternative would be paid for by beneficiaries in the north
only. Attached Figure illustrates the relative extent the rule curve could be raised with and without spillway modification.

Reconsider Buena Vista Pumping Alternative
Essentially the same proposal as Alternative A was rejected between the 1991 draft EIR and the 1992 final EIR. A proposal to pump water from the aquifer in the Buena Vista
area survived until the 1992 final EIR. Given that much more information has been
developed since that time, especially with the SVIGSM and HBA demonstrating that this area receives some of the greatest increases in groundwater levels from the reservoirs, a Buena Vista pumping alternative which perhaps delivers water to Zone 2B and adjacent lands should be reanalyzed with the current set of models. 149-16
Even though farmers in this area are concerned about the effects on their groundwater levels this must be balanced against the outsized groundwater level gains they receive from the reservoir. The hydrological questions that need to be answered are: 1) to what extent does shifting pumping from the coast to the Buena Vista area reduce SWI by reducing the gradient of the groundwater depression, 2) to what extent would increased pumping in this area induce increased groundwater recharge, 3) could the incremental reoperation alternatives discussed above further enhance recharge in this area, and 4) what would be the net effect on groundwater levels and water balance.

Thresbolds of Significance for Groundwater Levels 1) Throughout the HBA and CAAC process, one category of benefit consistently addressed was changes in groundwater reliability with drought being a particular example. The threshold of significance section of the DEIR only considers declines in average annual groundwater levels with no consideration of changes in variability or the magnitude and frequency of droughts. While the hydrological analysis indicates that groundwater levels will exist under all conditions, the analysis also 149-17
indicates that the frequency and magnitude of drought conditions will increase in the Upper Valley and Forebay areas (see for example, Figures 5.3-14 and 5.3-15). Interestingly, Figures 5.3-18 and 5.3-19 were not presented in the 1998 DEIR, which show that low groundwater levels would be exacerbated by Alternative B with 1995

8/23/01 Peter Reinelt AR 02677

*Salinas Valley Water Project 2-693 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

baseline conditions for the 1991 drought, The only figures presented (Phase l 1995 baseline and full project 2030) do not generate this condition. The significant hydrological characteristic of groundwater level variability or the frequency and 149-17
magnitude of droughts should be added to the thresholds of significance.
2) The DEIR presents the following threshold of significance: "Rising of 10 feet or
more of groundwater levels in the Forebay and Upper Valley unconfined aquifers, to the extent that may cause water-logging and/or loss of crop production (DEIR p. 5.3- 9)." What data or, analysis supports the 10-foot threshold or is it arbitrary? Have 149-18
groundwater levels relative to the root zone been analyzed in these areas? Since, land currently exists in the Upper Valley where vineyards cannot be planted because groundwater levels are too high, are adjacent lands threatened by rising groundwater levels?

Drought Conditions in the Upper Valley and Forebay According to the DEIR Alternative A has a "slightly different reoperation scenario" and the SVIGSM has been modified since the prior Alternative B analysis with changes in the Arroyo Seco Cone, San Luis Obispo diversions, and a new San Antonio rule curve. 149-19
Which of these differences accounts for the significant differences in groundwater elevation curves for the Upper Valley? Again, the relative contributions of the different subcomponents of the alternatives should be presented for comparison.
Request for Graphs of Monthly Reservoir Storage and Levels over Hydrological Record for 1995 Baseline and 2030 Future Conditions
Instead of average monthly difference in storage graphs (Figures 5.3-6 and 5.3-7) please a create a graph of the monthly storage in the reservoirs in AF over the hydrological cycle for the 1995 Baseline and 2030 Future conditions for the different alternatives. These 149-20

graphs, which would be similar to the average annual groundwater level graphs, would be much more informative concerning drought conditions.
Equivalent graphs with reservoir levels in feet would be more informative for recreational and visual concerns than the tables of averagë monthly surface elevations (Tables 5.8-1 149-21
through 5.8-6) or the exceedance probability tables (Tables 5.9-7 through 5.9-10).

Root zone problems
What data and analysis supports the conclusion that "increases fin groundwater levels]
are approximately 0.5 and 2.0 feet in the Forebay and Upper Valley Subareas. This increase would not result in any problems to the root zone (p. 5.3-22)." A detailed 149-22

analysis comparable to that suggested near the diversion pond area (p. 5.3-41) should be performed in the Forebay and Upper Valley.

Average Groundwater Levels Clarification Are average annual groundwater levels weighted by the seasonal distribution of pumping similar to the HBA? By the geographical distribution of pumping? Are different pumping distributions used for weighting each subarea? If weighted average annual 149-23
groundwater elevations are reported in the figures, they should be so labeled and the weighting scheme described in detail.

8/23/01 Peter Reinelt AR 02678

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-694 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Average Monthly Groundwater Levels
Since vineyards pump significantly for frost protection in the "non-peak irrigation season," there may be negative groundwater level effects. An average monthly groundwater elevation analysis and graphs for each of the four subareas should be included in the DEIR presentation so that landowners can analyze the effect of the project on the seasonal timing of groundwater extraction. The weighting scheme used in the HBA derives from regionally average economic considerations. These graphs would 149-24
present only physical changes to the environment. These requested graphs should be easy to produce as the SVIGSM operates on a monthly basis and similar "average monthly" graphs have been created for seawater intrusion (DEIR Figures 5.3-20 and 5.3-49) and
reservoir releases (DEIR Figures 5.3-11 and 5.3-28). These graphs would also be useful to understanding potential root zone problems for vineyards as high water tables are more
of a problem at certain times of year.
Maps of changes in Groundwater Levels All recent studies have included maps of changes in groundwater levels. Why are they 149-25
not included in this DEIR?

MCWRP (formerly CSIP and SVRP) The DEIR contains contradictory statements concerning whether the MCWRP is fully operational. "As the MCWRP becomes fully operational, delivering approximately 13,300 AFY of recycled water...(DEIR p. 5.3-2)." "The MCWRP was put in operation 149-26
in April 1998, and is now in full operation (DEIR p. 5.3-16)." Is the MCWRP now in full operation or still becoming fully operational? When is "fully operational" expected to occur?

The most recent published data on the MCWRP a raises a number of pertinent questions
for the current project. First, the recent operation of the MCWRP violates MCWRA Ordinance 3790 on the operation of wells within Zone 2B: "...water from supplemental wells will be used to meet peak demands..." Currently, as described on p. 5.4-20 of the DEIR, supplemental wells are used throughout the year for blending operations because of water quality issues of recycled water (MCWRA, Zone 2B Water Conservation Plan, 149-27
December 2000, see data on p. 14). The result of these water quality issues is that only 10,000 AFY of recycled water was used within CSIP rather than the 13,300 AFY
specified in the DEIR. The history of the water quality problems with the MCWRP raises concerns that the water quality studies with respect to the current DEIR are
inadequate.

What are the 1995 baseline assumptions for groundwater pumping and recycled water.
deliveries in Zone 2B? If MCWRP operational data is available for year 2000, please provide it to verify that 1995 baseline assumptions are realistic. Otherwise, the SVIGSM 149-28
should be changed to reflect realistic MCWRP operations within Zone 2B.

Water Quality Issues of Current DEIR
1) The water quality and quantity of the Blanco Drain water entering the diversion pond needs to be analyzed in more detail to avoid the water quality problems that have plagued the MCWRP. When variation of this diversion was previously proposed in the 1992 EIR, the diversion structure was located just upstream of the Blanco Drain. The current 2001 DEIR locates the diversion structure approximately 1000 feet downstream of the Blanco Drain. Therefore, the quality and quantity of Blanco Drain water could be a key determinant of diversion water quality. a) Use of very old Blanco Drain water quality data from 1975 to1978 (Table 5.4-5) 149-29

is not acceptable for analysis of existing conditioris.
b) The DEIR states that "….the dilution of Blanco Drain flow would be at least 11:1
(p. 5.4-16)," but this is based on the median drain flow. The maximum drain flow indicates that dilution would only be 5.5:1. In either 5 case, the 5 to 10% of Blanco Drain water of the combined total should be included in the total water quality calculation carried out in Table 5.4-9.
2) The absence of future 2030 water quality calculations is a major concern that should
be corrected with a table comparable to Table 5.4-9 for 2030 conditions. The DEIR states that 2030 deliveries for the CSIP area are 16,000 AFY of recycled water and 4,000 AFY of river diversions with 2,800 AFY of supplemental pumping to meet peak demands. Therefore, much of the year approximately 80% of delivered water. would be recycled as compared to the 55% in Table 5.4-9. Thus, future water quality would be much worse. The DEIR claims that "In the areas where project water was 149-30
delivered, groundwater pumping would be limited to peaking capacities and deliveries during droughts (p. 2-3)." Since the CSIP area has currently been able to avoid using some recycled water, which is replaced by supplemental pumping for blending, is the 2030 scenario for the preferred project credible?* Will supplemental pumping for blending continue to occur into the future in violation of MCWRA Ordinance 3790?

Flawed Conclusion of Flood Control Analysis The conclusion of this subsection ("All changes in flows as a result of the project would be contained well within the existing channel capacity of the Salinas River (DEIR, p. 5.3- 32).") cannot be determined with the analysis as presented: A more useful analysis would examine all flood events above the channel capacity regardless of the magnitude of the increase or decrease.. Events which have flows below the channel capacity with the 149-31
project are irrelevant to a flood impacts analysis. As in the HBA, this analysis should be applied to a number of river cross sections, not just at Bradley, With the analysis as presented, one can only conclude that all increases in flows greater than 1000 cfs as a result of the project would be contained well within the existing channel capacity of the Salinas River.

It should also be pointed out that a statistical flood control analysis, similar to that performed within the HBA report, which considers all possible events rather than those that have occurred within the historical hydrological record, could reveal situations where 149-32

flood magnitudes increase under the alternatives.

Development and growth-inducing effects Since, (1) one of the forces behind pushing the SVWP forward is development interests and (2) these development interests and their benefits and payment responsibilities have not been explicitly addressed in the CAAC process, the DEIR growth-inducing effect sections provide the lens to focus attention on this shortcoming in the analysis.
"The implications of this action [the adjudication alternative] might include restrictions or prohibitions on new waler use in the future (DEIR, p. 7-2)." "Since the Salinas Valley groundwater basin is already in overdrafi, any population growth will cause the sustainable pumping rate to be exceeded even further (DEIR, p. 7-2)." The DEIR concludes that "...less, and possibly far less, of this population growth would occur without the project (DEIR, p. 7-9)." "Further, more municipal/industrial growth is expected in the Salinas/Marina/Fort Ord area, where seawater intrusion is a more immediate issue, than in more southerly areas of the Salinas Valley. (DEIR, p. 7.5)."
Moreover, the connection between development and future seawater intrusion is also 149-83
clear. The predicted trend in water usage between 1995 and 2030 (DEIR Tables 1-2) indicates an overall decline in water usage, which includes.a large reduction trend for agriculture and an increasing usage trend for urban areas. Without the project, seawater intrusion is predicted to increase on average from 8,900 AFY to 10,300 AFY, even though overall water usage is declining, The reason: "Although there is an anticipated net reduction in total Basin water use, projected groundwater pumping is expected to increase in the northern portion of the Valley in response to planned urbanization in that area. Thus, while there would be an overall reduction in basin-wide groundwater pumping, the increase in pumping in the North Valley is anticipated to have a more direct effect on seawater intrusion (1998 DEIR, p. 7-20)."
The conclusion is obvious: the proposed project is necessary for future northern urban growth and development.

• ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

Environmental Impact Report
Section 1 - Introduction
1) The schematic representation of seawater intrusion in Figure 1-1 is misleading. It should be replaced with the prior schematic Figure 3-3 from the 1998 DEIR. 149-34
2) Subsection 1.5.2 omits that the planned growth and development is directly supported by the project and otherwise may not occur. The comment that the project will ".not directly alter distribution or density of a population..(DEIR, p. 1-12)" is misleading. In fact, subsection 1.5.4 contradicts the claim in subsection 1.5.4: "...the 149-35
proposed project has the potential to induce growth by providing additional water supplies.(DEIR, p. 1-12)."

Section 2 - Summary 1) Include the omitted facts in subsection 2.2.1 subheading General Envirnomental Impacts: This reoperation will increase the frequency and magnitude of drought 149-36
conditions in the Forebay and Upper Valley area.
Section 3 - Applicant's Preferred Alternative / Proposed Action 1) How can the Fort Ord aquifer not be considered part of the groundwater basin, while at the same time the SVIGSM model, on which all quantified results depend, indicates a subsurface flow between Fort Ord and Pressure areas? (DEIR, p. 3-1) 149-37

2) The preferred action would not "maintain present conservation release practices to recharge the groundwater basin (DEIR p. 3-4)." The timing and quantities released
would change resulting in a greater frequency and magnitude of drought conditions in 149-38
the Forebay and Upper Valley area. 3) The DEIR on p. 3-10 states that reoperation "would provide an average of 29,000 AFY of additional water for release" and conservation releases would have an
"increase of 30,000 AFY." Please clarify. Is this an error or is more water being 149-39
released than is added to reservoir storage by reoperation? 4) The DEIR on p. 3-22 states agricultural pumping will decrease by 51,700 AFY while Table 1-2 p. 1-7 shows 60,000 AFY. Which numbers are correct? 149-40
5) The subsection entitled "Preferred Delivery System" (DEIR p. 3-23) omits the 1995 baseline amount of supplemental pumping of groundwater wells for comparison with
the next subsection where 2,800 AFY is estimated for 2030.
6) The DEIR on p. 3-23 states that 2030 SWI would be 10,500 AFY without project while Table 1-2 p. 1-7 shows 10,300 AFY. Which numbers are corréct? 149-42
7) Section 3.2.6 omits consideration of the increased frequency and magnitude of
drought conditions in the Forebay and Upper Valley. 149-43

Section 5 Affected Environment, Environmental Consequences of Proposed Alternatives, and Measures to Mitigate Significant Environmental Effects 1) The 1995 baseline conditions for "...a basis for analysis for hydrology, hydrologic- based issues, and population projections.

4) The DEIR on most up to date? p. 5.3-8 states that the hydrology study period from 1949 to 1994 "is the longest period that adequate, consistent, and reliable information is available on hydrologic. data (precipitation and streamflow), as well as groundwater levels." Is 149-47
this true-(i.e. this data is not available for 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000)? 5) Typo, DEIR p 5.3-11 "Since 1977, the SVIGSM... should read "Since 1997, the SVIGSM.' 149-48

7) Do Figures 5.3-22, 5.3-23, and other seawater intrusion front figures show the location of the front 46 years into the future under the conditions modeled? If so this 149-50
should be clarified in the text and the current or initial condition location of the front
should be included in the figures for comparison. '8) Figure 5.3-24 is the wrong figure. This is the figure for Alternative A; this is not the figure for Alternative B. 149-51
9) The DEIR on p. 5.3-47 states that basin outflow to the ocean is 269,000 AFY for 2030 conditions while Table 1-2 p. 1-7 shows 249,000 AFY. Which numbers are correct or most up to date? 149-52
10)The DEIR on p. 5.3-62 states seawater intrusion will increase by 10,000 AFY annually with no project while Table 1-2 p. 1-7 shows an increase of 1,400 AFY (i.e. 149-53

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-701 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The Political Economy of Salinas Valley Water Alarms were raised about the long term reliability of the water supply. in the Salinas Valley as early as 1931 with the first reference to overdraft and seawater intrusion (SWI).' The components of a comprehensive solution to the overdraft and sea water intrusion problems of the Lower Salinas Valley have been known since at least 1946.2 The necessary components are: (1) storage of excess winter Salinas River water either in underground or surface reservoirs and (2) a conveyance system to deliver the stored water to the Pressure and East Side areas during the main irrigation season. This basic blueprint is still widely accepted and recommended today as a structural solution to balance the basin and halt SWI.3 The undisputed fact that the components of the structural solution have been known for over 55 years begs the question: Why hasn't it been built?

The answer can be found within the interaction of political and economic motivations that have forestalled implementation of the Bulletin 52 recommendations. The obvious
impediment to action appears to be the question: Who is going to pay for it? But hidden beneath this question and rarely discussed is another question: Why pay for it now; why not wait? Is there an economic incentive to wait?

Wby pay for it now; why not wait? Fifty-five years after Bulletin 52, water is still available to land in all areas (with minimal contributions from the CSIP and SVRP). The ability to switch pumping first to deeper aquifers and then further inland while transporting water by pipeline toward coastal areas, 149-58
puts off the eventual day when a water capture and delivery system will have to be built. There are a number of competing economic incentives in this process. First, delaying construction of a structural solution saves money because of the time value of money inherent in interest rates. The cost of a $100 million project today delayed 50 years is under $10 million at a 5% interest rate and under $1 million at a 10% rate. This creates a large incentive to delay spending on a structural solution. On the other hand, delay allows SWI to continue to advance, which destroys a valuable asset-the storage and conveyance capacity of the intruded aquifer. The result is that larger storage and conveyance facilities will eventually have to be built at higher cost to halt SWI and supply water to intruded areas. The last competing economic incentive is the cost of temporary measures to obtain water, namely drilling deeper wells or pumping inland and
transporting water toward the coast.

While no detailed study has been performed on these competing economic incentives to my knowledge, the paucity of community action to build any of the projects proposed in a plethora of studies since the construction of the reservoirs strongly suggests that SWI has been economically efficient up to this time. While there are also some common

property aspects of the problem which hinder community action, discussions with other economists knowledgeable about the particulars of the Salinas Valley reveal that they are also of this opinion. The resource economics literature derives conditions under which it is economically efficient to "mine" an aquifer. In the terminology of resource economics "mine" essentially means to overdraft ( i.e. extraction is greater than recharge). However, as SWI advances and the cost rises for both the system necessary to replace the intruded aquifer and the temporary measures to obtain water in front and below the intruding seawater, eventually it will become economically efficient to build the type of project outlined in Bulletin 52 or else dramatically reduce water usage most likely leading to the fallowing of land,
As one northern farmer from the CSIP area stated at a public meeting: "It's not a question of economic loss, and I don't see it down the road. The degradation of crops can't be proved in the Salinas Valley except in the coastal Castroville arca which has always had some degradation. Loss of water to the cities is driving the politics-screaming and yelling. Let's get a project done for the cities."
Who is going to pay for it? Retum now to the obvious question: Who is going to pay for it?
The Reservoirs--Storage of Excess Winter Flows The first piece of the structural solution, storage of excess winter flows by the construction of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, was paid for by all property 149-58
owners, North and South, overlying the aquifer, with some assistance from the state for San Antonio. Even though Bulletin 52 clearly identifies an overdraft problem in the Pressure and Eastside areas ("the North") with no foreseeable future shortages in the Forebay and Upper Valley areas ("the South"),* by appealing to the common benefit of all land owners and by providing assurances that any future conveyance system needed to halt SWI distribution would not be paid by the whole valley but only those in the area benefited, 5,6 reservoir bond measures were adopted which garnered the support of the North, where the vast majority of the electorate resided, as. well as some support in the South.

* Bulletin 52, p. 23. "The only overdrafts on ground water in the Salinas Valley are in the East Side and Pressure Areas. There is no present shortage of ground water in the remainder of the basin and no threat of deficiency under probable ultimate development. * Ditwiler, Cortlandt D., The Political Economy of Water Use Transfer and Integrated Water Resource Management in the Salinas Valley, California, Dissertation in Agricultural Economics, University of Califomia, Berkcley, 1966, p. 125. MIt was acknowledged that a surface distribution system might have to be developed in the future in the event that sea-water intrusion should continue. It was stated, however, that such facilities would be paid for not by a Valley-wide tax, but, rather tax in the specific area of benefit only."
Salinas Californian, September 21, 1963. "WIl distributions systems be needed for some areas to make fullest use of the water? Yes, if sea
water intrusion continues, however, the supply must be developed before it can be distributed." "Who will pay for these distribution systems? The areas benefited by the distribution system."

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-703 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Conveyance of Water to Overdrafted Areas during the Main Irrigation Season The second part of the structural solution, conveyance of stored water to overdrafted areas in the North, has not been built. Another project to address SWI, with the stated goal of using reclaimed water, the combined CSIP and SVRP, was built and includes a local conveyance system for the region where overdraft creates the greatest SWI. The most recent proposed project for the second part of the structural solution is the SVWP.3
Alternative A of this project would deliver stored water via the Salinas River channel to a new diversion structure, which would. be connected to the existing CSIP conveyance system by a 550-foot pipeline.
Despite the assurances when the reservoirs were built that the South would not have to pay for the second part of the structural solution to SWI, a conveyance system to deliver water to overdrafted areas, the South is assessed for the CSIP/SVRP, and again, attempts are being made to assess the South for the SVWP.

The North-South Political Economy The confluence of a number of factors in the political economic calculus seem to explain the history and the current situation. First, if the opinion that overdrafting the aquifer has been economically efficient is correct, then the farmers in the North, acting like good businessmen, would not want to pay for something themselves that does not make business sense (i.e. is economically inefficient). Second, in the long run, solving SWI has some benefits, and there are political costs to ignoring the concerns of the cities and the state. Therefore, if northern interests can spread the cost of SWI projects to southern 149-58
regions and the state and federal governments, the northern self-interest economic
calculus may become favorable.
Third, as a consequence of the historical distribution of population within Monterey County, the county Board of Supervisors, which oversees the county water resource agency, has four supervisors representing Salinas northward and one supervisor whose district includes the South Valley but also wraps around Salinas to the north to include seawater intruded areas along the coast and the city of Castroville. The supervisor from this odd shaped district resides in Castroville. This northern domination of the Board of Supervisors created the opportunity for northern interests, especially agricultural interests who contribute heavily to elected officials, to exert greater influence over the water resource agency through greater representation on the agency board.
Salinas Valley Water Myths
One of the more interesting elements of this historical North-South political economy of
Salinas Valley water is the propagation of a local water mythology. It is difficult to trace the source of origin, but over the years, three "water myths" have appeared and can still be heard despite compelling scientific evidence to the contrary.
The three myths as commonly expressed are:
1) Pumping in the South causes a large amount of the SWI problem.

" MCWRA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Draft Environmental Impact Report / Envir *-mental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project, June 2001.
AR 02688

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-704 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

4

2) The South gets most of the benefits of the reservoirs. 3) Agriculture in the South would not have developed without the reservoirs. The common characteristic of the three myths is they are all directed at the South. The
only possible apparent purpose of this mythology is to continue to spread the cost of SWI projects t0 the South. The second myth has appeared as fact in MCWRA ordinances 3635 and 3636. And, the MCWRA recently supported a study" to prove a variation of the third myth even though it directly contravenes the foundation of its own Historical Benefits Analysis study,
The first two myths have been disproved by the agency's own studies. The development of the SVIGSM by experts with community participation clearly shows that pumping in the North causes SWI to vastly greater extent than pumping in the South no matter how the analysis is performed. Various numbers have been put forth, depending on model version, for the ratio of how current North vs. South pumping at current levels of development affects SWI: 13, 14.4, or 18, to one. If one interprets the historical cause of SWI as the effect of initiating pumping up to current levels, rather than cutting from current levels, the ratio is greater than 68 to one. While the state-of-the-art SVIGSM is not perfect and could be improvedias is true for most any model, the point is nevertheless inescapable that pumping in the North contributes vastly more to SWI than the pumping in the South,

In fact, the least-cost nonstructural solution to halt SWI is to reduce pumping only in the North with no reductions in the South. This result was proved in detail in the Agland 149-58
report and does not change for any geographical SWI contribution ratio in' the range of previous model versions. The simple explanation for this result is that the producer surplus (profits) lost to reduce SWI by each acre-foot would be greater in the South than in the North. Although the North generally produces greater producer surplus than the South for acre-foot of water pumped, this ratio is not enough to overcome the 14.4 to ratio of the. SWI caused by pumping that same acre foot of water. Therefore, the least- cost (to the Salinas Valley economy) nonstructural solution to halt SWI is to reduce pumping only in the North where it is most effective in line with all structural solutions.
The second myth has been disproved by the development of the HBA report by experts with community participation. This report clearly shows that the North receives most (approximately 70%) of the benefits from the reservoirs, and in fact, almost all of these benefits accrue to the Pressure Area. Corrections to this report would raise the ratio beyond 80%. Therefore, the statements found in MCWRA ordinances 3635 and 3636: Although both reservoirs are located in the far south of the Salinas Valley, all of the lands in similar land use categories in Zone 2 and 2A have been assessed at equal rates since the construction of the reservoirs, regardless of whether the land in the zone was located in the north or south. Over the years, the lands in the southern parts of Zone 2A have clearly benefited from the groundwater recharge program, while the lands in the northem parts of Zone 2A have lost wells to seawater intrusion and others nearby are threatened by seawater intrusion.

implementation of the Salinas Valley Seawater Intrusion Program is therefore necessary in order to protect the water supplies in Zone 2A that are inland from the seawater intruded areas, to reduce the dependence of the coastal areas on water from the southern part of the groundwater basin, and to restore equity.in the distribution of Zone 2A water supplies [emphasis added]. are officially propagated myth.
Even though the third myth directly contravenes the foundation of the HBA report, where a fixed historical land-use model was chosen over a flexible model because the change in• the economic cost incentive was deemed to be small compared to overall farm costs (i.e. "with" and "without" the reservoirs the same crops would have been grown), the agency has recently spent about $25,000 on a study, half of which is devoted to support of the third myth. Although proving exactly which factors most directly led to economic development is extremely difficult given the large number of possible factors and a lack of detailed historical data, it is an easier task to disprove the importance of the reservoirs for agricultural development with the available data, This myth is disproved in a' companion piece to this report.'
think that most people who have not been indoctrinated in the mythology will recognize this discussion as a reasonable approximation of the political economic history of Salinas
Valley water.

Appendix - Supporting Quotations

Beginning of Salt Water Intrusion "In the report on the study of the water conservation problems of the Valley made by the State Department of Public Works, Division of Water Resources in 1931 and 1932 (financed jointly by the State of California and the Counties of Monterey and San Luis Obispo) casual mention is made of salt water encroachment in one or two wells at the lower end of the valley near the shore of Monterey Bay.""(Bulletin 52, p: 6)
"As early as 1931 it was predicted that if vegetable crop acreage were to increase over the current levels, an overdraft condition would probably develop." (Dit. P.68, source footnote--California Department of Public Works, Report on Salinas Basin Preliminary Investigation, Sacramento 1933)
"Although it was concluded that draft on the Valley aquifers was less than average annual replenishment, it was suggested that an increase in vegetable production in the lower Valley could upset the balance which then existed. It was suggested that spreading works in the Arroyo Seco Cone area would provide new water most economically. The second recommendation suggested that a dam on one of the major tributaries to the Salinas Would provide for the conservation of a considerable volume of water which WAs then wasting to the ocean." (Ditwiler p.109, source footnote--California Department of
Public Works, Report on Salinas Basin Preliminary Investigation, Sacramento 1933)
149-58
"As' a consequence, during recent years an increasing number of wells in that vicinity have become so salty that their use had to be abandoned or at least greatly restricted. In the Spring of 1944 conditions became so bad that a number of farmers and land owners from this area appealed to the Board of Supervisors for help. .Under instructions from the Board, County Engineer Howard Cozzens arranged with the State Department of Public Works, Division of Water Resources to make a study of the situation; cost to be borne equally by the State and Monterey County. In accordance with this understanding, an investigation was commenced by the Division in July, 1944.:"(Bulletin 52, p.6) "Complex studies [in Bulletin 52] relating to the inflow and outflow of subsurface water to and from the bay provided a basis for an estimate that in 1945 some 12,000 acre-feet of salt water intruded into the 180-foot aquifer. Actually in 1943 wells were being abandoned due to excessive salinity in the area at what was termed an accelerated rate.
By the fall of 1945 evidence indicate that some 3,000 acres were contaminated to the extent that it was either unusable for irrigation, or near the upper limit in salinity for safe
use." (Ditwiler p.98)

Bulletin 52 (California Department of Public Works, Salinas Basin Investigation, Bulletin No. 52, Sacramento, 1946).
"A complete solution of the problems of overdraft must include salvage of a portion of the large surface outflow from the Forebay Area." (Bulletin 52 p.20)

"The only overdrafts on ground water in the Salinas Valley are in the East Side and Pressure Areas. There is no present shortage of ground water in the remainder of the basin and no threat of deficiency under probable ultimate development. (Bulletin 52 p.
23)"
"Irrespective of the method of salvage employed to capture some of the surface outflow from the Forebay Area, a complete solution must embrace a plan of delivery of water impounded, either in surface or underground reservoirs, to locations where additional water is required. Released surface storage and increased percolation in the stream beds south of Gonzales, without artificial means of conveyance, would be ineffective to relieve 149-58
överdrafts in the East Side and Pressure Areas."Bul52 p.31
['"Thé study concluded that a program to increase percolation or provide for surface storage on the Salinas River system (the corrective measures recommended by the 1931 study) would be ineffective without supplemental works to divert water to the East Side . and Pressure Units." Ditwiler. p.111]

P

The MCWRA Request for a Determination of "Rough Proportionality" of Benefits
sa Unfortunately, after thoroughly reviewing the economic analyses presented in the Northwest Economic Associates report and the Engineer's Report', can come to no other conclusion than that the Agency (MCWRA) has chosen to direct its consultants to support the political position that benefits in Zones 2 and 2A are "roughly proportional" rather than develop an objective quantitative analysis of benefit proportionality based on the scientific and economic merits. It is unfortunate to have to make this claim, but these documents seem to be a continuation of the adversarial litigation approach rather than the open processes with community involvement and good faith efforts that characterized the development of the SVIGSM and HBA. This is a very a difficult position for agency consultants to be in; witness the agencies non-acceptance of the Agland report and the disappearance of the consultant authors when the results were politically unpopular with northern agricultural interests. much prefer the good faith, community involvement approach, but must respond to these reports for what they appear to be. The analytical bias is obvious because each author omits portions of their own previous analyses which contradict or greatly weaken the politically motivated conclusions.

The agency wants to maintain the current standby charge system for Zones 2 and 2A. Why?
Every main category of quantified benefits indicates that the Pressure area receives the greatest benefits per acre. All attempts to aggregate the differential benefits of the various categories also give the same result. Even though some benefits have not been 149-58
quantified, there is no reason to believe that the unquantified benefits will change this result and show that benefits are roughly proportional.
When so much evidence exists that benefits from the reservoirs do not accrue to all lands in a "roughly proportional" manner, how can the MCWRA continue to ignore the evidence that has been created through its own studies and continue to promote unfair equal assessments for all lands overlying the aquifer?

The time has come to accept the overwhelming scientific and economic evidence that benefits from the reservoirs vary greatly across the lands of the Salinas Valley. The
political effort to maintain unfair assessments which are disproportional to benefits should end.
There seem to be only two possibilities to explain agency efforts to maintain the current rate structure despite all the evidence to the contrary. Either 1) northern interests in the Pressure area which have historically dominated the agency's governing board do not want to pay rates proportional to benefits because their rates would rise, or 2) the agency staff does not want to face the political difficulties of changing the rate system to fair rates proportional to benefits.

There appear to be two central issues which must be supported to maintain the current rate structure: 1) commingling of expenses of the two reservoirs, and 2) the regional "rough proportionality" of benefits.
The first issue related to the commingling of zone expenses appears to be largely a legal matter. A recent court ruling found: "...Section 12 provides that '(t)he water standby charge shall be used for ongoing maintenance and operation of the zones of the agency upon which the charge is imposed...' There is no basis in fact or law to allocate all of the 'common' expenses to Zone 2A.3 The legal merits are beyond my expertise. On the other hand, there are no evident engineering or economic reasons why the reservoirs should not.,be operated as a system. The obvious solution from an operational engineering and economic perspective is to combine the zones into one new zone. The legal issues related to the historical obligation of the zones to pay the individual reservoir bonds' and the political feasibility are another matter. A number of questions related to the manner in which the joint operation of the reservoirs impacts the distribution of benefits are included in Appendix A.
The next issue is the "rough proportionality" of benefits. Neither of the reports reviewed here refers to or provides a quantitative definition of this term. My own opinion is that any ratio up to 1.2, or perhaps as high as, 1.5 to 1 could be considered roughly proportional. From the other direction, I think that most people would agree that for ratios greater than 2 to 1, benefits are definitely no1 roughly proportional. 149-58
Comments on the Engineer's Report for the Year 2001/2002 Standby and Availability Charges This study claims that although eight identified categories of "...benefits occur throughout the Zones 2 and 2A at varying levels" that "... when taken in the aggregate, there is a general level of benefit…that is roughly equal." It further claims that "The current standby charges, which are uniform throughout Zones 2 and 2A, are generally proportional to the benefits received from the projects."
I think it is abundantly clear what is happening. The author has been directed by the agency to write a report which supports uniform charges. The author as Principal-in- Charge of the prior HBA study' which clearly indicates nonproportional benefits has created a simplified approach to give the agency the answer it wants. The fact that the author knows that the result is otherwise is revealed in the following statements: "These roughly proportional benefits are not strict enough to support assessments that are subject to Proposition 218 requirements. Although the benefits are generally equal throughout the Zones 2 and 2A, a much more strict proportionality assessment would be required to. support a Proposition 218 assessment proceeding. This could lead to a differënt set of conclusions than those oulined here. [emphasis added]".

The simplified approach developed in this report is to identify categories of benefits, determine "yes" or "no" whether each area receives this benefit; and finally to add the yes's to determine proportionality. A simple example illustrates that this methodology is generally devoid of any quantitative economic meaning concerning proportionality of benefits.

Consider a small reservoir which provides two categories of benefits to two parcels of land. Parcel A receives $1 million in flood control benefits and no water conservation benefits. Parcel B receives $1 of water conservation benefits and no flood control benefits. The approach advocated in the engineer's report is summarized in the following
matrix.

BENEFIT Parcel A Parcel B

Flood
control yes no

Water
I conservation no yes

Totals yes yes

Therefore, since both parcels receive 1 yes, benefits are roughly proportional. The
problem with this approach is that yes's and no's are not a common metric suitable for 149-58
assessing benefit proportionality. The obvious metric to use is dollars. Using dollars as the metric, the matrix for the previous example becomes

BENEFIT Parcel A Parcel B

Flood
control $1 million $0

Water
conservation $0 $1

Totais $1 million $1

Now the proportionality of benefits is correctly identified as 1,000,000 to 1.
A difficulty arises when some categories are not easily quantified. However, this type of problem arises all the time in cost-benefit analysis of water resource projects. The U.S. Water Resource Council has created guidelines relevant to water resource projects and describes associated estimation techniques*.

Now benefits aggregated across categories by region are clearly not even close to any concept of roughly proportional. Is there any reason to believe that unquantified benefits will change this result? No, the relative values are likely to be small except for the one serious flaw in the HBA quantification which fails to account for the reduced destruction of the asset inherent in the conveyance and storage properties of the aquifer with an average annual benefit of approximately $1.3 million dollars in the Pressure area from slowing SWI, but this result will only further skew the ratio of proportionality in favor of the Pressure area. (see Appendix A for a detail derivation of this result and a discussion of the other areas in which the HBA could be improved.) Even the NEA report states that "A. comprehensive quantification of the more significanr [emphasis added] of these benefits was initiated in 1996 and culminated in the release of a 'report in April.1998 [the HBA]."

In any case, inclusion of the quantitative economic benefits for each category, reveals that regional benefits are not even close to "roughly proportional."

Average historical irrigated acreage numbers from the HBA are used for this conversion. However, it should be noted that significant flood control benefits occur only in the flood plain. Since the determination of benefits proportionality concerns current assessments, the standard must be the proportionality of current benefits. Therefore, the benefit and acreage values used in these matrices should be updated to reflect current values based on the baseline model of the SVIGSM and HBA; this will change the proportionality ratios but not the general pattem of nonproportionaliry.

Comments on Northwest Economic Associates Report This section of the review will focus on the discussion of benefits in the NEA *

report and the implications for cost allocation. About half of the NEA report focuses on the claim: that the reservoirs provided a reliable water supply which allowed for economic .. .•

development through increases in truck crop and vineyard acreages, which increased crop and land values, and produced multiplier effects throughout the local economy. This
claim is analyzed first. Then this commentary examines the NEA.review of prior benefits studies coupled with the implications drawn concerning cost allocation.
Economic Development and the Reservoirs The claim that the reservoirs provided a reliable water supply that allowed for economic development through increased truck crop and vineyard acreages is a variation of the oft repeated myth that the reservoirs allowed for the development of the southern valley. As stated in a companion discussion of the political economy of Salinas Valley water', the alternatives to this myth are more difficult to prove in the affirmative because of the great challenge in determining which factors are most important for specific economic developments. So while time and data limitations prevent the development of an econometric analysis necessary to establish the relative importance of different factors, 1 will demonstrate that any change in water availability and reliability provided by the reservoirs was not an important factor thereby disproving the myth. The key points are first that the reservoirs have changed reliability and availability as defined below very little to date, and second that agricultural water usage has actually declined since the construction of the reservoirs even with increasing irrigated acreage. 149-58

The NEA report begins the section on increases in irrigated acreage with the claim: "In the Salinas Valley, the effects of improved reliability are measurable directly in the large increases in irrigated vineyards and vegetable cropland in the entire Salinas Valley since completion of the Nacimiento and San Antonio projects; and by the complementary „id infrastructure which has built up around agricultural production.' There is no analysis in this report establishing the cause and effect linkage between the reservoirs and increased irrigated acreage beyond this claim of "direct measurability". There is no. quantification or measure of how the reservoirs have "improved reliability." This is not
economic analysis. Contrary to the NEA report, economic logic demands that causation be demonstrated; only correlation between the construction of the reservoirs and increased irrigated acreage is demonstrated. The correlation of events in time is not enough to demonstrate causation. Just as there has been a strong correlation between U.S. stock market performance and whether an NFC team wins the Super Bowl, there is
no causation.

The most glaring omission in this report and the strongest indication of analytical bias is
the absence of a discussion of the previous work on the same subject by the same author

of the "major factors influencing Salinas Valley irrigated agricultural production.»I1 NEA's prior work indicates the "major factors influencing Salinas Valley irrigated agricultural production" are "domestic demand; foreign demand; regional/national competitive position; packaging and processing costs; yield and technological change; transportation cost; other costs of production; land, labor and energy availability and cost; water reliability and cost." Which of these factors is the most important for the increased irrigated acreage in the Salinas Valley since the operation of the first reservoir in 1959? What is the relative importance of each of these factors? Are there other important factors such as tax shelter considerations and investor speculation for early development of vineyards? A detailed econometric analysis would be required to answer these
questions.

One could just as. easily claim that the effects of changing demand are measurable directly in the large increases in irrigated vineyards. I believe this is the more likely explanation, but this claim and belief do not constitute economic analysis. In fact the
SVIGSM final report states that "...fluctuations in vineyard acreage have been driven by
market forces" and "[t]his increase in vineyard acreage, however, has been accompanied by a reduced unit water use...." a »12
The next glaring omission of the NEA report is connected to the last statement: there is absolutely no discussion of the linkage between the construction of the reservoirs, increased irrigated acreage, and water usage. First consider the concepts of water availability and supply reliability. Agriculture could not exist without water. However, 149-58
this does not mean that the-availability of water causes agriculture to be developed; many other factors are important. In agreement with the NEA report, water supply reliability »i3 "…depends on the size, frequency, and duration of shortages..."
There are two reliability issues that have been raised with respect to the aquifer underlying the Salinas Valley. The first issue is the long-term reliability and
sustainability of the water supply provided by the aquifer in the northern valley as it is
threatened by seawater intrusion. The second issue is short-term reliability related to variations in recharge between wet and dry year cycles.
The impetus for all efforts to modify ground water recharge in the last 50 years has been the recognition that seawater intrusion threatens the long-term reliability of the aquifer as a water supply source in the northern valley. The role of the reservoirs in slowing SWI and the associated benefits have been examined in the HBA (with one major flaw, see
Appendix A), but there has been no suggestion that land would not have developed in the northern valley without the change in long-term reliability provided by the reservoirs.

The effect of the reservoirs on the short-term reliability or drought issue has been addressed in the HBA for the hydrological record including the severe 1976-1977 and .1988-1992 droughts. The HBA quantifies the benefits of historical drought protection provided by the reservoirs. The alternative method of employing statistical distributions which would include theoretically more severe droughts has not been undertaken. Based on the SVIGSM modeling, a water level exists under the land in all Economic Study Units (ESU) without the reservoirs even during the severe historical droughts.; In other words, water is still available under the land during severe droughts; it is just deeper in it the ground. The HBA attempted to quantify the cost of accessing this deeper water: (beyond the increased energy pumping cost) by examining the cost of well modifications in certain areas. It failed to take into account that excess pumping capacity exists in those same areas as explained in detail in Appendix A. Since the change in short-term reliability created by the construction of the reservoirs is so small or nonexistent, it is not credible that historical development or agricultural acreage would have been hindered
without this change.
Thus, even though a quantification of the change in historical water supply reliability provided by the reservoirs is enough by itself to discredit the claim that "...the effects of improved reliability are measurable directly in the large increases in irrigated vineyards and vegetable cropland in the entire Salinas Valley...," let's now examine the changes in water usage associated with the increased irrigated acreage since 1959.
Figure 1 presents agricultural water pumping calculated by the consumptive use 149-58
methodology for water years 1959 through 1994 for the Pressure, East Side, Forebay, and Upper Valley areas.' Trend lines are fitted by least squares to extract the average changes and remove the influence of annual- variation in the weather. During this period agricultural water pumping declined on average 6 acre-feet per year in the Pressure area, 578 ac-ft/yr. in the East Side area, 1518 ac-flyr. in the Forebay area, and 618 ac-ft/yr. in the Upper Valley area. During the same period irrigated agricultural acreage increased from 47,445 to 53,211 acres (increase of 5,766 acres) in Pressure area, from 31,846 to
37,354 acres (increase of 5,508 acres) in the East Side area, from 45,228 to 58,186 acres (increase of 12,958 acres) in the Forebay area, and from 30,763 to 48,140 acres (increase of 17,377 acres) in the Upper Valley area'5. How is it possible that irrigated acreage increased while pumping declined? The answer is twofold. First, basin irrigation efficiencies increasedlo because of both improved irrigation practices by farmers and technological change in irrigation equipment. Second, crop switching from higher water using crops (sugar beets, pasture, and field crops) to lower water using crops (truck crops and vineyards) greatly reduced consumptive use per irrigated acre (see Figure 2). Therefore and conclusively, less water is used by agriculture now than at the time the first reservoir began operation. Thus, the linkage between increased irrigated acreage of truck crops and vineyards and any changes in water availability or reliability brought about by

the construction of the reservoirs is irretrievably broken. It must be that changes in other
factors explain the increased development of irrigated agriculture and its attendant
economic benefits.

It should also be noted that the effect of the reservoirs on land use was discussed
extensively during the open HBA workshop process. Two modeling approaches were considered with regard to the effect on farm management decisions of changing water conditions brought about by the reservoirs. A fixed historical land-use model was chosen
a over a flexible model because the change in the economic cost incentive was deemed to
be small compared to overall farm costs (i.e. "with" and "without" the reservoirs the same crops would have been grown).
Therefore, the first two summary statements in the NEA report: "The Salinas Valley has become one of the most important agricultural regions in the nation, largely because of the reliable water supplies provided by the joint operations of Nacimiento and San Antonio" and "The success of agriculture is attributable directly to the availability of reliable water supplies from the Nacimiento and San Antonio projects" are false
statements.

One further historical note: in the era before the reservoirs, vegetable crop acreage grew. dramatically as a percentage of irrigated land from 1% in 1920 to 58% in 1960. See Ditwiler'7 for a discussion of the historical factors that played a role in this change. 149-58
Since, the linkage has been broken between improved reliability provided by the reservoirs and increased development of agriculture acreage. I will not review the NEA
discussion of increased crop and land values, and the multiplier effect on the local
economy. However, a few additional passages in this section of the NEA report deserve
brief comments.

The NEA report discussion on why vineyards did not arrive earlier even though research on the suitability of growing premium grapes was well known states: "Prior to the completion of the Nacimiento and San Antonio projects, the unpredictable rainfall which is characteristic of the Salinas Valley and the unregulated Salinas River flows made it very uncertain whether adequate water would be available at critical times for berry and vine growth."18 Comments such as these show a lack of knowledge about the history of agriculture in the Forebay and Upper Valley grape growing regions. Ground water rather than surface runoff has been the most significant water resource used for farming since 1910 owing to the technological advance of the deep-well turbine pump'9 In addition, the long historical experience of irrigating high water using crops (pastures, sugar beets, and field crops) as well as orchards with ground water proved the availability of a reliable supply sufficient to grow vineyards prior to the construction of the reservoirs.

Finally, the one area where I partially agree with the NEA report that the reservoirs allowed for increased development of irrigated agriculture is with respect to the flood control in the flood plain. From 1953 to 1997, irrigated agriculture acreage grew by 40% in Zone 2A. During the same period irrigated acreage grew by 80% in the 25-year with reservoir flood plain, by 19% between the 25-year and 100-year with reservoir flood plains, and by 13% between the 100-year with and 100-year without reservoir flood plains. It seems likely that part of the 80% increase in development of irrigated acreage in the 25-year flood plain can be attributed to the flood control services provided by the
reservoirs especially in comparison to the overall figure of 40%. On the other hand, the
small percentage changes between the 25-year and the 100-year without flood plains relative to the overall growth rate are more likely explained by factors other than flood control services. However, a detailed econometric analysis is needed to verify these opinions.

Review of prior benefit study categories
The NEA report briefly reviews flood control and water conservation and ground water recharge benefits. The report claims that the flood control benefits are "non-exclusive." It also claims that the same level of protection "…is available to everyone, and everyone in the area 'consumes' the same amount of benefit. For this reason, it is difficult, without arbitrary assumptions, to determine how much each person or property in the flood plain benefits from the project.»20 Many Army Corp of Engineer studies develop flood damage values as function of river flows; the greater the flow the greater the damage higher into 149-58
the floodplain. Thus everyone in the flood plain does not receive the same amount of
benefit. Those with economic assets in the lower flood plain receive greater benefit than
those higher in the flood plain. The methodology of HBA. flood control section develops similar results. The assumptions are not arbitrary; benefit-cost analysis of flood control projects determine variations in flood control benefits all the time.
In addition, the NEA report claims that individuals and properties outside the flood plain also benefit from flood control because "floods damage roads, utilities, buildings, and other infrastructure and facilities which provide services for everyone in a region, both inside and outside the flood plain." While this argument is technically true, it is disingenuous to make this argument because the comparative damage to a household that is completely flooded to one nearby which is not flooded at all is beyond any concept of
rough proportionality.
The NEA report also claims that "...the benefit provided by increased ground water recharge is non-exclusive." While it is true that the SVIGSM shows that ground water levels rise in nearly all areas and this cannot be excluded for any parcel of land for a
given operation of the reservoir, the magnitude of the ground water level increase and thus the associated economic benefit is exclusive because one only has the right to pump on ones own land.

Implications for Allocating Costs of the Proiects
- - The NEA report seems to argue that because "...benefits occur throughout Zones 2 and 2A at varying levels and different times" and because ".everyone living in the Salinas Valley benefits from the services provided by the projects and no one can be excluded from 'consuming' the benefits" that "a reasonable approach to cost allocation is a uniform charge on all property within specific zones which benefit from the project."2l
Certainly, benefits of the projects vary from year to year with the weather. However, it is common in benefit-cost analyses of water projects to use the hydrological record as a proxy for future weather and compute the average annual benefits. This sort of analysis is done all the time. Again, there is exclusivity with regard to the magnitude of benefits within the Zones. Therefore, there is no economic logic 1o support the claim that cost allocation should be uniform. Fairness dictates otherwise.

rf. Appendix A

Operation of the reservoirs 1. Can the reservoirs be operated together or independently to enhance percolation and recharge in different areas? 2. Are the reservoirs operated to maximize percolation and recharge for specific locations, such as, as near to the coast as is physically possible because of the urconfined, noneconomic aquifer north of Spreckles? 3. Are the reservoirs operated to maximize benefits to all lands overlying the aquifer? 4. Are the reservoirs operated to provide proportional benefits to all lands? 5. If areas can be identified which are threatened by drought, are the reservoirs operated in these times to relieve low water conditions in these areas? Or do the timing and purpose of releases remain the same during drought? 6. Does the operation of the reservoirs take into account the fact that raising ground water levels can result in water-logging and loss of land for production of certain high •
value crops such as vineyards?

Seawater Intrusion
The HBA claims that adding the cost of replacing the intruded ground water storage and distribution system with a surface system along with the cost of drilling 'deeper wells would be double counting. This claim is only partially correct, for it neglects the fact that
drilling deeper wells is only a temporary solution. The result of this error is that
approximately $1,278,252 of annual benefits for ESU 1 are ignored in the HBA. 1 149-58

Eventually, when all the aquifers underlying an acre of land are intruded, water must be obtained from elsewhere. The longer seawater is allowed to intrude under more and more land, the larger the required capacity of a surface system to halt seawater intrusion
and meet the water demand. Slowing the rate of SWI also slows the increase in the capacity of a surface system required to halt S'WI and meet demand. Saving some of the valuable asset, namely the storage and conveyance capacity of the ground water aquifer, is a benefit of slowing SWI by the reservoirs.
The following is an approximate calculation of this annual benefit.
During the historical period (1949-1995), the average annual basin overdraft WAS
approximately 20,000 af/yr. in the Pressure and East Side areas. During the same period,
average annual agricultural and M&I pumping in these areas was 215,886 af/yr.
Therefore, the safe yield was approximately 195,886 af/yr. If we assume that the safe- yield can be evenly apportioned to each of the 95,892 agricultural and M&I acres in the Pressure and East Side areas, the safe-yield per acre is 2.04 af/ac. SWI is destroying the asset that provides the safe-yield; if the aquifers were completely intruded the safe-yield would become zero. On the other hand, SWI is not destroying the needed surface system capacity related to the original 20,000 af/yr overdraft; this is where the HBA is partially
correct.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-722 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

14

Based on SVWP estimates, the cost of a surface storage capacity providing a yield of 10,000 af/yr is $60,000,000. The cost per af/yr is therefore $6,000, and the cost per acre to replace safe-yield of 2.04 af/yr is $12,240 per acre. If half of this storage capacity is apportioned to each of the 180-foot and 400-foot aquifers, the result is $6,120 per acre per aquifer.
Based on the HBA, without the reservoirs seawater would have intruded •under an additional 4,900 acres of the 180-foot aquifer and 1,200 acres of the 400-foot aquifer. On an average annual basis over the 37 year record, this translates to 132.43 ac/yr and 32.43 ac/yr intruded, respectively. Thus, the average annual avoided loss of storage capacity has been $1,008,943.20 [=(132.43+32.43)x$6,120].
The value of the conveyance capacity estimate for the aquifer is based on the cost of the CSIP conveyance • system. CSIP cost approximately $39,000,000 a for a conveyance system for 12,000 acres, or $3,250 per acre. If half of the conveyance capacity of the aquifers is apportioned to each the 180- and 400-foot aquifers, the replacement cost is $1,625 per acre per aquifer. Thus, the average annual avoided loss of conveyance capacity has been $267,897.50 [=(132:43+32.43)x$1,625].
Both of these amounts need to be added to the cost of the temporary solution of well replacement figure of $78,542.65.
The total annual SWI costs avoided due to the reservoirs are thus estimated to be 149-58
$1,355,383.35. (Note the cost on the spreadsheet are slightly different because they are

not rounded).
The fact that the HBA ignores the cost of the destruction of valuable assets (ground water storage capacity and ground water conveyance capacity) is a major flaw.
Change in groundwater pumping costs ...s...

Investigations show that the benefits associated with avoided groundwater pumping costs in the HBA are vastly overstated in the South [and are probably about 50% of the reported value] for the following reasons. First, current irrigation energy costs are overstated. The claim that the ".. . typical
hour (kWh). electric rate is about 12 cents per kilowatt
(MW 1997, p. 3-3)" is correct for the PG&E AG-1B flat rate schedule
($0.11984 per kWh). However, many farmers in the South èmploy time-of-use rates (such as PG&E AG-4B or AG-5B) to reduce costs. With these rates energy cost per kWh may be more than 50% lower (Summer, off-peak rates: $0.07204 AG-4B and $0.04264 AG-5B). The ability to use time-of-use rates is greater in the South due to the existence of small regulation reservoirs and also crop type.
Second, many farms in the South have excess pumping capacity and thus can operate the most efficient wells. The HBA claims the ".. . average pumping efficiency is about 60% (MW 1997, p. 3-3)," whereas many farmers operate above this level.

Third, "For simplicity, the 0&M cost is assumed to be 10 percent of the energy cost or about 2 cent [per af per foot] (MW 1997, p. 3-3)" in the HBA Draft Report, According to experts at the Irrigation Training Research Center at California Polytechnic University, no such predictable correlation between 0&M costs and changes in ground water levels . exist. Therefore, this assumption should be eliminated.

Well Performance: Well Modification and Additional Well Costs
The HBA analysis assumes one of two specific responses to rectify well performance problems associated with declining ground water levels: either the bowls are lowered or the well is replaced. Since lowering of pump bowls is a relatively small benefit, only the well replacement response is addressed here. The HBA predicts that 8% of Upper Valley wells would be replaced without reservoirs due to lower GW levels. The restriction of farmer response to this singular response is unfounded.
First, ground water pumping in the Upper Valley has declined 25% from its peak (Final HBA, Appendix A); clearly more than 8% excess pumping capacity exists. Therefore, even if the performance of a well is impaired, common sense dictates that an unneeded
well will not be replaced.
Second, there is a possible inconsistency between the historical modeling logic and the modeling of this specific response by any effected farmer. Would those wells slated for replacement in the HBA have been built to the same specifications under different hydrological conditions? What are the construction dates of those wells designated for 149-58
replacement?
Third, the data set used in the Upper Valley (the only. subarea where this cost is indicated) for this calculation includes only 19% of the wells, and this data set is stated to be insufficient to assign this cost by ESU. It also appears from the well location map, that the geographical distribution is not representative. Where are the locations of the wells designated for replacement?
Fourth, the derived result also could reflect a calibration problem of the ISGM. On the "Well Perforations and Monthly Ground Water Levels" graphs, the historical ground water level data should be included similar to that on the "Hydrographs of Measured and• Simulated GW Levels" graphs of Attachment 2 of Appendix A of the HBA Draft Report.
Therefore, because of the weak methodological and data support, this cost should be eliminated from the spreadsheet until the above questions are sufficiently addressed.
Change in Suitability of Land for Production of Certain Crops [Loss of Productive Vineyard Land] The HBA neglects the fact that higher ground water levels restrict the suitability of some lands for the production of certain crops. Thus, the higher ground water levels indicated by the IGSM may not only provide a benefit of reduced pumping cost but may also impose a cost associated with the loss of the opportunity to grow the most profitable crop. This cost is equal the difference between the highest value crop and the next best

alternative (unless less costly technological drainage solution exists-then cost of technological solution). This cost is most likely to apply to lands which would be suitable for vineyards in the "without" reservoir case which are unsuitable for vineyards.
in the "with" reservoir case. This cost, which may be substantial, has been neglected in
the analysis.

Flood Control During the HBA workshop process, two modeling approaches were considered with regard to the effect of GW level chänges on farm management decisions. A fixed land- use model was chosen over a flexible model because of the small percentage of GW puiping costs in overall farm costs. No similar process occurred with respect to the flood control modeling approach for agriculture. The result is an analysis that ignores the possibility of good business management decisions by farmers. . In the case of flood control when a larger percentage of per acre farm costs are involved, Montgomery Watson has chosen a "stupid, myopic farmer" model over a "wise, adaptive farmer" 149-58

model.

The flood control model assumes the same land use and crop mix patterns for the "with" and "without" cases. The model thus assumes that farmers will make the same decisions
in the case of a 100-year "with" magnitude flood whether it occurs every 100 years or every 8 to 22 years as in the "without" case. This approach implies that vineyard farmers in the Upper Valley repeatedly plant new yineyards every 8 years in some areas, even though vineyards take 4 years to bear fruit. The differential change in return frequency between the lower and upper valleys implies that this "stupid farmer" assumption results in a greater overstatement of benefits in the upper valley versus the lower valley,
In addition, good farm management dictates the construction of levees to protect crops and land investment, yet the Final HBA continues to ignore the existence of these levees in the economic analysis.

LETTER 149

Peter Reinelt
August 23, 2001

149-1 The commenter is correct in noting that the modeling used for Alternatives A and B
uses different assumptions regarding the needed outflows from the Salinas Valley groundwater basin in order to halt seawater intrusion.. The differences result from a
number of minor modifications that have been made since 1998 better to calibrate
the SVIGSM, Because of these differences, and as discussed in section 5.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS, it is not appropriate to compare specific model outputs between Alternatives A and B.

Comparison of the impacts of the two alternatives to baseline conditions indicate that both Alternative A and B will stop seawater intrusion and therefore provide a significant benefit to the Salinas Valley. The EIR hydrologic criteria for meeting the Basin balance objective and seawater intrusion are as follows (DEIR, June 2001, PP 5.3-22 and 53.25):
The hydrologic balance is defined as a zero or positive average annual change in groundwater storage during the simulated 46-year hydrologic cycle.
stopping seawater intrusion is defined as achieving an average monthly seawater intrusion of zero over the simulation period.
Both Alternative A and B meet these criteria. The margin by which each alternative meets the criteria is different. In the case of Alternative B, a larger margin on positive long-term change in storage and subsurface outflow to the Monterey Bay was assumed compared to Alternative A.

Because both Alternative A and B meet these criteria, the Draft EIR/EIS focuses
upon those characteristics that most clearly distinguish the alternatives from one another. These distinguishing characteristics include costs, environmental impacts, different components and facilities, as well as different operational criteria. For example, Alternative B includes a North Valley surface storage facility that is used to store Salinas river water that typically flows to the Bay in the non-irrigation season, and release the stored water during the peak irrigation season for agricultural irrigation use. This diversion does not cause any hit on the reservoirs, however, is shown as a diversion from the Salinas River. The higher diversion rate (approximately 16,100 AFY) under Alternative B includes this component, which is not included in Alternative A. In addition, Alternative B uses the subsurface diversion facilities, which are operated differently than the surface diversion facilities
under Alternative A,

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-731 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

149-2 The commenter is correct in noting that numbers shown in the referenced figures are in error. These errors arise from, among other factors: (1) confusion between data generated by modeling and data reflecting actual flows; and (2) confusion among total releases, releases for conservation purposes, and releases for flood control purposes. The Draft EIR/EIS hydrology section has been revised to correct errors such as these and to present the results of revised modeling that has
been performed since the Draft EIR/EIS was published, as described in Master Response MR-4. See Chapter 3.0 of this document for revised values. These modifications do not change the significance of impacts as expressed in the Draft EIR/EIS.

149-3 The commenter requests additional detail regarding the modeling of recharge in the northern valley. However, the commenter does not explain how, or if, the requested additional detail related to the analysis of significant environmental issue. Moreover, differentiation among the components of the groundwater resource would not meaningfully affect the results of the modeling and project evaluation and are not required for the Draft EIR/EIS. The scale of analysis used for the Draft EIR/EIS is of sufficient detail to allow for identification of the extent and severity of impacts and the patterns of water releases, recharge, and reuse that are likely to result with project implementation.
149-4 The commenter requests differentiation of water flows related to perched aquifers.
Please see response to Comment 149-3.

149-5 The commenter requests additional analysis comparing Alternatives A and B. Please see response to Comment 149-1 and 149-2.
149-6 Please see response to Comment 3-8.
149-7 The assumptions for land and water use used to establish for the "1995 baseline
conditions" have not changed and would not be meaningfully different from year 2002 in terms of the ability of the project to meet objectives. Given the expectation that water use in the Basin is expected to decrease over time, 1995 conditions are considered to represent a conservative baseline.

149-8 The 46-year hydrologic period used in the SVIGSM (October 1948 through September 1994) incorporates both drought and wet season periods and allows for adequate assessment of the impacts of the SVWP under different climatic periods. The hydrologic record for 1995 to the present is also reliable; however, extending the modeling period to the present day would not add climatic stresses that are not already being simulated, and therefore would not add meaningfully to the
simulations.

149-9 This comment discusses the appropriate allocation of the costs of various projects to address seawater intrusion and the history of such efforts; it does not raise any issues regarding the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS. Therefore, no further response is required. AR 02716

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-732 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

149-10 This comment does not raise any issues regarding the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS. Therefore, no further response is required.
149-11 The MCWRA operates the reservoirs toward the goal of meeting all the operating criteria listed on Draft EIR/EIS page 5.5-32 and quoted by the commenter. It is acknowledged that these criteria must be balanced. This is not a contradiction of the quoted statement. The commenter also raises concerns as to the adequacy of the range of alternatives analyzed. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS provide a mix of: (1) reducing demand for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. See Master Response 1
149-12 The commenter raises concerns regarding the adequacy of the alternatives analysis. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS provide a mix of: (1) reducing demand for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. Please see Master Response MR-1. Also, note that the 10% reduction figure from the referenced Project Plan Report was an assumption that was not based on modeling. As described in Master Response MR-1, the 30% to
50% reduction was based on modeling various scenarios of pumping reduction in both the entire Basin and in selected parts of the Basin.
Regarding a reduction in pumping of 50% "…over only ESUs 1 and 3", this area represents 31,000 a irrigated acres and a population in excess of 150,000 people. Ignoring the provision of water for the residents of this area for the moment, the loss in crop value alone would top $130 million per year, using the valuations described in Master Response 1. The related employment effects (job loss/wage loss) and the effects on the economy and potential blight of such a loss would mimic what is described in the Draft EIR/EIS for Alternatives D and E. When the
reduction in water fot residents is factored in, the impact is greater. See, also, Master Response MR-5 regarding the already low per capita water use in this area.
149-13 The commenter raises concerns regarding the adequacy of the alternatives analysis. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS provide a mix of: (1) reducing demand for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. It is not necessary to attempt to quantify the changes in groundwater recharge that could result from different elements of Alternative E. The information presented in the Draft EIR/EIS is sufficient to provide a reasoned basis for comparison of the effects of the alternatives.

149-14 The commenter raises concerns as to the adequacy of the alternatives analysis. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS provide a mix of: (1) reducing demand 5

for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of
pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the LIZZO

Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. Please see Master Response 1.
149-15 The commenter criticizes the range of alternatives. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft EIR/EIS provide a mix of: (1) reducing demand for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. Please see Master Response 1. Selecting the FERC rule curve and increasing Nacimiento Reservoir releases during September and October or modifying the spillway at Nacimiento Reservoir would not halt seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley and therefore would not meet the project objectives. A project to deliver water to the north valley for diversion and groundwater pumping replacement is also needed to meet the goal of halting
seawater intrusion.

149-16 The commenter criticizes the range of alternatives and requests consideration of a
Buena Vista pumping shift alternative. The alternatives analyzed in the Draft
EIR/EIS provide mix of: (1) reducing demand for groundwater supply; (2) substituting a new water supply to be used in lieu of pumped groundwater; and (3) increasing the amount of fresh water entering the Basin by streambed recharge of the aquifer and/or percolation of applied irrigation water. Please see Master Response. In addition, the Buena Vista Pumping Alternative in the 1991 Draft EIR included constructing as many as ten wells. Well perforations were to begin at a depth of approximately 400 feet. Average annual groundwater declines were predicted for both the 180-foot aquifer and the 400-foot aquifer. /

The Buena Vista area is located in the Pressure Subarea. In the Pressure Subarea,
clay layers deposited as part of the geologic process are prevalent. Clay layers overlie ,the 180-foot aquifer and separate the 180-foot aquifer from the 400-foot aquifer. Therefore, recharge of the 400-foot aquifer would not be affective as recharge to the aquifers in the Forebay Subarea.
The Buena Vista Pumping Alternative alone would not halt seawater intrusion in the Salinas Valley. Since the 1991 Draft EIR was published, new wells have been constructed at or in close proximity to the proposed well sites. Since ground surface elevations adjacent to the Salinas River in the Buena Vista area are in the range of 60 to 80 feet above mean sea level, extractions from a well perforated at a depth greater than 400 feet would be removing water from an aquifer located below mean sea level, which, with time, has the potential to become subject to sea water intrusion.
149-17 The commenter contends that a second threshold of significance should be used for
evaluating project effects on groundwater levels but does not specify why the threshold that was used in the Draft EIR/EIS (changes in average annual groundwater levels) should not be considered adequate. The threshold of significance used for the analysis of groundwater effects is an appropriate measure
for determining impact significance and comparing the effects of different
alternatives. Variability in groundwater levels would not constitute a valid threshold,
AR 02718

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-734 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

* as such variability occurs under most conditions, and any particular variation is not necessarily indicative of a trend.
149-18 The commenter raises concerns as to the justification of the threshold of significance for increased groundwater levels. The threshold of significance on regional groundwater levels was established based on study of historical fluctuations in the groundwater levels in each subarea. Although there will be variation valley wide, this amount of increase was selected as representative value of the amount of increase in ground levels that would affect crop production.

149-19 See responses to Comments 149-1, 149-2, and 149-3.
149-20 The commenter requests additional detail regarding the monthly storage in the reservoirs. However, the commenter does not explain how, or if, the requested additional detail related to the analysis of : significant environmental issue. Moreover, the additional requested detail would not meaningfully affect the results of the modeling and project evaluation and are not required for the Draft EIR/EIS. The scale of analysis used for the Draft EIR/EIS is of sufficient detail to allow for
identification of the extent and severity of impacts and the patterns of water releases,
recharge, and reuse that are likely to result with project implementation. However, please see response to Comment 19-22.
149-21 The commenter requests "equivalent graphs with reservoir levels in feet." Such additional detail would not add meaningful analysis to the Draft EIR/EIS. The scale of analysis used for the Draft EIR/EIS is of sufficient detail to allow for
identification of the extent and severity of impacts and the patterns of water releases, recharge, and reuse that are likely to result with project implementation.
149-22 The commenter requests additional support for the conclusion that increases in groundwater levels would not result in problems to the root zone. The analysis of changes in groundwater level on root zone is based on the depth to water in the Upper Valley and Forebay Subareas. The average depth to water in the Upper Valley Subarea has been estimated as 50 feet and that in the Forebay subarea as 110 feet. At the same time, the root zone for most of the crops in these areas is anywhere from 1 to 3 feet below land surface. Therefore, the 0.5- to 2.0-foot change in groundwater level would not constitute a significant impact on the crop root zone.
149-23 The commenter raises concerns as to whether the modeling weighted annual groundwater levels. The average groundwater levels shown in for each subarea are weighted by geographic distribution of pumping. These weights are used in similar
form in all subareas. In addition, the geographic distributions of the weights are the same between the Baseline conditions and the Baseline plus Alternative. As a result,
the weighting method does not affect the relative impact of the Alternative on the groundwater level.
149-24 The commenter requests average monthly groundwater elevation analysis and graphs for each of the four subareas so that landowners can analyze the effect of the project on the seasonal timing of groundwater extraction. However, additional detail would %

not meaningfully affect the results of the modeling and project evaluation and are not required for the Draft EIR/EIS. The scale of analysis used for the Draft EIR/EIS is of sufficient detail to allow for identification of the extent and severity of impacts and the patterns of water releases, recharge, and reuse that are likely to result with project implementation.
149-25 Maps are not necessary for the presentation of the Draft EIR/EIS because tables and text adequately describe potential changes in groundwater levels. This comment does not raise any issues pertaining to the adequacy of the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS. Therefore, no further response is required.
149-26 The commenter raises questions as to whether the MCWRP is fully operational. The
MCWRP is fully operational. The commenter does not explain how this would affect significant environmental issue. As a result, no further response is possible.
149-27 The commenter states that the history of MCWRP raises concerns regarding the adequacy of water quality studies supporting the Draft EIR/EIS. However, the commenter provides no specifics as to the elements of the water quality studies supporting the Draft EIR/EIS that present concerns. Therefore, no further response is possible.
149-28 As noted in Master Response 1, the MCWRA has modeled impacts on a valley-wide basis. 1995 baseline assumptions for groundwater pumping and CSIP deliveries are shown in Table 1-2 and include 13,300 AFY of CSIP deliveries. Those assumptions apply to zones 2 and 2B alike. CSIP deliveries in the 2000/2001 water year totaled 11,000 AF. Deliveries from CSIP have increased each year since it became operational in 1998. Thus, 13,300 AFY delivery is reasonable to assume.
149-29 The commenter raises expresses concern with the analysis of water quality. The commenter does not explain why use of data from 1975 to 1978 is unacceptable
when such data is the only data available and therefore no response is possible for
this portion of the comment. The commenter also suggests that Blanco drain water
be included in the analysis. However, as shown page 5.4-16, it is estimated that the maximum TDS and nitrate concentrations for water from the Blanco drain would
still meet applicable water quality standards. For this reason, the Draft EIR/EIS concludes that the Blanco drain would have no adverse impact on water quality at the diversion pond. Table 5.4-9 presents the estimated water quality based on the projected blend ratio for future (current plus project) conditions.
149-30 The commenter raises concern with the absence of future water quality calculations. Table 5.4-9 of the Draft EIR/EIS presents the estimated water quality based on the projected blend ratio for future (current plus project) conditions.
149-31 The commenter raises concerns regarding the adequacy of the flood control analysis. The purpose of the flood analysis is to determine if a high flow under the Baseline
condition would increase to exceed channel capacity under the Baseline plus Alternative. The Commenter's suggestion to consider all flood flows is not

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-736 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

reasonable, because reduction of flood flows below historical conditions is not one
of the proposed project's goals.
149-32 The commenter suggests that the flood control analysis should include all possible events. See response to Comment 149-31.
149-33 The commenter raises concerns with regard to the analysis of growth inducement. Please refer to Master Response MR-3.

149-34 The commenter requests Figure 3-3 from the 1998 DEIR replace Figure 1-1 in the Draft EIR/EIS. The MCWRA respectfully disagrees, as the current schematic is
more accurate in the depiction of seawater intrusion.
149-35 The commenter states that the analysis of growth inducement is inadequate. Please
see Master Response MR-3.•

149-36 The commenter states that subsection 2.2.1 does not explain that reoperation will increase the frequency and magnitude of drought conditions. Drought conditions will not increase since drought is a function of precipitation and not groundwater levels. The frequency of water level changes in the Upper Valley as a result of the Alternative A analysis will not exceed the 10-foot threshold and therefore is not a
significant impact.
149-37 The commenter states that the Draft EIR/EIS is inconsistent as to the description of the relationship between the Fort Ord Subarea and the Salinas groundwater basin. Based on most geologic reports, the Fort Ord Subarea is not considered as part of the main Salinas groundwater Basin. However, the inflow from Fort Ord shown on the groundwater balance schematics represent the boundary flows from the Fort Ord Subarea as simulated by the SVIGSM.

149-38 The commenter sates that the preferred project would result in a greater frequency
and magnitude of and frequency of drought conditions. Please see response to
Comment 149-36.

149-39 The commenter states that there is an inconsistency in the description of the increased amount of water that will be released. The 29,000 AFY of additional water being available for release as result of reoperation is different than the 30,000 AFY value. The 30,000 AFY value refers to the statement on page 3-11 that compares the
difference in releases between 95 baseline conditions and the 95 SVWP. Please see
Master Response MR-1.
149-40 The commenter is correct in noting that the Draft EIR/EIS in Table 1-2 shows an assumed decrease in agricultural pumping by 2030 of 60,000 AFY and in Chapter 3
cites an expected decrease of 51,700 AFY. The EIR/EIS is in error in presenting two different values, but neither value can be identified as "correct" at this time, as 5 both represent predictions of the amount of change in agricultural pumping that will take place in the next 25+ years. The value used in the hydrologic modeling is 60,000 AFY. The amount of assumed change in future agricultural groundwater, 02721

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-737 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

whether it is 60,000 AFY or 51,700 AFY, is approximately 12-15% of the total amount of groundwater pumping anticipated for the Basin in 2030.
The difference between the two numbers is not meaningful in terms of the conclusions of the EIR/EIS analysis regarding the operation of the project in 2030. The EIR/EIS acknowledges that the modeling performed using the SVIGSM, like all modeling, involves uncertainty. The estimate of future agricultural groundwater
pumping is one of numerous assumptions about future conditions that was incorporated into the evaluation and modeling; assumptions were also made, for example, about future population growth and urban water demand in the Salinas Valley, hydrology (patterns of wet and dry ycars), and regional economic trends. The assumptions are reasonable expectations of future trends based on historical records and predictive tools used by planning agencies. However, all are merely informed predictions, and their correlation with actual values cannot be assured, but can be
determined only through direct observation and measurement over time. Under
SVWP implementation, reservoir operations would need to be refined based on real-
time observations and measurements of hydrologic conditions. The success of the
SVWP to halt seawater intrusion in 2030 would be determined based on these
measurements, rather than modeled conditions. Given these factors, it is sufficient
to indicate that the reductions in agricultural groundwater pumping in 2030 will be on the order of 51,700-60,000 AFY.

149-41 The commenter states that the subsection entitled "Preferred Delivery System omits
the 1995 baseline amount of supplemental pumping of groundwater wells. The purpose of this subsection is to provide a contrast with the following subsection, which does provide the 1995 baseline amount of supplemental pumping of groundwater wells.

149-42 Please see response to Comment 149-2 and 149-3. The correct value is 10,300 AFY.

149-43 Please see response to comment 149-36.

149-44 The commenter's quotation from the Draft EIR/EIS is inaccurate. The commenter
asks for the year of the most recent land use data, and whether that data is
considered part of "hydrologic-based issues." The MCWRA relied upon a number of different sources for land use data, including, but not limited to, the North County Land Use Plan (1993) and California Department of Conservation's reports from the year 2000. The term "hydrologic-based issues" generally refers to issues
related to hydrology including, where appropriate, land use issues.
149-45 The commenter states that Figure 5.1-2 is incorrect with respect to current land usage especially vineyard lands. However, the commenter does not provide any explanation as to why the figure is incorrect. As a result, it is not possible to respond
further.

149-46 The commenter states that there are inconsistent descriptions of the amount of outflow to the ocean. 242,000 AFY is a historical flow value. 238,400 is a simulated baseline outflow used for modeling. AR 02722

149-47 The commenter questions whether the 1949 to 1994 study period is adequate. See responses to Comments 149-7 and 149-8.

149-48 The commenter states that, on page 5.3-11, the text should read "Since 1997, the
SVIGSM…" rather than "Since 1977, the SVIGSM..." The commenter is correct
that the year should read 1997.
149-49 The commenter requests clarification of different descriptions of the scope of the seawater intrusion problem. As stated on page 5.3-25, the 10,000 AFY average annual rate of seawater intrusion is based on the 46-year hydrologic period whereas the values in Table 1-2 refer to the baseline conditions.

149-50 The commenter asks whether Figures 5.3-22 and 5.3-23 show the location of the front 46 years into the future. The referenced figures present the results after 46
years into the future. The purpose of the figures is to present the differences between the baseline modeled condition and the SVWP for comparison purposes
149-51 The commenter states that the Figure 5.3-24's reference to Alternative B is incorrect. Figure 5.3-24 correctly states that it describes Alternative B.
149-52 The commenter requests clarification between the description of the basin outflow to the ocean on page 1-7 and page 5.3-47. The correct value is 249,000 AFY for the Salinas River outflow to the ocean.

149-53 The commenter requests clarification between the description of the scope of seawater intrusion on page 5.3-62 of the Draft EIR/EIS (10,000 AFY) and Table 1-2 of the Draft EIR/EIS (1,400 AFY). The confusion arises from the fact that page 5.3-62 refers to the total approximate increase, rather than the incremental increase beyond baseline.

149-54 The commenter states that the description of current uses of groundwater does not include the blending of water to improve water quality. This comment is noted.
149-55 The commenter suggests that the EIS/EIR conclusions regarding availability of the
recreational fishery at Camp Roberts are flawed. This issue is discussed is in the
EIS/EIR on page 5.6-51 and in Master Response MR-7.

149-56 The commenter requests clarification as to the Ford Ord's relationship to the basin. See response to Comment 149-37..

149-57 The commenter notes that flood flows less than 1000 cfs are omitted. Flows less
than 1000 cfs are not shown due to limitation on graph scale and because they would not meaningfully affect the results of the modeling

Gentlemen:
am in receipt of your letter dated June 26, 2001 regarding a proposed project, which will involve Lake Nacimiento and the spillway operation. Your Environmental Impact
Report should address and provide mitigation to the following items.

1 If it is possible that you would implement only 1 or 2 of the six elements of the proposed plan implement, it is conceivable that they partially would be tremendously adverse to the operation of Lake Nacimiento. would like 150-1
to be assured that should your project be passed as a complete plan and a comprehensive alatable release plan bé made for Nacimiento. A partial implementation could be disastrous.

2. Throughout the last 20 years the progressive historical filling and lowering of Lake Nacimiento has taken on relatively pleasing pattern to those who use Lake Nacimiento for recreation. In essence, the lake level is maintained, generally, through July 4.and then slowly lowered through Labor Day and then down to the flood level after Labor Day. The 150-2
fluctuation averages 30' to 40' per year. Is it possible that by this new proposal that the fluctuation would greatly exceed that 30' or 40'? Also, is it possible that the draw down for the lake would occur much earlier through the recreational season that it does now? Rapid depletion would •• damage lake users. v*

It is my understanding that you anticipate the lake operation to produce levels approximately 26' lower than historic levels. | do not understand what times of the year or what this specifically means. It is impossible to state either an approval or disapproval for this element of the plan with 150-3 such sparse information.

3. The impact on Läke Nacimiento is recognized to be major. It seems that for a similar expenditure and for a greater increase in overall value, that a back up reservoir could be installed above Lake Nacimiento to provide for

AR 02725

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-740 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

a majority of the flood control operations as well as additional waters. l would think this would be one item well worth investigating in the 150-3
Environmental Impact Report. In your letter you stated that there would (cont'd)
be "unavoidable, significant impacts occurring to visual and recreational resources at Lake Nacimiento'. Perhaps the Environmental Impact Report could address the resulting financial losses for those lake users that have invested significant sums of money into their facilities for the 150-4
lake use. am certain that if the lake becomes a "mudhole" that property values would plummet and the Monterey County Water Resources Agency would be responsible to make up any differential by changing the chartered use of the water. This item should be well addressed in the Environmental Impact Report.

4. Those of us who have contracted to purchase water from Lake Nacimiento (on availability whether or not we are able to use it) could be deprived of some of the allocated water rights. How does the proposal 150-5
plan to mitigate or compensate for less water in the reservoir if there is less water.
can recall supporting the installation of power generated turbines at Lake Nacimiento Dam. In my file, I have in writing, a statement from the Monterey County Water Resources 'Agency that says that water releases NOT be done solely for the purpose of generating power and that the operation of the dam would NOT CHANGE •because of the installation of 150-6
the turbines. However, over the past few years we have been notified that releases are taking place in order to keep the turbines running and that the releases are not required for ground water replenishment. believe that this time your intentions and total procedure should be made abundantly clear, legal and binding So that no similar adverse effects could occur as a result of your proposed project.

5. I am certain that other issues will arise as they are discussed.
These questions need to be thoroughly addressed and answered. understanding that E.I.R. copies are available at It is my
a selected sites through Monterey 150-7
County and even as far as Paso Robles. It is very inconvenient for me, as a property owner and recreational lake user, to get to those areas to read the extensive report.

Spindler Engineering Corporation July 16, 2001

150-1 For purposes of identifying different elements of project operations in the Draft EIR/EIS, the MCWRA has described the SVWP in terms of its components. However, the SVWP consists of all of these components as a whole, which were developed to operate in concert to meet project objectives. •The project has been analyzed in its entirety; partial implementation of the project would not meet the project objectives and is not contemplated.
150-2 The proposed reoperation is projected, based on modeling, to entail declines in average monthly Nacimiento Reservoir surface elevations of 4 to 17 feet, compared to baseline conditions. See revised Tables 5.8-5 and 5.8-6 in Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS, which present the results of revised modeling of baseline and Alternative A operations showing average monthly surface elevations. See also Figures 1-12 in response to Comment 22, which show the modeled monthly surface elevations for
each year of the simulation period.
150-3 Permitting requirements and environmental considerations make infeasible the consideration of construction of a second dam upstream of Nacimiento Dam. Such an alternative would result in increased impacts to steelhead, as overall system releases would likely be less due to the need to impound more water. Other biological resources would be adversely affected at any location where a new a
impoundment would occur upstream of Nacimiento, and other, unknown impacts would be likely given the magnitude of such an improvement. Further, it is not known if this alternative would impound sufficiently more water such that it could operate the project, given the overall limitations of the watershed. Given these very likely constraints, this alternative is likely to be infeasible. Without additional details and recommendations, no further response on feasibility can be provided.
Alternatives to the proposed project that were previously considered include construction of new reservoirs on rivers in Chalone Canyon or Arroyo Seco. These alternatives were eliminated from further consideration over time because of issues
related to cost, environmental impacts, and/or technical feasibility. Please tefer to Master Response MR-8 for a detailed discussion of the alternatives previously considered by MCWRA to halt seawater intrusion.

Nacimiento and San Antonio dams for flood protection and groundwater recharge.
The MCWRA has been granted the right to beneficial use of the water captured behind the dams by the SWRCB, which reacknowledged this right in a recent decision (Application 30532). The proposed reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs are consistent with the MCWRA's water right license and would not constitute changing of the "chartered use" of the water.
150-5 See response to Comment 150-4 regarding the MCWRA's water rights. Individual contracts that landowners around Nacimiento Reservoir hold for the use of reservoir water pertain to water that is within the San Luis Obispo County entitlement of 17,500 AFY. The San Luis Obispo County entitlement would not be affected by any changes proposed under the SVWP. See Master Response MR-10.
150-6 The Draft EIR/EIS describes the proposed operations of the SVWP. No further response is necessary as no specific issucs are raised concerning the environmental analysis.

150-7 The Draft EIR/EIS has been published on the MCWRA's website (www.co.monterey.ca.us/mewra) and is available for purchase from MCWRA. The Response to Comments documents will also be available for purchase from
MCWRA.

In compliance with CEQA regulations, the Draft EIR/EIS was distributed to a long list of agencies, as well as to number of organizations. It was submitted to the
California Office of Planning and Research (State Clearinghouse), which distributed the document to selected State agencies. A notice was also published in the Federal Register pursuant to NEPA regulations and the document was sent to the U.S. EPA for distribution to Federal agencics. In addition, the San. Luis Obispo County Planning Department received four copies of the document for review, the Paso Robles Library received four copies, various homeowner associations around the lake received copies, the County Public Works Department (Hydrology Section) received three copies, and the City of San Luis Obispo (Utilities Department) received a copy. In addition, informational meetings were held at the Salinas Valley Fairgrounds in King City on July 10; 2001 and in Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County) on July 30, 2001. A formal public hearing on the document was held at MCWRA'S offices in the City of Salinas on August 1, 2001. The public review period started June 8, 2001 and ended August 28, 2001 complying with all public
review requirements.

RE: Salinas Valley Water Project Comments

Dear Mr. Meyer,
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Directors and the Community of Oak Shores. Our Community Assn. goes on record that it does not accept the Salinas Valley Water Project position that there have to be "unavoidable significant impacts to the visual and recreational resources at Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs as a result of the short-and the long-term project operations" as stated in your SVWP EIR Draft Report.
It is very disturbing to the people all around the lake to see the promoters of this project attempting to run roughshod over their rights without due consideration for their lives.
The lake level at Nacimiento can and should be managed at levels that will maximize solving the needs of the people in the Salinas Valley without damaging the interests of the people who live at the lake and depend on it for their well being. Your existing proposal to severely drop the lake levels will be extremely damaging to our community. 151-1

There is much more at stake for many people at the lake than just recreation. There are serious economic and environmental factors that demand your due consideration. Your agency and report handles the communities at the lake as if they were something that you can write off, as an unavoidable loss in order to solve the water needs of Monterey County. This is not acceptable, nor is it responsible mänagement,
Our community goes on record to state that it is imperative that you do not approve any re-operation of the Nacimiento Lake that doesn't provide for the rightful interests and representation of the people in San Luis Obispo County directly or indirectly affected by your Salinas Valley Water Project.

The scheduling for releasing water from reoperated Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs would result in additional variation in surface elevations compared with existing conditions. This would result in significant and unavoidable visual impacts at both reservoirs. This impact will need to be considered in light of the project and its benefits and the operational priorities of the reservoirs.

Re: Comments on Draft Environmental Impact Report/EnVironmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley, Water Project

Dear Mr. Smith:
California Water Service Company (Cal Water) would like to thank the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for the opportunity to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR/DEIS) for the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). Cal Water, in its capacity as the largest water purveyor in the Salinas Valley, has been providing water service to Salinas and King City since 1962. Cal
Water's service area comprises over 29,000 service connections and a population in a excess of 115,000 persons. We've been an active participant in the ongoing efforts to
address the complicated water supply conditions of the Salinas Valley for many years.
Cal Water fully supports the MCWRA's objectives of: (1) stopping seawater intrusion (2) providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future (year 2030) needs and (3) improving the hydrologic balance of the groundwater basin in the Salinas Valley. We are pleased that a proposed alternative has been developed to deal with these objectives. We are concerned, however, that the preferred alternative (alternative A) on its own falls short of addressing all of the requirements set before the MCWRA by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). The urgency of these requirements was reinforced by the SWRCB when in 1996, as a separate action, stated that it considered the problems facing the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin to be one of "the most critical water resources issues in California". With this in mind, we are forwarding
the following comments:

AR 02731

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-746 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE COMPANY

T

1. DELIVERY OPTIONS The DEIR/DEIS discusses a preferred alternative, which is similar in many aspects to a proposed project described in the 1998 SVWP DEIR. While the project has been revised to include a surface water diversion facility (in lieu of subsurface diversion), it continues to* address both short-term 'and long-term
solutions to agricultural sectors only, with no urban deliveries. Cal Water 152-1
believes that all delivery options must include water for Salinas. As stated in our comments to the 1998 DEIR, water supplied to Salinas should be viewed as having a dual benefit, serving to help mitigate seawater intrusion, as well as providing an alternative source of water that will help urban water purveyors comply with the ever-changing, stringent water quality regulations associated with groundwater pumping.

2. NITRATES
Nitrate contamination continues to worsen in the Salinas Valley and poses a serious threat to domestic water supplies. In Salinas, we currently have 6 wells out of service due to nitrate contamination and we continue to experience
escalating levels in others. We are currently working closely with our consultants to help determine favorable locations for new well sites and continue to explore the most feasible and cost effective treatment methods for nitrate contamination. 152-2

Either option will come at a significant cost to our ratepayers. In King City, out of 8 wells are out of production due to nitrate contamination. It is stated in the DEIR/DEIS that the purpose of the preferred action is to "provide for the long-term management and protection of groundwater resources in the basin." Urban water purveyors need a long-term, reliable sourcé of water and should not be excluded in any water delivery project.

3. ADDITIONAL WATER DELIVERIES TO THE CASTROVILLE
SEAWATER INTRUSION PROJECT
Cal Water is concerned that additional water deliveries to the Castroville
Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) only may raise water levels in the CSIP area above sea level. * While this seems like the intended goal, we believe there is a potential danger from the resulting hydraulic mound. Elevated groundwater levels created by the reduction of pumping by the supplemental wells may act in 152-3
conjunction with the apparently lower groundwater levels in the greater Salinas area to accelerate or push a portion of the intruded seawater in the 180' aquifer. towards Salinas. This may result in worsening the seawater intrusion condition by increasing its rate of advancement, thus rendering currently useable potable supplies unfit for use sooner than previously anticipated. Improperly abandoned wells with perforations in both the 180' and 400' aquifers will only exacerbate the
problem.

4. SALINAS RIVER RECHARGE, CONVEYANCE & DIVERSION
The DEIR/DEIS states that the preferred project would provide an average of
29,000 acre-feet per year (AFY) of additional water for release to the Salinas River. Of that amount, approximately 9,700 AFY of water will be available 152-4
behind the dam downstream of Spreckels for delivery to agricultural users in the CSIP area. The plan proposes no way to control groundwater pumping upstream of the diversion, so no mechanism exists to guarantee the continued deliveries of 29,000 AFY to the project area and ultimately, 9,700 AFY for diversion for the CSIP project.

IN SUMMARY

(1) The preferred alternative contains no component for urban water deliveries.
(2) Nitrate contamination continues to degregate urban water supplies. A long-term
reliable water source is needed.

(3) Additional water deliveries and a reduction in pumping in the CSIP area will create a mounding effect, which has the potential of accelerating the intruded seawater landward.

(4) It contains no guarantee that 29,000 AFY will be available for conveyance and
distribution.

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the DEIR/DEIS for the SVWP. Addressing the complex issues and needs of all water users is the key to our success and longevity. Should you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to call me at (408) 367-8243.

LETTER 152

California Water Service Company
August 1, 2001

152-1 Alternative A proposes to deliver surface water to agricultural users only, at least in the near-term. While urban areas would not receive water directly, the groundwater basin for agricultural and urban areas is the same. Thus, the problem of halting seawater intrusion, the project's primary objective, is accomplished whether the deliveries are to agricultural or urban areas. Because an existing delivery system to®
agricultural areas is already in place, it is logical to maximize the economic benefit of using this existing infrastructure rather than adding several million dollars in cost. In the future, if expansion of the delivery system is needed, consideration will be given to deliveries to urban areas. As to the desire of the commenter to solve Salinas
groundwater regulatory issues, the project is intended to benefit the entire groundwater basin and is not directed at any single jurisdiction. Thus, the interests of one locality can not take precedence over overall project feasibility.
152-2 Please see responses to Comments 20-27 and 152-1.
152-3 Based on the results of the SVIGSM and presented in Figures 5.3-26 and 5.3-27, it is unlikely that the SVWP would result in a hydraulic mound that would push intruded seawater toward Salinas. There is no evidence to support that a such a mound would occur and none has been submitted in any comments, other than as a general
concern.

152-4 If pumping upstream of the diversion were to increase substantially in the future, thereby inducing greater recharge from the Salinas River, then the project yield could potentially be affected: The increase in pumpage would impact reservoir elevations by causing an increase in releases to meet diversion requirements and the increase in
recharge from the stream channel as a result of an increase in pumpage upstream of the diversion. At this point in time, a substantial increase in pumpage upstream of
the diversion is not expected to occur for irrigation purposes within the Salinas Valley. Please see also, Master Response MR-1 concerning delivery of 29,000 AFY.

153-1 The Draft EIR/EIS included an analysis of short-term (e.g., construction-generated) emissions. Please refer to pages 5.11-14 through 5.11-18 of the Draft EIR/EIS. To reduce short-term impacts to regional air quality, the Draft EIR/EIS included mitigation measures recommended by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (APCD) and the San Luis Obispo County APCD for the control of short-term emissions. Implementation of these measures would reduce short-term emissions by approximately 5 to 80 percent, depending on the pollutant of concern and the individual measure employed. However, predicted "worst-case" controlled emissions would likely remain above applicable thresholds and could potentially have a significant impact on regional air quality. As stated in the Draft EIR/EIS, short-term construction-generated emissions attributable to the proposed project would be considered significant and unavoidable.
153-2 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project effects on
property values near Nacimiento Reservoir.
153-3 Please see Master Response MR-2 and Section 5.9 of the Draft EIR/EIS concerning
recreation impacts.
Impacts to visual resources resulting from the proposed project are presented in Section 5.8 of the Draft EIR/EIS.
153-4 No response is necessary as no environmental issues are raised.

Dear Sirs:
The South Shore Village Club, Lake Nacimiento, CA strongly objects tö both the proposed action and the lack of substance in the subject documentation. The proposed action to halt seawater intrusion has been selected by the MCWRA from five "picked" alternatives that do not promise or indicate splution (e.g., the proposed action mentions an expanded distribution system for diverted Salinas River water (s] in the 154-1
future if monitoring indicates that seawater intrusion has not been halted"). The proposed action does not call for maximizing the collecting /saving of river walers, nor conservation programs for irrigation and other municipal naeds. "Reoperation" of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs appears to be under the discretion of the MCWRA, which has in the past exhibited ineptness.
The proposed action and the DEIR/DEIS do not adequately address: 1) Severe droughts
2) Severe flooding 3) Wasted water and/or river waters flowing into Monterey Bay.
It appears to the South Shore Village Club that special interest groups in the northemn Salinas Valley have assisted in the preparation of these alternate plans and the DEIR/DEIS; and that the proposed action will be very detrimental to Nacimiento and San Antonio users and environment.
The South Shore Village Club recommends that proposed courses of action (solution) be investigated that are of mutual benefit, long term, and conserve river waters.

154-1 The commenter's opposition to the proposed project is noted. The SVWP has a long history and the project components presented and evaluated in the Draft EIR/EIS have evolved from and represent the culmination of years of planning, engineering, and public involvement. Please refer to Master Response MR-8 for a detailed discussion of the alternatives previously considered by MCWRA to halt seawater intrusion. Please see Master Response MR-5 regarding conservation.
154-2 The Draft EIR/EIS addresses cach of the issues listed by the commenter with regard to the impacts of the SVWP in comparison with baseline conditions. The modeling performed for the project is based on the hydrologic record of October 1948 through September 1994, which includes historical drought (including severe drought) periods. Therefore, the model results presented in the Draft EIR/EIS account for operations during droughts. See also response to Comment 20-3.
Flooding is addressed in Section 5.3, beginning on page 5.3-32 in the Draft
EIR/EIS.

The Draft EIR/EIS compares river outflow to Monterey Bay under SVWP operations compared to baseline conditions. Please see page 5.3-17 of the Draft EIR/EIS. As to "wasted water" flowing into Monterey Bay, this water is essential to maintaining the bay/river ecosystem. Please see Section 5.6 of the Draft EIR/EIS.

Dear Mr. Smith:

I have just read DEIR/DEIS Draft. As a property owner at Lake Nacimiento (Town Creek), and an owner of several rental (income) properties in Paso Robles, I have grave concern with the proposed plan.
The modification of the spillway looks like a good idea and should give both 155-1 • counties a good return on the investment.
The re-operation portion of the plan looks to me to be one sided in the Northern Salinas Valley interest only. San Luis Obispo County, Paso Robles and Lake Nacimiento property owners would suffer a great loss financially and environmentally. This plan would turn an ideal recreational area into a reservoir for the farmers of Monterey County to use as they wish. 155-3

You need to come up with a better plan to serve the people, not just the few.

Re: Draft EIR/EIS
Salinas Valloy Water Project Monterey County, Califomia

Dear Sirs:
This letter is on behalf of 66 property owners and/or renters of Oak Bay Condominiums located on Heritage Ranch to San Luis Obispo County, Please let this letter serve as a partial list of concems we have with the above draft eovironmental impact report for Lake Nacimiento.
To say we are dissatisfied with the "avoidable significant impacts to occur to visual and recreational resources at Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs as a result of short- and long- term project operations" is unacceptable.
We believe there are opportunities to avoid this irreparable damage to our reservoirs and hope to work with Monterey County in order to facilitate positive remediation to halt seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley groundwater basin.
The draft EIR is woefully inadequate and needs to address the following:
1. Bald Eagle Nesting Areas: Lowering Lake Nacimiento during thé recreation season of 16 to 28 feet will decimate the area that bas become a reserve for nesting bald eagles since 156-1
they were an endangered species. This has also become home to Golden Eagles and Osprey,

2. The inability to launch boats from the Heritage Ranch marina will add greatly to the traffic impacts at Nacimiento's main marina as well as require additional areas for boat 156-2 trailers and other vehicles. This has not been addressed.
3. Modification of the spillway at Nacimiento Dam and reservoir reoperation. 156-3

4. There must be an economic component to this report. If the primary reason for selecting Altemate A is because it is several million dollars less expensive to Monterey County than Alternatives B, C or D, then the monetary loss to SLO County must be given equal
attention.

Salinas Valley Water Projecr 2-756 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties are partners. Partners do not decimate one at the expense of the other. SLO County and the City of Paso Robles stand to lose millions through loss in property devaluations, tourism, business revenues, and an unquantifiable level of scenic and pristine quality of life. Many of us retired here and are unable to pick up and start over.
Unavoidable negative impacts are Acts of God. Man-made negative impacts are because man chooses not to use the brains God gave him. Together, we will provide a better way to mitigate or 156-4

minimize the issues.
Oak Bay Condominiums Association alone has spent $104,000+ replacing it's existing 32 docks over the last three years. The proposed action makes our recent efforts and money wasted as the docks will be on dry land when needed most. This equates to inverse condemnation of our property without compensation. Unlike the retired populace, many of us will sell and leave the
area.

The EIR does not address the adverse impact this action makes to our unique diversity at Heritage Ranch. The cultural and economic mix is special. We are: Rich, middle-class, and poor Retired, fishermen, and recreational enthusiasts 156-5
Black, white, and brown. This all but insures that those who can afford to leave, will. If this is the political answer to
affordable housing, it fails. Those left will be hard-pressed to make up the monetary difference
necessary to sustain its environment.
The current scenario provides that Salinas Valley property owners trump the livelihood of SLO County property owners. This is unacceptable. Why should Salinas Valley property owners have the avoidable significant impacts. The issues are created by Monterey County and continue to be
fostered by poor conservation methods and additional growth allotments.
Again, we want to work with you to find better altematives. Please give us the opportunity.

156-1 Please refer to Response to Comment 24-10 for information on potential effects to terrestrial wildlife in the vicinity of Nacimiento Reservoir. Please refer to Response
to Comment 2-10 for information on potential effects to bald eagles.
156-2 It is acknowledged that the project may require greater use of the main boat ramps at Nacimiento. This is an existing condition (if it occurs) during low water conditions. That said, even if these ramps were to become crowded, the crowding
(or "traffic impacts" as referred by the commenter) is not an environmental impact.
Also, please see Master Response MR-2 regarding recreation mitigation.

156-3 The commenter is not clear regarding the need to address modification of the spillway and reoperation of the reservoir. These issues are addressed throughout the Draft EIR/EIS. Because specific environmental issues are not raised, no other
response can be provided.
156-4 Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on
the local economy and property values near Nacimiento Reservoir. In addition, please see Master Response MR-2 regarding consideration of mitigation for recreation and Master Response MR-4 and Chapter 3.0 regarding changes to the
hydrology analysis which show less of a strain on reservoir elevations than reported in the Draft EIR/EIS, although the impact is still considered significant.

156-5 As described in response to Comment 130-9, the proposed project would not have any disproportionate impacts to minority communities. The community surrounding Lake Nacimiento does not meet the criteria used when considering
whether a community may be subject to environmental justice impacts. Therefore,
there are no significant environmental justice impacts.

Attention: Mr. Robert Smith
Regulatory Branch

Subject: Comments on the Draft Environmental Impact Report Environmental Impact Statement - Salinas Water Project
SCH.#2000034007.

Dear Mr. Smith:.
The Paso Robles Chamber of Commerce has taken great interest in the Salinas Valley Water Project. The Chamber supports a resolution to the seawater intrusion problem and supports adequate water supplies for urban and agricultural needs.
The role of the Chamber of Commerce is to promote the best interests of our Chamber members and the business community. The Paso Robles Chamber of Commerce, in particular, is very sensitive to the agricultural industry having many members who depend upon agriculture for their livelihood. In addition, we are strong advocates for businesses in our area that are supported by recreation and tourism. We are greatly concerned with the impacts of the Salinas Valley Water Project on the members of the Chamber of Commerce, the business community as a whole, and for the City of Paso Robles. Based on our review of the EIR/EIS, it is clear that significant impacts will result in the implementation of this project as proposed. These impacts have been clearly identified in the EIR as significant 157-1

unmitigatable impacts, both to recreation and to the visual component of the lakes. 1n our opinion, these impacts will have a significant economic impact on our community. We are greatly disturbed that the EIR/EIS offers neither mitigation nor quantification of these impacts. While this may not be considered an environmental impact, it is socio- economic impact that cannot be ignored. It is therefore vital that these impacts be quantified, and that an economic impact analysis be performed to determine actual economic impacts on the community of Paso Robles and the County of San Luis Obispo.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-759 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

( We would appreciate i response to the following three comments:
1.: Due to the potential for'significant economic impacts to occur as a result of this project, the Chamber of Commerce of Paso Robles respectfully requests that an 157-1
economic impact analysis be prepared on this project, and that the projèct not proceed untit this economic impact information has been presented to the public.
2. We request that the project proponents demonstrate that the proposed project will actually solve the saltwater intrusion problem, 157-2

3. If the proposed project is successful in solving the, saltwater intrusion problem, what restrictions will be put in place to prevent future water users from continuing to overdraft the aquifer and thereby perpetuate the problem?. 157-3

We appreciate the opportunity to comment.

157-1 The MCWRA acknowledges the socioeconomic impacts that would be expected to result from the project and has for years sought solution to the problem of seawater intrusion that would both halt the intrusion and result in minimal adverse
effects elsewhere. In all the years of trying, no solution has arisen that is acceptable to all community interests, economically feasible, and/or has the ability to receive environmental permits. While a number of commendable suggestions have been provided through comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, no feasible alternative to the
project has been raised that would avoid the impacts to lake users and meet the
project objectives. Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of project impacts on the local economy near Nacimiento Reservoir, Master Response MR-2 for a discussion of mitigation measures related to recreation, and Master Responses MR-1, MR-4, and Chapter 3.0 for a discussion of a revised
hydrology analysis that shows less of an impact (though still significant) to lake levels.

157-2 A description of the effects of the SVWP on seawater intrusion is presented on page 5.3-25 of the Draft EIR/EIS. See response to Comment 114-4 regarding modeling assumptions and degree of certainty in predicting future conditions.
157-3 In areas where project water is delivered, ground water pumping would be limited to peaking capacity and deliveries during droughts.

Also, water needs in the Salinas Basin are projected to decrease by 17,000 acre-feet per year in the year 2030. At that time, drawdown impacts on the reservoirs would be somewhat less than in the near term, as described in several sections of the Draft
EIR/EIS. Also, please see Master Response MR-5 for a description of the water conservation measures being implemented in the Salinas Valley. All this said, MCWRA can not guarantee that water use in the future will be as projected in this

COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL REPORT (DEIR) FOR THE 158
SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT

By Dan Heath, individually and on behalf of Water World Resorts,
Inc. dba Lake Nacimiento Resort
and Lake San Antonio Resorts Inc.

SUMMARY OF DEFICIENCIES

1) The DEIR presents inadequate and inconsistent data, and the information and quantities discussed therein are conflicting. The lack of an accurate and consistent project description 158-1
renders the DEIR invalid.
2) The DEIR fails to adequately and accurately evaluate the effect of the Project(s) on the recreational usage of the Reservoirs and the economic impacts on recreation and recreation- 158-2
related businesses.
3) The DEIR inappropriately combines what are essentially two separate projects, the "Spillway Modification" Project and the "Water Diversion" Project. These Projects should 158-3
be addressed as separate issues.
4) The DEIR fails to evaluate alternatives to the "Water Diversion Project", which should include a plan to halt seawater intrusion by forcing those responsible for what is.actually a "pollution problem" to stop pumping from the wells causing the intrusion and thereby to 158-4
cease polluting the groundwater of adjacent lands. 5) The DEIR fails to evaluate the economic and social impacts of the proposed Project on the entire community, and to evaluate the limited number of citizens who will actually benefit from the Project. The DEIR should consider the total acreage to be affected, the value of the 158-5
Project on a per-acre basis, the crops raised on the affected property, and the value as a
whole to the taxpayers of Monterey County.

In summary, the inadequacies of the DEIR as detailed below, respecting omissions, reliance on faulty, outmoded or incomplete data, failure to consult with relevant agencies, and failure to fairly and comprehensively catalog and address environmental and economic impacts which will flow from the Project, require that the Project proponents withdraw the DEIR, amend it as indicated below, and re- circulate it for further public review and comment. Preferably this will be accomplished with a separate 158-6

DEIR for each of what clearly are two separate projects, one of which should commence with all due speed (the Spillway Modification Project), and the other (Water Diversion Project) perhaps not at all.
These comments are submitted under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act,
California Public Resources Code Section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA published by the Office of Planning and Research at 14 California Code of Regulations Sections 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). Specifically, these comments are authorized pursuant to CEQA Section 21091 and CEQA Guidelines Sections 15044 and 15085.

*

I) INADEQUACY AND INACCURATENESS OF DATA AS PRESENTED IN THE DEIR:
The primary area of concern here is the inconsistent information presented in the DEIR related to the amounts of water to be diverted from the Salinas River, for the purpose of curtailing Seawater intrusion. The DEIR provides many different versions of the amounts to be diverted and presents this data in a way which makes an intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental effects of the projects impossible. This confusing data leaves the reader with a total lack of understanding regarding the projects, the actual amounts to be diverted and the effects of the projects on the reservoirs and recreation at the reservoirs as well as the environmental effects of the projects on the fisheries of the reservoirs, erosion of the shoreline and visual impacts around the lake.
Examples of conflicting information, starting in the beginning of the DEIR and working through it towards the end.

Page; 1-7 States the following: Table 1-2
Ground water pumping 463,000 AFY, 1995 baseline conditions
443,000AFY 2030 projected future baseline conditions The difference in baseline ground water pumping in total, is <20,000> less in 2030, according to this
information.

Also included on this table are these facts:
Urban Use 45,000 1995 baseline 85,000 2030 baseline use + 40,000 AFY
Agricultural Use 418,000 1995 baseline 358,000 2030 baseline use • 60,000AFY Outflow to the Ocean is projected at 11,000 acre feet per year less, in 2030 than in 1995
Net Savings according to this Baseline table, of water that would presumably be saved within the ground water basin and reservoirs, would be 31,000 AFY..
Below table 1-2 in section 2 a statement says; ' Baseline (1995) and future Baseline (2030) assume that 158-7
deliveries from the MCWRP are being made. Under 1995 condition, approximately 13,300 AFY are
delivered, while under the 2030 conditions, 15,900 AFY is projected for delivery.

THE QUANTITIES LISTED ABOVE ARE IMPORTANT IN EVALUATING THE
INCONSISTENCIES WHICH FOLLOW. SPECIFICALLY, THE DEIR CONFIRMS 13,300 AFY AS A 1995 DIVERSION AMOUNT AND 15,900 AS THE 2030 DIVERSION AMOUNT, IF THE PROJECT
WAS IN PLACE.

Page; 1-9 States the following : In the second Paragraph, * The project is expected to divert an average of 9,700 AFY of water from the Salinas River during the irrigation season.
So, what is it, 13,300 AFY, OR 9,700???
Page; 2-2 States Under applicants preferred alternative, paragraph 3. 66 A seasonal diversion structure
would be constructed on the northern reach of the Salinas River to divert an average of 9,700 AFY for irrigation during April through October.

AR 02748

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-763 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Does this mean that the is figure of 13,300 is incorrect? Should the reader now believe that 9,700 is the true diversion amount? 158-7

Page3-11 Section 3.2.3. SALINAS RIVER RECHARGE, CONVEYANCE & DIVERSION
States in the 3rd paragraph, * Approximately 172,000 AFY would be released for conservation purposes in an average year with the project in place, an increase of 30,000 AFY compared to baseline conditions.'
The 4th Paragraph states that, The conveyance and diversion of reoperated water from the reservoirs would involve: (1) continued conveyance of existing quantities plus reoperated water from the reservoirs via the Salinas River, (2) seasonal confinement of water behind the proposed in stream diversion dam, and (3) diversion of an average of 9,700 AFY of water via the pumping of pooled water from behind the dam.

SO, THIS SECTION SEEMS TO IMPLY THE FOLLOWING:

After the project is built, approximately 172,000 AFY will be released from both reservoirs, which 158-8
according to this section will also be 30,000 AFY more than currently released.
In actuality, the current releases for the year 2001 are projected to be 170,000 AF. Not 142,000 AF. Furthermore this section states that an additional 30,000 AFY will be released, all of which will be generated by the reoperation of the reservoirs, But most importantly, it does not reveal what will happen to this 30,000 AF of additional released water. It does say that 9,700 will be diverted, but makes no mention of the usage of the remaining 20,300 AF. Furthermore, according to Table 1-2 in the front of the DEIR as discussed above, there will be a net savings in water usage of 31,000 AFY by 2030.
So where is the additional 21,000 AFY going and what is happening to the 31,000 AFY that will allegedly be saved by less Ag. usage and less water flow to the Ocean? Most importantly, are any of these quantities reliable??
Page 3-22, Section 3.2.4 DISTRIBUTION/DELIVERY OF WATER

States the following:
Agricultural needs, which make up a far greater share of water use. Are projected to decrease by approximately 51,700 AFY (a 13%reduction) as result of several factors, including increased inrigation efficiencies,…........., and some conversion of land from Ag. To Urban uses.
THIS IS ANOTHER CONFLICTING SET OF NUMBERS.
According to Table 1-2 Ag use will decline 60,000AFY, not 51,700 AFY. According to Table 1-2 158-9

Ag. Usage in Baseline 1995 is 463,000 AFY.

If 51,300, is 13% of the current usage, then this would mean the total current Ag. Usage is 397,692 AFY; NOT 463,000 AFY. As stated in Table 1-2.
A difference of nearly 9,000 AFY is very important; after all, it is nearly equal to the amount which may be needed for diversion, depending on which numbers are to be believed.

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-764 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Page 5.3-13 Reservoir Reoperation- Alternatives A and B

Nacimiento Reservoir Storage Levels- Alternatives A and B States that: "Under alternative A, the average reservoir levels in Nacimiento will be approximately 50,000 AF lower in the summer and 20,000 AF lower in the winter......."
This lower storage is mostly due to the draw on the reservoir for water supply to the SVWP diversion facility.

HOW DOES AN ANNUAL DIVERSION OF 9,700 AF, EQUATE TO A RESERVOIR THÄT IS 50,000 AF LOWER DURING THE DIVERSION PERIOD?

San AntonioReservior Storage levels- Alternatives A and A B.

States that: "Average monthly storage levels would be approximately 76,000 AF lower than existing 158-10

conditions during the summer and fall and nearly the same in the winter."

These quantities defy all LOGIC!
How can a project that will produce 30,000 in AFY in additional water via reoperation of the reservoirs, and generate an estimated 21,000 AFY in additional water savings via Ag. use decreases and less water flow to the oceanhave the effect of causing Nacimiento and San Antonio to somehow be lowered on: regular basis by a combined amount of up to 126,000 acre ft.? These figures become even more confusing considering the statements made that the new SVWP is only suppose to divert on average, 9,700 AFY. At the rate of 9,700 AFY, it would take (13) years to drain that amount of additional water out of the reservoirs and that assumes there are no extra wet years along the way.

Obviously, this information is severely flawed and must be corrected.

Page 5.3-16 Reservoir Releases- Alternatives A and B States that; " Higher release requirements for diversion and recharge during the irrigation months would result in up to nearly 7,000 AF a month of higher releases observed for the April through August period."

This Section also states that: " Releases from both reservoirs under the project scenario of both A and B will be generally higher during the summer months than existing conditions. Under both Alternatives A and B, reoperation would increase the releases from San Antonio.......'

There is no explanation given other than DUE TO REOPERATION! This makes no sense whatsoever. 158-11

In today's real world, all of the water that can be released for recharge into the basin is already being released. It is not possible to make the Salinas River somehow magically begin to absorb more water, unless you pump more water directly out of the immediate river basin or actual river flow, and neither one of these things are going to happen. If there are such plans, they have been conveniently omitted in this DEIR.

Therefore, there. is no reasonable explanation for why 7,000 extra AF would be released monthly and what

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-765 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

.*

would happen to it, if it was released. 158-11
The statements discussed above must be addressed and either corrected or have reasonable explanations
provided for them.
Page 5.3-47 MCWRP- Alternatives A and B States that: "The MCWRP is projected to deliver 25,600 AFY by the year 2030 to Agricultural water users in the northern portions of the basin, 15,900 of which would be delivered directly during the spring/summer irrigation season and approximately 9,700 AFY which would be stored for delivery during. the water season.

Such a statement is incomprehensible. It seems to say that there will be 15,900 AF a year diverted in 158-12

2030, from the diversion dam in the river. If this is true, then is it also the correct assumption to believe that 13,300 AFY will be diverted in the near term, as discussed in Table 1-2? Once again the number "9,700 AFY" appears, only this time it says that is the amount that will be stored for delivery during the water season. What does this mean, stored in the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs or stored some place else? Why is it being separated as something different than the rest of the
15,900 AFY? Answers and a clearer explanation about what all of this means, must be provided.
As discussed above, the information contained in the DEIR pertaining to the preferred Alternative A, is confusing and conflicting. There is a complete lack of reasonable explanations to support the data provided and it is not possible to read the DEIR and understand what is really going to take place and how the proposed project will effect the many various aspects of the environment, citizens of the area and other aspects deserving of consideration, such as recreation and the businesses that thrive on that recreation.
A clear and concise explanation of the SVWP is required and should be easy to understand, envision and evaluate not only the rationale behind the project, but also the economic justification and the environmental and economic effects the project will produce.

There should be no set of numbers that conflict with others, and the data contained within the DEIR
should be consistent throughout. It is my understanding that the courts have made clear that distorted
project descriptions are inappropriate, as only through an accurate view of the project can affected
outsiders and public decision makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental costs, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal, and weigh other alternatives in the balance.

2) THE FAILURE OF THE DEIR TO ACCURATELY DESCRIBE THE IMPACTS OF THE
PROJECT ON RECREATION:

Because the DEIR contains so many conflicting and unfeasable assumptions about the projects effects on lake levels, it is reasonable to assume that there is no accurate or correct data in the DEIR relative to 158-13
Recreation.
Furthermore, the data that the DEIR acquired from Monterey County Parks does not accurately reflect the true economic impacts of reservoir levels on Recreational businesses associated with the reservoirs. It is inconceivable that the preparers of the DEIR failed to consult or collect data from the concessionaires at 158-14
the Reservoirs, when in fact 30 years of historical data exist. Had they taken the time to gather such data,

AR 02751

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-766 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

they would know that if the assumptions contained in the DEIR are correct, the economies of the
Recreation industry in both Monterey County and San Luis Obispo County will be devastated.

The impacts of lowering Nacimiento by an average of 50,000 AF and San Antonio by 76,000AF, would lower annual sales by several million dollars for the concessionaires alone and at least as much for other
area businesses as well. This would also result in the loss of as many as 160 area jobs and have a trickle 158-14
down negative impact on other countywide businesses from boat dealers to food and beverage
distributors.
Because the dollars spent by recreational tourism at the reservoirs is respent many times over with literally thousands of other businesses and individuals, the overall economic impact of the SVWP could quite easily be in excess of a loss of $ 100,000,000 a year to the local economy, if in fact the reservoirs are lowed on average by another 126,000 AF during the summer season as stated in the DEIR.
The actual effects of the project must be calculated accurately with regards to real impacts on lake elevations. Then, real data must be obtained from the concessionaires, to accurately project the impacts to the recreation and the businesses that depend on it.

One very excellent example of how inadequately recreation has been evaluated by this DEIR,; is as
follows.

Page 5.9-13 This section discusses the fact that the SLO water project used a threshold of elevation 748 as the point where recreation is severely damaged. The SVWP DEIR uses a threshold of 730 and claims to
have received it from the Parks department and the concessionaire. In fact, the authors of the DEIR seem to have extracted that number from a single piece of dated correspondence and taken it completely out of
context.

The DEIR STATES: "No evidence exists or is available to suggest either threshold is more appropriate to use. Furthermore, regardless of which threshold is used for this recreation analysis, the impact result
would be the same."

Such a statement is patently absurd, and was obviously written by someone with NO KNOWLEDGE regarding recreation at the reservoirs. 158-15

The last three years that the reservoir levels where at or near elevation 730 ASL the combined gross income of both concession operations was approximately 2,500,000 which is well below a profitability level.

The last time the levels were at or near 750 ASL, the gross sales were approximately 40% higher than at the 730 levels and equaled approximately $3,500,000.
More importantly, with normal average levels as has been the case during the last 6 years, the gross sales have equaled approximately $6,000,000. this does not include any Monterey county parks department income.

This entire section should be completely rewritten and reevaluated prior to acceptance of the DEIR, after valid information is obtained by the preparers.

3) TWO SEPARATE PROJECTS, SHOULD HAVE TWO SEPARATE DEIRS

Combining the Spillway Modification project with the diversion project is wrong for several reasons. To begin with, one is not dependent on the other and either can be accomplished without the other. Both projects have totally different impacts on the Environment and therefore both projects should be 158-16
separately evaluated. The spillway project must be completed, regardless of whether or not a diversion project is ever constructed. The consequences of failing to modify the Nacimiento Spillway would have
devastating impacts on everyone concerned with any use of any type regarding Nacimiento, whether it is Salinas Valley water uisers or business and recreational interests at the lake.

FAILURE TO MODIFY THE SPILLWAY, AND TO DO SO IMMEDIATELY, WILL RESULT
IN A NEW FLOOD RULE CURVE THAT WILL BY IT'S VERY NATURE, PREVENT 158-17
NACIMIENTO FROM EVER FILLING ABOVE ELEVATION 746 ASL.

The MCWRA, is flirting with real disaster by combining these two separate projects and risking the chance that the Spillway modification may be delayed, due to the much more controversial Diversion
Project.

THE SPILLWAY PROJECT

The Spillway Modification Project has no significant environmental impacts and will simply allow the reservoir to be operated much the same as it is currently being operated but with the ability to store more water in the reservoir earlier in the season, which would generate environmental benefits.
The spillway modification must be completed soon or the DSOS and FERC will modify their flood rule curves and require lower lake levels for safety against flooding.

THE DIVERSION PROJECT

The Diversion Project should stand on it's own and be evaluated separately, because it has nothing to do with the Spillway Modification. It is a separate matter, involving separate issues and considerations. 158-18
There are many potentially negative impacts associated with the Diversion Project; they are for the most part, discussed, (although inadequately) in the current DEIR,
1) Negative impacts on lake levels 2) Negative impacts on Salinas river Habitat 3) Negative impacts on Recreation 4) Negative impacts on area businesses 5) Negative impacts on local property values 6) Negative impacts on Monterey County taxpayers
The validity of building the Diversion Project is very suspect for many reasons, all of which require more in-depth evaluation and consideration. It is for these very reasons that these projects should not be combined, as a valid project will be delayed by a flawed one.

AR 02753

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-768 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Alternatives to this project have not been adequately addressed and along with appropriately evaluating all of the above-mentioned Negative impacts, which may be caused by this project, more alternatives should be considered to this project, which have not been adequately evaluated in the past. 158-19
Specifically, alternatives which stop/control Sea water intrusion by curtailing pumping and halting irrigation of land without the resources to sustain the practice. As will be further discussed below.
It is with these thoughts in mind, that anyone evaluating this SVWP DEIR, should arrive at the same
conclusion to separate these two projects.
The Spillway Modification must be Built ASAP, because it is required and will be mandated for safety purposes. Re-evaluate the Diversion Project and re-write the DEIR, to include additional and perhaps
preferable alternatives.

4) THE SEA WATER INTRUSION PROBLEM IS ACTUALLY A POLLUTION PROBLEM
AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS SUCH.

The bottom line with Sca Water Intrusion is SIMPLE. For many years, now, certain landowners and their tenants have been pumping water out of wells on their land at rates that far exceed the quantities of water underlying that land. They have pumped all of the available water from below their land and then proceeded to pump via suction the fresh water lying below adjacent lands which in many cases did not belong to them. This process ultimately polluted their underground water stores and that of surrounding . land owners, via suction which first used up the fresh water below their land, then took that of their neighbors and is now ultimately sucking Sea Water into the underground storage of all of the surrounding
areas.

CONSIDERED.

This should be appropriately discussed and evaluated a as a viable alternative within the DEIR, concerning the Diversion project. 158-21

5) WHAT ARE THE REAL BENEFITS OF THE DIVERSION PROJECT AND WHO RECEIVES
THE BENEFIT VS, WHO PAYS FOR IT?

As: part of this DEIR, an evaluation should be done regarding the environmental and economic effects of supplying diverted water to the area that would be receiving the water, and a cost-benefit analysis completed on such a project.
The evaluation should clearly pinpoint and describe the precise parcels of land that will receive the water.
The acreage should be measured and the crops grown on the same land should be listed.
The value of the
land to others. crops grown should be listed, along with land lease rates for those owners leasing their 158-22

The value of keeping this benefitted land in irrigated cropland should be discussed, vs. other alternatives, from reverting it back to dry land crops or cattle grazing as well as developing it for housing etc.
A proper study should been conducted which analyzes the likelihood of converting this land into development land, with or without this project, as well as if it would be possible to develop it without importing water to it via the proposed Diversion Project. When would this land likely be developed in the normal course of future growth and is this project truly intended to keep this land viable for agriculture or make it more valuable for development?
Finally, there should be a full disclosure of who owns the approximately 5,000 acres that will allegedly

AR 02755

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-770 Response t0 Comments on the EIR/EIS

benefit from the project. How many property owners are there? What is their annual income per acre and
( per owner and how do they earn their income, from farming it themselves or leasing it to others? If leased to others, who are they and what is the value of this project to them?
All of these questions should be answered and disclosed in a valid analysis of whether Monterey county taxpayers should spend Tens of Millions of dollars for the benefit of just a few, or whether valid 158-22
alternatives should be explored. There are everal alternatives. The landowners caused the problem and they should bear the cost of fixing it. The landowners caused the pollution to others and should be stopped from doing further damage.
Finally, a full disclosure of who the land owners are should be made, along with their permanent residence addresses so that the taxpayers of the Co. of Monterey know where their money will be going and who it will be benefiting if this project goes forward.
Sea Water intrusion must.be halted now, and that is easy to do.
An EIR is not required to stop illegal pollution.
In summary, the inaccurate and unwarranted assumptions contained in this DEIR, as detailed in this letter, as well as the omissions, reliance on faulty or incomplete data, failure to consult with relevant agencies and concessionaires, and failure to fairly and comprehensively catalog and address environmental and economic impacts which will flow from this project require that the DEIR should be withdrawn, amended as requested herein, and re-circulated for further public review and comment, preferably as two separate projects.

(dba Nacimiento Reservoir Resort and San Antonio Reservoir Resorts, Inc.) August 25, 2001

158-1 The commenter states that the DEIR's project description is internally inconsistent.
However, the commenter does not identify any inconsistencies. Consequently, no further response is possible.
158-2 The commenter states that the DEIR fails to adequately evaluate the Project's impacts upon recreational resources. Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for a detailed discussion of the project's effects on the local economy of northern San Luis
Obispo County. See Master Response MR-2 for a description of mitigation measures that have been considered for the Final EIR/EIS to address project effects on recreation.

158-3 The commenter states that the DEIR inappropriately combines two separate® projects. CEQA encourages broad definition of the "project" that is the subject of environmental review. See 14 C.C.R. Section 15378(a). Moreover, the five
physical/programmatic components (modification of the Nacimiento spillway; reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs; Salinas River recharge, conveyance, and diversion; distribution/delivery of water; and delivery area pumping management) are necessary to meet the objective of the proposed project of halting seawater intrusion, because none of the five components could individually halt seawater intrusion.

158-4 The commenter states that the DEIR'S alternatives analysis does not adequately analyze demand management. The Draft EIR/EIS addresses alternatives that
include No Action/Total Demand Management (Alternative D), and No Action/State Adjudication (Alternative E). Please see Master Responses MR-1 and
MR-5.

158-5 The commenter states that the DEIR's analysis of the project's economic and social
impacts is inadequate. Please refer to Master Response MR-6 for detailed
discussion of project effects on the local economy and property values near Nacimiento Reservoir, as well as the area and population of the Salinas Valley relying on groundwater affected by seawater intrusion. See also Master Response MR-1.

and 149-3. The 13,300 AFY value refers to the delivery of treated wastewater (i.e., recycled water) provided through the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP). The 9,700 AFY value refers to the average amount of surface water that would be diverted from the Salinas River for delivery in the CSIP area.
158-8 The commenter requests clarification of the water balance calculations. See Master Response 1, Master Response 4, and responses to Comments 149-1, 149-2, and 149- 3. The 172,000 AFY value represents average annual conservation releases, and the 30,000 AFY value represents the difference between this value and average baseline conditions for the 46-year period studied. Releases are varied by year in response to specific hydrologic conditions and demand for water. In many years, releases will be greater than the average and in other years releases will be less than the average.
158-9 The commenter requests clarification of the description of the Draft EIR/EIS' description of pumping. See response to Comment 149-40. 158-10 The commenter requests clarification regarding the description of reservoir storage levels. Please see Master Response MR-1 and Master Response MR-4 and responses
to Comments 149-1, 149-2, and 149-3. The vatiation among the numbers describing
reservoir storage levels results from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the fact that recharge in the stream channel takes most of the water that is released from the reservoirs during the irrigation season. As a result, only a small portion of the water released makes it downstream to the diversion point to be ultimately pumped from the river and delivered for irrigation.
158-11 The commenter asks for clarification regarding comparisons of Alternative A and
Alternative B. Please refer to Master Responses MR-1 and MR-4, as well as responses to Comments 149-1, 149-2, and 149-3.
158-12 The commenter requests clarification regarding the amount of water delivered by the MCWRP. See response to Comment 158-7, Master Response 1, Master Response 4, responses to Comments 149-1, 149-2, and 149-3. References in the Draft EIR/EIS to the "MCWRP" are to the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, which
deliver recycled water (tertiary-treated wastewater) for irrigation use in the CSIP area.
These amounts are distinct from the surface water diversions proposed as part of the SVWP. The 9,700 AFY value in this paragraph refers to recycled water that would be stored in the non-irrigation season, under future (2030) Alternative B (only) a operations, in a subsurface storage reservoir, as specified in the last sentence of the
paragraph cited by the commenter.
158-13 The commenter states that the data in the DEIR is inadequate to support is conclusions regarding impacts to recreation.

The MCWRA is in the process of reviewing the flood rule curve at Nacimiento with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the California Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD). It is not known what flood rule
curve might be adopted. Consequently, it would be speculative and inconsistent with both CEQA and NEPA to evaluate the environmental impacts of any such new rule. Because this comment does not raise any issues on the environmental analysis in the Draft EIR/EIS, no further response is required.

Nacimiento Reservoir, which was funded by Salinas Valley landowners. The SVWP would benefit all lands and water users (agricultural, industrial, and urban) overlying the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin because continuing seawater intrusion will
eventually affect the usability of water for all these uses. Further, an alternative that considers conversion of large areas of farmland to housing as a means to halt
seawater intrusion would result in significant impacts associated with farmland loss,
traffic, air quality, etc.

RE: Response to Draft EIR/EIS, Salinas Valley Water Project
Dear Mr. Smith:
As a property owner, a recreational user of Lake Nacimento, and as a developer, I have many concerns regarding the Proposed Project and the analysis provided in the EIR/EIS. In general, there has not been enough specific information regarding various aspects of the project to allow me or other more informed individuals to adequately understand all the potential impacts associated with the proposed project. However, as required by law this is our opportunity to respond, and I urge you to consider my comments.
I own approximately 1,900 acres surrounding what is known as Dip Creek. I purchased this property last year because of the recreational value and scenic beauty that it provides. use the Lake Nacimento recreational facilities on Numerous friends and family members a regular basis. Therefore, my concern about the future recreational use of the lake and potential impacts to property values is understandably significant.
The following discussion summarizes my concern regarding the proposed project based on the information that has been provided in the EIR/EIS.

OVERVIEW As will be discussed further in this response, The Proposed Project cannot be expected to solve all downstream water difficencies experienced by Monterey County. Therefore, the proposed improvements and revised operational parameters need to be implemented in consideration of downstream conservation, acquisition of new water resources for the 159-1

Salinas Valley and the interests of the property owners and recreational users of the Lake.
AR 02760

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-775 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

As stated in section 1.2.1, aquifer pumping and recharge rates must be brought into balance. When considering drought years or extended periods of low rainfall, it is clear 159-2
that Nacimento Lake cannot provide all of the necessary water resources to prevent or arrest saltwater intrusion, Additionally, increased demand for water for new development needs to be analyzed moré thoroughly since there appears to be no mitigation measures directed at minimizing this impact. 159-3

Lake Nacimento is a finite supply of water. The recreational use and economic factors associated with the lake are important and require analysis that not been folded into the 159-4
document. If balance is the objective, then more analysis should be included in the document to address alternatives for balancing the needs of down stream uses and public and private interests of San Luis Obispo County residents and lake users.

REOPERATION SCHEDULE
All. of the impacts associated with the Proposed Project on Lake Nacimento will be defined by the Proposed Reoperation Schedule which is not included in the document. In order to understand the impacts to our property interests and those of Heritage Ranch and
other lake communities, we need more specific information about the schedule. This request is based on the lack of adequate.information available to the public upon which to evaluate the recommendations in the document. Furthermore, reduced release rates during dry years as anticipated within document need to be provided 10 the public so we can understand the entire scope. Also, how the release schedule is tied to water conversation measures. downstream is very critical. This information would allow me 159-5
and others directly affected by the proposed project to make an informed response.
Coordinating release rates with downstream saltwater intrusion and additional consumptive use is a complex undertaking. Increased releases from the lake can be, part of the solution, however, it would not be wise to rely on the lake as the ultimate solution. At best, it can be argued that it is an interim solution that will have long-term impacts as well as immediate short-term impacts to the residents and users of the lake. Therefore, we are asking that a more complete analysis of the interrelationship of the release schedule with water conversation and reduce demands for new development be provided.

ECONOMIC IMPACT
As you have heard as several public information meetings, there 'is a significant concem that the Proposed Project will negatively impact property values as well as business interests at the lake. The Heritage Ranch Owners Association derives revenue from
recreational users of the lake. Reduced revenues due to decreased use of the lake will a have a direct impact on the association dues paid by every single property owner within 159-6
the community. This is a wide-ranging impact that has not been addressed within the document. Considering that the lake will not solve all downstream needs, how much of
an economic impact should the residents of Heritage Ranch and other lake communities endure to partially mitigate downstream needs. Here the question of balance, equity and

AR 02761

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-776 Response 10 Comments on the EIR/EIS

fairness needs to be explored. The county of San Luis Obispo will lose property tax revenue, Monterey County will lose recreational revenue and the public needs to be able to evaluate if a revised operational schedule can mitigate these apparent impacts.
Please provide an analysis of the economic impacts to San Luis Obispo County from 159-6

reduced property values resulting from the unpublished revised operational schedule and then provide at least two alternative release schedules that would reduce the impact to property owners and recreational users.
LAKE LEVEL ANALYSIS The EIR/EIS does not contain enough information for the public to be able to analyze how they will be impacted by reduced water levels during operational year. Providing exhibits showing the lake level at various times of the year would provide / graphic tool 159-7
that can assist the public in evaluating and/or suggesting alternatives that could be. viable for consideration,

It is evident that the Proposed Project will impact recreational facilities at tbe lake. Launch ramps will not be usable during extended release periods and consequently both recreational users and residences will be harmed. A mitigation measure for this eventuality should be the extension of boating ramps for the existing recreational facilities and the cost of that being born by the Project. While this is a mitigation measure, the ultimate operational schedule could avoid these impacts if significant 158-8
releases were deferred until after Labor Day, for example. At any rate, insufficient information has been provided to the public upon which to base an informed decision We request that the EIR/EIS preparer provide maps of lake levels-as it relates to the proposed and suggested operational schedule for public review.
WATER CONSERVATION AND DOWNSTREAM CONSUMPTION
It may be fair to conclude that downstream consumptive use for both agriculture and development has exceeded the safe yield of existing ground water and Nacimento recharge capability. This EIR/EIS should address and make recommendations for an aggressive conservation effort for downstream users. To ignore the extractive use as an integral part of the solution is inexcusable. If the condition is as serious as described and balance being goal, insufficient information has been provided for the public 1o understand how conservation will be integrated directly with *lake discharges. The 159-9

recharge capabilities presented by the lake and the conservation measures exercised downstream are inextricably linked and should be presented as "The Project".
We request that the EIR/EIS preparer and the County of Monterey provide information and analysis of the dependency of downstream conservation and lake discharges as the
mitigation to saltwater intrusion.

AR 02762

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-777 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

CONCLUSION I understand and appreciate the opportunity that increased release rates from Lake Nacimento will benefit downstream users in Monterey County. I also think that the document does not fully analyze alternatives that may be implemented to safeguard the recreational and property interests of those with a long-term vested interest in Lake Nacimento. It is simply not adequate to say that Monterey County will seek a balance without providing enough information for the public to evaluate the adequacy and potential impacts associated with those future actions. The information that-I have requested would assist me in more fully understanding the project, its impacts and possible mitigations.

Re: Comment on Salinas Valley Water Project Draft EIR/EIS Our File: 5061.26377

Dear Mr. Smith:

I am writing on behalf of General Farm Investment Company to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement for the Salinas Valley Water Project ("Dreft EIR/EIS") prepared by the Monterey County Water Resources Agency and the Army Corp of Engineers. General Farm Investment Company owns land in the Pressure Area of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin.
General Farm submits the following comments for your consideration:
l. Expanded Distribution System - At page 3-23 and 3-24, the Draft EIR/EIS discusses possible future expansion of the distribution system if
additional deliveries are needed to halt seawater intrusion. The document
states at page 3-24 that for purposes of the of the Draft EIR/EIS "it is assumed that deliveries would occur. to the southeast of the CSIP service area."
However, other than the fact that this arca is the closest arca to the diversion 160-1
dam that is not already within the CSIP area, the Draft EIR/EIS offers no explanation or justification for expanding the distribution system in this direction.

groundwater pumping may make a more significant contribution to seawater intrusion. If the distribution system is to be extended at all, it should be extended into areas where it is going to achieve the maximum benefit if. at all feasible.

2. Effects of Inundation - General Farm Investment Company owns property near the proposed inundation area. The Draft EIR/EIS includes. a discussion of potential impacts of increased groundwater levels on agricultural lands adjacent to the river, including increases of water levels of up to 4 feet within 400 to 500 feet and potential root zone problems and/or water logging 160-2
within 200 to 300 feet of the inundation arca. (Draft EIR/EIS, p. 5.3-41.) The summary of the impact and mitigation measures on pages 2-9 through 2-10 of the Draft EIR/EIS is inconsistent with this discussion. These discussions should be made consistent.
As mitigation of these impacts, the Draft EIR/EIS recommends installation of subsurface drainage systems to remove excess water from affected agricultural areas. (Draft EIR/EIS, p. 5.3-63.) The Draft EIR/EIS 160-3
should identify any engineering studies which support the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation. In addition, the Draft EIR/EIS states at page 2-3 that estirnates do not include "costs for environmental mitigation or operation and maintenance costs." The Draft EIR/EIS should discuss whether implementation of these measures. to. mitigate potentially significant impacts on adjoining agricultural lands will result in any direct or indirect costs and/or 160-4
lost revenues to adjoining land owners and whether these measures can be implemented without interfering with agricultural operations on the affected properties.

3. Dolivery Area Pumping Management - The use of surface water diversion to provide a substitute water supply would be expected to reduce water quality problems associated with the existing CSIP éystem. Nonetheless, when used in combination with recycled water, there is the potential that water 160-5
quality problems could persist, depending on the blending ratio of recycled water to diverted surface water. This could result in potentially significant adverse impacts on soils irrigated with low quality water. Such potential impacts should be discussed. In addition, the discussion of delivery area pumping management on pages 3-24 to 3-25 of the Draft EIR/EIS should be 160-6
modified to clearly state that pumping would only be limited when blended

water is of sufficiently high quality that its use would pose no potential for either short-term or long-term adverse impacts to agricultural soils irrigated with project water. 160-6

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Dreft EIR/EIS. General Farm Investment Company generally supports the project and looks forward to working with the Agency, the Army Corps and other interested parties and agencies to make this project a reality.

LETTER 160

Fenton & Keller (on behalf of General Farm Investment Company)
August 27, 2001

160-1 As noted on pages 3-23 and 3-24 of the Draft EIR/EIS, given the dynamics of the hydrologic system, the uncertainties of whether future demands will equal the projected 2030 demand, and the limitations of modeling, it cannot be known whether seawater intrusion would actually occur in 2030. It is possible that the project as proposed, with deliveries only within the CSIP system, would continue fully halt seawater intrusion in 2030. The monitoring program included in the proposed action would determine the success of the project in halting seawater to

intrusion over the longer term. If monitoring indicates that seawater intrusion has begun to advance landward in the future, deliveries of surface water from the SVWP in the future may need to be expanded beyond the CSIP area.
Results of modeling using the SVIGSWM have shown that the area southeast of the existing CSIP pipeline distribution system is where an alternative water supply may need to be provided in the future, should monitoring indicate that an expansion of pipeline facilities beyond those described in Phase 1 of the proposed project is needed to halt seawater intrusion. However, this potential expanded delivery system has been planned only conceptually to address this potential future need. Given the uncertainties in predicting whether seawater intrusion will occur in the long term, it is appropriate at this time to consider the expanded delivery system only at this conceptual level. Actual plannin of an expanded distribution system, should one be needed, would be based on results of the monitoring of actual conditions. The relative merits of expanding the system into different areas would be more appropriately addressed at such time that monitoring indicates a need for expansion.
160-2 The commenter's observations are correct. The impact shown at the bottom of page 2-9 should read as follows, consistent with the text on page 5.3-41:
Impacts on Agricultural Areas: Implementation of Alternative A
(existing and future) could increase groundwater levels more than 4 feet near agricultural areas adjacent to the river. This could result in potential root zone problems and/or water logging of crops within 200-300 feet of the impoundment zone in isolated areas of similar or lower surface elevation.

The mitigation shown on page 2-10 refers to this impact. On Draft EIR/EIS page

... 5.3-63, this mitigation is incorrectly shown as corresponding to Alt A-8 rather than A-9.

Corrections of these errors are shown in Chapter 3.0 of this document.

Salinas Valley Water Project AR 02768

2-783 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

However, as described 5.3-41 of the Draft EIR/EIS, insufficient topographic data was available at the time the document was prepared to better determine if the impact to farmland root zones would occur. New topographic data has been collected and shows that elevations of land adjacent to the diversion facility are sufficiently high that it is unlikely that impacts from water logging would occur. That said, it can not be assured that water logging absolutely will not occur SO the conclusions of the Draft EIR/EIS, including mitigation, are unchanged.
160-3 Subsurface drainage systems are used in agricultural areas throughout the Delta and parts of the San Joaquin Valley to mitigate high water tables, and this has proven to be effective. Other options include planting trees or other vegetation with high evapotranspiration rates in proximately. However, as described in response to Comment 160-2,based on new survey information performed after the release of the Draft EIR/EIS, the use of subsurface drainage systems as mitigation would not
appear necessary.

160-4 As discussed on page 5.3-63, any subsurface drainage systems would be installed by MCWRA. However, as discussed above, such a system is not likely to be needed.
160-5 As stated in Section 5.4.1, MCWRA plans to blend recycled water with diverted Salinas River water before it enters the CSIP system in order to achieve a uniform blending ratio, increasing the overall quality of water in the CSIP system.
See also responses to Comments 14-1 and 25-4.
160-6 MCWRA Ordinance No. 03790 governs well use within the CSIP service area (Zone 2B). This ordinance provides for maintenance and use of "standby" wells by individuals within the project service area. Further, the ordinance specifies circumstances under which standby wells can be used. The use of standby well in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance would continue under implementation of the SVWP.

Re: Draft Environmental Impact Report/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR/DEIS), Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Mr. Smith,

The Salinas Valley Water Coalition (Coalition) appreciates the opportunity to comment on Monterey County Water Resources Agency's (Agency) Draft Environmental Impact Report/Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIR/DEIS) for their proposed Salinas Valley Water Project. The Coalition has supported the Agency in its pursuit and development of a project that meets the stated goals of the Salinas Velley Water Project (SVWP). The implementation of these goals and the associated project must be cost effective, reasonable and hydrologically sound,
The proposed SVWP is subject to the appropriate CEQA and NEPA review that allows for public participation and comment. The DEIR/DEIS is the vehicle by which this takes place. Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA/NEPA process. The Agency has a responsibility to provide for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to environmental issues related to the Agency's activities. The Coalition belleves that the Agency's willingness to commit to public scrutiny along with public participation has been demonstrated this past year, We commend the Agency for its' willingness and commitment to this level of public participation, We strongly believe it is this type of public participation process that makes a difference in the end results.

The Salinas Valley Water Coalition supports full environmental review of the SVWP and its various components. We have always stressed the need for the Agency to consider the adverse impacts to the individual landowners and the various regions of the valley associated with the project components and the measures necessary to mitigate these identified adverse impacts. It is important that the public is informed through the appropriate CEQA/NEPA documents, as to the specific project components, the manner in which they will be operated and managed to meet the project goals, the adverse

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-785 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

environmental and economic impacts associated with them, as well as the mitigation
measures necessary to avoid or reduce, significant adverse impacts, and the cost of
this mitigation.
The Coalition believes it is by working together through this' process that the Project's stated goals can be achieved. We are committed to working with the Agency to achieve a solution to the Salinas Valley Basin's water problems and offer the following comments with regards to the SVWP DEIR/DEIS, for your consideration.
1. Project Purpose and Objectives: The DEIR/DEIS states the purpose of the proposed action is to address the critical issues facing the management and longevity of the Basin's water resources by meeting the following objectives:
Stopping seawater intrusiot Providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future (year 2030)
needs.
• Improving the hydrologic balance of the groundwater basin in the Salinas Valley (Basin).
It is stated that the proposed action is comprised of a series of structural and 161-1
program-based components, and that these components will serve, together with the existing Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project, to meet the listed objectives.
The above Project Objectives are slightly different than what has been previously considered for Project to solve the Basin's water problems - specifically "improving the hydrologic balance* rather than "hydrologically balancing*' the ground water basin. Because of this distinction, it is important that the Final EIR/EIS clearly defines the level of "improvement* sought and anticipated and then compared to the level of Project needed to "hydrologically balance" the basin. The public and the decision-makers must be fully informed prior to making their decision. They must be able to weigh the 'risks', if
any, associated with not hydrologically balancing the basin.

2. Nacimiento Spillway Modification: Section 3.2.1 states that "as described below, the spillway modification is needed whether the entire SVWP proceeds or not.....Spillway modifications will be made regardless of the SVWP as : Zone 2/2A operation and maintenance project for flood control purposes...' 161-2
The Salinas Valley Water Coalition may be willing to support a spillway modification as part of the operation and maintenance costs of Zones 2/2A,
however, your draft document does not provide the reader with this option. While it is mentioned, it is not discussed. The public as well as the decision- makers should be informed as to the size and level of such a project needed
to meet the exlsting needs of Zone 2/2A.

Salinas Valley Water Project, Draf Master Environmental Impact Report, December 1998

AR 02771

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-786 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The DEIR/DEIS states that the spillway modification is included for analysis in the document because of its *relation to reservoir reoperation". The discussion that follows then states that the flexibility provided by the spillway modification "enables implementation of reservoir reoperation (described in Section 3.3.23) to the degree needed to meet downstream recharge and diversion requirements.* These statements coupled with the discussion in Section 3.2.2 gives a perception that the spillway modification as discussed is
being proposed solely so the Agency may implement the reoperation of the
reservoir to meet the diversion requirements of the surface diversion 161-3
component. If this is not the case, then it must be clearly shown. Again, the document does not delineate between the size and level of a spillway modification to meet existing Zone 2/2A needs and that needed to meet the needs of the surface diversion component. Could a smaller level of
modification be made to the spillway that would accommodate the additional 50,000 acre foot change in the present flood pool? What is the difference in the level of flood protection achieved by each of these 'proposed' alternatives?

The discussion under *Construction & Cost" states that "these costs will be financed apart from the capital costs for the other components of the SVWP preferred alternative." Is this true? If so on what basis and in what manner? 161-4

3. Reoperation of Reservoirs: The DEIR/DEIS states that "Due to the ability to store more water through the wet season, Nacimiento can be reoperated to release less water in the wet season and release it during the irrigation
season. San Antonio reservoir will also be reoperated to store more water in the west season and release it during the irrigation season. This will allow for a greater level of groundwater recharge and will allow diversion of water at the lower Salinas River for direct delivery. Water will be in the Salinas River
year round, except during droughts. As a result, existing channel 161-5
maintenance activities may need to be modified."

Based on the above statement, it appears that the reoperation of the
reservoirs is solely for the purpose and benefit of the proposed downstream
surface diversion. Section 3.2.2 states that the "proposed spillway modification would allow changes in the way Nacimiento reservoir is operated." Does this mean that the Nacimiento reservoir would need to be operated in a different manner if the spillway modification was constructed to
a smaller modification level as discussed in #2 above? If so, how?

.There has been, and continues to be, much confusion surrounding the
manner in which the reoperation will occur and the potential impacts,
particularly to flooding. Your final document must clearly show that the
proposed reoperation of the reservoirs will not increase the risk of flooding
and in fact reduce the existing flood protection afforded by the manner in 161-6
which the reservoirs are currently operated. Your hydrologic modeling must take into account and simulate the storm event of 1995 and then detail the
2 This appears to be a typo as there is no Section 3.3.2; I believe it should read Section 3.2.2.

AR 02772

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-787 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

difference(s), if any, between existing conditions - what happened, and proposed conditions - what will happen. What, if any, is the increase risk of flooding? How will the level of flood protection provided under existing operation of the reservoirs differ from the level of flood protection achieved 161-6

under the proposed reoperation of the reservoirs?
Section 3.2.2 also states that the *.operation of both reservoirs has been, and continues to be, for two primary hydrologic functions: flood control and conservation…." It further states that the preferred reoperation would result in approximately 29,000 AFY of additional stored water that would be available for additional conservation releases and downstream diversion. Section 3.2.3 states that the downstream diversion will average 9,700 AFY. These 161-7
two numbers seem inconsistent to some individuals and one can spéculate that the relationship between the two is not linear. However, it would be clearer to the public and decision-makers if the relationship were specifically
explained.
As stated above, the DEIR/DEIS states that As a result [..of the reoperation of the reservoirs] existing channel maintenance activities may need to be modified." [emphasis added] Will they need to be modified and if so in what manner and at whose expense? Will this channel maintenance program be part of the mitigation and monitoring program or. will it be developed and evaluated separately? The Monterey County Water Resources Agency along with many individual landowners have been experiencing difficulty in obtaining the necessary permit to adequately maintain the river channel, primarily because of the endangered species issues. Because of this, it is important that the Final EIR/EIS provides sufficient detail of any proposed 161-8
channel maintenance program to address anticipated impacts from the reoperation of the reservoirs and any accompanying monitoring program. The Final EIR/EIS should inform the public and decision-makers the manner in which the program will be implemented and any potential adverse impacts to the Preferred Project by not implementing such a program. What is the potential of increased flooding by not implementing an on-going channel maintenance program? What is the impact to the 'assumed water available for downstream diversion?

The DEIR/EIS has used the hydrologic period of 1949 - 1994 to make the above deteimination. The Coalition has supported and participated in the development of the SVIGSM as a tool to be used by the public and decision- makers to assist them in evaluating the Agency's proposed project. We have also stated, and continue to believe, that the SVIGSM is a,working tool, one that should be constantly updated and refined as new information becomes available. To this end we believe is important that the SVIGSM be updated 161-9
so the hydrologic model period includes the years 1995 - 1998. As you are aware, there were significant flood events during this period of time and it is important that the Final EIR include a full analysis of these years with specific regards to the potential adverse impact on flood flows as a result of the

4

AR 02773

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-788 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

reservoir reoperation of the proposed project. Failure to do so may render the EIR inadequate.
The manner in which a in project will be operated to achieve the stated goals will determine the various levels of significant adverse impacts associated with the attainment of the goals. CEQA requires that the public and decision- 161-9
makers be fully informed as to the adverse impacts associated with a Project
and forbids agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen such impacts. The DEIR/EIS must be amended to include the above mentioned hydrologic analysis and identify the impacts associated with potential flooding.

In addition, the Coalition believes it would be helpful to have the Final EIR/EIS
include a discussion as to the potential, or lack of, increased 10 - and 25-
year flood events as a result of the proposed project's reservoir reoperation. 161-10

4. Surface Diversion/Impoundment: Section 3.2.3 states that the "conveyance and diversion of reoperated water from the reservoirs would involve ..... diversion of an average of 9,700 AFY.." and then in the last paragraph of the section it states,.."Up to 12,800 AFY of the impounded water would then be diverted from the river via pumping directly into the existing 161-11
CSIP pipeline for delivery to agricultural users." Does this mean that the maximum amount of water that would ever be diverted in one year would be 12,800 acre feet, and that the average amount would be 9,700 acre feet? Under what basis would 12,800 acre feet be diverted? The Final EIR/EIS
should clearly analyze those times when the 12,800 acre feet will be diverted
in and the differences in potential environmental impacts that would occur
versus the diversion of 9,700 acre feet.

Section 3.2.4 discusses the Distribution/Delivery of Water under the Proposed Action/Preferred Alternative. It is stated that the preferred delivery system will

..* deliver up to 12,800 AFY to the CSIP area (with an average annual amount of 9,700 AF). This amount coupled with the delivery of recycled water already generated or planned to be delivered in the CSIP area (13,300 AFY), is stated to result in total annual average deliveries of approximately 23,000 AFY. The DEIR/EIS says this level of delivery would halt seawater intrusion based on 1995 demands.
What is the current level of delivered recycled water to the CSIP area? What 161-12
is the average annual amount of recycled water currently being delivered and expected to be delivered? It seems that the level of delivered recycled water is an important factor in determining the amount of water that needs to-be
diverted and delivered to the CSIP area to insure that seawater intrusion is
stopped. Is there a mitigation plan developed, or planned for development, in the event there is not sufficient recycled water to meet the needs of the CSIP area with the maximum amount of surface water diverted being 12,800 acre feet? Is there a possibility that more surface water would need to be diverted

AR 02774

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-789 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

to meet the needs of the CSIP area? If so, it should be understood that any increase in the amount of surface diversion to meet these needs, requires
additional environmental review. 161-12

Section 3.2.4 also states that while the SVIGSM indicates that seawater
intrusion will be halted by the project (in conjunction with the CSIP deliveries) based on current 1995 demand, with ai projected increase in water demands (primarily associated with urban development) in the north valley area in the future, seawater intrusion may not be fully halted based on year 2030 projections. Because of this it is suggested that the amount of surface diversion be increased and the delivery area expanded to agricultural uses outside of the CSIP area to fully halt seawater intrusion in the year 2030. In order to achieve this, the document states that diversion from the Salinas River would be increased from an average of 9,700 AFY to 18,300 AFY. This is almost double the amount of diversion planned.to meet existing needs. 161-13
It is not clear how the monitoring of the implementation of the 'Project' will take place, what the program consists of or the criteria that will be used to make the decision as to move forward in the implementation of the 'Project Plus' - the Final EIR/EIS should explain this. It should also explain who will be making this decision and how the implementation will occur. Will this be the subject of a separate environmental review process at some level other than what is presented in the current document? It is important that the public and decision-makers fully understand the decision that is being made - is it the implementation and construction of the Preferred 'Project' or is it the
implementation and construction of the Preferred 'Project Plus'?
5. Delivery Area Pumping Management: Section 3.2.5 discusses the need to manage and limit pumping by those water users who receive direct water deliveries from the proposed project. It states that management measures are already in place in the CSIP area as part of the CSIP implementation and that this type of restriction would continue to be necessary to ensure the project's effectiveness in meeting its stated objectives and needs. The DEIR/DEIS states, 'pumping management within the project delivery area has •been incorporated to hydrologic model evaluations."
The DEIR/DEIS does not state what management measures are in place in 161-14
within the CSIP area, the manner in which they are being implemented, and
their impact, or lack of impact, on meeting the stated objectives and goals of
.the Proposed Project. The public and decision-makers must be fully informed
and therefore this information needs to be included within the Final EIR/EIS
along with what "pumping management" that's been incorporated to hydrologic model evaluations. Are there any potential environmental impacts due to the implementation of such measures? The management measures
and pumping limits being proposed for implementation is important to the landowner subject to these proposed measures as well as the public and decision-makers. What is the potential impact to them, to their businesses, and to the overall success of the Proposed Project? It should be clearly

AR 02775

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-790 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

understood if the success of the Proposed Project to meet its objectives and goals is based, in part or in whole, on the implementation of such measures, and what the impacts are associated with the implementation and with not I61-14
achieving the project's stated goals.
If an'expanded delivery system is needed as discussed in Section 3.2.4, what type of management measures and pumping limits would need to be implemented to ensure the success of the project goals and the halting of seawater intrusion? How would the implementation occur and by whom? 161-15
What are the adverse impacts by not implementing such measures?
6. Drought Contingency Planning: Section 3.2.6 discusses drought contingency planning and states that based on the SVIGSM evaluations assuming that groundwater is pumped whenever river diversions are not available or are not adequate to meet the needs of the designated delivery area, "groundwater supplies are adequate to meet project objectives without re-establishing intrusion in the Salinas Valley through droughts of historic
record."

The manner in which a "*preferred alternative" is managed and operated during times of drought should be analyzed within the Final EIR/EIS. The manner that a project will be operated during periods of drought will determine the level of significant adverse impacts, and the associated mitigation measures necessary to avoid or reduce the impacts. While it is stated that 'groundwater supplies are adequate...*, at what level of pumping do they become inadequate? Over what period of time? What are the 161-16

impacts? What is the mitigation plan to avoid such impacts? These same questions need to be answered for the Preferred Project 'Plus'.
The Salinas Valley Water Coalition supports the Agency in their development of a Drought Contingency Plan and believes it is a necessary component for the successful implementation of the Salinas Valley Water Project. The DEIR/DEIS does not fully define a 'drought contingency plan' and it should. The plan should be based on specific criteria for what determines a drought, or other water shortage emergency and the plan should define the specific goals it will achieve. It needs to be clear to the public, exactly what the Agency's objective is implementing the drought contingency plan. Is the Agency developing a policy and plan, which will require the subsequent adoption of an ordinance to implement the program once the "trigger", is pulled?

7. No Action - Total Demand Management:
This section discusses the Agency actions in the absence of a physical solution. It is stated that the MCWRA has not made determinations of how reductions would occur, and at the same time it states, "in order to stop 161-17

seawater intrusion and balance the Basin, it is assumed that a 30 to 50%

7

AR 02776

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-791 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

reduction in existing ground water pumping would be required." The DEIR/DEIS does not provide any documentation to support this statement. On what basis was 30 - 50% reduction assumption determined? The 161-17
DEIR/DEIS should be amended to clarify that no determination has been
made nor any analyses, hydrological or environmental, completed which .(cont'd)
would support a uniform basin-wide pumping reduction.
It is stated that under the No Action - Total Demand Management Altemative,
seawater intrusion would be stopped and the Basin would be brought into forced hydrological balance. The DEIR/DEIS fails to provide any documentation which shows that seawatér intrusion would be stopped using a Total Demand Management Alternative, and under what operational 161-18
scenario. Again, the DEIR/DEIS must be amended to either clarify this statement or delete it, as there is no scientific basis for it.
The DEIR/DEIS does not fully evaluate environmental impacts associated with a Total Demand Management Alternative. The Final EIR/EIS must inform the public and decision-makers that in order to implement a Total Demand Management Alternative a separate, independent EIR would need to be completed. This separate EIR would then analyze the environmental impacts associated with a Total Demand Management Alternative along with 161-19
analyzing the various pumping reduction scenarios which could achieve the alternative's stated goal(s). CEQA requires the Agency to examine the individual activities to determine the significant adverse impacts associated with the individual activity. The SVWP DEIR/DEIS does not fulfill this requirement with regards to the Total Demand Management Alternative, and the Final EIR/EIS must clearly state this.
8. Water Rights: The proposed Preferred Project includes the diversion of surface water and it is stated that the Agency will be required to obtain a permit from the State Water Resources Control Board. Is a water right permit 161-20
required for the spillway modification component and/or the reservoir re- operation component, and/or are amendments to any existing water to right
permits required?
It is our understanding that in granting water right permits, the SWRCB must determine under what conditions water may be taken and used, and a permit is issued when the SWRCB has determined that the proposed appropration will best serve the public interest. In deciding whether to issue permits, the SWRCB considers the needs of the proposed project, existing rights and uses of water within the proposed area, and the protection of the environment. If the SWRCB determine that the use of the water applied for 161-21
by the MCWRA is available, would best serve the public interest, is in
accordance with the CEQA, and would not impair existing rights, then a permit is issued.

The appropriation of water is govemed by laws and procedures which, together, allow for the orderly development of the state's water resources

AR 02777

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-792 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

while protecting existing right holders, and guarding against waste and • unreasonable use. The Monterey County Water Resources Agency must recognize the prior water rights of individuals when considering the
implementation of any proposed Project. This recognition and the evaluation
of significant impacts to these rights, should be assessed within the scope of EIR/EIS. The approval of any project must also provide recognition; and protection of, existing water rights. Without this recognition and protection, implementation of the project will not be possible. 161-21

The Final EIR/EIS should include a discussion of this recognition and (cont'd)
protection with regards to the proposed surface diversion and the proposed spillway modification and re-operation of the reservoirs. It is important that • individual landowners and water right holders are provided the assurance that
the proposed project will not interfere with their rights.

It is through the EIR/EIS that the public and the Agency will be informed regarding the
impacts of the proposed Project, its. components and the associated mitigation measures necessary, including ones necessary to make the individual landowners
whole. The Salinas Valley Water Coalition supports full environmental review of the Proposed Project and appreciates the opportunity to comment on the draft document. We support the development and implementation of the Project as proposed predicated on the above issues, questions, etc., being appropriately addressed. The Community of the Salinas Valley must continue to work together to successfully implement the project that will provide a solution to our water problems and meet the long-term needs of the
basin.

LETTER 161

Salinas Valley Water Coalition
August 28, 2001

161-1 Through the SVWP, the MCWRA seeks to achieve the greatest improvement of hydrologic balance possible while meeting the other project objectives of halting seawater intrusion and providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future (2030) needs. As described on pages 5.3-22 through 5.3-25 of the Draft EIR/EIS, Alternatives A and B are both expected to result in an increase in groundwater storage; thus, implementation of either of these alternatives is expected to more than balance groundwater pumping and recharge.
161-2 Completing only the Nacimiento Dam spillway modification would not meet the project objectives of stopping seawater intrusion and providing adequate water supplies to meet current and future needs. Therefore, it is not analyzed separately (i.e., as a project alternative) in the Draft EIR/EIS. However, the impacts of this modification are discreetly evaluated in the Draft EIR/EIS, and the document could be used to approve this element of the overall project. The size and level of spillway modification included in the Draft EIR/EIS would meet the existing needs of Zone 2/2A, as a component of the overall project. A facility sized to meet only flood control requirements has not been studied as this would not meet overall project objectives of reoperation to halt seawater intrusion.
161-3 The Draft EIR/EIS focuses on combinations of components, including spillway modification, that could achieve the project objectives. As noted in response to
Comment 161-2, the spillway modification is not evaluated separately in this
EIR/EIS because it would not, in itself, achieve the project objectives. Evaluation of potential alternative sizes of a spillway-modification stand-along project, absent the SVWP, and the levels of flood protection associated with each would need to be addressed in a planning-level study, (if such a proposal were to be advanced) which is beyond the scope of this EIR/EIS.
The commenter's correction to the typographical error in Section 3.2,1 has been noted in Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS.
161-4 Any change in the Flood Rule Curve at the existing Nacimiento Reservoir wouldnot require any change in the operations and maintenance costs associated with the existing Necimiento Dam. However, any structural modification made to the Nacimiento Dam to meet new Flood Rule Curve Requirements, will require an increase in operations and maintenance costs associated with the structural

• modification to Nacimiento Dam. These new operation and maintenance funding
requirements will require a positive outcome of a Proposition 218 ballot procedure.

2-794 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Any capital costs associated with the construction of a spillway modification will also require a positive outcome of a Proposition 218 ballot procedure. It is anticipated, that the Monterey County Water Resources Agency will initiate the preparation of a Proposition 218 ballot procedure in calendar year 2002 to fund capital costs associated with a structural modification and follow-on operations and maintenance
costs.

161-5 The Draft EIR/EIS is focused on the attributes of a project that would achieve the project purposes. To this end, it describes how the modification of the Nacimiento Dam spillway would enable the reservoir reoperation that would be necessary to
achieve the project purposes in combination with the other structural components of the project. This description does not preclude reoperation of the reservoirs, should the spillway modification be implemented in the absence of approval and implementation of the SVWP; nor does it mean that reservoir reoperation would necessarily occur in the absence of the SVWP. Should the SVWP not be
implemented, the MCWRA would need to separately evaluate the specific reservoir operation that would achieve optimal flood control and water conservation purposes. However, this is not an alternative to the SVWP as it would not attain project objectives. For these reasons, the analysis of a spillway-only project is not
evaluated in the EIR/EIS.

161-6 See responses to Comments 19-5 and 149-8. Reservoir reoperation would not significantly change the high-flow regime downstream of the reservoirs, and channel flows would remain within the existing range of channel flows. As noted on page 5.3-58 of the Draft EIR/EIS, flood events under both Alternative A and Alternative B for the 46-year hydrologic period modeled were compared with channel capacity for the assessment of project impacts, and it was determined that both alternatives
would have a less-than-significant impact on downstream flooding. The 46-year hydrologic period included flood events in 1958, 1973, and 1983 that were similar
in magnitude based on rainfall data at King City and Salinas to the 1995 flood
event referenced by the commenter.

161-7 See response to Comment 119-5.
161-8 The Section 404 permit for channel maintenance work in the Salinas River specifies that channel maintenance work cannot be conducted when the channel contains
water. Therefore, under current channel maintenance activities, there is cessation
of releases from the reservoirs, resulting in the river channel drying for a period of approximately 6 to 8 weeks in September and October, allowing access to the channel for maintenance. Under the reoperation of the reservoirs proposed for Altemative A, there would be no cessation of releases in September and October.
Channel maintenance work could be conducted outside the wet river channel, but
only on a modified basis. Based on historic hydrology, the channel would be dry for a period roughly every 2 of 5 years and at that time maintenance activities would be
able to mimic current activities more fully. The presence of rivers flows in the
Salinas River will prevent the growth of in-channel vegetation and the
development of in-channel sand bars that could be removed in a dry channel
AR 02780

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-795 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

under a channel maintenance program. Thus, flooding potential is not expected to
change.

161-9 See response to Comment 161-6. The SVWP is expected to have a less-than- significant impact on downstream flooding. Also, as described in responses to Comments 131-4 and 149-24, specific operational parameters for releases and downstream diversions would be based on real-time conditions that would occur.
Projections of month-to-month or week-to-week releases of water from the
reservoirs would be determined by the Reservoir Operations Committee of the MCWRA based on real-time water-demand and climatic conditions.

161-10 See response to Comment 161-6. Hydrologic modeling for the proposed project has shown that 10-year and 25-year flooding events remain in the channel.
161-11 The proposal is to divert maximum of approximately 12,800 AFY of surface water. The total diversions for year would depend on the amount of water available for diversion, based on a number of factors, such as rainfall conditions, previous ycars' hydrology, and the volume and timing of releases for flood control purposes and to meet in-stream flow requirements. The modeling of project operations included some years in which high diversions were possible and others in which diversions were curtailed, resulting in the average diversion amount of 9,700 AFY for the 46- year modeling period reported in the Draft EIR/EIS. The project effects reported in the Draft EIR/EIS encompass the full range of changes in reservoir levels and flows expected under different hydrologic conditions and include maximum, average, and below average deliveries. The impacts of deliveries of 12,800 AF would not differ from deliveries of 9,700 AF; both are based on the variety of factors that allow the deliveries while meeting mitigation requirements, including fish flows.
161-12 See response to Comment 3-3. As indicated in that response, substantially more recycled water will be produced than can be delivered to the CSIP area and than is assumed to be delivered in the future under implementation of the SVWP. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the amount assumed in the analysis of SVWP operations would not be available, 11,000 AFY was delivered in the most recent water year. As to the possibility of CSIP not delivering sufficient water, if this were the case the MCWRA would need to evaluate all options available to halt seawater intrusion and if: proposed solution wete to result in increase environmental impacts, additional CEQA review would be needed prior to any approvals.
161-13 The monitoring program to determine the success of the SVWP in halting seawater intrusion would be a modification of the efforts currently employed by the MCWRA, as described in Section 3.2.7 of the Draft EIR/EIS. Alternative A is the preferred alternative that is currently being contemplated for implementation. MCWRA would
determine if the monitoring results showed project success or the need for additional improvements. There would be separate environmental documentation if future monitoring indicated that an expansion of the SVWP were necessary to halt seawater
intrusion. Future environmental review would include, but is not limited to, an

evaluation of impacts on hydrology, habitat, water quality, wetlands, aesthetics, cultural resources, and air quality. Please also see response to Comment 3-9.
161-14 See Master Response MR-5 for description of water management measures that are currently in place in the CSIP area. See response to. Comment 3-4 regarding
assumptions about future water conservation efforts incorporated into the modeling of SVWP operations. As noted by the commenter, the Draft EIR/EIS states that continuation of pumping management is necessary to ensure the project's effectiveness; however, the water management measures are part of assumed existing conditions. Future pumping is assumed to be reduced by the amount of water delivered by the project; this water would replace groundwater. Therefore, there is assumed to be no impact to agriculture as a result of the project. See also Master Response MR-1 concerning pumping reductions in the CSIP area.
161-15 See response to Comment 161-14. If expansion of the delivery system were
required in the future, it is anticipated that pumping limits would be applied in the expanded delivery area and that they would be designed to restrict pumping by the amount of delivered water. However, given the uncertainty of the need for an expanded system and the conceptual nature of the proposal, it would be premature to speculate on this level of detail of future operations at this time.
161-16 The evaluation performed for the Draft EIR/EIS encompasses project operations during drought conditions identical to those of the historical record, and is sufficient for identifying whether the project will be successful in halting seawater intrusion (based on the best available modeling).• Drought is, essentially, considered those times when water is unavailable for delivery through the diversion facility. The modeled years encompass periods of wet weather and drought, including severe drought conditions over the 46-year period of record.
There is no guarantee that more severe droughts will occur in the future, but by the same-token so may periods of wetter weather than modeled. As discussed previously, there are limitations to modeling, but this is the best available information short of operating the project and monitoring its success. Further, there
are no "impacts" of the project on seawater intrusion if the modeling is not accurate; rather the project would be less successful at halting seawater intrusion but. groundwater conditions would still be improved compared with existing conditions.
See response to Comment 20-3 regarding the MCWRA's intended operations under drought conditions.

161-17 Please see Master Response MR-1.

161-18 Please see Master Response MR-1.

161-19 Impacts of all five alternatives, including the Total Demand Management alternative, 5
are described in the Draft EIR/EIS to the degree necessary to make an informed decision with respect to the preferred alternative and the other alternatives. If a Total Demand Management project were to be pursued further, it would need to be 02782

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-797 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

much more extensively defined and evaluated, including completing appropriate environmental review in compliance with CEQA. The SVWP EIR/EIS is not
intended to be the only document needed to approve a Total Demand Management scenario; if it were to become a proposal the MCWRA pursues to halt seawater
intrusion.

161-20 The spillway modification does not require obtaining a water right permit or amendment from the SWRCB. The existing water rights permit allows storage of up to 377,900 AF at Nacimiento and telease of up to 180,000 AFY. Neither of these would change under project conditions.
161-21 Provisions of the California Water Code prohibit junior water right holders from interfering with the exercise of water rights held by senior water right holders. It is not necessary to analyze project effects on prior water rights because the SVWP would be precluded by law from causing such interference.

SUBJECT: Response to Draft EIR/EIS re: proposed Salinas Valley Water Project

Dear Gentlemen:
As President of the CAL-SHASTA Boat Club on Lake Nacimiento, I am writing to Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). address our concerns regarding the proposed
Our first objection is the summary statement that recreational usage is secondary to your proposed SVWP. It is our: understanding that the original license to develop Lake 162-1
Nacimiento does not minimize recreational uses as secondary, nor does it prioritize one use as superior to others. Your interpretation that the proposed SVWP will result in impacts to recreation that will be "significant and unavoidable" is inappropriate. (Chapter 162-2 2.3 & 2.4) We believe that in light of the original licensure the plans should be revised to mitigate the anticipated negative effects.
Your Draft EIR notes significant anticipated urban development in the Salinas Valley. At the same time you discuss the problem of over-pumping the aquifers within the Valley. Won't further growth require more aquifer pumping? Is the water from Lake Nacimiento intended to support this growth? Isn't it standard policy to tie growth to known 162-3
available resources? We do not believe the 1955 State Licensure for Diversion and Use
P of Water at Nacimiento gives Monterey County the right to divert water from Lake

AR 02784

Nacimiento for domestic uses over that of recreational usage. Again the utilization of this resource cannot subjugate one usage over another. 162-8

In Chapters 2.2.5 and 3.2.5 you discuss Pumping Restrictions. These relate only to areas
receiving project water. Restrictions need to be placed on all pumping within the Valley 162-4
or the problem with salt water intrusion will continue. This needs to be addressed within
the EIR.

The Spillway Modification (Chapter 2.2.1) will allow Nacimiento Reservoir to store a greater volume of water in years of adequate rainfall. This additional water, and any gathered during the winter in the seasonal diversion structure, (another point which needs to be addressed in your EIR), should be the resource delegated for release during the irrigation season We believe that your proposed "Reoperation" plan to release additional water beyond the current release curve, and any additional water stored due to the 162-5
Spillway enhancemnent, is unjustified. Following this guideline will prevent substantial degradation of the recreational opportunities at Lake Nacimiento and San Antonio. We believe that mitigation is not only "feasible" (chapter 2.3 & 2,4) but is necessary.
In Chapter 1.4.1 you state "no subsequent CEQA or NEPA review would be required for the proposed action after the certification of this EIR/EIS." We believe that stipulating to • .162-6
this. will potentially prevent any discussion of future alternatives, and we do not wish to acquiesce without further discussion of your plans.

Chapter 1.5.4 relating to the potential degradation of fire protection by hampering the
Fire Department's boats to reach lakeside structures also needs further discussion. These boats have the potential of reaching lakeside structures long before the CDF. Following 162-7
your proposed Reoperation Guidelines, and thereby preventing their utilization, is a significant public safety hazard-one that Monterey County could potentially be charged
accountable.

Lastly, the policy that established a 3:1 empty space pool for Nacimiento over San Antonio needs to be evaluated. The 2000 revision of the San Antonio Flood Rule Curve
unfairly penalizes Lake Nacimiento with already substantially lower lake levels. We feel 162-8
that this policy needs review, and any additional plan which further magnifies this discrepancy has our opposition.

LETTER 162

Cal-Shasta Club, Inc.
No date

162-1 The State Water Resources Control Board issued License No. 7543 to the MCWRA
on August 6, 1964 for diversion and use of water from Nacimiento Reservoir. The license gives the MCWRA the right to store 350,000 AF (recently increased to 377,900 AF) and use up to 180,000 AF of water from Nacimiento Reservoir for irrigation, domestic, municipal, industrial, and recreational uses. Based on the special bond election on April 26, 1955, the priority uses for Nacimiento Reservoir were
established as flood control and water conservation. This bond measure was
approved by voters in Zone 2 of the Monterey County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District, now known as the Monterey County Water Resources
Agency.

162-2 Please see Master Responses MR-2, MR-4, and Chapter 3.0 for a discussion of
revisions to the hydrology analysis that shows a lesser (but still significant) effect on lake levels and a discussion of potential measures to mitigate recreation impacts.
162-3 MCWRA has water rights to release 180,000 AFY from Nacimiento and the project would be within these rights. Urban growth is projected to occur in the Salinas Valley as described in the Draft EIR/EIS, particularly in Section 7 (growth inducement) and the project would facilitate some of that growth through the halting of seawater intrusion.

162-4 As stated in Section 3.2.5 of the Draft EIR/EIS, pumping restrictions are in place for those water users who receive direct water deliveries from CSIP to manage and limit their water use, and such restrictions would continue under the SVWP, to limit
pumping by those who are receiving surface water supplied by the project. Water conservation is already practiced throughout the Salinas Valley, and is expected to continue in the future. See Master Response MR-5 for more information about measures being taken by the MCWRA to manage water resources and about other water conservation efforts in the Salinas Valley.
162-5 See response to Comment 74-2. In addition, please note that the presence of migrating steelhead during winter would preclude the impoundment of water at the seasonal diversion structure during winter; therefore, the structure is proposed for operation only during April through October. See also master Response MR-2 regarding mitigation of project effects on recreational uses at Nacimiento Reservoir.

162-6 The statement that "no subsequent CEQA or NEPA review would be required for the proposed action after the certification of the EIR/EIS" is correct. Future 5

environmental review would be required for an expanded distribution system, but

Sherman Ellis, 4642 Smugglers Pt., Paso Robles, CA 93446
My name is Sherman Ellis. I live in Heritage Ranch. 163

I'm going to refresh what was brought up. at the meeting in

4 Paso Robles, and with your permission, I'm going to look at

5 this problem from the farmer's point of view. .In Paso Robles

6 you • were told that we will suffer approximately a hundred
million dollars worth of damages, This number is growing. 163-1

8 We're taking additional inputs from city businesses and 'other

9 places, so you're going to deal with a damage of somewhere

'10 between a hundred million and whatever it grows to.
11 I explained that this was pretty easy to mitigate by
simply installing a rule curb on the bottom of your discharge

13 pian in your model at 740 feet. There's only 30,000 acre-feet

14 of water difference between that number and what you planned . P
15 to do, and I'm going to now put oñ my farmers hat for my

16 brother who lives up around Greenfield with a ten-thousand

17 acre farm, with your permission.

18 I look at the table on 5.8-20 which is in the 163-2
19 Ordinant A so we can simplify the conversation. I'm going to

20 talk only about Lake Nacimiento, but I realize that San
Antonio is being de-watered in a serious way also. .The only

22 difference, is my brother tells me that lives down in Heritage

23 Ranch, that San Antonio doesn't have homes around it; whereas

24 Lake Nacimiento does have homes around it, over 1,700 there,

25 he tells me, are already built in Heritage Ranch alone, not

1 taking in account for those at other places in the lake.
These are not, he tells me, water.skiers but people who have
permanent homes. The average value is $200,000.
Now, he told me this so that I can take a look.at
what was going on up here and see really, is this in the best
interest of the farmers to do what we're talking about for

such a little thing. I'm looking at your proposed changes in

8 average monthly surface elevations. I realize these are
averages. I realize they have some numbers in them. I'm a

10 graduate engineer and have been through, before I got to

11 farming, I got through some pretty tough courses at the
12 University of Michigan. One of them had to do with 163-2

13 statistics. By including odd numbers, drastic numbers, in the

14 mix of data, then you get an average which includes things

15 that can be handled separately, particularly if these numbers

16 are way out from the normal curve.

17 In this case, by including numbers having to do with

18 floods and numbers having to do with a situation of drought

19 which is very easily handled if the number is set aside,

20 nobody has to worry about a drought that you can't do much

21 about it anyway, and obviously we're not going to overflow the

22 dam and get into a flood control problem. So those kind of

23 numbers can be set aside. As far as the flood condition is

24 concerned, I'm looking at this chart and heard what you told

25 me this morning about the flood control rule being changed

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

AR 02791

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-806 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 where you can take 789 acre-feet as the, rather, I'm sorry,
789 feet as the new flood control limit. If you look at this

chart that was handed out, then you're going to gain close to
64,000 acre-feet' of water.

5 I'd like to ask as farmer, why we should expose

6 ourself to a hundred plus million dollars in damages to these
folks down there because my brother doesn't care for that, and

8 based on the averages, we're going to start January on

9 Ordinant A with 739 acre-feet. That's a long way from 789

10 feet, which is a flood problem. So there really isn't any

11 problem on the average: I know that there are numbers above

12 it and numbers below it on a data situation. When you deal 163-2

13 with averages, half of them say you will be worse off and half

14 of them say you'll be better off, so, however, in depicting

15 what averages are, that's what you would do in the average

16 time or there's something wrong with the preparation.

17 I want to ask, why de-water the lake during January,

18 February, and March. If you look there, we're taking out in

19 January, 15 feet; February, 14 feet; and March 13 feet. I'd

20 like to keep that water in the bank So it will be available to

21 me when I'm growing broccoli in the summertime. Doesn't seem

22 like there is any flood control problem on the average, so why

23 release it in the spring/runoff and go into the ocean? On a

24 common sense basis, a different mind, the engineering data 'and

25 some of those other things just doesn't make any sense to put

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-807 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 water in the spring runoff and go into the ocean, and yet we

2 say we will do that on the average every year. I'd like to

M. : know why I shouldn't have more water available for me in case
we have bad rainy season. and we have a lack of moisture.. I

5 want to keep raising what I'm raising there in that farm by
Greenfield. There's only 10,000 acres there, but I still need

water.
I noticed that you don't raise the, this little dam
up here by Fort Ord in your diversion facility until April.

10 In the.meantime, we've thrown right now 240,000 acre-feet into

11 the ocean. Why can't you raise that dam a month earlier and

12 of the rain off, some of the runoff? There ain't 163-2 catch some

13 much water pardon my southern accent, farmer's talk

14 there is not much water going in that diversion facility.

15 9,700 feet is a relatively small amount in a dam that's

16 holding 378,000 acre-feet, so there's not much water really
I think 17 going to the diversion facility, relatively speaking.

18 that diversion facility is a good idea because the problem is

19 there near Castroville where those folks are growing that

20 stuff up there and had been pumping for a long time and that's

21 where that seawater problem came from. . It came from

22 over-pumping right there next to the ocean, and it's been

23 going on for 50 years, and I'm glad that you folks are going

24 to do something about it, but as a practical measure, there's

25 about 64,000 feet that can be captured by this new rubber dam

. ..

1 you're putting in down there at Lake Nacimiento. That's a
good idea. Those folks down there think it's a good idea down
there too, but if you look at this chart, on the average,

4 you'11 very seldöm get up to where you're going to capture

5 that water because that water is the water that would be up

6 close to 800 feet, and if in January you're operating at 739
feet on the average, how do you ever expect to get any good

8 out of that rubber dam that us farmers are going to have to

9 pay for when we buy those bonds to finance this thing?

10 If you're going to capture some water, you're going

11 to have to keep more water in the lake in the first place and
12 that's a heck of a good idea because then we would have some 163-2

13 water in case w have no rain later this year or we have a bad

14 year next year. And yet look at this chart, says you're

15 going to take that lake down to' 715 feet. That is only 16

16 percent of the capacity of that lake. So if you de-water the

17 lake on the average every year, how are you ever going to get

18 back up to where the rubber dam will do you any good? My

19 brother tells me that the folks down there want to cooperate;

20 that they feel that this salt water intrusion is a reäl

21 problem and we feel for those folks. We don't want to have to

22 see them build a desalination plan up there and bring nukes in
23 California to do it. The only difference between the two

15 1989 as a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, and it'g

16 primarily proposed of property owners from surrounding

17 lakeside residential communities along with other interested

18 property owners and businesses in the vicinity of Nacimiento.

19 The committee's prime objective has always been and

20 still is the fair consideration of all beneficially uses of

21 the water in Lake Nacimiento, and with that objective in mind,

22 we offer the following: The project EIR does not acknowledge

23 the level of environmental impact in San Luis Obispo County; 165-1

24 fails to address the wide array of environmental impacts

25 including those to species, natural resources and recreation. 165-2

The project EIR does not acknowledge the wide array of water
use in San Luis Obispo County which would be adversely 165-3
3 affected by the project, are recognized beneficial uses of

4 water and are entitled to be protected and mitigated against

5 in such an EIR..

6 More importantly, this project would not be necessary
but for years of failed management by the Monterey County

8 Water Resource Agency. The agency is asking us and this EIR

9 to make up for years of bad management, failure •to meter and

10 charge appropriate rates for irrigation water and failure to

11 plan for, appropriately for growth. The project alternatives

12 selected is not the least environmentally impacting and shoula

13 be rejected in favor of local projects in Monterey County such 165-4

14 as proper water use planning, increasing retention facilities

.
15 to build, excuse me, to better apply and store water in the

16 rainy season and enhancement of the water recycling project.

17 These points and others will be addressed in detail in our

18 written comments and I thank you very much on behalf of NARMAC

19 for the opportunity to speak before you this afternoon.

Association that she just mentioned, and as a result of that,

2 I sit on the reservoir operations committee that your agency

3 has created; and last but not least, I'm a property owner and
a homeowner at Läke Nacimiento and have been for 20 years,

5 more than 20 years.
The environmental document that's out for review has 80
many places that are, that need comment and there is not

8 sufficient time, sO I'm just going to hit the three areas

9 that, that I think.are important. One of them deals with the

10 basic problem definition on objectives; secondly, the

11 recreation area; and thirdly, the re-operation portion. The

12 problem, the EIR identifies the problem of seawater intrusion

13 and talks about the fact that it's caused by over-drafting,

14 and that the solution is to balance, as they say in there, the
15 re-charge rates and the pumping, and then the balance of the

•16 whole report goes a hundred percent of talking about how to 166-1

17 only deal with the re-charge rates and nothing about the

18 over-pumping, and I think that's an oversight in the well,

19 it's not an actual oversight because later on in the report

20 they talk about conservation measures that were reviewed and
rejected in the 1998 EIR, and I went back and dug that out and
looked, and the reason that it was rejected as stated in the

23 $98 EIR was because indirect economic effects on the

24 agricultural practices; practices and support industries would

25 have been devastating to local and regional economies. I

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

found that pretty interesting because nowhere in the report is
economic impacts of this project on San Luis County or the
lake, and the lake; however, there's a part of the project 166-1

4 that was •totally rejected because it was an economic problem (cont'd)

5 for this county, a little inconsistency there. It seems to me

6 that. some faction of conservation measures should be included
in this project to work along with it, and that's just not

8 done .

0 The second point I wanted to talk about is the
10 recreation. Again, the EIR reports recreation as being

11 secondary, and I went back I like to keep a lot of old

12 documents and things BO I went back and looked at the

13 original permit from the State of California for your agency

14 to retain water, the water rights permit, and the purpose of

15 that, the purpose of the construction of the dam per that

16 permit was for irrigation, domestic, municipal, industrial and 166-2

17 recreational uses, SO it's not secondary; it's right there

18 with all the other uses. Two years ago or so, the agency made

19 a request to increase their right to trap water behind the

20 dams. They found out that the size of the dam was really

21 bigger than they thought it was, SO they went to the state to

22 get 27,000, the right to store 27,000 more acre-feet of water,

23 and in the application for that permit, they stated that the

24 application, let's see, "water under this application will be

25 used for the purpose of recreation after regervoir and will

11 TRI-COUNTY URT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

AR 02799

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-814 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 also be released for percolation." Now here, recreation is
right up in number one and doesn't talk about select control

3 or conservation or all the other things you say that 166-2

4 recreation is secondary too, SO I just thought that was pretty (cont'd)

5 interesting.

6 In terms of that, the report goes on to say that the
impacts on recreation are significant and unavoidable, and I

8 would agree they're significant. I would disagree that

9 they're unavoidable. The modification to the spillway will,

10 as Curtis pointed out earlier, create a possibility to raise

11 the flood curve and thereby store 12 more feet of water or

12 60,000 acre-feet as Curtis pointed out. That's fine if it

13 raing and the water is there, but if it's not there, there's

14 no additional water to divert down here at the Salinas at the

15 diversion structure. I think there's a three-operational

16 alternative needs to be reevaluated or looked at in terms of 166-3

17 other operational alternatives that would be dictated upon the

18 actual surface of the lake at the end of the rainy season; in

19 other words, currently the elevation is at 777 in January. If

20 next January after the spillway, whenever you get the spillway

21 made, if the elevation is not higher than that elevation in

22 January 1st, in other words, up towards the '89 elevation,

23 then there's no diversion made that year, and that way the

24 lake will be operated as it has been in the past except when

25 the additional quote water is gained; that also, I think, is

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 12

AR 02800

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-815 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 well, the model needs to be rerun under that scenario to
see what affect it has on both the lakes and the groundwater

3 basin and I suspect that you're still going to be able to
accomplish a positive groundwater flow, as you say, in the

5 basin and decrease the impact on the lake levels so they won't

6 be, in fact, unavoidable.
The report, just one other side, the report says that, 166-3

8 they use the ten-dollar word, "conjunctive use" takes (cont'd)

9 advantage of storing water in the ground so that you can use

10 it when there's dry seasons. I submit that this scenario

11 would take advantage of that same "conjunctive use" when

12 during those years where you were not able to do a diversion.:

13 The wet years where you can do a diversion, it's going to

14 affectively shore-up the groundwater and the dry years,

15 they'11 have to use, work out of the bank, the groundwater

16 bank.

17 I intend to submit written comments at a later date.

18 That's all the comments I have at this time. Thank you.

25 just highlight a couple of points, observations that we 've

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 13

AR 02801

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-816 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 made about the draft environmental document, but before I do

2 that, I'd like to commend the agency and the Army Corps for

3 moving forward on a project that is more cost effective and

4 has fewer significant, potential significant environmental

5 effects than projects that have been considered in the past.

6 Also, there are, probably everybody in this room is far more

7 familiar with the history of this valley and the projects that

8 have been proposed than I am, but it's my understanding that

9 the original project that was proposed when the dams were

10 originally built, involved some sort of surface diversion

11 delivery system to bring water from the reservoirs to the

12 northern part of the county and although this isn't exactly

13 the project that was contemplated at that time, it certainly

14 is in line with that general concept and in that sense it is

15 keeping, in keeping with the perks of the reservoirs as

16 originally conceived.

17 The first issue that I want to address is the

18 discussion in the environmental document regarding the

19 expanded distribution system. There is a statement in that

20 section, and I believe that's at page 3-23, 3-24. It talks

21 about, it states that it is assumed that deliveries would 167-1

22 occur under an expanded delivery system to areas to the

23 southeast of the CSIP. area. We believe that that text should

24 be revised. That statement should be deleted and the reason

25 for that is it's early to tell at this point where expanded

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

AR 02802

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-817 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

-

1 delivery would have the most beneficial effect in the future.

2 Presumably at some point in the future when modeling
determines that some expanded delivery system is required, at

5 that time there would be some sort of analysis to determine

6 where new deliveries would have the most bang for the buck,

7 the most benefit for the least amount of cost and. I think that
section of the draft environmental document should be revised

8

9 to say that that is what will occur, that in the future it

10 will be determined where the expanded deliveries could happen,

11 the maximum benefit for the least amount of cost, and the 167-1

12 reference to the area, to the southeast of the current CSIP (cont'd)

delivery should be deleted. If you think about it, southeast

13

; of the existing CSIP delivery surface is going to be areas,
14 southeast of .the service area is going to.include areas along
15 the river where one would expect that re-charge would be

16

17 quicker and that pumping may not have as great an impact on

18 seawater intrusion as it may in other areas where re-charge is

19 slower,' so that concept should be taken into account, it seems

20 to us, in that section of the draft environmental document

modified.

22 The second item is in the discussion of the potential
inundation effects and raised water levels is in an area near

23 the impoundment area, there seems to be some inconsistencies 167-2

24 in the discussion.

25 I think they are minor and can be
addressed quite easily. In the summary discussion, chapter

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) • 757-6789 15

AR 02803

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-818 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 two, there are statements that describe the impact of being,.
2 potentially raising water levels two feet within eight-hundred

3 to a thousand feet of the impoundment area, but when you dig a

4 little deeper into the text, there'g discussion of an increase

5 in four feet in areas closer to the impoundment area. That 167-2

6 minor inconsistency well, the summary could, seems to (cont'd)

understate the potential impacts to agricultural lands, and

8 that should be modified to make it consistent• with a more

9 detailed discussion in, I believe, it's in chapter 5.3.

10 Another issue related to the inundation area and the
ai impacts to agricultural lands nearby, the mitigations refer to
12 installing tile drains to, to drain the area. The question

13 that we have is who's going to pay for those? I know the cost

14 estimates don't include the estimates for the mitigation, but

15 it should be stated clearly in there that the expense won't 167-3

16 fall on the affected land owner, but it would fall on the

17 agency. I'm sure that will be addressed at the appropriate

18 time when more detailed information regarding costs of

19 mitigations comes out.

20 The final subject area that I want to address is the

21 draft EIR/EIS discussion of potential delivery pumping,

22 delivery area pumping management this is at page, I 167-4

23 believe, 3-24, 3-25 that portion of the EIR. The

24 environmental and it's also discussed in chapter five. The
25 environmental document with respect to water quality impacts

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 16

AR 02804

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-819 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 takes the approach that because the blended water with the
surface water diversion facility will be superior in quality
to the project water coming out of CSIP presently that the
potential impacts of applying this water to agriculture lands

5 is insignificant. We think that the more appropriate

6 comparison would be the comparison of the water quality that
would come from this project under alternative A with the

8 irrigation of agriculture lands with groundwater, with clean

9 groundwater as it's occurring in certain areas of the CSIP

10 delivery area right now. We also feel that the discussion of 167-4
11 delivery area pumping management should also discuss the legal
12 concept that's contained in the agency's enabling act, which

13 states that pumping can only be restricted or limited in

14 areas of the agency's, within, the agency's jurisdiction, when

15 there is an adequate substitute water supply and that concept
16. necessarily entails adequate quality and as well as quantity

17 and unless the water supply meets that standard contained in

18 the agency act, the pumping limitation, or pumping limits

19 cannot be imposed within an area of the agency's jurisdiction,

20 sO we believe that the draft environmental document should
address that issue as well. Once, again, General Farm

22 Investment is generally in support of this project and

23 encourages the agency to continue down the path towards the

24 adoption of the proposed project and looks forward to the

25 successful implementation of that project. Thank you very

Good afternoon. My name is Dan Heath, and I have been
in business at Lake Nacimiento for 30 years and watched it go
up and down for 30 years. I've been in business at Lake San

8 Antonio since 1992 and I'm one of the original members of the

9 Monterey County Water Resources Reservoir Operations Committee

10 who has played a significant role in these projects as a part

11 of our processes, and I'm really disappointed with this

12 environmental impact report. I'm also suspect of'
13 environmental reports. I will never get over the fact that

14 there was a environmental impact report done for them,

15 hydroelectric plan, at Nacimiento that said it will. never have

16 an impact on the operations of the reservoir. That couldn't

17 be further from the truth. The releases at Nacimiento today

18 are being handled and managed with the highest priority being

19 how much money the county can generate from the release of
water through the hydroelectric plan. So in general, I don't 20

21 trust EIR'S very much or the people who. write them.

22 The San Luis Obispo County Water Project known as the

23 San Luis Obispo Nacimiento Water Project, did an EIR a few

24 years back. It's really interesting. They would be taking

25 approximately twice the amount of water out of Nacimiento on

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 18

AR 02806

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-821 Response 10 Comments on the EIRJEIS

an average basis as this project. That is dependent on which

3 number you choose to accept from this DEIR, but if you use

4 9,700 acres, the San Luis Obispo project would take almost

5 twice as much out annually and yet their EIR claimed it would

6 have almost no impact on the surface elevation of the lake at

all. of course, I had some problems with that too because of
their computer models, and

to 0o think it's the computer models
that in this case that are big part of the culprit that lead

10 to confusion and my inability to understand what in the world

11 is going on here. Before I read this EIR, I would have said,
I understand this project.
12 It's basically a good project.

13 There are some problems that I have with certain aspects of

14 it, but generally it's a good project. It needs to be built.

15 It will take care of San Luis Obispo's needs, and it can fix,

16 to a certain degree anyway, the seawater intrusion water; but

17 when I read this document, I say to myself, well, depending on
what page

18 I decide to believe,'I'm not so sure whether it's

19 good or not. One thing that comes to mind right off the bat

20 though, I'm reminded of, back in the late '80's I was at a

21 meeting up here way back in the history of this whole process,

22. and one of the things that I noticed when I was looking at the

23 list of property owners affected in the Castroville area was

24 that it was a very small group of people, and they were not

25 farmers. They were people who lived in places like Marin and
Monterey County and San Francisco, very wealthy land owners

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 19

AR 02807

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-822 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 who probably have neyer been near a diesel tractor in their

2 life, and the one thing that is really missing to me in this

3 impact report is the fact that there's no mention of that.

4 How many acres are we really talking about protecting as

5 farmland in the Castroville area and who owns that acreage

6 and how are they benefiting from it? I suspect it's a 'very
small group of very wealthy individuals who lease their land

8 out, and this project is going to benefit that very small

9 wealthy group of people. Now, we 've heard a lot of people

10 around the lakes voice their concerns about economic impacts

11 on their property values and so on and so forth. I can tell

12 you that they're correct. If I believe the parts of this EIR

13 that say that San Antonio will be an average of 74 feet lower

14 than it is currently, I can tell you that that project, which

15 Monterey County is very involved in because it operates the

16 facilities there along with my small part of it, will never be

17 able to cover its expenses again. It will devastate it so bad

18 that it will cut the gross income by 60 percent and make it

19 impossible to operate it at less than a deficit of several

20 million dollars a year. I have a real problem with that if

21 this project is really being done to benefit a few very

22 wealthy people that live in San Francisco. That's not fair to

23 the rest of the, or the rest of the taxpayers of Monterey.

24 County. This project may not be SO fair to allow taxpayers in

25 Monterey County anyway, especially if they're the one's

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 20

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-823 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 footing the bill for the project and it's only going to

2 benefit a few wealthy people who just ought to be. made to shut

3 down their wells perhaps; after all, they are the individuals

4 who created this problem. I don't believe dt was Monterey

5 County Water Resources. It's the land owners. They overuse

6 their resources of their land, and they're the one's who
should have to pay the bill.

8 With those things in mind, I just want to, I realize

9 that this isn't a situation where you ask some questions, so

10 I'm not going to try to do that, but I spent hours and hours

11 and hours reading this document, and I'm going to spend more

12 and more hours reading it, and I'm probably going' to submit a

13 document to you that's.just as heavy as yours, and I hope you

14 enjoy reading mine' as much as I'm enjoying reading yours, but

15 here's a few things that demonstrate why I'm confused, and I

16 hope that they'11 make sense to everybody else. I've taken

17 some excerpts out of the EIR. It's not very many pages and in

18 reality; most of what's of value in it, that ERI could have

19 been written on this many pages, as far as I'm concerned. On

20 page 1-7 it says that "under 1995 conditions, approximately.

21 13,000 acre-feet a year are delivered. Well, •under 2,030

22 conditions, 15,900 acre-feet year are delivered." However, 168-1

23 on page 2-2 under "proposed action and applicant's preferred

24 alternative A," it says, "a seasonal diversion structure would

25 be constructed on the northern Salinas River to divert an

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

AR 02809

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-824 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 average of 9,700 acre-feet a year for irrigation." Well, that

2 doesn't match the page I just read, so I'm still confused. I

3 get to page 2-3 and I read about the pump station with a

4 capacity of 85 CFS. Well, that works out to 5,000 acre-feet a

5 month, so I'm having trouble now figuring out why it's 168-2

6 necessary to build a pump station that you can pump 5,000

acre-feet a month through when you're only going to divert

8 9,700 acre-feet a year. Then I move along to page 2-16, and I

9 look at some of these, some more information and it says, "the

10 impacts to Nacimiento reservoir because 20 to 21 percent of

11 the peak recreation days would be adversely affected by this

12 project," and yet knowing the way Nacimiento fluctuates and

13 goes up and down and whatnot, I'm still not relating how it's

14 really going to have a negative impact on the lake because

15 9,700 acre-feet isn't going to do it.' If you!d taken 9,700 168-3
16 acre-feet out of this year, it would have lowered it 18

17 inches. Well, that wouldn't hurt anything, but this document

18 says it's going to lower it by an average of 20 to 30 feet.

19 It also says it's going to lower San Antonio •by an average of

20 75 feet. If you took 75 feet of water out of San Antonio this

21 year, you'd be almost emptying the lake: It doesn't make any

22 sense to me. I can't get it to work out no matter how I look

23 at it. If I go to 3-11, I'm at the top of page 3-11, it says,

24 "the modifications to the Nacimiento spillway could, 168-4

25 specifically the preferred re-operation, would result in

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING.(831) 757-6789 22

AR 02810

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-825 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

approximately 29,000 acre-feet of additional stored water."

2 Well, based on the years that I've been talking about this

3 project and listening to things on it, I agree with that

4 completely. I think it might even be more than that. So my

5 logic tells me, if you're going to store 30,000 acre-feet away 168-4

6 more.and if you're going to divert 9,700 acre-feet, you're
plus 20. You're not negative a hundred and twenty-thousand

8 acre-feet of water between the two reservoirs. I think

9 Sherman Ellis in his comments pointed out some interesting

10 facts about floods and droughts, and I think that's where some

11 of these problems with your computer models are, but

12 nonetheless, there's a lot of statistics in this document that

13 don't add up and including, for instance, on page 3-11 it also

14 says, "approximately, 172,000 acre-feet of water would be

15 released for conservation purposes in an average year with the'

16 project in place, an increase of 30,000 acre-feet of water a

17. year." Now, the people in this room that work for the Water 168-5

18 Resources Agency know that this year the projected releases

19 are 170,000 acre-feet of water. We know that. So why does

20 this document say, with the project in place, there will be

21 172,000, an increase of 30,000? It's not valid, and if the

22 information in this document isn't valid, you can't or should

23 not adopt it. You need to fix it. When I look at page 3-12,

24 I'm further confused when I see things that say, at the top of 168-6

25 the page, you may remember I've read about 9,700 acres,

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 23

AR 02811

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-826 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

acre-feet a year, 15,000 acre-feet a year. At the top of this 168-6
page it says, "up to 12,800 acre-feet of water per year, (cont'd)
impounded water, would be diverted from the river via pumping
directly into the CSIP," so now we have one more number,

5 12,800, and that's on page 3-12. When I go down a couple of

6 paragraphs it says that "the maximum surface water diversion
7 to the CSIP service area would be approximately 65 cubic feet

8 a second over a 24-hour period." I'm not sure exactly what 168-7

9 that means because it doesn't make it clear. It also says,

10 "it appears that delivery of water would occur over an 18 to

11 24-hour period of operation.' 18 to 24-hour period of

12 operation when? Once a day? Once a week? All summer long 168-8

13 for six months? If it's all summer long for six months, it's

14 •40,000 acre-feet of water. Well, maybe the guy who wrote this

15 understands it, but I bet there's nobody else in this room

16 that could tell me what that means. I can't figure it out,

17 especially when I understand that the pumping station has the

18 ability to pump 5,000 acre-feet of water a month. That's just

19 a matter of mathematics.

20 To further confuse me, I kept on going. Now I got to

21 page 322 and it says, "agriculture needs, which make up a far

25 a year less, this thing is going to transfer 9,700 acre-feet;

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-827 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the lakes are going to be an average of 50 feet a month lower
than they are now and I still can't figure out where in the

3 world the water is going to because on page, 5.3-13 it says, 168-9

"Nacimiento reservoir storage levels. Under Alternative A, (cont'd)

5 the average monthly reservoir storage in Nacimiento would be

6 lower than under existing conditions. The Nacimiento storage

in the summer would be .approximately 50,000 acre-feet lower

8 and in the winter, 20,000 acre-feet lower." What are we doing

9 with it? I can't figure that out for the life of me. The

10 next paragraph says, "average monthly storage under this

11 project would be approximately 76,000 acre-feet lower than

12 existing conditions in the summer and the fall at San 168-10

13 Antonio." 74,000 acre-feet of water less. What are we going

14 to have, a ten-year drought or something? It's no wonder why

15 all these people who live down there are äbsolutely freaking

16 out. They should be.

17 Then moving right along, on page 5.3-16 under figure

18 5.3-8 it says, "higher release requirements for diversion and

19 re-charge during the irrigation months would result in up to

20 nearly 7,000 acre-feet per month of higher releases observed 168-9

21 from April through August." Well, I don't get that either.

22 Now, we're going to release 7,000 acre-feet a month? How do

23 you multiply that times five and get 9,700 acre-feet a year?

24 The Salinas River isn't going to change. There's only so müch

25 percolation you can get in that river. We know that. It's

pretty much been the same for a hundred years. Besides that,
this report, I just read in there that irrigation demand is
going to drop by 50,000 acre-feet, so then we have 5.3-47.
That's the page. The paragraph is "Monterey County Water

5 Deliveries. Alternatives A and B." The MCWRP is projected to

6 deliver now on this page we're going to deliver 25,600
acre-feet a year by the year 2030. Water users within the

B northern portions of the basin. To water uses, 15,900 of

9 which would be delivered directly during the spring and summer

10 peak irrigation season and 9,700 acre-feet a year which would 168-12

11 be stored for delivery during the water season. So somehow or

12 another we got to 26,000 acre-feet 30 years from now, even

13 though according to'everything else that I've been able to

14 find in this report, the actual use of water is dropping over

15 that 30 years, and the actual runoff into the ocean is

16 dropping by 10,000 acre-feet, and, I don't know; I guess I

17 have to go back to school and learn how to do math better

18 because I just don't get it. I'm going to, like I said, try

19 and make some sense of what I don't understand here and give

20 you a report on this, but I really hope you don't try to adopt

21 thi's EIR. I think you need to redo it just like the people in

22 San Luis Obispo County, and the two of you need to get

23 together and make sure that when they take 10,000 acre-feet of

24 water out of the lake, it has the same effect as when this

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-830 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 slide show this afternoon, the purpose and objectives of this
project are A, or number one, the halt of seawater intrusion;

3 two, to provide adequate water supplies to meet the needs out
to 20/30 and three, to improve the hydrologic balance 9o the
groundwater basin that's kind of a mantra that many of us
have come to repeat over the years. But with that in mind,
I'd like to focus my comments really in one area, and they'1l

8 become fairly apparent to you as I go through them.

9 With regard to halting seawater intrusion, we believe

10 that delivery to the CSIP area of the surface diversion will

11 not likely halt seawater intrusion. In particular, we believe

12 that it's going to have insufficient effect on intrusion in

13 the Marina and the Fort Ord areas. The agency's 1999 data

14 clearly indicates that there's a real and possibly an urgent

15 problem in the Marina and the Fort Ord area. In decreasing 169-1

16 pumping in the CSIP area, the Castroville area, that 12,000

17 acres that we're all very familiar with may help the overall

18 groundwater basin recover in decreased intrusion, but if the

19 project is implemented as designed, that is, phase one, as

20 again the slides indicated, this average with only deliveries

21 to the CSIP area, the Marina Fort Ord area, we believe, will

22 not receive the level of protection required to halt

23 intrusion, and as a result, the wells that currently provide a

24 hundred percent of the water to the Fort Ord area, will be in

25 danger of contamination. We believe that in order to meet the

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 28

AR 02816

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-831 Response 10 Comments on the EIR/EIS

project objective of halting intrusion, this level of
diversion in the incorporation of an expanded delivery system
outside of the CSIP area, which was portrayed today as phase
two of the project, which have been looked at 169-1

5 programmatically, is going to be required, and we say that the (cont'd)

6 longer the agency waits to come to this conclusion, the more
irreversible the damage will be in the areas that I'm speaking

8 to.

9 I comment on the monitoring program. The coastal

10 monitoring program is an integral component of any Salinas

11 Valley Water Project alternative. Current accurate

12 information about the status of location of intrusion must be

13 available to all water users in the basin. We believe that
14 the tailoring and the supplementing, as described in the EIR,

15 of the existing monitoring, will have to be very significant 169-2

16 to produce a strong program that is capable of providing

17 accurate documents of information about intrusion all along

18 the coast as far inland as necessary, and only with such a

19 complete and integrated monitoring eystem will we be able to

20 provide reliable data to be used to help determine the need

21 for additional facilities or management strategies. As an

22 enhanced monitoring program is essential to the success of the

23 Salinas Valley Water Project, we believe it deserves more

24 attention than this EIR and by the agency in general, and bÿ

25 the way, we have received and appreciate the two volume set

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 29

AR 02817

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-832 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 that we recently received with regard to the monitoring

2 program. We think that's a real good step in the right

3 direction. This EIR, however, we think needs to focus a bit

4 more on that monitoring program and have more explanation as 169-2

5 to the tailoring and supplementing that's going to be, that's (cont'd)

going to be needed to make it, to bring it up to the level•

that it needs to be.

8 With regard to the hydrologic modeling, we've heard

9 some comments already. We believe that before this project to

10 be supported as the preferred project to halt seawater

11 intrusion into the basin, it must be demonstrated that the

12 project is capable of halting intrusion, not merely in gross

13 basin inflow outflow calculations, but demonstrating intrusion

14 will be halted across the entire coastal basin interface.

15 Ultimately, the agency must not be persuaded to opt for the 169-3
16 least expensive alternative without a strong belief that once

17 implemented that alternative will completely solve a problem.

18 The water users in the Salinas basin cannot afford to wait to

19 learn whether or not the proposed preferred project; that is,

20 delivering diverted Salinas water to merely the CSIP area can

21 achieve the primary objectives of halting intrusion. This is

22 an especially imperative issue for the water users in the

23 Marina and Fort Ord area. Without a delivering system to

•24 provide diverted water to the Marina and Fort Ord area to be

25 used to reduce the amount of groundwater pumping in this area

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 30

AR 02818

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-833 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 as in the CSIP area to the north between Salinas and the

2 coast, intrusion is likely to continue its inland movement in

3 the 180 and the 400-foot aquifers. This.would have a

4 significant and costly impact on Marina Coast Water District 169-3

5 operations for our marina and for our Fort Ord customers who, (cont'd)

6 by the way, pays assessments and who presumably would be ask
to help pay for this project.

8 Just a brief word about previous agreements and
9 comments. The draft does not seriously consider the Marina

10 Fort Ord area for a basin management plan, Salinas Valley

11 Water Project alternative to groundwater pumping that's called

12 for in the 1993 and '96 annexation agreements that we're all

13 familiar with. Rather, the agency has described a project

14 that will provide distinct, direct benefits to the CSIP

15 growers and hopefully identifiable benefits to the Salinas 169-4
16 area in slowing or halting intrusion in that portion of the

17 pressure area, that is between Castroville, the CSIP area and

18 the city of Salinas, which is imperative. The agency'§

19 strategy as stated in the draft is to put this project in

20 place in the Castroville area now and wait for years as a more

21 comprehensive monitoring problem is completed to see if

22 seawater intrusion is indeed halted. We think it's doubtful

23 that this project is going to halt intrusion in the Marina

24 Fort Ord area. As can be seen if you look at, in the draft,

25 look at figures 1-2, 1-3 and 3.3, an overlay to those figures,

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789

AR 02819

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-834 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

and it's pretty clear that there's a real problem there, and
by focussing on the 12,000 acres in the CSIP area for
delivery, for a delivery system, is not going to have the
intended effect that will be needed to the south, to the 169-4

5 southeast. Clearly reducing pumping in the CSIP area will (cont'd)

6 have an insufficient effect to the south. In order to halt

the southern intrusion. front, again looking at figures 1-2 and

8 1-3, pumping in the 180 and the 400 aquifers will need to be

9 curtailed and/or supplemented by another source of water,

10 specifically to replace or augment the existing Fort Ord

11 wells.

12 The Marina Fort Ord has been identified by 'the county

:13 as an area of great economic importance. The redevelopment of

14 the former military installation of lands depends primarily on

15 the availability of reliable, sustainable water. Without such 169-5

16 a water source, the thousands of new housing units, the

17 hundreds of thousands of square feet of new educational and

18 commercial and industrial space, the thousands of new jobs

19 planned for former installation will be jeopardized. By

20 focussing on the proposed project components as described, the
21 Nacimiento spillway modification and reservoir re-operation,

22 the river diversion and the delivery to CSIP, I added the

23 solution to seawater intrusion in the basin as a means to

24 balance the basin hydrologically and as the source of water

25 supply out to 20/30; by doing that, we believe the agency

1 sends an incorrect message to the public, that this relatively

2 inexpensive project will be sufficient to achieve these
objectives. Hydrologic balance may be achievable in the
.Castroville area; but that has never been the objective of the
BMP process. The agency has historically sought to design,
build and. operate a project that would protect all basin water

users. Certainly the documented presence of accelerating
intrusion in the Marina Fort Ord area, more than 10 million
dollars paid to the agency which enabled in the Salinas Valley

10 Water Project, the voluntary commitments in the Marina Fort

11 Ord area to limit groundwater extractions, the only'special

12 alternative commitments in the entire basin and the critically

13 important role that this area played in this county's economy,

+5 14 all this argues for a project that provides a complete
15 solution. Can't wait many more years while more square miles

16 of irreplaceable aquifers storage is polluted to come to the

17 conclusion that the Marina Fort Ord area must be included in a
18 comprehensive solution,

19 Our district would respectfully request that the agency
20 consider moving forward with your project in committing 3
immediately to designing and evaluating and incorporating a
169-6 delivery system that is a system that is referred to today as

23 phase two that will bring supplemental water to where it is

24 perhaps most needed and that is the area to the southeast of
the current CSIP area, the Marina Fort Ord area. I thank you 25

5 Good afternoon. I'm speaker. number eight. Bob Jaques

Control Agency. Just some brief comments. The Pollution

8 Control Agency is strongly supportive of the Salinas Valley

9 water plan as an important step toward resolving water

10 problems in the Salinas Valley basin. We're proud of the

11 partnership we've had with Monterey County Water Resources
12 Agency in the development and operation of the Monterey County

13 water recycling projects which are currently providing over

14 10,000 acre-feet per year of the new water supply to help 170-1

15 solve this problem in the form of recycled water. We believe

16 the new water supply is clearly needed to eliminate seawater

17 intrusion in the Salinas Valley, and that the project has

18 proposed perhaps only the first of several steps in this

19 direction would help assure long-term availability of recycled

20 water not only for agriculture use in the current CSIP area,

21 but also in urban areas and other parts. of the county where

22 water shortage problems also exist.

2 JOHN LINDLEY, 75313 Interlake Road, Bradley, CA 93426 171

I.'m number nine and my name is John Lindley. I'm
representing myself as usual. I live in Monterey County just
north of the entrance to south shore of Lake San Antonio. I

have some comments regarding a, I think, a lack in the mission
in the EIR and some comments on some other things. All of my

9 comments have to do with a summary. I have not gone through

10 the total EIR, so my comments are a lot shorter, not too much

11 to worry about.
12 Ag a former volunteer disaster worker, I was concerned*
13 about the situation where we have wet years and we have floods
14 because of the change from worry about closures and no

15 fishing. Monterey County has had in recent times serious

16 flooding problems. We lost the bridge at Soledad here a few

17 years ago on Highway 101, substantial bridge; a lot of water,

18 a lot of topsoil as well, washed away from the fields that

19 were near the river, an economic loss to farmers. As you fly.

20 down the valley now, you can still see those spots where crops

21 are growing but clearly not to the extent they are elsewhere,

22 so it has been a long-term loss. We have examples in the

23 central valley where think the same year we had over a
24 hundred-thousand people that were - - because, not because of

25 rain that fell in the central valley but because the water

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 35

AR 02823

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-838 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 management people did not correctly estimate the amount of

2 storage they needed, and when the rains did come, they

3 released so much water that it flooded the people in the

4 central valley., This is a problem for me. I can't blame

5 mother nature for having caused floods, but when people cause
floods, I think it's a real sad thing. Certainly the cities
that let those people put houses in that flood plane are to

8 blame, the people that collected taxes in the special
9 districts for flood protection and.the managers of dams are to

10 carry some of that blame too. In any case, it seems to me

11 what you're proposing for Lake Nacimiento could be heading in

12 the same direction. You are increasing the spillway capacity,

13 in your words, to pass the most probable maximum flood event,

14 and you are intending to re-operate the dam SO that you are

15 going to have more water stored in the late part of the wet 171-1
16 season. All that is commendable as long as you don't have a

17 really strong late-year storm, and if you do, it sounds like

18 you're going to pass all that water out your new spillway into

19 the residents in the farmland of Salinas River valley, and

20 clearly this is going to cause the same balancing act of any

21 dam has of how do you keep it empty for. the floods and full

22 for the farmers and satisfy the fishermen as we'll? Right now

23 you are forced by the fact that your spillway is small, not to

24 have more room in the dam; therefore, as you raised the, as

25 you're allowed to raise the level of the dam, it seems to me

1 there's going to be more instances where. you're going to have

2 to have emergency releases of water. It seems like the water

3 that comes out may be a higher volume and more total volume

4 than previously; therefore, I strongly urge the EIR to address

5 the situation. 171-1

I may be overstating it. It may not be (cont'd)

6 correct because the data is not in here to assess what the
situation is going to be. So that's my first comment.
LO CO Next, I have much the same problems with some of the

10 things as one of the previous speakers in the summary section.

11 As a resident near the lake, I was very interested and I went
to the meeting in Paso Robles to find out how low was the lake

12 going to go? How long was it going to be low? What times a

.13 year was it going to be in that situation? Thèse simple

14 things are not really addressed in the summary at all. The

15 statements are made, but is 28, San Antonio would be 28 to 30

16

17 feet less than under existing conditions which really nothing 171-2

is said about lower existing conditions are and what that

18 means. Also there's the statement that was 38 percent would

19

will be reduced by 28 percent or 38 percent. 38 percent of

22 days or the four heavy Sundays and the Memorial Day, et

23 cetera. There's no way to take that figure and turn it into

24 anything that is, •that means anything, so a it's a problem in

25 the way this is written and' more information is needed. I did

2 might do it in a better fashion. The chart, 30 years up and

M• downs, is interesting, but it doesn't give you a quick

4 picture. It takes a lot of detail to do that.
My last comment has to do with something that Mr. Jacob

6 said in your introduction. believe you said that if you

7 went to adjudication that there would be a 30 percent
171-3 8 reduction in water. The way I look at table 1.2 which is on

9 page 1-7 of the introduction, it appears there's something

10 over, almost 500,000 acre-feet of water being pumped out of

11 the ground now. The overdraft is 17,000 acre-feet. That is a

12 little more than three percent needed to be made up. The

13 seawater intrusion which is 8,900 acre-feet, which you're

14 going to balance out by 9,800 acre-feet. That's a little less
than two percent of the total that's coming out. Some of the 15

16 other speakers said there isn't a lot of water that's needed

23 Company for the Salinas and King City districts. On behalf of

24 our company, I would like to thank both the agency and the

25 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the opportunity to comment on

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 38

AR 02826

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-841 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the drafting EIR. We will be providing written comments
before the August 7th deadline. I'm just going to touch

3 briefly on some of the concerns we have.
First of all, for those of you that don't know,

5 California Water Service is the largest urban water purveyor

6 in the Salinas Valley. We've been providing water service to
Salinas •and King City and surrounding areas since 1962. Cal

8 Water service area comprises over 29,000 service connections

9 and serves a population in excess of 115,000 people. We have•

10 been an active participant in the ongoing efforts to address

11 these complicated waters used for many years.

A.A First of all, I want to say that our company fully
supports the agency's objectives of Mr. Armstrong• mentioned

14 those, stopping seawater intrusion, providing adequate water

15 supplies to meet the current future year 20/30 needs and
the Salinas 16 providing the hydrologic groundwater basin in

17 Valley, and we are pleased the proposal alternative has been
18 developed to deal with. these objectives. We are concerned,

19 however, that the preferred alternative, that being A, on its

20 own falls short of addressing all the requirements set before

21 the Monterey County Water Resources Agency bÿ the State Water

22 Resources Control Board. You know it wasn't too long ago

23 that, that the Water Resource Control Board indicated that

24 they considered 'the problems facing the Salinas Valley
25 groundwater basin to be one of the most critical water

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 39

AR 02827

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-842 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 resources issues in California. That should not be ignored.
So with that in mind, I'm just going to briefly touch

over four concerns. that we have in the EIR. First of all, it

4 was the delivery options. While the project has been revised

5 to include a surface diversion facility in lieu of the

6 subsurface diversion, it continues to address both short-term
and. long-term solutions to the agriculture sectors only with

8 no word on deliveries. Cal Water believes that all delivery 172-1

9 options must include water for Salinas. Water supplied to

10 Salinas should be viewed as having a dual benefit, serving to

11 help mitigate seawater intrusion as well as providing an

12 alternative source of water that will help urban water
13 purveyors comply with the ever changing stringent water

14 quality regulations associated with groundwater pumping.

15 While we're on the topic of water quality, my second

16 issue is nitrate contamination. Nitrate contamination

17 continues to worsen in the Salinas Valley and does pose a

18 serious threat to domestic water supplies. In Salinas, alone

19 we currently have six wells out of service due to nitrate 172-2

20 contamination and we continue to experience escalating levels

21 in other wells. We're rrently working closely with our

22 consultants to help determine favorable locations for new well

23 sites and continue to explore the most feasible and cost

24 effective treatment method for nitrate contamination; however,

25 each of these scenarios will come in at a significant cost to

TRI-COUNTY COURT REPORTING (831) 757-6789 40

AR 02828

Salinas Valley Water Project 2-843 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

1 our payers. In King City alone, five out of the eight wells

2 are out of service due to nitrate contamination, It stated in

172-2 3 your EIR that the purpose of the preferred action is to
provide for long-term management. and protection for --.

5 groundwater resources in the basin. Urban water purveyors
need. that long-term reliable source of water and should not be
excluded from. any delivery project.

8 The third issue of concern is the additional water
deliveries to the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project area

10 or CSIP. We're concerned that the additional water deliveries

11 to the CSIP project may only raise water levels in the sea .sip

12 above sea level. While this seems like the intended goal, we

13 believe there's potential danger from the resulting hydrologic

14 mound. We believe this will accelerate or push a portion of

15 the intruded geawater into the 180-acre foot acquifer towards 172-3

16 Salinas. This may result in worsening the seawater intrusion

17 condition by increasing its rate of advancement. We believe

18 that the improperly abandoned wells with perforations in both

19 the 180 foot and 400 acquifers will only exacerbate the

20 problem.

21 Finally, our fourth concern is the Salinas River

22 re-charge conveyance and diversion issue. The EIR states that

172-4 23 the preferred project would provide an average of 29,000

24 acre-feet per year additional water for release in the Salinas

25 River. Of that amount, , 700 acre-feet of water will be

1 available behind the dam downstream in Spreckles for delivery

2 to agriculture users in the CSIP area. Due to the likelihood 172-4

3 that additional agriculture acres will come into production in (cont'd)

4 the future, we're concerned that there's no mechanism in place

5 to guarantee the continued deliveries of 29,000 acre-feet to

6 the project area and ultimately 9,700 acre-feet for diversion
for the CSIP project.

8 So quickly, to summarize, number one, the preferred
alternative that contains no component for urban water

101 deliveries; number two, nitrate contaminations continue to

11 degradate urban water supplies, a long-term reliable water

12 source is needed; number three, additional water deliveries

13 and reduction in pumping in the CSIP area will create a

14 mounding effect which has the potential of accelerating the

15 intruded seawater landward; and finally, contains no guarantee

16 that 29,000 acre-feet a year will be available for conveyance

17 and distribution. Thank you for your time.

m one is on page 1-9. This really is more of a comment: (cont'd)

4 There's a'line in' there that says, '"distribution to

5 agriculture sectors only regarding its project. No

point of discussion for funding at a later date, 8O I just
"If seawater 8 wanted to bring that up. Also on page 1.9.

10 the coastal urban areas, an expanded distribution system might
need to be delivered, might be needed to deliver Saiinas

That 13 We have a little trouble with that particular line.

16 that line to be somehow changed because we can't believe

17 that's going to be all the urbans fault in the future for any

18 seawater intrusion that would occur, so we believe that line

19 should be corrected.

20 Also in that particular area it talks about future in

21 expanded distribution system. It's not clear on who's going

22 to benefit from that future expansion, as to whether that's 173-3

23 going to urban or a combination or to the Marina coastal area.

24 It's just very vague. Who would pay for the system? It seems 173-4

2 some discussion about economice as.it pertains to this
project. If I understand correctly, there was a I'm new to

the area.. I've been here a year, so you're going to have to

5 give me a break. I don't know the history to a lot of these

6 projects. But it's my understanding that there was some form

7 of a Salinas Valley Water Project, project plan drafting

8 report October 1998, where it was actually containing a

9 nitrate floor plan within it.

10 This EIR has excluded that. That is highly important

11 to the City of Salinas and to its residents. As you heard a

12 moment ago from Cal Water, we have a nitrate problem and it is 173-5

13 continuing to grow. I'm working very closely with Cal Water

14 to try and find new well site locations that aren't
15 contaminated. That'g becoming very difficult to do. So we

16 believe it's a very important aspect to this EIR to have a

17 nitrate component to it, and I believe someone mentioned about

18 monitoring and other things earlier, one of the earlier

19 speakers. Also, someone else brought up about having troubles

20 in making some of the numbers work. I won't go into great

21 detail. I' had a gimilar problem, and I. would like to thank

1 In the population and housing 1.5.2 and then 1.5.4,

m just going to read these. This is an area that I can't make

sense of.. " The proposed action" and this is in 1.5.2, the
population of housing. » The proposed action, " meaning the
project, "would not directly alter the distribution or
density of population nor would it create a demand for

8 additional housing." It goes on to state about another

9 sentence or two later. "And no project features will alter

10 growth plans or support additional growth beyond what is

11 currently planned," meaning general .plans and their updates.

12 In the 1.5.4, the public services, on the 173-6 I'm okay with that.

13 same page "as previously noted, the proposed action has

14 potential to induce growth by providing additional water

15 supplies which would create an additional indirect need to

16 public services." These two statements don't match. One is

17 saying it's not going to produce any growth other than what

18 you're saying. The next one is saying it's going to be

19 inducing the end of the growth, which I'm reading as a, okay,

20 we're going to provide water for what's already on the coast.

21 We're not going to provide anything for the future. This is
22 saying you're providing beyond the future.

for agriculture in a very specific area, and we can appreciate
the fact they're trying to make some efforts in that

3 particular area, but the seawater intrusion is far greater
than the CSIP area. There needs to be some efforts made to
expand it way beyond what's currently being proposed. This
may be the cheapest at the moment, but we -- I can't say that
counsel has made this suggestion, but I would like to suggest
that maybe the project should include both phase one and phase 173-7

two .at this point if you're going to make a real effort to

10 help stop seawater intrusion. I believe it would be an

11 easier, well, nothing is going to be easy to justify, but I

12 think it would make a bigger impression that a real large

13 effort is being made on the project as a whole for the salt

14 water intrusion than one spot in the middle, so I think that

15 would be a better.

16 Also on page 7-9. It's seven - . area 7.2.3, proposed
17 action implementation and growth inducement. There's a line

18 in there it saÿs, I believe it's the last sentence, "it can

19 only be said thät less and probably far less of this

20 population growth would occur without this project." I'm not

21 sure what that means. Which city is that actually directed 173-8

22 at? Is it on the, the water is right on the ocean, around the

23 coast, or are we talking inland? It's known, it's a known

than Ag does, So I'm not so sure I. understand that particular
line as it relates to the City of Salinas.
I'd just like to follow-up by closing and saying that I

5 realize that this is a tough issue. Salt water intrusion is a

6 very real situation that we have in this area and that there
needs to be some very serious efforts being made. I believe

8 the second attempt I think •CSIP was the first attempt
this is probably the second real attempt being made to try and

10 assist in that area. The only thing •I can suggest is that

11 gince CSIP, since it's been brought into the fold and it's

12 been in place for awhile, it may have slowed it down, but it

13 didn't stop it from coming. Assisting in that area one more

14 time may slow it
is down some more, but even by your own report,
it's not going to stop it from coming. I believe it will

16 probably be better effort on behalf of everyone who's involved

17 in the séawater to make. it a global seawater intrusion effort

18 and not focus on one spot again, expand the horizons; expand

19 the project and you probably have a better opportunity to

20 actually get a greater amount of support, maybe make some of

21 the negatives go away, if we should say. And for the people

168-2 The maximum amount of surface water to be delivered is estimated to be 12,800 AFY, with the average being 9,700 AFY (delivered from April through October). A different amount would be pumped each month on average and at different times of
the day. For designing the pump station, one must estimate the maximum amount that would be pumped to accommodate the demand of the peak months during the irrigation season (May, June, and July). The 85-cfs value is based on the maximum
amount that would be pumped over an 18-hour period rather than a 24-hour period. Taking into account this 18-hour period, the 85-cfs value corresponds to a maximum monthly volume of approximately 3,800 AF rather than 5,000 AF. The approximate maximum monthly demand under 1995 conditions is 3,800 AFY. is

Since the Draft EIR/EIS was published, new modeling has been performed as described in Master Response MR-4; the results of the revised modeling replace those presented in the Draft EIR/EIS. See Chapter 3.0 of this Final EIR/EIS for the updated information, including replacements of these tables and those showing changes in Nacimiento Reservoir elevations (Tables 5.8-5 and 5.8-6).

168-7 The 65-cfs value is the maximum daily flow over a 24-hour period in the CSIP pipeline for surface water diversions. However, it is not expected that the system will deliver water 24 hours/day, given current practices where fields are typically irrigated over an 18 (out of 24) hour period. Thus, to deliver this 24-hour maximum average of 65 cfs, approximately 20 to 25% more pump/pipeline capacity is needed, which equates to approximately 85 cfs.

168-11 As noted by the commenter, the referenced text reads, "Higher release requirements would result in up to nearly 7,000 AF per month of higher total releases observed for the April through August period" (emphasis added). As is evident in the cited figure (Figure 5.3-8), the amount of 7,000 AF per month refers to the maximum average monthly amount shown for this period, which corresponds to June. The other months during the irrigation period have lower average release levels. The releases from the reservoirs would include amounts for downstream recharge, which is not maximized at this time, and minimum flow requirements for steelhead. Thereforc, the releases would need to be much higher than what is eventually pumped from the diversion structure for irrigation deliveries.

The peak recreation period lasts 153 days, beginning May 1" and ending September 30th. Therefore, as noted in Section 2.0 of the Draft EIR/EIS (Summary), the proposed project would reduce by 38 to 39% the number of available peak recreation days during the recreation season at Nacimiento Reservoir.

173-6 The SVWP is proposing to deliver project water only to the CSIP area, which serves agricultural users. However, the proposed action would recharge the Salinas Valley groundwater basin, which serves both agricultural and urban users. Consequently, delivering water in accordance with Alternative A would remove a significant obstacle to growth. The Draft EIR/EIS concludes that the project would remove the obstacle to growth in accordance with general plans, and this is not a no growth conclusion. The general plans for cities in the Salinas Valley project considerable growth over the next 3 decades.
173-7 The proposed action would recharge the Salinas Valley groundwater basin, which serves both agricultural and urban users. See response to Comment 29-12.
173-8 The population growth discussed in this section is not targeted to a particular area. All municipalities within the Salinas Valley draw their water from the groundwater aquifers. The statement generally refers to the implications of not bringing the Basin into balance. As the City of Salinas is relatively close to the intruded seawater front in the 180 foot aquifer and is in the eventual path of the intruded front in the 400 foot aquifer, the City could ultimately be substantially effected if seawater intrusion is not halted.

Re: Meeting in Paso Robles on 7/30/01 Meeting in Salinas on 8/01/01 DEIR for the SVWP

Water Resources of the Salinas Valley in Monterey the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP) released by the Monterey County Agency (MCWRA) as it may affect their interests.
The entire SVWP appears to intrusion in be ill conceived in that the reduction of seawater the northern part of Monterey County near the coast can be accomplished much faster, easier, at Castroville

Resources Control and cheaper than what the DEIR. The June 2000 memorandum Board, is conceived in of Harry Schuller of the State Water MCWRA to further its studies which has been studying and providing funds to the of seawater intrusion near Castroville, reflects that option.

the Salinas Valley no effect on the rest of Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties - and be fiscally conservative. The DEIR fails to recite this option identified by the SWRCB, much less include it as an

Salinas Valley Water Project alternative to the expensive and controversial 5

2-864 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS 6t8ZO

Mr. Curtis Weeks Page 2 SVWP DEIR 7/30/01

"Alternative A." Our clients have provided to the MCWRA the SWRCB's memo 174-1 nearly one year ago and have urged it to take it seriously on many occasions since then to no avail. A copy of the memorandum is enclosed.
Second, the SVWP's technical premises remain hidden from public scrutiny. While our clients plan to submit a much more detail technical memorandum identifying various flaws, lapses, and inconsistencies in the SVWP DEIR, one point is already obvious. The MCWRA has refused to divulge to the public the core data upon which its assumptions about combating seawater intrusion are based. Our client have asked for the water pumping data in the seawater intruded area known as the Pressure subarea in order to be able to critique the underlying factual premises of the SVWP. The MCWRA has categorically refused to 174-2
provide the pumping data. Copies of our clients' request and the MCWRA's response are enclosed. When the MCWRA previously provided pumping data in a summary form in a different context, the MCWRA disputed the accuracy and applicability of it own summaries when our • clients relied on it in a SWRCB hearing.
The pumping data would also demonstrate that the SWRCB's section 275 option is viable in that such data will identify the universe of the inefficient pumpers that should be regulated in order to preserve their own farming viability. Unless and until the.SVWP process is public and the underlying data - not just conclusion based on unspecified data -- is made available to the public for peer review, the public will have no faith in the SVWP, much less be able to critically evaluate it. To the extent that individual pumping data is considered confidential, such confidence must bow to the aggressively public nature of environmental review under the California and national standards (CEQA and NEPA).
Third, the DEIR is silent about the May 1, 2001 contract entered into by the MCWRA and several northern growers in which the MCWRA has promised to use all of its available resources to further the grower supported Alternative A at the expense of all other options. A copy of our clients' pleading in the Superior 174-3 Court of Monterey County raising that contract is enclosed. The contract among the MCWRA, Tanimura & Antle, Inc. and Chris Bunn is part of that pleading.
Finally, the DEIR by happenstance or design ignores the importance of Monterey County Ordinance 3790 which at least on its face tightly constrains the ability of persons in the critically seawater intruded area known as Zone 2B to pump from water wells. The Ordinance also orders the destruction of various water wells in that area so that the recycled water provided may be relied upon. Nor does the DEIR reflect the "amendment" to the enforcement provisions of Ordinance 3790 contained in the May 1, 2001 contract among the MCWRA, 5

Tanimura & Antle, Inc. and Chris Bunn. That amendment effectively repeals the destruction of water wells, thus allowing landowners in the most critically seawater intruded area to continue to exacerbate their problem by using their water wells instead of relying exclusively on the recycled water provided to them 174-4
by the MCWRA. The DEIR fails to explore how full and vigorous enforcement (contd

Our clients have been in the Salinas Valley a long time and intend to remain. They are not interested in short-term "solutions" that are rushed to so-called
public acceptance by pressure and unyielding bureaucratic time frames. Our clients are willing to meet with and discuss the merits of the SVWP and other options for more properly managing the water resources of the Salinas Valley in San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties with other interests in the Valley in a spirit of cooperation. The DEIR for the SVWP released by the MCWRA, however, is lacking data needed by the public to understand - much less accept its recommendations, fails to recite and explain the May 1, 2001 contract the MCWRA, Tanimura & Antle, Inc. and Chris Bunn that affects the SVWP and Ordinance 3790, and fails to explore and explain viable options to Alternative A that the MCWRA is contractually obligated to prefer.

3.0 CHANGES TO THE DRAFT EIR/EIS

As a result of comments received on the Draft EIR/EIS, changes have been made to the Draft EIR/EIS text. Additionally, some changes have been made to reflect minor revisions or corrections by the lead agencies. None of these administrative changes result in modifications to the determination of significance as originally reported in the Draft EIR/EIR. A compilation of the revisions to the Draft EIR/EIS is provided below. Changes in text are signified by strikeout (strikeout) where text is removed, and by bold (bold) where text is added. The following
changes are organized sequentially, as they would appear in the Draft EIR/EIS.
CHANGES TO CHAPTER 1.0 (INTRODUCTION)

1. In response to Comment 29-8, Page 1-9, Second paragraph, 4h sentence of the Draft EIR/EIS should be modified to read as follows:
If seawater intrusion continues in the future due to increased groundwater pumping demands in the coastal areas, an expanded distribution system might be needed to
deliver Salinas River water to areas outside the CSIP area. It has not been determined
who would fund the building of the expanded distribution system and/or receive water from the system.
CHANGES TO CHAPTER 2.0 (SUMMARY)

1. In response to Comment 25-7, the penultimate sentence in item 3 on page 2-3 of the
Draft EIR/EIS has been modified as follows:

A pump station with a capacity of 85 cfs would discharge the diverted water into the existing CSIP pipeline and-where it would co-mingle with water from the Monterey County Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant; because all blending of surface and recycled water would occur at this point, which is upstream of the CSIP delivery system, the characteristics of the water delivered to each user in the CSIP area
would be the same.

2. The following text replaces the last paragraph on page 2-9 of the Draft EIR/EIS:
Impacts on Agricultural Areas: Implementation of Alternative A (existing and
future) could increase groundwater levels more than 4 feet near agricultural areas adjacent to the river. This could result in potential root zone problems and/or water logging of crops within 200-300 feet west of the impoundment zone in isolated areas of similar of lower surface elevation. This would be considered a
potentially significant impact of Alternative A.
CHANGES TO CHAPTER 3.0 (DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT)

1. The following sentence was erroneously omitted from the bottom of page 3-12 of the Draft EIR/EIS:
AR 02853

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-1 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

May 30 - October 31 - Gates raised, water impounded to El. 9.0, bypassing up to 20 cfs through the fish ladder with the Salinas River Lagoon closed or up to 15 cfs with the lagoon open, and diverting up to 85 cfs.
2. In response to Comment 25-12, the following sentences are added to the end of the second paragraph on page 3-22 of the Draft EIR/EIS:
The control system for the diversion facility would be integrated into the existing control systems associated with the delivery of water within the CSIP area. This will ensure the controlled blending of recycled and diverted river water and appropriate control of delivery of the blended water.

3. In response to the modification of the impoundment area as discussed in Master Response MR-9, Figure 3-6 (page 3-13) of the Draft EIR/EIS is hereby replaced. Please refer to page 3 of this chapter.

4. In Response to Comment 25-11, Figures 3-7, 3-8, 3-9 have been modified. Please refer to pages 3-4 through 3-6.
CHANGES TO SECTION 5.1 (LAND USE AND PLANNING)

1. In response to Comment 110-15, Page 5.1-6, Fifth paragraph, fifth sentence of the Draft EIR/EIS should be modified to read as follows:
Approximately 40% of the residences surrounding Nacimiento Reservoir are occupied yeat-round, while the remaining 60% are occupied seasonally, with use geared toward recreation on the reservoir.

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.3 (HYDROLOGY AND FLOODING)

1. To reflect the results of the revised modeling conducted after the release of the Draft EIR/EIS (see Master Response MR-4) and additional corrections to Figures 5.3-5 and 5.3-34, Section 5.3 of the Draft EIR/EIS has been replaced. The revised section is provided here in its entirety.

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-7 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

5.3.1 EXISTING CONDITIONS

The Salinas Valley extends approximately 120 miles northwest from the mountain
regions in San Luis Obispo County near Santa Margarita to Monterey Bay in Monterey County. The primary focus of the following discussion is on the Salinas Valley Ground Water Basin (generally, the Monterey County portion of the Salinas Valley) and Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs. Along its length in Monterey County, the Valley varies in width from approximately 3 miles near Bradley to 10 miles at the Monterey Bay coast. The Valley is bounded on the east by the Gabilan and Diablo ranges, and on the west by the Sierra de Salinas and Santa Lucia Range.
HYDROGEOLOGIC CONDITIONS
The Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin consists of four hydrologic subareas as shown in Figure 3-2. These are known as the Pressure Subarea, East Side Subarea, Forebay Subarea, and Upper Valley Subarea. These subareas do not represent different groundwater subbasins, but are used to designate areas within the basin with different hydrogeologic characteristics. The geologic and hydrogeologic conditions of these subareas, and their interrelationship have been described in detail in the publications listed above. The Fort Ord area's hydrogeologic relationship to the main groundwater basin has not yet been determined. For this reason, the Fort Ord area is not included in the hydrologic impact analysis of the EIR/EIS.
The Salinas Valley Integrated Ground and Surface Water Model (SVIGSM) was
constructed to represent the Basin as four subareas, including Fort Ord. Since Fort Ord is dependent on groundwater supplied from the Pressure Subarea, and until hydrogeologic conditions are better understood, it is considered in the SVIGSM for planning purposes.
Pressure Subarea: In general, the Pressure Subarea, located in the northern portion of the valley, is comprised of three main aquifers, the Pressure 180-Foot, the Pressure 400- Foot, and the Deep Aquifer, which occurs at approximate depths of between 900 and 1,700 feet below land surface. An aquifer is the underground geologic material that
stores the groundwater, which can be pumped for beneficial use of water.
As a result of increasing groundwater production, as documented in Bulletin 52 (in 1946), groundwater levels have been declining below mean sea level, which has caused the intrusion of seawater into coastal aquifers. As the undergroundwater supplies became intruded with seawater, groundwater pumping in the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer was shifted to the Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer in the mid-1970s and to the Deep Aquifer in the mid-1980s.

Based on the previous hydrologic investigations (Montgomery Watson, 1998) and the MCWRA groundwater monitoring program, it is believed that today in the Pressure
Subarea north of Salinas, more than 90 percent of pumping occurs from the Pressure
400-Foot Aquifer, approximately 5 percent occurs from the Deep Aquifer, and a smaller amount is pumped from the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer. In areas south of Salinas, it is estimated that approximately 60 percent of groundwater pumping occurs from the %
Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer, while 40 percent occurs in the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer. 02860

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-8 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Use of the Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer becomes more limited in the vicinity of Chualar to
Gonzales.

Seawater intrusion into the Pressure Subarea was occurring at an annual rate of
approximately 14,000 AFY prior to initiation of operations of the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects (MCWRP). The MCWRP delivers recycled water as irrigation water for the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP). As the MCWRP becomes fully operational, delivering approximately 13,300 AFY of recycled water, the annual rate of seawater intrusion is projected to decrease to approximately 8,800 AFY.
East Side Subarea: The East Side Subarea is in the northeast part of the Salinas Valley, east of the Pressure Subarea. This area consists mainly of three aquifer layers. Historically, a majority of groundwater pumping had occurred from the uppermost Shallow East Side Aquifer; currently approximately 40 percent of groundwater pumping is estimated to occur in this aquifer. The remaining groundwater pumping occurs in the intermediate Deep East Side Aquifer. The Deep Aquifer, as recognized in the Pressure
is Subarea, is also known to occur in the East Side Subarea,
Forebay Subarea: The Forebay Subarea is in the center of the Salinas Valley, southeast of the Pressure and East Side Subareas. The majority of groundwater pumping in this area occurs from the shallow aquifer zone. However, some of the deeper wells are believed to be pumping from the deeper Forebay aquifer zone. Although the Deep Aquifer in the Pressure and East Side areas is also known to extend to the Forebay Subarea, few wells are known to be pumping from this aquifer in the Forebay Subarea.
Upper Valley Subarea: The Upper Valley Subarea is in the southernmost part of the Salinas Valley, southeast of the Forebay Subarea. The Salinas River groundwater basin extends to the southern end of Monterey County, near Bradley. The aquifer layer in this area is in one unit. The majority of wells in this area are relatively shallow, and lie along the course of Salinas River.

SURFACE DRAINAGE CONDITIONS
The Salinas River system drains two major tributaries controlled by dams, the Nacimiento and San Antonio rivers. The watershed tributary to the Nacimiento River is approximately 330 square miles, and that for the San Antonio River is approximately 328 square miles. Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs regulate the flows from corresponding rivers to the Salinas River. Nacimiento and San Antonio rivers contribute approximately 200,000 AFY and 70,000 AFY, to the Salinas River, respectively. In addition, there is flow from the upper Salinas River, which is most prominent during the
wet winter months.

Average annual historical Salinas River flows entering the Basin at Bradley are 324,000
AFY, as measured at the Bradley gaging station. Major tributaries to the Salinas River between Bradley and Monterey Bay are: Pancho Rico Creek, San Lorenzo Creek, Arroyo Seco and El Toro Creck. The largest tributary is the Arroyo Seco. Arroyo Seco flows, as they enter the Basin, are approximately 122,000 AFY, some of which becomes recharge,
before joining the Salinas River. The magnitude of this recharge has been estimated to be
between 40,000 and 60,000 AFY.
AR 02861

Salinas Valley Water Project. 3-9 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The historical Salinas River outflow to the ocean has been estimated to average 242,000 AFY, the majority of which occurs during the months of November through March. During the spring and summer months, the two reservoirs (Nacimiento and San Antonio) are operated by the MCWRA to minimize the outflow to the ocean, while maximizing the recharge through the Salinas River bed.
The Merritt Lake watershed drains approximately 26 square miles. The area upstream of Highway 101 is drained by Prunedale Creek. Prunedale Creek flows into Merritt Drain, through Merritt Lake, and into Tembladero Slough. Tembladero Slough flows into the Reclamation Ditch, which connects to the Old Salinas River channel just south of its
entrance into the southern end of Moss Landing Harbor.
EXISTING LAND USE, PRECIPITATION AND OVERDRAFT
The primary land use within the Salinas Valley is agricultural. Since the late 1940s, irrigated acreage within the Valley has increased substantially, with steady increases in the 1940s and 1950s, and more rapid increases in the 1960s and 1970s. Total irrigated acreage has remained relatively constant since the 1980s. Urban acrcages have also
experienced substantial growth, most of which has occurred in Castroville, Gonzales, Greenfield, King City, Marina, Salinas, and Soledad. As the agricultural and urban areas have expanded, so have the water needs of the Valley.
Recharge to the groundwater basin occurs primarily from precipitation, return flows from irrigated lands, and stream recharge from the Arroyo Seco and Salinas River. It is estimated that stream recharge accounts for approximately half of the total basin recharge. Average precipitation in the Valley ranges from 15 to 60 inches in the mountain ranges on either side of the Valley, and 10 to 15 inches within the Valley itself. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter, from November through March. To help increase the utilization of Salinas River flows for groundwater recharge and to provide flood control benefits, Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs began operations in 1957 and 1967, respectively. These reservoirs have been operated to optimize Salinas River recharge by storing winter runoff and making releases in timely manner during the irrigation season, when the potential for recharge is highest.
Historically, groundwater conditions in the Salinas Valley have been declining due to the almost exclusive use of groundwater for agricultural and urban purposes. Declining groundwater levels in the Pressure and Eastside Subareas, basin overdraft, and seawater intrusion are a serious concern to the MCWRA and State Water Resources Control
Board (SWRCB). Overdraft and seawater intrusion were first documented in the Valley in 1946, in a report published by the then named State Department of Public Works, Division of Water Resources (Bulletin No. 52).
The objectives of the proposed project are focused on alleviating the quality and quantity
problems facing the Basin's water resources. As shown in the reeently-completed Salinas Valley Historical Benefits Analysis - Final Report (Montgomery Watson, 1998), average annual seawater intrusion has historically averaged 11,000 AF, while basin overdraft has averaged approximately 19,000 AF per year, duting the 1949-94 hydrologic period.

SYSTEM OPERATIONS

Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs began operations in 1957 and 1967, respectively. The two reservoirs provide a total of over 700,000 AF of storage for flood control and conservation purposes.
The reservoirs have historically been operated to maximize the releases for conservation, while minimizing flood control releases. For purposes of this EIR/EIS, a conservation release consists of any water released when the reservoir water level is at or below the flood control rule curve (i.e., below the level above which releases for flood control would be required, see discussion below). Such releases generally contribute to groundwater recharge via' the Salinas River bed. A flood control release consists of any release made while the lake level(s) is above the flood control rule curve. Such release is generally during wet hydrologic periods. Although these releases may partially contribute to groundwater recharge through the Salinas River bed, recharge is not maximized due to saturated soil and other hydrologic conditions. Therefore, the reservoir operating criteria can be summarized as:

7. Storing winter time runoff from tributary watersheds to the Nacimiento and San Antonio rivers, while maintaining adequate flood attenuation storage (i.e., available capacity);

8. Maximizing recharge to groundwater basin, through timely releases during the dry seasons; and

9. Minimizing (accounting for other demands) the Salinas River outflow to the ocean.

Under an agreement dated October 19, 1959, as amended ("1959 Agreement"), the MCWRA is obligated to furnish to San Luis Obispo County up to 17,500 AFY of water from Nacimiento Reservoir. Furthermore, License for Diversion and Use of Water No. 7543, which establishes the MCWRA's water rights for Nacimiento Reservoir, is expressly subject to the 1959 Agreement. San Luis Obispo County has not historically exercised only a minimal amount of its rights to water under the 1959 Agreement. That County is now considering a project that would utilize some or all of these rights. The MCWRA reservoir operations to-date have included the small amount of deliveries to the lakeside residents in San Luis Obispo County, under the 1959Agreement, which total a minimum of approximately 1,300 AFY.
Current Operating Guidelines
In order to meet the objectives of the reservoir operations, the MCWRA has historically maintained an end of flow in the Salinas River near Spreckels, by targeting approximately 40 cubic feet per second (cfs) in the flow at the Chualar Bridge. Given the long river reach to control (approximately 100 miles) and maximize recharge, the Chualar Bridge has proven to be a good area to obtain flow information for operation of the reservoirs So they can maximize recharge through the river bed and minimize flow to the ocean during the spring and summer time operations. The actual location of the end of the

The average annual inflow to Nacimiento Reservoir is about three times that of San Antonio Reservoir. Because of this, the MCWRA has operated the reservoirs so that releases from the two reservoirs also result in an approximate 3:1 ratio in the stored water maintained between the two reservoirs.
There are two agencies, in addition to the MCWRA, that require or make recommendations regarding the storage and release volumes in the reservoir(s). In order to maintain an adequate flood control space in the reservoirs and be able to pass the Probable Maximum Flood, the California Department of Water Resources, Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) requires a strict adherence to the designated flood control rule curve. The DSOD rule curve is designed to protect the dam structure from catastrophic failure when a large flood event occurs. The rule curve is used to ensure adequâte storage space is available to prevent the dam from being overtopped based upon existing spillway capacity. In addition to water supply and fiood control, Nacimiento dam also has a hydroelectric power plant at the dam site, bringing it under it the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which also requires : rule curve. While the MCWRA is concerned about the safety of the dam structure, its goal is also to minimize the impacts of downstream flooding in a large flood event. As such, the MCWRA is currently using a more conservative rule curve than the DSOD and FERC curves, which are essentially the same. Figures 5.3-1 and 5.3-2 show the flood control rule curves currently used by the MCWRA for the operation of each reservoir, as well as the DSOD and FERC required curve for Nacimiento. The DSOD does not require : Rule Curve for San Antonio. Since there are no power plants at San Antonio Dam, FERC does not have jurisdiction for operation of San Antonio Reservoir.
Existing In-stream Flow Requirements
In addition to the reservoir storage and release operations, the MCWRA entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) in 1985 that establishes minimum downstream flow requirements for Nacimiento River and has an informal agreement with CDFG for San Antonio River. The MOA establishes minimum flow requirements and includes special conditions during periods of drought.

SEDIMENT TRANSPORT

There have been limited studies on the sediment transport behavior in Salinas River
including:
Sediment Discharge from the Salinas River and the Effects of Upstream Reservoirs (James McGrath, 1987);
Salinas River Study: Phase Draft Report. River Morphology and Behavior (Anderson- Nichols-West, 1984);

• Flood Insurance Study, Monterey County, California, Unincorporated Areas (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1985).
Copies of these documents are available for review at the Monterey County Water
Resources Agency.
In general, as water flows through rivers and channels, it carries with it some sediment. Part of the sediment is dragged or rolled along the bed or is for the most part in contact with the bed. This is called bed load. The other part of the sediment is suspended in water and travels with approximately the same velocity as water. This is called suspended load. The amount of sediment carried by the river or channel is one of the most important variables in all sediment analyses. The phenomenon of sediment transport depends on many factors, including hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics. Since the former cannot be adequately quantified, a high degree of accuracy in sediment load computations cannot be expected. Nevertheless, several analytical and experimental
investigations have been carried out to quantify the sediment loading, primarily based on hydraulic characteristics of the sediment material.
The Anderson-Nichols-West (1984) report concluded that the flow rate that causes channelization to occur in the lower reaches of the Salinas River is approximately 3,000 cfs. The minimum flow at which the sediment loads are detected is approximately 1,000
cfs, below which no major sediment transport phenomenon occurs. The largest floods
of record are in excess of 100,000 cfs, while floods of magnitude of 25,000 cfs or more
are fairly frequent.
From a sediment transport standpoint, a river reach is said to be in equilibrium when the amount of sediment (both suspended load and bed load) entering the reach is the same as that leaving the reach. Hence the stream reach bed elevation does not change over the long term. However, if incoming and outgoing sediment loads are different, the bed level must either rise, or fall. A rise in bed level is known as aggradation and a fall in the bed level is known as degradation. Aggradation may occur under low flow conditions where transport capacity of the river is less than sediment load; thus deposition occurs. Degradation may generally occur under high flow conditions where the transport capacity of the river is more than the sediment load; thus scouring of the beds and/or channel sides occurs which increase the sediment load.

Decline in average annual groundwater levels relative to the Existing Condition, so as to increase pumping lift in manner that pumping equipment would be adversely impacted.

Rising of 10 feet or more of groundwater levels in the Forebay and Upper Valley unconfined aquifers, to the extent that may cause water-logging and/or loss of crop production. In the Pressure and East Side subareas, a rise in groundwater levels in the confined aquifers is desirable, to reduce and eventually reverse the gradients of groundwater flow from an inland to a seaward direction. a

Seawater Intrusion

Long-term increase in the rate of seawater intrusion into the Pressure, East Side, and Fort Ord Subareas.

Increased landward advances in the geographic extent and location of the existing seawater intrusion front, as defined by the simulated 500 mg/l chloride concentration contour line.

Flooding Potential
The reoperation of reservoirs causes additional flooding beyond the capacity of the downstream Salinas River channel capacity.
The construction and operation of Merritt Lake facilities, under Alternative B, changes the flooding frequency of the watershed.
Sediment Transport
Substantial increase in the sediment loads from the reservoir inflows;
Substantial increase in the scouring of the channel bed downstream of the reservoirs;
Increase in the sediment loads as a result of project operations in the Salinas River during the high flood flows to the extent that sediment deposits along the channel or at the lagoon entrance would change the river bed elevation significantly;

IMPACT ANALYSIS - METHODOLOGY

The Salinas Valley Integrated Ground and Surface Water Model (SVIGSM) was used as a planning tool in the development of the project, and subsequently as the analytical tool in determining potential hydrologic impacts.
An overview of the SVIGSM is provided below. For detailed information on the SVIGSM, its development, application, assumptions used, and recent update process, refer to the following documents: the Salinas River BMP Task 1.09 Report (MW, 1994), Salinas Valley Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Model Update, Final Report (MW, 1997), Salinas Valley Historical Benefits Analysis (MW, 1998), and Update of the Historical Benefits Analysis (HBA) Hydrologic Investigation in the Arroyo Seco Cone Ara, (AT Associates, 2000).

These documents are available for review at the MCWRA.
SVIGSM Features

The SVIGSM is a finite element computer model with the ability to simulate various aspects of the hydrology of the Salinas Valley. Its major features include:
Simulation of the horizontal and vertical movement of groundwater through the multiple confined and unconfined aquifer layers within the Salinas Valley.
Simulation of the surface water hydrology in the Salinas Valley, including the Salinas River and its major tributaries, and the interaction between these rivers and the underlying groundwater basin. Other hydrologic components, such as runoff from precipitation and contribution from minor tributaries also are simulated.
Simulation of the operations of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs based on operational rules for flood control, water supply, and minimum flow requirements.
Simulation of urban and agricultural water use requirements in the Valley using land use, crop requirements, and agricultural practice information. Recharge and return flows from applied wäter also are simulated.

Simulation of the volume and geographical extent of seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley from Monterey Bay.
SVIGSM Development AR 02869
The SVIGSM was originally developed in February 1994 to analyze* the groundwater resources of the Salinas Valley. In 1996 and 1997, it was subsequently refined for use in the SVWP planning and EIR process. The update process involved a series of 5 workshops, which were sponsored by the MCWRA, with participation from the

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-17 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

MCWRA Board of Directors, public, recognized experts, interested agencies, and the project engineering team. The focus of the workshops was to evaluate, update and revise the assumptions and input data used in the preparation of the SVIGSM so that it would be appropriate for use in the impact analysis section of the EIR. A written account of that process, and modifications made to the model, is provided in the report entitled Salinas Valley Integrated Groundwater and Surface Water Model Update, Final Report (MW, 1997).
The SVIGSM was used to model the subsurface flow, chloride transport, and reservoir operation. The SVIGSM along with pre- and post-processing programs were used to evaluate the proposed project's potential impact on the hydrologic conditions in the Salinas Valley. The Corps of Engineers' Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) package was used to analyze the flooding impacts of reoperation of reservoirs. The SVIGSM was also used to develop and assess the hydrologic impacts of water delivery options for the subsequent phases of the proposed project, as described in Chapter 3.0 (Project Description).
The SVIGSM version 4.15 (1997) was used to analyze the impacts of Alternative B. Since 1977, the SVIGSM has been updated as follows: 1) Additional data was obtained on hydrology and hydrogeology of the Arroyo Seco Cone area. This data was incorporated into the model and the model was subsequently recalibrated; 2) The San Antonio Rule Curve was updated based on the San Antonio Reoperation Study (MCWRA, 2000); and 3) The reservoir system layout in the model was refined to more accurately simulate and account for the Nacimiento diversions to San Luis Obispo County. The updated SVIGSM version 4.18 (1999) is used to assess the hydrologic impacts of Alternative A. Because Alternative B is no longer the preferred alternative and extensive modeling of Alternative B was conducted for the 1998 EIR, it has not been re-evaluated with the updated SVIGSIM. Nevertheless, the results of the 1998 EIR
modeling of Alternative B compared with hydrologic conditions defined using the same
model yield generally the same relative level of change as would result from using the updated model. See the discussion in the introduction to Chapter 5.0.
IMPACT ANALYSIS - FORMAT

The format of the following impact discussion is presented by phase and impact topic (i.e., changes in groundwater elevation), rather than by project component (i.e., diversion structure), as is done in the majority of the EIR sections. Hydrologic impacts are evaluated and measured on a basin-wide scale and are inherently linked to multiple
components.
An overview of the project's operation, including amount of water released, stored, diverted and/or delivered is provided as an introduction to each phase. A discussion of impacts follows each "operational overview." The analysis is focused on Alternatives A and B, which result in physical changes that affect hydrology. A discussion of
Alternatives C, D, and E is found at the end of the impact discussion.

EXISTING CONDITIONS (1995) PLUS PROJECT- OVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS
As discussed in Chapter 3.0 (Project Description), the proposed project includes the existing spillway structure at Nacimiento Dam in order to meet the modification to
requirements of DSOD and FERC to pass the probable maximum flood (PMF). Based on this modification, it is anticipated that no flood control rule curve will be required by DSOD and FERC for Nacimiento Reservoir, because the new spillway would be designed to pass the PMF safely, without damage to the dam structure. The MCWRA would, however, have a flood control rule curve during the rainy season, in order to have sufficient storage available to reduce the risk of downstream flooding. Currently, no modifications to the San Antonio dam and/or spillway structure are proposed; San Antonio can safely pass the estimated PMF for that dam. Figure 5.3-4 shows the existing and proposed modified rule curve for the Nacimiento Reservoir.

Reservoir Reoperation - Altematives A and B
The MCWRA operates Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs for two primary functions: () flood control and (i) conservation (maximizing the recharge through the Salinas River bed, while minimizing the flow to the occan). Based on the hydrologic modeling of the Basin using the SVIGSM, it was determined that additional water is needed to stop seawater intrusion and help bring the Basin closer to a hydrologic balance. Modification of the Nacimiento spillway is required by DSOD to remove restrictions on flood control operations. Once modified, the operating rule curve would
allow increased flexibility of Operations at the reservoir. This would especially be evident during the late-winter and early spring periods when lake levels have historically been maintained at elevation 777 feet (per the accepted rule curve). During normal and
AR 02871

Salinas Valley Wäter Project 3-19 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

heavier rainfall years, this has often meant a forced release of water from Nacimiento Reservoir that could otherwise have been stored for conservation uses.

By increasing the capacity of the spillway, more water could be stored during the winter/spring of above normal years. Wintertime releases to the Salinas River could be slightly decreased (compared with current conditions) and more water would be available for summer-time flows in the river.
It is noteworthy that the Nacimiento spillway modification by itself does not benefit the project. The benefits of spillway modification are only realized by allowing reoperation of the reservoirs, which in turn increase the summer-time flows available for release and
recharge and/or diversion.
No modifications to the structure at San Antonio Reservoir are required. The reoperation would result in changes in the amount, frequency, and schedule for releases
of water from Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs into the Salinas River. The
reoperation of reservoirs is most effective when combined with the changes to Nacimiento rule curve that result from modifications to the Nacimiento spillway
structure.

Figure 5.3-5 presents the changes in reservoir releases, river flow, groundwater recharge, and ocean outflow for the peak irrigation versus non-peak irrigation season for Alternative A. Alternative B is expected to have similar results as Alternative A. Since the spillway modification and reservoir reoperation are considered a near-term project,
the changes are presented for the comparison of existing condition with initial operations of Alternatives A or B. The figures present the changes in groundwater recharge along three reaches of the Salinas River -from Bradley to Soledad, Soledad to Spreckels, and from Spreckels to Monterey Bay. The Pressure and East Side are combined for purposes of presentation in Figure 5.3-5.
Nacimiento Reservoir Storage Levels - Alternatives A and B -
Under Alternative A, the average monthly reservoir storage levels in Nacimiento reservoir (Figure 5.3-6) would be lower than under existing conditions. The Nacimiento storage in the summer and winter period is approximately 50,000 48,000 AF and 20,000 15,000 AF, respectively, lower under the proposed action than the existing condition. This lower storage is mostly due to the draw on the reservoir for water supply to the SVWP diversion facility. The impact of such lower reservoir storage on visual resources is discussed in Section 5.8 and in recreational activities is discussed in Section 5.9 of this
EIR/EIS.

Under Alternative B, the operation of the SVWP during the Existing Plus Project
scenario would result in average monthly reservoir storage in Nacimiento Reservoir that
would be similar to or lower than Alternative A storage levels.
San Antonio Reservoir Storage Levels - Alternatives A and B
Under the Existing Plus Project scenario of Alternative A, average monthly reservoir storage in San Antonio Reservoir is lower for the project than the existing conditions for 5
every month of the year (Figure 5.3-7). These lower storage levels result because the 02872

Reservoir for this project to increase conservation storage during the winter months. Average monthly storage under the project would be approximately 76,000 79,000 AF lower than existing condition levels in summer and fall; however during winter months (Tanuary through March) monthly storage would be lower by approximately 74,000 77,000 AF. This suggests that although San Antonio is generally operated at lower levels, the reoperation calls for storage in winter for subsequent release in spring and summer months.

Under the Existing Plus Project scenario of Alternative B, average monthly reservoir storage in San Antonio Reservoir would be similar to or lower than Alternative A levels as compared to existing conditions.
Reservoir Releases - Alternatives A and B
The reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs would cause a shift in the release patterns that would result in decreased releases releases during the summer period. during the winter and increased

Under Alternative A, releases from Nacimiento would be lower during the winter months under the Existing Plus Project scenario (Figure 5.3-8). This is primarily the result of the increased spillway capacity, as well as no diversion requirement by the proposed diversion facility at Moro Cojo, during the winter months.

Higher release requirements for diversion and recharge during the irrigation months would result in up to nearly 7,000 8,000 AF per month of higher total releases observed for the April through August period.
Under Alternative B, similar to Alternative A, releases from Nacimiento would be lower
during the winter months under the Existing Plus Project scenario. This is also primarily due to the change in the rule curve allowed by the result of the increased spillway capacity, as well as no release requirement for the diversion facilities proposed at Spreckels during the winter months (There is sufficient water in the river for winter time diversion). Although, the subsurface diversion facilities divert water to the Merritt Lake surface storage site during the winter and rainy season, higher release requirements for diversion and recharge during the irrigation months under the project conditions would
result in releases similar to Alternative A observed for the March through August period.: Alternative B allows for channel maintenance by stopping releases during the September and October period.
Releases from San Antonio Reservoir under the Existing Plus Project scenario of both Alternative A and B would generally be higher during the summer months than existing conditions (Figure5.3-9). Under both Alternative A and B, reoperation would increase the releases from San Antonio Reservoir during the irrigation months to enhance groundwater recharge and meet diversion requirements. Duting the winter and early spring months, a reduction in releases would occur under the project.

In addition, under Alternative A, the flows during September and October would be higher, as the project would be operated to deliver irrigation water at that time.
In order to meet the fish flow requirements at Bradley (see Section 5.6), the operational criteria would allow for an appropriate amount of release to maintain 155 cfs at Bradley, when natural flows at Paso Robles are above 60 cfs.

Salinas River Outflow to Ocean - Alternatives A and B

Since the Salinas River represents a key source of fresh water for the purposes of groundwater recharge and direct diversion, a criteria of the operations of the project is to optimize the use of the Salinas River flows and minimize the outflow to the ocean. While the Salinas River ocean outflow under the existing condition is estimated to average 238,000 AFY, Alternative A project operations would reduce it to approximately 229,000 AFY, over the 46 year hydrologic period.

As shown in Figute 5.3-11a, there is a slight decrease in the ocean outflow during the winter, a slight increase during the spring, and an overall decrease on an average annual basis. The average annual decrease under the project would be due to the reduction in flood control releases and/or spills resulting from Nacimiento Reservoir under the modified storage rule curve and increased use of water during the irrigation months.to enhance groundwater recharge. Similar conditions would occur under Alternative B project conditions (Figure 5.3-11b).

Under Alternative A operations, it is expected that the average annual groundwater levels would increase by 44.7 11.7, 7.7, 0.5 0.4, and 2.0 0.4 feet, in the Pressure, East Side, Forebay, and Upper Valley Subareas, respectively (Figures 5.3-12 through 5.3-15). Two primary objectives of the SVWP are to stop seawater intrusion and bring the basin into
hydrologic balance, via reductions in groundwater pumping and redistribution of the surface water stored in the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. As such, Alternative
A is designed to raise the groundwater levels in much of the Pressure and East Side Subareas. The 44.7 11.7- and 7.7-foot increase in average annual groundwater levels in the Pressure and East Side Subareas thus would be considered beneficial environmental
impacts. Figures 5.3-12 and 5.3-13 show the annual fluctuations of the average groundwater levels in these areas.

The conveyance of water released from the reservoirs via Salinas River channel causes an increased recharge through the Salinas River bed. The groundwater levels would, thus, increase in the Forebay and Upper Valley Subareas. Although an increase in groundwater levels could potentially cause slightly higher groundwater levels, the estimated increases are approximately 0.5 and 2.0 feet in the Forebay and Upper Valley Subareas. This increase would not result in any problems to the root zone. Increases would be higher in the Pressure and East Side. However, the altered groundwater table is much deeper in
these areas and the root zones would not be affected.

Implementation of the Existing Plus Project scenario of Alternative A would increase average groundwater levels in all subareas of the Basin. No root zones would be affected. This would help improve the bydraulic balance of the basin and would be considered a beneficial impact of the project (Alt A-1).
The SVIGSM was also used to simulate the average annual groundwater elevations under the Existing Plus Project scenario of Alternative B. In the near term project operations, it is expected that the average annual groundwater levels would increase by 13.4, 5.4, 0.1, and 0.2 feet, in the Pressure, East Side, Forebay, and Upper Valley Subareas, respectively (Figures 5.3-16 through 5.3-19). Similar to Alternative A, Alternative B is designed to raise the groundwater levels in much of the Pressure and East Side Subareas. The 13.4 and 5.4 fect increase in average annual groundwater levels in the Pressure and East Side Subareas thus would be considered beneficial
environmental impacts. Figures 5.3-16 and 5.3-17 show the annual fluctuations of the average groundwater levels in these arcas.

Impacts to Basin Groundwater Balance - Alternatives A and B
As stated above, one of the main objectives of the SVWP is to help provide a basin-wide hydrologic balance. For the purposes of this project, the hydrologic balance is defined as a zero or positive average annual change in groundwater storage during the simulated 46-
year hydrologic cycle. Under the existing conditions (no action or Alternative C), the average annual fresh groundwater storage, over the 46-year hydrologic period, is expected to reduce by 45,000 9,600 AFY.
Implementation of the Existing Plus Project scenario of Alternative A would reverse the annual reduction in groundwater storage to an approximately 6,000 2,500 AFY increase

This improvement in groundwater storage is largely due to additional recharge through the Salinas River bed during the summer and irrigation season, and reduction in pumping in the MCWRP service area.

the Merritt Drain downstream of Highway 101, but upstream of the Reclamation Ditch pumping plant at Highway 183. The drainage area tributary to the storage site is approximately 600 to 700 acres. The storage facility at Merritt Lake would be designed to have sufficient freeboard within the reservoir to contain all runoff from the drainage area that would drain directly into the reservoir impoundment. Capture of storm water
runoff in the proposed storage facility would have a negligible, or slightly beneficial (reduction), effect in downstream flooding. The reservoir would be constructed with
spillway section that would pass the peak storm flows through the reservoir. However, the reservoir would be designed to be able to maintain a 5-foot freeboard. As a result, the peak flood flows would be retained within the reservoir for all flows up to the 100. year flood flow. No upstream or downstream flooding impacts are anticipated.
The Alternative B Merritt Lake surface storage facility would not increase upstream or downstroam flooding. This would be a less-than-signijficant impact of the project (Alt B-4).
Sediment Transport Impacts - Alternatives A and B
The proposed reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs under both
Alternatives A and B could potentially impact the transport of sediment in the Salinas River. This can also potentially impact the deposition in the Salinas River lagoon area. Sediment transport and its associated impacts are evaluated for the following areas:
Upstream and downstream of the reservoirs; AR 02884

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-46 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Salinas River under flood flows; Salinas River and lagoon under low-flow conditions; and
Merritt Lake watershed.

Upstream and Downstream of Reservoirs
When rainfall occurs in excess of the infiltration capacity of the soil, the flow of water over soil surfaces exerts a drag force on the soil. Soil particles are dislodged and transported due to: sufficiently large drag force; impact of raindrops on the soil surface; and flow of high velocity winds over a soil surface. This process of transport is generally retarded by the presence of grass, weeds, trees, and other vegetation on the ground. This type of erosion and associated transport phenomena is of special interest in watershed planning and reservoir design, maintenance, and operation. The components of the proposed project would not impact the tributary watershed upstream of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs.
Degradation can generally occur downstream of reservoirs because of the change in channel flows created by storing and releasing water from the reservoir. Most of the upstream sediment load is stored in the reservoir and thus water released from the dams is nearly free of sediment. When such sediment is picked up from the riverbed
downstream of the dam and is never replenished, channel scouring or degradation results. As part of the proposed reoperation of reservoirs, the modification of releases from the reservoirs could potentially increase the degradation of the riverbed just
downstream of the dams.
Under both Alternatives A and B, the total annual volume of reservoir releases would not change substantially, and reoperation flows would be within the existing range of flows. Therefore, the impact of
reoperation on sediment transport is expected to be less-than-significant, and no significant «pstream impacts are antiapated (Alt A-5, Alt B-5).
Salinas River Under Flood Flows

Flood flow conditions can also cause scour of the channel beds and/or sides. As previously described in this section, the reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs would not significantly change the high flow regime downstream of the reservoirs. In fact, the changes in the reservoir rule curve would somewhat reduce the peak flows which may eventually reduce the sediment load effects during the periods of peak flows.
Under both Alternatives A and B, the proposed additional springtime releases would be within the
historic range of expected high flows and would not significantly impact sediment loads in the Salinas
River (Alt A-6, Alt B-6).
Salinas River and Lagoon Under Low Flow Conditions
In cases when the river branches out into smaller channels, such as in a delta environment or when the channel flows are reduced to less than transport capacity, 5
deposition occurs. Although, the proposed reoperation of the reservoirs would somewhat reduce the Salinas River outflow to the ocean, flows would be maintained for fish requirements and existing flows from the City of Salinas Industrial Wastewater 02885

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-47 Response 10 Comments on the EIR/EIS

Treatment ponds near Davis Road and agricultural runoff would be unchanged such that the low flow conditions would not be substantially altered. Consequently, it is not expected that the changes in reoperation would impact the sediment transport and the subsequent aggradation at the entrance to the Salinas River lagoon area.
'The reoperation of the reservoirs, under both Alternatives A and B, would cause the Salinas River to flow during the spring and summer season at higher rates than historical flows. This additional flow is, however, less than 120 cfs. Based on the earlier studies, the minimum threshold at which suspended sediments become significant is 1,000 cfs.
The increased late spring and summer flow proposed, as part of reservoir reoperation, under both Alternatives A and B, would be well below the threshold at which sediment transport would occur, and n0 significant impact on Salinas River sediment transport is antiaipated (Alt A-7, Alt B-7).
Merritt Lake Watershed & Moss Landing Harbor - Alternative B
The surface water reservoir proposed at Merritt Lake under Alternative B would store approximately 3,000 AF of diverted Salinas River water. The reservoir would be designed to attenuate flood flows to ensure no impact related to downstream flooding. Although the proposed design of the drainage system at Merritt Lake would closely mimic existing conditions, a small portion of runoff from the area contributing flows to the Reclamation Ditch and Tembladero Slough, and subsequently Moss Landing Harbor, would be captured. The proposed design would provide sufficient freeboard within the reservoir such that this runoff would be safely stored within the reservoir and would preclude the need for downstream releases. This capture of a small portion of the total
flow would have a negligible, if not slightly beneficial, impact because sediment contained within the runoff would be captured in the new storage facility. This sediment would have to be removed and disposed of on a periodic (once every 20 to 30 years) basis.

The construction and operation of the proposed Merritt Lake surface storage reservoir under Alternative
B is expected to slightly reduce and, therefore, have less-than-significant impact on the sediment loads downstream of the reservoir (Alt B-8).
Surface Ponding at the Diversion Structure - Alternative A
Alternative A includes the installation of a seasonal diversion structure dam at
approximately the Moro Cojo area. The height of the diversion structure would be controlled by pneumatically operated gates. The gates would be raised to a height of 10 feet above the channel bottom (9 feet msl), and will cause ponding of water during the April through October period to provide irrigation water for diversion to the agricultural lands within the Zone 2B area. The surface ponding would extend throughout the length of the river from the dam site upstream to slightly past the Davis Road crossing (approximately 4.5 miles). This ponding would potentially impact the groundwater levels in the perched aquifer zone immediately below the riverbed. The increase in groundwater levels in the perched aquifer system would have a potential impact on two sites in the vicinity of the river: the landfill operated by the Monterey Regional Waste
Management District (MRWMD) and the agricultural lands in the close vicinity of the
river.

AR 02886

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-48 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Impacts on the Landfill
There are two perched aquifer systems under the landfill area, the 2-Foot and the 35- Foot systems. The goal of the impact analysis is to define the approximate distance outside which changes in perched groundwater levels would be less than the threshold value. In the case of the landfill area, the threshold value is a 2-foot tise in groundwater level. If a rise higher than this threshold were to occur, there would be potential for the project to cause water beneath the landfill to rise to the bottom of the landfill cells.
A hydraulic relationship between the changes in the river stage and the groundwater level has been developed. Based on the hydrogeologic parameters provided by the MRWMD and the information on changes in the river stage due to SVWP operations, the area of influence for a 2-foot rise in groundwater level as result of the proposed 10-foot rise in river stage is approximately 800-1000 feet from the project site. Since the distance
between the project site and the landfill is approximately 1,800 feet, the landfill would not be located within the area of influence for the 2-foot rise in groundwater levels associated with surface ponding at the diversion structure.
Implementation of Alternative A could increase the perched aquifer groundwater levels in the vicinity of
the impoundment. This increase is estimated to be approximately 2 feet within an area 800- to 1,000 feet from the project site. Because the landfll is located more than 1,000 feet from the impoundment area, Alternative A would have less-than-significant impacts on the groundwater levels in the vicinity of the surface diversion structure (Alt A-8).
Impacts on Agticultural Areas
The goal of the impact analysis related to effects on agricultural areas is to evaluate the potential root zone problems and/or water logging due to the ponding upstream of the surface diversion structure. The impact threshold for changes in groundwater levels in the agricultural areas is a rise of more than 4 feet in groundwater levels in the perched
aquifer system.
The impact analysis is similar to the one performed above for the landfill area. This analysis concluded that: 400 to 500-foot area of influence is applicable to the ponding adjacent to the agricultural areas; i.e., most of the significant changes in groundwater levels (increases of more than 4 feet) would occur within a 400 to 500-foot distance from the river. Based on the analysis, it is not expected that groundwater levels outside this area of influence would rise more than 4 feet. Because agricultural fields are located as close as approximately 200-300 feet from the river, and there are some areas west of the impoundment at elevations similar to the impoundment elevation, some portions of these agricultural fields could be subjected to potential root zone problems and/or water logging due to the ponding upstream of the surface diversion structure. In order to determine the locations in which groundwater levels would increase more than 4 feet
near the agricultural areas, detailed land use maps as well as topographic data to the 1- foot contour level would be needed. This type of data is not available at this time, but may become available during the review period of this Draft EIR/EIS. At this time,
therefore, the impacts on agricultural areas related to the ponding upstream of the
surface diversion structure would be considered potentially significant. If topographic

AR 02887

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-49 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

surveys are conducted and generate different results, this wil be reported in the Final EIR/EIS.

Implementation of Alternative A (existing and future) could increase groundwater levels more than 4 feet near agricultural areas adjacent to the river. This could result in potential root zone problems and/or water logging of crops within 200-300 feet west of the impoundment zone in isolated areas of similar or lower surface elevation. This would be considered a potentially significant impact of Alternative A (Alt A-9).
FUTURE PLUS PROJECT OPERATIONS
The analysis of future operations of Alternatives A and B is based on future conditions
at the 2030 level of demand compared with "Future Baseline (2030)." The Future Baseline (2030) ("No-Action") condition is defined as the conditions of the basin under the 2030 level of development when no project is implemented.
Alternative A - Overview of Operation
Upon implementation of Alternative A, additional monitoring would need to occur on groundwater levels and the rate and extent of seawater intrusion. The details of the
monitoring program are explained in Chapter 3.0. Based on the projections made using
the latest land and water use data in the north valley, the rate of seawater intrusion under
the 2030 conditions is estimated to be 10,000 AFY (No-Action conditions or Alternative C). It is also estimated that to halt this rate of seawater intrusion under the 2030
conditions, additional surface water diversion and an expanded service area beyond the Zone 2B area may be needed. It is proposed that the definitive need and amount of additional surface water deliveries be determined through the MCWRA's monitoring and
data analysis program (described in Section 3). If additional surface water is needed, the
proposed delivery area will be to new areas (currently unspecified) outside the CSIP
service area: Figure 5.3-33 shows the approximate area of surface water delivery.
Alternative B - Overview of Operation
The Salinas Valley Water Project, under Alternative B, would be operated in the future
under a similar "conjunctive use" premise as in the near-term operations. Under future implementation, the reservoirs would be reoperated to meet the diversion requirements. at the Salinas River diversion facilities during the normal and above normal water years. Under these conditions, the agricultural growers in the delivery areas would receive Salinas River water via pipelines and distribution or standby well systems. These areas would reduce groundwater pumping by the amount of surface water received. While the surface water deliveries would meet the base daily demands, the peak daily demands would be met via supplemental wells owned and operated by the MCWRA or an assigned purveyor (see Chapter 4.0).
Reservoir Reoperation - Alternatives A and B 5
Similar to the near-term project operations, future operations under Alternative A call for reoperation of the reservoirs to optimize the diversion rate at the proposed diversion facilities. The immediate benefit realized from this reoperation is maximizing the 02888
recharge along the Salinas River, as bulk of the releases for diversion would occur during

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-50 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

the period of April through October, when the groundwater levels are lower due to increased agricultural pumping in the Valley. The basic premise of the project, however, is that the diversions would continue during normal and above normal water years; however, the rate of diversion would be reduced during below normal water years, and potentially halted during dry and critical water years.
Under Alternative B, future operations would be similar to the near-term operations, where the reservoirs would be reoperated to maximize the recharge along Salinas River, as well as utilizing the modifications to the spillway and rule curve to meet the requirements of the project diversion facilities. As described earlier in this section, the diversions would take place during normal and above normal water years, and would be reduced during below normal and dry years.
Figure 5.3-34 shows the effects of the reoperation of reservoirs under the future conditions of Alternative A when compared to the operation of reservoirs under the Future Baseline (2030) conditions. Alternative B is expected to have similar results as Alternative A.

Nacimiento Reservoir-Storage Levels - Alternatives A and B
As shown in Figure 5.3-35, the future operation of the SVWP under Alternative A would result in lower average monthly storage in Nacimiento Reservoir throughout the year than Future Baseline (2030) conditions. This is mainly due to higher releases for the proposed surface diversion facilities, as well as the releases made during September and October, unlike the Future Baseline (2030) conditions. The future operation of the SVWP under Alternative B would likely result in similar or lower monthly reservoir storage in Nacimiento Reservoir than Alternative A.

San Antonio Reservoir Storage Levels - Alternatives A and B
As shown in Figure 5.3-36, average monthly reservoir storage in San Antonio Reservoir would be lower under the future phase of Alternative A as compared to the Future Baseline (2030) conditions. These lower storage levels would result because the reservoirs are reoperated to increase the releases for recharge and downstream diversions. Alternative B is expected to have similar results as Alternative A. Unlike the Nacimiento Reservoir, no modification of the storage rule curve at San Antonio Reservoir was analyzed to increase conservation storage during the winter months.
Reservoir Releases • Alternatives A and B

The reoperation of Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs under Future Conditions would cause a shift in the release patterns, which would result in decreased releases during the winter and increased releases during the summer. As shown in Figure 5.3-37, releases from Nacimiento would be lower during the winter months under future operations than under Future Baseline (2030) conditions. This is primarily the result of the higher storage rule curve during the winter months. Higher relcase requirements for recharge during the summer months with future operations would result in up to nearly 7,900 11,000 AF per month of higher total releases observed for the March through August period under Alternative A. Alternative B would have similar release patterns under future conditions as Alternative A.
As shown in Figure 5.3-38, releases from San Antonio Reservoir would generally be 5 higher during the summer months for the Puture Plus Project scenario of Alternative A than under the Future Baseline (2030) conditions. Reoperation would increase the 02892

releases from San Antonio during the summer months to enhance groundwater recharge. Due to the increased releases during the summer months over Future Baseline conditions, storage would be reduced. This reduction in storage levels results in the reduction in flood control releases observed in Figure 5.3-38, particularly during the month of January. Alternative B would have similar release patterns under future conditions.

MCWRP Deliveries - Alternatives A and B
The MCWRP is projected to deliver 25,600 AFY by the year 2030 to agricultural water users within northern portions of the Basin, 15,900 of which would be delivered directly
during the spring/summer peak irtigation season and approximately 9,700 AFY which would be stored for delivery during the water scason. Under Alternative A, the non- irrigation season recycled water would not be produced and secondary treated wastewater would be discharged to the ocean via the MRWPCA regional treaument plant. However, under Alternative B, the non-itrigation season recycled water would be stored in a subsurface storage reservoir, for subsequent delivery, during the irrigation
season.

Salinas Rivet Flows at Bradley - Alternatives A and B
Overall, the changes in stream flows from baseline conditions would resemble the changes in releases from Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. Figure 5.3-39 shows
the average monthly Salinas River flows at Bradley under the Future Plus Project scenario of Alternative A. Alternative B would have similar tesults as Alternative A.
They are lower than the 2030 No-Action during the winter months, and higher than No- Action during the surnmer. In order to meet the fish flow requirements at Bradley (see Section 4.6), the operational criteria allows for appropriate release amount to maintain 155 cfs at Bradley when natural flow at Paso Robles is above 60 cfs.
Salinas River Outflow to Ocean- Alternatives A and B
Salinas River ocean outflow under the Future Baseline (2030) is estimated to be 269,099 249,000 AFY; the future operations of Alternatives A and B would reduce B it to approximately 261,000 239,000 AFY, over the 46-year hydrologic period.

Figures 5.3-40a and 5.3-40b show the average monthly Salinas River ocean outflow for the Future Baseline (2030) and future conditions of Alternatives A and B.
As shown in this figure, there would be a decrease in the ocean outflow during the winter, a slight increase during the spring, and an overall decrease on an average annual basis. The average annual decrease is due to the reduction in flood control releases and/or spills resulting from Nacimiento Reservoir undet the modified storage rule curve and increased use of water during the summer months to enhance groundwater recharge.
In order to minimize the impacts of the project operations on the flow conditions below the diversion facility, a one cfs flow would be maintained downstream from the diversion facility. This flow would be maintained during June - September, and while any releases are made for project water requirements.
Future Project Conditions - Impacr Analysis
Impacts to Groundwater Levels - Alternatives A and B
The SVIGSM was used to simulate the average annual groundwater elevations under the Future Plus Project scenario of Alternatives A and B. Under future operations of Alternative A, it is expected that the average annual groundwater levels would increase by 20.8 17.3, 9,6 9.5, 0.7 0.6, and 2.5 0.5 feet, in the Pressure, East Side, Forebay, and Upper Valley subareas, respectively (Figure 5.3-41 through 5.3.44).

(Alternative A 2030)
The 20.8 17.3- and 9.6 9.5-foot increase in average annual groundwater levels in the Pressure and East Side subareas would help to teduce seawater intrusion and would thus
be considered beneficial environmental impacts.
Under the future operations of Alternative B, it is expected that the average annual groundwater levels would also increase by 4, 5, 0.3, and 0.1 feet, in the Pressure, East Side, Forebay, and Upper Valley subareas, respectively (Figure 5.3-45 through 5.3-48). Similar to Alternative A, the 4- and 5-foot increase in average annual groundwater levels
in the Pressure and East Side subareas for Alternative B would help to reduce seawater intrusion and would thus be considered beneficial environmental impacts.
The conveyance of water released from the reservoirs via Salinas River channel would increase recharge through the Salinas River bed. The groundwater levels would thus increase in the Forebay and Upper Valley subareas. Although an increase in groundwater levels could raise water tables, the estimated increases are approximately 0.7 and 2.5 feet in the Forebay and Upper Valley subareas under future operations of Alternatives A and approximately 0.3 and 0.1 feet under Alternative B. This increase is not sufficient to affect any root zones.

Salinas Valley Water Project AR 02899

3-61 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Implementation of Future (2030) conditions for Alternatives A and B would increase average groundwater levels in all subareas of the basin. No root zones would be affected. This would be considered a beneficial impact of the project in the Pressure and East Side subareas, and a less-than- significant impact in the Forebay and Upper Valley subareas (Alt A-9, Alt B-9).
Impacts to Basin Groundwater Balance and Seawater Intrusion - Alternatives A
and B

Based on the simulation results using the SVIGSM, the average annual fresh groundwater storage, over the 46-year hydrologic record, is expected to decrease by 16,000 AFY under the Future Baseline (2030) conditions.
Implementation of the SVWP under future conditions would increase the average annual change in groundwater storage by approximately 300 200 and 500 AFY, under Alternative A and B, respectively. This increase in groundwater storage is largely due to reduction in groundwater pumping, in lieu of surface deliveries to the delivery areas, and additional recharge through the Salinas River bed.
The average annual rate of seawater intrusion, over the 46-year hydrologic record, is estimated to be 10,000 AFY, under the Future Baseline (2030) conditions. Implementation of Alternative A under future conditions, as well as Alternative B, would reduce seawater intrusion in the summer months and eliminate it in most of the winter
months. There would be an average annual rate of subsurface flow out to the ocean after implementation of either Alternative A or B under the future conditions.
Figure 5.3-49 shows the average monthly seawater intrusion for future conditions under Alternative A. This figure shows that seawater intrusion under the Future Baseline
(2030) conditions is occurring in nearly every month of the year. Figure 5.3-50 shows the annual rate of seawater intrusion under the 2030 No-Action and Alternative A future
conditions. Note that the rate of seawater intrusion would generally be below zero during normal and above normal water years when SVWP makes deliveries. During drought conditions, when the areas served by the SVWP water are served by groundwater, the rate of seawater intrusion would increase. However, on a long-term basis, there would be an average annual rate of subsurface outflow to the ocean after implementation. Figures 5.3-51 and 5.3-52 show the extent of simulated 500 mg/1 chloride concentration in the Pressure 180-Foot and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifers,
respectively.

Implementation of both Alternative A (with an expanded delivery area, if needed) and Alternative B would halt seawater intrusion. Seawater intrusion would be effectively reversed during normal and greater than normal rainfall years, and would occur at a rate less than current and Future Baseline (2030) conditions under drought conditions. The net effect, considering all rainfall years, would be no- additional seawater intrusion. This is a beneficial impact of Alternatives A and B (Alt A-11, Alt B-
10).

Under future conditions of Alternatives A and B, reoperation of the reservoirs to maximize conservation releases would continue. In addition, downstream diversion of
water from the Salinas River would be implemented. As a result, both Nacimiento and San Antonio would be reoperated to maximize both: conservation releases for recharge and to meet downstream diversion requirements. The release patterns proposed for both phases are very similar as explained below.
As a comparison, Figures 5.3-8 and 5.3-9 present the difference in proposed releases (by month) from baseline conditions under near-term project conditions of Alternative A and Figures 5.3-37 and 5.3-38 present the difference in proposed release from baseline conditions under future project conditions (Alternative B would have similar results as
Alternative A). As shown on these figures, the total volume of water releases from the reservoirs downstream into the Salinas River is less than 30,000 AF in any given month under both phases for Nacimiento Reservoir.
For San Antonio, an actual reduction in proposed releases would occur under the future
project conditions as compared to the Existing Condition with Project (the maximum monthly release under "Existing Plus Project" (1995) would be just over 8,000 AF compared to just over 7,000 AF under the subsequent phases).
Alternatives A and B are anticipated to have a less-than-significant impact on downstream flooding. This conclusion is based on an analysis of the flood events in comparison to channel capacity. As discussed, although Alternatives A and B would increase spring-time median flows, all increase would be well within the capacity of the existing channel and thus no project-induced flooding impacts are anticipated.
Based on the similarities between the reoperation proposed under near-term and future project conditions (Alternatives A and B), the downstream Salinas River flooding impacts under the future conditions would similarly have a less-than-significant impact (Alt A-11, Alt B-11).
Sediment Transport Impacts - Alternatives A and B 5 Alternatives A and B under future conditions would have similar sediment transport impacts to those anticipated under existing conditions. A brief explanation of how these impacts would differ by implementation stage is provided below, and the reader is 02906

No activities in the upstream watershed of the two existing reservoirs (Nacimiento and San Antonio) are proposed and thus no impact on sediment transport would occur. No
downstream degradation is anticipated as result of continuation of flows that are within
the range of flows that have occurred during the more than 40 years of reservoir
operation. During the future project conditions, reoperation of the reservoirs would continue and additional conservation releases would be made for the proposed downstream diversion of flows from the Salinas River. Reoperation during the future
project conditions would result in spring and summertime flows between 60 and 150 cfs in the lower reaches of the Salinas River, As described previously stated, the minimum threshold at which suspended sediments appear is 1,000 cfs and therefore no significant impacts are anticipated under both Alternatives A and B. A minimal "delta" could
develop at the upstream end of the impoundment; however, it will be flushed out with subsequent high flows in the winter. At the close of the diversion season, the impoundment will be drained slowly by incremental lowering of the spillway gates. In the Merritt Lake watershed and under Alternative B, a proposed 3,000 AF storage facility would be designed as a balancing reservoir for water diverted from the Salinas River. This storage facility would be designed to mimic existing drainage conditions (as previously described), and would have negligible downstream effect on sediment
transport.
Implementation of Alternatives A and B under future (2030) conditions would have 1 less-than- significant impact on sediment transport at the existing reservoirs, along the Salinas River and lagoon, and in the Merritt Lake watershed (Alt .A-12, Alt B-12).
ALTERNATIVE C
Under Alternative C, no action/no action, the SVIGSM shows a reduction in fresh water storage in the groundwater basin of 15,000 AFY under existing conditions, increasing to
•16,000 AFY in the future (2030). This is expected to result in an annual average increase of 10,000 AFY in seawater intrusion under current conditions and this would stay approximately the same into the future.
Alternative C, the no action alternative, would result in an annual increase of 10,000 AF in seawater intrusion to the 180-Foot and 400-Foot Aquifers. This would cause the seawater intrusion front to advance inland, eliminating the groundwater basin from use for potable and irrigation uses in areas where it advances. This is a significant impact. (Alt C-1)

ALTERNATIVES D AND E

Under Alternatives D and E, demand for water in the basin would be managed, either by the MCWRA (Alternative D) or through adjudication of the basin by the SWRCB (Alternative E). The net result of this would be to reduce the level of water use sufficiently to halt seawater intrusion. It is not known how much of a reduction would be needed, but it is estimated at 30% to 50% basin-wide.
Alternatives D and E, through forced reductions in groundwater use, would (by definition) halt seawater intrusion. This would result in a less-than-significant impact on seawater intrusion. (Alt D-1, Alt E-l)

5.3.1 MITIGATION MEASURES AND RESIDUAL IMPACTS

Mitigation measures are provided below for significant or potentially significant hydrologic and flooding impacts. These mitigation measures apply to components of Alternatives A and B, as indicated in the parentheses after the mitigation title. Impacts on Agricultural Areas (Alt A-8). If root zone problems and/or water logging occurs on agricultural areas due to the ponding upstream of the proposed surface diversion structure, then the MCWRA will install a subsurface drainage system to remove excess water from affected agricultural areas. This subsurface drainage system will consist of a tile drain system placed beneath the soil surface. The excess water collected in the tile drain system will be recaptured and returned to the project.
Residual impact: Less-than-significant flooding impacts.
Impacts on Seawater Intrusion (Alt C-1). Alternative C would result in a substantial increase in seawater intrusion. This impact is not mitigable within the context of a no action alternative.

Residual Impact: Significant and unavoidable.

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.4 (WATER QUALITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH)

1. In response to Comment 6-4, the first sentence on
hereby changed as follows: page 5.3-38 of the Draft EIR/EIS is

Alternative B would B include the proposed development of a water treatment plant to treat agrieultural or urban-water-supplies-water diverted from the Salinas River and stored in surface facilities, which would be used to supply agricultural or urban
users.

2. In response to Comment 14-1, page 5.4-26 of the Draft EIR/EIS is changed to add the following text after the discussion of Impact Alt A-6:

There is a potential that pathogens in the Salinas River could be diverted to the
irrigation system and then applied to crops. A high percentage of irrigation water in California is applied under similar circumstances with no known adverse health consequences. Nevertheless, the MCWRA will develop additional data to determine if any unusual circumstances would create potential health hazards from use of Salinas River water.

a There is a remote potential that pathogens that may be in Salinas River water would be diverted and applied to crops. This could create a potential health hazard, but this is not known without additional data and consultation. For this
reason, health hazards from use of diverted Salinas River water are considered
potentially significant (Alt A-6b).

AR 02911

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-73 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

The following mitigation measure is added to page 5.4-38:

Potential Health Hazatds from Use of Diverted River Water (Alt B-6b) The MCWRA will collect and analyze Salinas River water samples at the location where diversion is proposed. Once samples are analyzed, MCWRA will consult with the County Health Department and the
California Deparment of Health Services to determine if water treatment
is required. If water treatment is required to protect the beneficial uses of diverted river water, MCWRA will provide for such treatment.

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.5 (TERRESTRIAL BIOLOGY)

1. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, mitigation measure Alt A-7 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

Impacts to Riparian Habitat (Alt A-7). The MCWRA will mitigate for the loss of riparian habitat through a mitigation program that may inelude-a combination of the-follewing eptions The preeise mitigntion-will-be determined-through consultatien-with GDFG-and-USFWS, as required-to-ebtain-a-GWA-Seetien-404-Permit-from-the-USAGE outlined in Appendix A of this Final EIR/EIS.
Option 4
The loss of riparian habitat will be mitigated through replacement and/or restoration at least a 1:1 ratio (2.5 acres) that will be determined during the permitting process. The restoration will include a combination of new plantings and restoration of areas invaded by non-native species, at a ratio to be decided upon by the involved agencies. Mitigation for this impact will include development of a detailed riparian restoration plan, prepared by MCWRA and approved by CDFG and USFWS. The goal of the restoration plan will
be to eventually establish mature stands of riparian habitat near the banks of the lower Salinas River. The exact location and planting design will be developed through consultation with CDFG and USFWS. Performance standards will be included to ensure that an 80% coverage in replacement trees is achieved over a 5-year period checked by aerial photo coverage. Annual reports identifying planting success and monitoring efforts will be submitted by MCWRA to CDFG and USFWS.

2. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the third paragraph on page 5.5-36 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

Jurisdictional Waters of the U.S. that could be affected by the proposed spillway modification include all areas within the ordinary high water mark of Nacimiento Reservoir. These Waters of the U.S. would not be affected by the construction in the spillway because this construction activity would not result in the loss of these jurisdictional waters. Waters of the U.S. are subject to Section 404 of the CWA. Because construction activities associated with the modification of the Nacimiento
spillway would require construction activity below the ordinary high water mark, a Section 404 permit would be required by USACE. Construction activity would be permissible after obtaining : USACE Nationwide Permit 33 for dewatering and a Nationwide Permit 25 for structural discharge. A wetland delineation would not need to be completed to obtain either of these permits (B. Smith, pers. comm., 1998).

3. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the second to the last
paragraph on page 5.5-36 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

Operation of the Salinas River surface diversion facility would result in the formation of an inundation pool that would extend 4.5 3 miles upstream from the dam location (Figure 5.5-3 to 5.5-5). The reoperation of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs would cause a shift in the release patterns that would result in decreased flows in the

AR 02914

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-76 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

Salinas River during winter (between November and March, and increased flows during the summer (between April and October).

4. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the first three paragraphs on page 5.5-37 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:
To evaluate how construction and operation of the surface diversion facility would affect riparian habitat, vegetation currently present within the proposed area of inundation was quantified by plant community. The anticipated loss of riparian habitat, resulting from creation of the inundation pool was calculated by overlaying the arcas proposed to be inundated (i.c., arcas below the USGS 40' 9' contour line) onto aerial photographs with delineated boundaries for each community. It is assumed that all existing riparian vegetation in the proposed inundation arcas would be killed because the inundation pool would be present throughout most of the growing season (April through October). The amount of riparian habitat that would be temoved duting construction of the dam was quantified using drawings provided by project engineers.
The analysis-is-based on the best amilable informatien. The leeatien ef the- inundatien peol has-been-estimated-based-on spot-surveys. These-were interpelatedto-estimate-the appreximate-boundaties ofthe- peol. Thus, the analysis herein tepresents a reasenable estimate-of impacts, but -is not-preeise.  Additional topogmphie-surveys and habitat characterizatien may be conducted during the-Draft-EIR/BIS review peried.Ifse, the results will-be-tepetted -in the Final EIR/EIS Under-any circumstances, the analysis herein is reasenable-based en-available data,

Operation of the surface diversion facility would result in the flooding and subsequent
loss of an estimated 30 1.3 acres of riparian habitat above the aetive channel ordinary high water matk of the Salinas River. This was calculated by interpolating the topographic data avail able to estimate the inundation pool, then using geographic information system analysis to determine acreage. Creation of the inundation pool would likely promote growth and diversity of existing riparian vegetation along the edges of the pool. Likewise, riparian growth could become established in some upland areas that curtently receive only temporary flooding during the growing season. However, any expansion of existing riparian habitat is expected to be limited entirely to areas within the
existing channel because, based on observed practices, it is unlikely that riparian habitat
would be permitted by landowners to encroach into adjacent farmland located on both sides of the inundation pool. Creation of the inundation pool could also promote the establishment or spread of other wetland plant communities within the existing channel
such as freshwater emergent marsh. The tate and extent of expansion of these wedland communities into the inundation pool is difficult to predict and could be affected by the permitted channel maintenance activities (Regional 404 permit),

5. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the second and third 5
paragraphs on page 5.5-38 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

The net loss of riparian habitat resulting from construction and operation of the surface 02915 diversion facility is estimated to include 32 2.5 acres of existing mixed riparian habitat above the ordinary high water mark (Figures 5.5-3 through 5.5-5). This total

Salinas Valley Water Project 3-77 Response to Comments on the EIR/EIS

includes an estimated 30 1.3 acres lost due to flooding after creation of the inundation pool and the removal of 2 1.1 acres of habitat resulting from construction of the dam. Approximately 50-pereent-ef this-habitat is-mature. The remainder is-in various-stages-of regeneratien-fellewing reeent and (expected) ongeing maintenanec aetivity and channel seouting eaused by high-flews. Some enhancement of existing riparian vegetation and expansion of riparian habitat in uplands is anticipated, but because this habitat would
continue to be subject to removal from future stream maintenance activities, it is not included in the calculation.

Some habitat would likely be removed as a result of permitted channel maintenance activities, but the amount is not known. As a worst-case, it is assumed that proposed construction and operation of the surface diversion facility under Alternative A would be entirely responsible for the loss of an estimated 32 2.5 acres of mixed riparian babitat of varying quality. Mixed riparian habitat is considered a sensitive. habitat and is regulated by USACE and CDFG. This loss-would-substantially desrease the value of this area for a-number ofwildlifo-species. This impact would be significant (Alt A-7).

6. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the last two paragraphs on page 5.5-38 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

Construction and operation of the diversion facility under Alternative A could reduce
the number of breeding pairs of yellow warbler through direct removal of 2 1.1 acres of riparian vegetation during construction of the dam and the subsequent flooding and loss of approximately 30 1.3 acres of riparian habitat that is-considered may be suitable
nesting habitat. However, the loss of habitat for yellow warbler, yellow-breasted chat, and western pond turtle would not substantially reduce the amount of potential nesting habitat or the local or statewide population of these species. Creation of the inundation pool would likely increase the amount of aquatic habitat for western pond turtle; the
amount of upland habitat may be slightly reduced by flooding. Impacts associated with the surface diversion facility are not expected to affect California red-legged frog or least Bell's vireo because they are presumed absent.
Construction and operation of the of the diversion facility proposed under Alternative A would result in the loss of 32 2.5 acres of riparian habitat that is suitable for California red-legged frog, least Bell's vireo, yellow warbler, yellow-breasted chat, and western pond turtle. This impact would not substantially reduce the amount of potential habitat or the local or statewide populations for any of these species. California red-legged frog and least Bell's vireo are presumed absent from this location and neither species is expected to be afected by this impact. This would be a less-than-significant impact on all five special-
status species (Alt A-8).

7. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the second to the last
paragraph on page 5.5-45 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

Authorization for fills shall be secured from USACE via a Section 404 permit, and from CDFG via Section 1600 agreement from-CDFG, as-appropriater, and Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) via 401 certification.

8. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the fifth paragraph on page 5.5-46 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows: AR 02916

9. In response to several comments on the Draft EIR/EIS, the second to the last paragraph on page 5.5-46 in Section 5.5 has been revised to read as follows:

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.6 (FISH BIOLOGY)

1. In response to Comment 5-3, the first paragraph on page 5.6-16 of the Draft EIR/EIS is revised as follows:

The South Central California Coast ESU includes steelhead populations in streams from the Pajaro River (inclusive) to (but not including) the Santa Maria River. Snyder (1913) reported that steelhead entered all the tributaries to the Salinas River in large numbers during high flows. Before the Salinas Dam was built in 1942, adult steelhead migrated upstream as far as, or farther than, Pozo, east of San Luis Obispo. After the dam was built, adult steelhead migrated as far as the dam in varying numbers, dependent on the amount of rainfall (Titus, et. al., in press). In 1946, a year in which steelhead did not reach the dam, the estimated catch of steelhead in the Salinas River was 3,600 (White and Broderick, 1992). In the mid- 1960s, CDFG (1966) estimated that the ESU was composed of 27,750 spawning steelhead of which an estimated 500 spawned in the Salinas Basin. Five major streams (Pajaro River, Salinas River, Carmel River, Little Sur River, and Big Sur River) supported 4,750 spawners in the mid-1960s but have supported fewer than 500 in recent years (NMFS, 1997). Based on recent surveys in the Salinas River, primarily in the Arroyo Seco tributary (Hagar, 1996), the present Salinas run probably averages less than 50 fish. Based on these estimates, the Salinas run does not now, nor has it histerieally represented represent a significant numerical component of the ESU.

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.9 (RECREATION)

1. As stated in Master Response MR-2, and in response to several comments received, Page 5.9-20 of the Draft EIR/EIS is hereby revised as follows:
Reservoir Impacts at San Antonio and Nacimiento Reservoirs during Existing Plus Project and Future Plus Project scenarios (Alt A-1, Alt B-1, Alt A-3, Alt B-3).
MCWRA will coordinate with Monterey County Parks Department and lake concessionaires to determine the feasibility of extending public boat launch ramps and stationary boat docks at the two reservoirs. This would allow the public to access these reservoirs during periods when low lake-levels make lake access difficult.
Residual Impact: Existing Plus Project conditions would result in significant impacts to recreational resources. Because of the proposed mitigation would not reduce the
number of days below the 730-foot threshold, the residual impact remains significant
and unavoidable.

CHANGES TO SECTION 5.11 (AIR QUALITY)

1. In response to Comment 11-1, the first paragraph on page 5.11-3 of the Draft EIR/EIS is revised to read:

As required by the CCAA, the District adopted the 1991 Air Quality Management Plan for the Monterey Bay Region. The 1991 AQMP addressed planning requirements to meet the ozone standard mandated by the CCAA and included measures to control emissions of VOC from stationary and mobile sources. Since the 1991 AQMP was adopted, control requirements have been reduced, and the plan was updated in 1994 and 1997 to reflect these changes. The 1991 AQMP was most recently updated in 1997 2000. The 1997-2000 AQMP update included current air quality data related to ozone precursor emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NO), which in the presence of sunlight combine in the atmosphere to form ozone; up-to-date population forecast; revisions to emission inventory, forecasts and design value; changes to the emission reduction strategy; and progress report on implementation of the 1991 AQMP (MBUAPCD, 2000).

2. In response to Comment 11-2, the second paragraph on page 5.11-3 of the Draft
EIR/EIS is revised to read:

The 'Clean Air Act requires that projects receiving federal funds demonstrate conformity to the local AQMP. Conformity guidelines for the AQMP extend these requirements to all regionally significant projects, regardless of whether federal funding is being sought. Emission forecasts contained in the AQMP are based on population forecasts adopted by the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) and the San Benito County Council of Governments (SBCOG). For population-related projects, eenfermity-consistency with the AQMP, for determination of long-term cumulative impacts, is assessed by comparing the projected population growth associated with the project to these population forecasts (MBUAPCD, 1997).

3. In response to Comment 11-3, the second paragraph on page 5.11-5 of the Draft
EIR/EIS is revised to read:

The Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD) is responsible for monitoring air quality in the NCCAB. MBUAPCD samples ambient air at ten monitoring stations in the basin (Figure 5.11-1). Ambient air quality in the SCCAB NCAAB is described in terms of compliance with state and national ambient air quality standards (AAQS) (Table 5.11-1).

4. In response to Comment 11-4, Table 5.11-5 on page 5.11-14 of the Draft EIR/EIS is revised to read:

The MBUSPCD Guidelines provide that construction ernissions of the ozone precursor pollutants VOCs and NO, are accommodated for in the emissions inventories of state- and federally-required air plans. Accordingly, construction-related VOC and NO% emissions need not be specifically quantified (MBUAPCD, 2000). MBUAPCD-approved dispersion modeling can be used to refute the determination that a proposed project would result in a significant construction-related PMi0 impact based on a projected exceedance of the MBUAPCD threshold.
The SLOPACD provides a tiered approach to the significance of operational emissions. Projects for which emission levels can be reduced to less than 25 pounds per day for ROG, NO,, SO2, or PM1o, and to less than $50 pounds per day for CO through the implementation of mitigation measures provided by the SLOCAPCD can be approved without a finding of significance as long as the District's recommended mitigation measures are implemented. n/s Not Specified Source: MBUAPCD, 2000; SLOCAPCD, 1995.

6. In response to Comment 11-5, the second and third paragraphs on page 5.11-17 of the Draft EIR/EIS are revised to read:

Given the area of disturbance and amount of equipment and personnel required, construction of the diversion facility options (i.e., collection wells or the infiltration galleries) would each generate similar levels of pollutants. As presented in Table 5.11-6,
on an individual component basis, emissions associated with construction of the
diversion facilities, pipelines, and the Merritt Lake surface water storage option could potentially exceed the MBUAPCD's daily significance threshold of 82 lbs/day for PM10- Consuuetion generated emissions associnted-with-the-Mewritt-Lake- surface-water storage would also excced the MBUAPCD's daily significance thresheld ef 550-lbs/day-fer-cO. Construction-generated emissions associated with the subsurface water storage option would not be anticipated to exceed the MBUAPCD's daily significance thresholds of 82 Ibs/day for PM1 ex 550 ls/day-fer-co:
Combined daily emissions of PM,, and-CO associated with construction of the proposed Alternative B facilities would exceed the MBUAPCD's construction ernission thresholds
of 82 pounds per day for PMy and 550 pounds-per-day-fer €O. Based on the analysis conducted, construction of the proposed facilities would have a significant short-term impact on air quality in the NCCAB and a potentially significant impact on adjacent agricultural crops (Alt B-1).
CHANGES TO CHAPTER 7.0 (GROWTH-INDUCING IMPACTS)

1. In response to Comment 3-11, the following is added to page 7-11 of the Draft EIR/EIS:

The MCWRA will work with Monterey County and the cities and communities
within the County tO encourage maximum use of water conservation practices in
new development, including the use of ultra low-flow water fixtures and drought- tolerant/low water demanding landscaping.

2. In response to Comment 3-11, the following is added to page 7-11 of the Draft
EIR/BIS:

As local jurisdictions consider development proposals, they should aggressively implement general plan policies and other zoning ordinances and programs that result in reducing potential environmental impacts, including impacts to agriculture, water use, traffic, air quality, and biology. While these programs are not within the purview of the MCWRA or the USACE, they are reasonable requests that would help reduce potential impacts from land use conversion.
These progtams would be the responsibility of local agencies as part of their land
use approval process.

INTRODUCTION

The Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) has proposed to install a diversion dam on the Salinas River as a component of the Salinas Valley Water Project
(SVWP). This component is referred to as the Alternative A Impoundment in the EIR/S
for the SVWP (EDAW, 2001). If constructed the surface water diversion would be located within the SE ¼ of Section 16, Township 14S, Range 2E, MDB&M, approximately 6 miles northwest of the city of Salinas. The diversion is located immediately downstream of the Blanco Drain between State Highway 1 and the Blanco Road crossings, south west of Salinas in Monterey County, California (Figure 1). The impoundment is designed to store water up to an elevation of nine feet above mean sea level (msl). The backwater effect is anticipated to extend from the diversion location to approximately 1500 feet upstrcam of Blanco Road, approximately 3.2 miles in total length (Figure 2). The impoundment at full pool will be approximately 48 acres. The objective of the diversion is to provide irrigation water for Salinas Valley farms during the growing season so that they need not pump groundwater from the aquifer. The diversion would be in operation from April through October. The water surface of the impoundment elevation during the period of operation is anticipated to fluctuate on a daily basis between elevations of 8 and 9 feet msl. The diversion is designed to operate
with fluctuations between 5 and 9 feet msl.

The SVWP has several additional components, including reoperation of Nacimiento and
San Antonio reservoirs to provide water for diversion at the site discussed in this
document (EDAW, 2001). The objective of the SVWP is to reduce seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley groundwater aquifers.
Given the operational parameters of the impoundment there is concern that local resources including riparian forest, jurisdictional wetlands, and agricultural land could be adversely affected by the proposed project. This study was designed to provide additional insight on the potential for adverse effects or beneficial enhancements to riparian resources and agricultural lands adjacent to the proposed impoundment at full pool (i.e. above 9 ft msl. The potential impacts are associated with potential seasonal inundation of riparian habitat and the increase in the adjacent groundwater elevation anticipated to occur when the impoundment is in operation. Low-lying agricultural lands could be affected by a predicted increase in groundwater surface elevation that could influence
subsurface drainage and irrigation systems (typically located 1 to 3 feet below the 1 ground
surface) and potentially the crop root zone (typically within Ifoot of the ground surface).

Based on these concerns, four specific objectives have been outlined for this analysis:
Determine the extent of the effects, if any, on adjacent agricultural fields due to
increased groundwater levels;

I-1 AR 02931

Determine the acreage and quality of riparian cover types above the proposed impoundment water surface elevation (9 ft msl) that may be affected by the impoundment through inundation or increased groundwater surface elevation;
Determine the extent and type of jurisdictional wetlands that may be affected by the proposed diversion impoundment; and
Evaluate potential mitigation measures and locations in the immediate vicinity of the impoundment.
The study area includes streamside forests and agricultural fields adjacent to the Salinas River extending from the site of the proposed diversion dam to approximately 1,500 feet upstream of Blanco Road. The basic approach used for this study was to (1) measure the elevation of key resources in the study area including fields, levecs, drains, and the river bed elevation; (2) map and spatially register the riparian cover types, agricultural lands, and the cxtent of anticipated backwater inundation; and (3) identify low lying areas that could be subject to adverse impacts related to impoundment water storage.
Data from two companion studies are also used in this analysis. Borcalli & Associates (B&A) designed the diversion structure and defined the facility and construction footprint (B&A, 2002). EDAW conducted field surveys to determine the location of the ordinary high water mark (OHWM) and delineate US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional wetlands within the impoundment area (EDAW, 2002):
This document is organized to first describe the methods used to characterize riparian and agricultural site conditions. Section 3 summarizes the results of the field surveys and data analysis. Section 4 then presents potential impacts to resources adjacent to the proposed diversion impoundment and, finally, Section 5 outlines mitigation needs based on the impact analysis.

METHODOLOGY

This section outlines the methods used in the various components of this study, including data collection and data processing.

2.1 ELEVATION SURVEY METHODOLOGY

The objective of collecting land surface elevation data was to develop a digital terrain
model that could be used (1) to determine the anticipated location of the water surface elevation for the proposed impoundment at full pool; and (2) to determine the elevation of surrounding riparian habitat and agricultural fields relative to the proposed
impoundment. Agricultural Surveys, Inc. (Ag Surveys) collected all of the land surface
elevation data used in this study.
One data set was collected in July 2000 as part an effort to select the location of the
proposed diversion. These data consist of several channel cross sections, spaced at 1,000-foot intervals along the length of the study area. In August of 2001 Ag Surveys a conducted a second survey designed to identify the location of the uppermost extent of inundation that would result from the proposed impoundment (i.e. water surface elevation at full pool, 9 feet above msl). This was accomplished through an iterative process of
surveying several locations on the stream bank until a shot was collected at the 9-foot elevation. This process was conducted throughout the length of the proposed impoundment area. Ag Surveys then interpolated a contour line from these points. The
surveying firm also collected land surface elevation data from the agricultural fields, farm
roads, drains, and levees adjacent to the river. All of this information was combined and
used in the digital terrain model developed by ENTRIX (see Section 2.3).

2.2 RIPARIAN VEGETATION MAPPING METHODOLOGY

The objective of mapping the riparian vegetation was to identify the dominant riparian vegetation assemblages that makeup the streamside forests along the Salinas River and characterize their distribution and vertical structure. Riparian vegetation mapping occurred the week of September 7, 2001 and on October 24-25, 2001. The study area for this mapping effort extended from the location of the proposed diversion to approximately 1,500 feet upstream of Blanco Road (Figure 2). Vegetation was
characterized and mapped to a distance of approximately 500 from the OHWM on both
sides of the Salinas River.

The boundaries of the vegetation polygons were delineated in the field and drawn on aerial photographs, which were later digitized and geo-referenced for use in a Geographic Information System (GIS). Polygon boundaries were determined based on species composition, height, and canopy composition. For each vegetation polygon, each observed tree species, the height of the dominant and sub-dominant cohorts, and the percentage of the overhead canopy occupied by trees of a given height or age class were recorded. In some cases, it was possible to delineate groups of polygons consisting of

2-1 AR 02933

only one or a clearly dominant tree species. In other cases, the polygons were classified as "mixed forest". Understory vegetation was recorded in instances where it was
believed to influence the overall structure of a forest stand. The location of Arundo was
recorded in every instance where it was observed. Herbaceous and shrub-like vegetation
were recorded and mapped in areas where they were the dominant plant types observed.
Vegetation height was determined by visual estimation, as was canopy composition. Canopy composition, for this study, is defined as the percentage of a given height interval within a vegetation group occupied by the crown of trees of a single species and cohort.
In several areas the riparian forest and understory was too dense to establish transects or
pathways for direct observation from the ground. Visual observations of these stands were made from the accessible perimeter and the interior portions were evaluated for cover type based on observation of aerial photographs. Map polygons defined from aerial photography are differentiated on the maps from those mapped on the ground.
The field maps were brought into the GIS via "on-screen digitizing". When placing the lines for the vegetation polygon coverage, attempts were made to discriminate between shadows and tree crowns but it was often difficult to accurately distinguish one from the other. Thus, the boundaries of these polygons are reasonable approximations of the
vegetation type locations.
Once the raw data were digitized and geo-referenced, preliminary exploratory data
analysis was conducted in order to create classifications to summarize the observed
assemblages. Forested single species stands were given individual classifications. In
cases where a given species was particularly abundant (e.g., willow) or tall (e.g.,
cottonwood) classifications were subdivided to reflect differences in stand structure. The
"mixed forest" classification was also subdivided to reflect differences in stand structure
and to identify areas with multiple age classes. The non-forested classifications were
determined based on the dominant cover type a for a given area. A further description of the riparian cover types used and the results of this study are provided in Section 3.

2.3 GROUNDWATER IMPACT ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY

The objective of the groundwater impact analysis was to determine if predicted changes
in groundwater surface elevation resulting from operation of the river impoundment
could: 1) adversely impact agricultural resources in the study area; and 2) adversely impact or potentially enhance riparian resources adjacent to the impoundment.
Impoundment-related impacts to these resources could result through direct inundation or
subsurface inundation of the associated root zone when the proposed diversion would be operated. To accomplish this objective, a digital terrain model was created to represent the elevation of the ground surface and an approximation of the groundwater surface that is anticipated to result from the proposed impoundment when at full pool. By comparing these two modeled "surfaces," areas potentially affected by anticipated changes in groundwater elevation could be identified and quantified.
The hydrologic analysis for the impoundment provided in the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) (EDAW, 2001) indicates that

2-2 AR 02934

raising the surface water elevation in the river channel to 9 feet msl seasonally could result in a 2 foot rise in the groundwater surface elevation at distances of 800 to 1,000 feet beyond the Salinas River. Therefore, the area considered in this analysis was limited to the length of the Salinas River channel that is anticipated to have backwater effects from the diversion dam (i.e. the impounded area) and the adjacent riparian and agricultural zones extending 1,000 feet to each side.
To create the terrain model, elevation data collected by Ag Surveys was used to generate a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) surface. The TIN represents the ground surface elevation within the 1,000-foot analysis area. The overall analysis area was broken into two point coverages, one for each side of the river. Points within the TIN were spaced at a 10-foot interval. Ground surface elevations for both point coverages from the ground surface TIN using ArcInfo. were interpolated

Calculations for the groundwater surface elevation model were confined to the same 1,000-foot analysis area. For each point coverage, the distance of aii points from the nearest location on the 9-foot contour was calculated using ArcInfo. This lateral distance was then used to calculate the height of the new groundwater level at the point's location according to the following relationship:

9 ft
}- 2 ft
1000 ft

This model assumes that storage of water behind the surface impoundment at an elevation of 9-feet msl will increase the elevation of the groundwater a table at a distance of 1,000-feet from the channel by 2-feet. This assumption is based on the analysis completed in the EIR/S for the SVWP (EDAW, 2001). It further assumes that the current height of the groundwater table in the immediate vicinity of the river is equal to the river bed elevation. The surface elevation at the proposed location of the diversion structure is 0-feet msl (B&A, 2002). For the purposes of this simple analysis the slope of the groundwater table is assumed to be constant. Because of the typically shallow slope of the Salinas Valley in this area and the high hydraulic conductivity of the unconsolidated alluvial sediments that are located near the surface in the area of the impoundment, the assumption of a relatively flat existing groundwater table is reasonable. However, on the west bank (left side facing downstream) of the Salinas River near the upstream end of the proposed impoundment, there is bluff. It is unclear where the existing groundwater table in this area would be located based on general hydraulic and geomorphologic principals and it is difficult to obtain actual groundwater table elevation information. Therefore, no analysis related to the effect of the project on the groundwater table in this location was made as part of this study.

2-3 AR 02935

To calculate the height of the new groundwater level (G1) at any point (P1) within a distance of 1,000 feet from the river's edge, the following equation was used:

Where G| is the modeled elevation of the groundwater in feet above msl that is anticipated to result from the proposed impoundment, S is the slope of the groundwater table (see Equation 2 below), and D is the distance from the 9-foot msl contour which is the maximum elevation of the diversion impoundment. The slope (S) is calculated from the relationship noted above such that:

S = Tan 0 = (Rise/Run) = 7/1000 = 0.007 Equation 2
To complete the groundwater surface elevation model, the two point coverages were converted to surface elevation grids and groundwater elevation grids (Cell size = 10 ft.). The difference between the terrain surface elevation and the predicted groundwater level was calculated. The resultant grids were reclassified into 3 categories:
Difference: < 1 foot
Difference: 1 to 3 feet 1
Difference: >3 feet

The less than 1-foot category is intended to identify those areas where the groundwater table could directly influence the vegetation root zone and subsurface drains. The 1 to 3- foot category is intended to identify those areas where the groundwater table could influence subsurface agricultural irrigation and drainage systems, as well as the root zones of mature riparian trees and shrubs. The greater than 3-foot category identifies those areas where agricultural and riparian resources are unlikely to be influenced by the increased groundwater elevation.
The reclassified grids were converted to polygon coverages, which were later merged into one polygon coverage. A spatially referenced representation of field boundaries was then used to identify specific agricultural fields and riparian habitat that might be impacted by the increased groundwater elevation. This was accomplished by calculating the total acreage. of the areas classified as "Difference 0 to 1 feet" and "Difference between and 3 feet" existing within the boundaries of the corresponding riparian or agricultural areas. The results of this analysis are presented in Section 4.

RESULTS

3.1 RIPARIAN HABITAT CHARACTERIZATION

Approximately 190 acres of streamside vegetation were mapped within 500 feet of the edge of the river channel OHWM as part of this effort. Although, in some cases, individual trees were mapped, in most cases groups of trees with similar characteristics were mapped. Observed trees include willow (Salix spp.), cottonwood (Populus spp.), box elder (Acer negundo), coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa), and tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca). A list of observed species is provided in Table 1. Figures 3a through 3e show the extent and distribution of the
vegetation cover types mapped. Table 2 notes the number of acres and the percent of the tota! area occupied by each cover type. Representative photographs are provided in Appendix A.
Willow and mixed forest comprise approximately 79% of the 190 acres of riparian vegetation mapped (Table 1). Willows were pervasive throughout the study area and were often the dominant component of the mixed forest classification. Single species willow stands comprised 36.3% of the total area mapped. Although willows are typically classified as facultative wet species (FACW), for the purposes of wetland delineation, the willow stands in the study area above the OHWM appear to lack indicators of wetland hydrology and hydric soils. EDAW (2002) found that no jurisdictional wetlands existed above the OHWM in the study area.
Pure cottonwood stands were rare (2.8% of the total area) and in many cases consisted of a single large tree that was distinct from the surrounding vegetation. Cottonwoods were, however, an important component of the mixed forest classification. This is especially : true of the mixed forests with multi-level canopies. In these stands very large cottonwoods (>40 ft. tall), with relatively little canopy closure (e.g., <50%), tower above a shorter cohort of trees with much denser canopies. At least four size (age) classes were observed in these multi-level mixed forests. These size classes generally corresponded to trees ranging from 0-10 feet tall, 10-20 feet tall, 20-35 feet tall, and greater than 35 feet. Occasionally, willows were the dominant trees in the tallest height class. In these cases, the uppermost canopy in the stand tended to be denser and canopy composition was frequently greater than 50%. The subdominant trees in the mixed forest classification
were typically younger willows and cottonwoods although numerous box elder were observed in some stands on the Northeast side of the river (right side looking downstream).

The understory in most areas was very dense. Poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum) and Pacific blackberry (Rubus ursinus) were observed in the understory of nearly every forested stand along the river.

3-1

Over 60% of the forest stands classified in this study have a dominant tree cohort greater than 30 feet tall. Most of these stands have at least one subdominant cohort and many
have several. The vertical structure of the riparian forests in the study area appears to have resulted from a mixture of natural and anthropogenic disturbances. In general,
forest stands closest to the river channel are shorter than those at a greater distance. Large winter storms are common on the Salinas River and maximum daily flows may exceed
60,000 cubic feet per second (Figure 4). It appears that these large scouring flows often
"reset" the vegetation near the channel. Vegetation removed by periodic channel maintenance programs may also influence the forest structure of vegetation in close
proximity to the channel. The intent of these programs is to increase the flood conveyance capacity of the river by removing vegetation and scarifying sandbars in and around the active channel. At least two sections of the channel in the study area had been
recently maintained.
All or portions of this riparian corridor are periodically inundated by very large floods, for example the flood of 1995. It is possible that the current uneven age structure observed in many of the mixed forest stands reflects new tree recruitment that occurred after such large but infrequent floods. Review of historical aerial photography indicates that the extent and size of forested cover in the study area has increased since 1937, just prior to the construction of the USACOE levees in this reach.
The dense, mature riparian vegetation above the 9-foot msl contour provides good quality refuge for wildlife particularly in those areas where the riparian corridor extends more than 500 feet from the edge of the river channel. The mature trees provide numerous perch and nesting sites for birds, and the dense understory provides cover and provides good insect foraging areas. The dense understory may also provide good cover for amphibians, such California red-legged frogs (Rana aurora draytonii) that may utilize the river channel for foraging and dispersal.
Giant reed (Arundo donax), an invasive exotic species, was commonly found at the transition between the active channel and the forested floodplain. Arundo was observed in 32 of 135 polygons in the study area covering a total of 1.6 acres. Near the proposed diversion site, Arundo was Observed fringing the channel edge and would be immediately
adjacent to the proposed impoundment at full pool (see Figure 3a). Arundo was also
observed at discrete locations near the forest edge and adjacent to agricultural land. It was rarely, if ever, observed within forest stands with dense canopy cover.

3.2 GROUNDWATER ELEVATION RESULTS

Using the analysis outlined in Section 2.3, simulated groundwater contour lines were developed for the lands adjacent to the proposed diversion impoundment (Figure 5). The contour lines represent the modeled groundwater surface elevation above mean sea level.
In additión to mapping these groundwater elevations, the results of estimating the difference in land surface elevation and groundwater elevation is also present in Figure 5.
For purposes of this study, it was assumed that impacts to agricultural crops may occur when the depth from ground surface to groundwater surface is less than one foot and that

3-2 AR 02938

subsurface agricultural drains and irrigation systems may be impacted where the groundwater surface elevation rises-to within 3 feet of the land surface. Areas meeting these criteria are depicted on Figure 5.

3.3 WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES
In addition to characterizing the riparian corridor, EDAW conducted an evaluation of the area within the OHWM or the 9-foot msl contour, which ever was higher (EDAW, 2002). The area below the OHWM is considered jurisdictional waters of the United States by the Army Corps of Engineers and is subject to the permit requirements of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act. The findings of the wetland delineation were reviewed and approved by the USACOE and are summarized below.

3.3.1 EPHEMERAL WETLANDS
Jurisdictional ephemeral wetlands were identified in the river channel below the OHWM. These wetlands consist of vegetated sandbars and small patches of freshwater marsh. The presence of these wetlands is dependent upon water year conditions and the frequency with which channel maintenance work for vegetation removal and sandbar grading has occurred under the Salinas River Channel Maintenance Program Regional General 404 Permit. The USACOE is not expected to request mitigation for seasonal inundation of these ephemeral wetlands (pers. com. with Bob Smith, USACOE).
Vegetated Sandbar
Numerous vegetated sandbars occur within the channel of the Salinas River in the study area. Vegetated sandbars occupy approximately 18.8 acres of the river channel below the OHWM. Vegetation on the vegetated sandbars is dominated by hydrophytes, including rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) (FACW), bearded sprangletop (Leptochloa fascicularis) obligate (OBL), sourclover (Melilotus indica) (FAC), and barnyard grass . (Echinochloa crus-galli) (FACW). Willow (Salix spp.) seedlings are present as well.
The sandbars are located within the OHWM of the Salinas River and are inundated for long periods of time. Sediment deposits and oxidized rhizospheres were observed during field surveys. The soils underlying the vegetated sandbars are characterized by low chroma colors, with some gleyed inclusions (2.5Y 4/2, 2.5Y 4/2 with 4/10Y mottles, 2.5Y 4/2 with 3/N and 2.5/N mottles, and 2.5Y 4/2 with 2.5N mottles). Based on these indicators the soils qualify as hydric. The boundaries of the vegetated sandbars were determined based on changes in vegetation cover and landscape position.
Freshwater Marsh

Small linear patches of freshwater marsh occur in the study area within the channel of the Salinas River at the lower elevations of the vegetated sandbars described above. No separate acreage was determined for the freshwater marsh habitat, as it occurs in narrow fringes along the vegetated sandbars described above.

3-3 AR 02939

Vegetation in the fresh water marshes is dominated by hydrophytic vegetation, including rabbitfoot grass (Polypogon monspeliensis) (FACW), bulrush (Scirpus americanus, S. robustus) (OBL) and common horsetail (Equisetum arvense) (FAC). Arroyo willows
(Salix lasiolepis) (FACW) are also present.
The fresh water marsh habitats are located within the OHWM of the Salinas River and
are saturated for long periods of time. The sandy soils underlying the fresh water marshes are characterized by low chroma colors ( 10YR 4/2 and 2.5Y 4/2) and aquic moisture regime. Based on these indicators the soils qualify as hydric. The boundaries were determined based in changes in vegetation cover and landscape position.

3.3.2 PERMANENT WETLANDS

EDAW evaluated areas between the OHWM and the 9-foot msl contour to delineate
permanent jurisdictional wetlands. No permanent jurisdictional wetlands exist in this
portion of the study area.
During the riparian habitat surveys ENTRIX looked for evidence of permanent wetlands in low-lying areas within the riparian corridor above the 9-foot msl contour. No evidence of wetlands was found. This does not preclude possible existence of small wetland areas
with in the inaccessible portions of the broader areas of riparian forest. The soils on the upland flood plain are typically well drained and appear unlikely to pond water even in
low-lying areas.
Based on these field observations, it is unlikely that permanent or seasonal wetlands exist
in the study area.
3.3.3 OPEN WATER HABITAT / SALINAS RIVER

The Salinas River is the dominant feature of the study area. The channel bottom typically
is completely filled with water during the rainy season, completely flooding the vegetated
sandbars and freshwater marsh noted above. The vegetated areas are often scoured or
destroyed by these floods and reappear at other locations the following spring and
summer. The presence of these vegetated habitats are fostered by excess releases under
the current conservation release program from the upstream reservoirs.
Habitats in the river-channel can be broken down into the open water habitat occupying the low flow channel of the river and areas occupied by vegetated sandbar and freshwater marsh as described above. All of these habitat types are located below the OHWM of the
channel, which can be easily distinguished on the banks of the river by characteristic drift
lines and shelving. The open water habitat in the low flow channel of the river occupies
approximately 32.4 acres during the summer months.

3.4 DIVERSION CONSTRUCTION

The proposed di version dam will be a pneumatically controlled inflatable dam that will extend across the Salinas River, 200 feet in total length (Borcalli et al., 2002). The height of the Obermeyer Spillway gate will be controlled with an inflatable air bladder. The

3-4 AR 02940

dam foundation elevation will be positioned to maintain grade control at El. 0.0, except for a 10-foot recessed segment immediately adjacent to the intake and fishway entrance. This invert section, set at El. -1.0, will be positioned such that when the Lagoon is open to the ocean and water is not being diverted, the 10-foot wide* lower section will always have approximately one foot of water depth, except when there is very little flow and a tide less than minus 1.0. When the Lagoon is closed, the water level will generally be controlled to approximately El. 2.0 to 3.0, thereby flooding the diversion site with the gates lowered. The compressor and controls for the air bladder will be located near a pump station out of the channel.

The footprint for the diversion facility is 1.7 acres shown on Figure 3a with an addition 2 acres for construction staging areas. Of the 1.7 acre facility footprint, a total 0.6 acres of the facility is in the river channel below the OHWM, 0.9 acres of riparian habitat above the OHWM will be permanently lost, and 0.2 acres outside of the channel will be devoted to the pumpstation. The construction will require the temporary disruptionof approximately 0.2 acres of riparian habitat on the left bank provide access (facing downstream) to to the left end of the diversion structure. A 2-acre construction staging and soil stock piling area will be required. However, it is anticipated that this can be placed on adjacent agricultural land.

POTENTIal IMPACTS

The proposed surface water diversion would operate from April to October, Average daily flows for the Salinas River, at the Spreckels gage, during this period range from
roughly 25 to 1,200 cubic feet per second (Figure 6). Currently, water surface elevations during low flow periods generally occur around sea level. Operation of the impoundment would increase the elevation of the river's water surface to 9 feet msl during the summer
months. The storage of water behind the impoundment would inundate portions of the
channel that typically would be dry during the summer. The area and extent of this inundation would decrease with increasing distance from the diversion site as the backwater effect diminished and the water surface neared its pre-impoundment elevation. Water storage is also anticipated to alter the elevation of the groundwater table in areas
immediately adjacent to the river channel. A simple model was used to predict how the
diversion impoundment might affect the elevation of the adjacent groundwater table.

4.1 RIPARIAN VEGETATION

The objective of this part of the study was to quantify the total area of riparian forest susceptible to impacts based on the increase in water surface elevation, describe the assemblage of species in those areas and, assess their quality in the event that mitigation for lost resources may be necessary. Construction of the diversion dam and operation of the impoundment could affect the study area in these ways: construction impacts, inundation or impacts associated with increased groundwater elevation.

4.1.1 GROUNDWATER AFFECTS

Based on the comparison of the simulated groundwater surface and the digital terrain model, it is anticipated that the proposed impoundment will raise the groundwater table into the root zone of small areas immediately adjacent to the channel (the red areas in Figure 5). Several such areas are currently forested. In addition, the groundwater is anticipated to rise to within 1 to 3 feet in other areas in the riparian forest (the green areas in Figure 5).. Potentially impacted forest stands were identified by intersecting geo-
referenced representations of the 9-foot contour and the vegetation polygon data set. It is likely that the groundwater elevation influence will be greater in the downstream end of
the impoundment where the water will be impounded to a greater depth relati ve to the
surrounding baseline groundwater elevation.
This analysis revealed that only 1.9 acres of riparian habitat would be affected by inundation of the root zone (i.e. <1 foot depth to groundwater) by the project impoundment (Table 3, red area in Figure 5). This is less than 1% of the 190 acres of riparian habitat mapped in the study area. Of these 1.9 acres, the two dominant cover types are 0.45 acres classified as herbaceous vegetation, and 0.44 acres classified as Mixed Forest- multilevel Canopy, which is typically dominated by willows.

4-1 AR 02942

Up to 32.5 acres of riparian forest are predicted to be influenced by a groundwater table increase to within 1 to 3 feet of the ground surface (Table 4, green areas in Figure 5). Willows less than 30 feet tall and willows greater than 30 feet tall are the two cover types influenced to the greatest extent, 5.4 acres and 11 acres, respectively (Table 4). Within the affected acreage, Monterey cypress (0.002 acres) and bacharis (coyote brush, 0.08 acres) are the only plant species identified that might not be enhanced and could be adversely affected by the presence of long-term shallow groundwater. Neither of these species is typically a riparian corridor inhabitant.
Riparian forests are dominated by hydrophytic (water loving) plants that have evolved to inhabit the wetter areas immediately adjacent to streams and rivers. Therefore, increasing the groundwater surface elevation in these areas is not anticipated to result in adverse
conditions for the existing vegetation. The majority of the cover types influenced, particularly willow and cottonwood, will benefit from an increase in groundwater elevation. The greater availability of water during the growing season can improve growing conditions for these species and may result in an improvement in the riparian forest in these areas.

The long term saturation of the root zone could result in anaerobic conditions, which can
adversely affect riparian vegetation. However, such conditions are not expected to occur
because the impoundment will fluctuate daily from 1 to 4 feet in water surface elevation
depending upon the rate of inflow to the impoundment and the demand for irrigation water. The groundwater surface elevation is expected to fluctuate in muted response to these changes in surface water elevation. In addition, the soils in this area are typically
well drained and are unlikely to generate anaerobic conditions.

Evapotranspiration is the transport of water through the roots and plant vascular system to the atmosphere via stomatal pores in the leaf surface in response to atmospheric conditions (i.e., temperature and humidity). Evapotranspiration will be at its peak during the summer months when the impoundment is in use; which may reduce or drawdown to a large extent the predicted increase in groundwater surface elevation. It is anticipated
that the riparian forested areas will benefit from the additional groundwater available.

4.1.2 DIVERSION DAM CONSTRUCTION

In addition to effects due to groundwater surface elevation affects, the installation of the proposed diversion facility will result in removal of approximately 0.9 acres of riparian
vegetation located on the east bank of the Salinas River immediately adjacent to the
proposed di version dam (Figure 3a). The vegetation at this location includes three cover
types in relatively equal proportions, herbaceous, willows less than 30 feet tall, and willows greater than 30 feet tall (Figure 3a). Access to the left bank of the river during dam construction will temporarily remove 0.2 acres of riparian habitat.

4.1.3 INUNDATION

Evaluation of the riparian habitat below the 9-foot msl contour conducted by EDAW
indicates that a total of 5 acres exist between the OHWM and the 9-foot contour. This

4-2 AR 02943

area will be inundated when the impoundment is at full pool and is comprised of approximately 0.5 acres of arundo, 3.2 acres of sand, 0.3 acres of mixed forest, and acres of willow. It is anticipated that the mixed forest and willow habitat will not survive long-term inundation.

4.1.4 SUMMARY

In summary the impoundment will influence the riparian corridor in several different ways:

Approximately 0.9 acres of willows and herbaceous riparian habitat will be permanently lost due to construction of the diversion facilities;
Approximately 0.2 acres of willows will be temporary disturbed due to construction access on the left bank;
Approximately 0.3 acrès of mixed forest riparian habitat and 1 acre of willows present below the 9-foot msl contour will be lost due to inundation; and
Approximately 34.4 acres of riparian habitat will be potentially enhanced by the increased availability of shallow groundwater during the growing season.
The construction of the diversion dam and creation of the seasonal impoundment is likely to result in an overall enhancement of the riparian corridor. The permanent and temporary loss of riparian habitat due to construction and inundation totals less than 2.5 acres, which can be suitably mitigated through local revegetation programs using native riparian species (see Section 5). Therefore the impacts to the riparian corridor are considered less-than-significant.

4.2 WETLANDS

No wetlands were observed above the 9-foot msl contour elevation, which in most areas of the impoundment is essentially the OHWM. As noted earlier, willows and other vegetation types that may be found in wetlands were observed, however other factors such as wetland hydrology or hydric soils were not found in the area surveyed. Therefore it is concluded that no permanent jurisdictional wetlands will be impacted by installation of the proposed diversion dam and related facilities and by the proposed impoundment.
Ephemeral jurisdictional wetlands consisting of predominantly vegetated sandbars and some freshwater marsh areas were delineated below the OHWM. These wetlands will be inundated by the impoundment. However, no mitigation for this action is anticipated.
4.3 AGRICULTURAL LAND

This study was designed to determine if the proposed impoundment would alter the groundwater table resulting in the degradation or loss of agricultural land or associated infrastructure in the study area. Prolonged inundation can alter biogeochemical processes

4-3 AR 02944

in soil thereby rendering whole fields, or portions of fields, unsuitable for crops with low tolerances for hydric conditions.
The model results indicate that changes in groundwater elevation resulting from operation of the surface water impoundment would result in minor impacts to agricultural activities within the study area. None of the fields in the study area will be directly inundated by surface water because the majority of the agricultural lands are at elevations that are higher than the Salinas River (see Figure 2). Approximately 0.2 acres of agricultural land in close proximity to the proposed impoundment may experience some increase in soil moisture or groundwater surface elevation within 1 to 3-feet of the ground surface (Figure 5).
This potential affect should not limit the use of this small portion of the agricultural field. The assessment methods are conservative, because the model assumes that the surface impoundment will be operated with a continuous water surface elevation of 9 feet msl. In reality the surface water elevation of the impoundment will continually fluctuate, perhaps as much as 4 feet between 5 and 9 feet msl, as demand for water changes over the course a of a day. Thus, the surface water elevation may not be high enough for a sufficiently long time to produce the groundwater elevations predicted by our model. The model identifies the maximum extent of the area impacted and, therefore, may overstate the true impact of the project.
The predicted periodic increase in the groundwater table in the 0.2 acres of agricultural land is not expected to pose a significant impact to continued use of the land. Therefore, no mitigation is proposed.

4.4 SUmmary

In general, anticipated impacts to riparian habitat above the 9-foot msl impoundment elevation and adjacent agricultural lands resulting from the proposed project would be minimal. Over 190 acres of riparian vegetation were mapped and classified as part of this study. Less than 2.5 acres of riparian habitat may be adversely impacted by the proposed project (Figure 3a and Figure 5).
Finally, the agricultural land analysis determined that raising the water surface elevation in the Salinas River could potentially impact 0.2 acres (Figure 5). This is due to the fact that most of the agricultural -land is high (e.g., >20 ft. msl) relative to the impoundment. Low-lying fields located west of the impoundment are too far from the river channel to experience any impact from the predicted increase in groundwater table elevation adjacent to the proposed impoundment.

5.0
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MITIGATION

5.1 POTENTIAL MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS
The above conservative analysis indicates that the construction of the proposed Alternative A diversion and impoundment will result in the loss or disturbance of approximately 2.5 acres of riparian habitat. This constitutes approximately 1.3 percent of the riparian habitat within 500 feet of the river channel in the study area. This adverse effect is in large part offset by the potential enhancement of approximately 34 acres of riparian forest due to the greater availability of shallow groundwater adjacent to the
impoundment during the growing season.
Because the extent of the adverse effects are so small and the potential enhancements are
relatively. large in comparison, it is recommended that mitigation for the lost riparian habitat be performed on a 1 to 1 basis (1 acre of restored habitat per 1 acre of lost riparian
habitat). On this basis mitigation for riparian habitat loss would consist of restoration of 2.5 acres of native riparian vegetation (e.g., willows, cottonwoods, sycamores, or box elder) in relatively close proximity to the study area. It is assumed that the 0.2 acres of
riparian habitat disturbed on the left bank during construction access will be revegetated
in place.

Based on the results of this analysis no mitigation for adverse impacts to agricultural lands or jurisdictional wetlands is proposed.

5.2 MITIGATION OPTIONS

As a part of this analysis disturbed areas in close proximity to the river channel that could be suitable riparian habitat restoration areas were identified. Within the study area the following five locations are believed to have some restoration potential depending upon
their availability:

Area is greater than 5 acres and is located on the southern corner of a pie
shaped agricultural field immediately west of Blanco Drain (Figure 3a). This
comer of this low-lying field is immediately adjacent to the river channel at an elevation of approximately 15 feet msl. Revegetation of this comner of the field would provide bank stability and continuity of the riparian corridor. This is the only potential restoration location identified on the right bank of the river. This area. appears to be in agricultural production which may be a limiting factor regarding availability;

Area 2 is approximately 2.3 acres and is located on the left bank adjacent to polygons 34, 35, 63, 64 and 66 (Figure 3b). The area consists of disturbed ruderal vegetation in a low-lying area off the northern tip of an agricultural
field. The site is surrounded on three sides by riparian vegetation consisting of willow > 30 feet tall, cottonwoods and mixed forest with multi-level canopy.

5-1
AR 02946

This area is not immediately adjacent to the river but is at an approximate elevation of 14 feet msl;

Area 3 is approximately 1.4 acres and is located on the left bank (facing downstream) and is interspersed with polygons 46 and 48 (Figure 3c). This is a sparsely vegetated outside bank of the river approximately 3000 feet long. Revegetation of this area would provide enhanced bank stability and continuity of the riparian corridor;
Area 4 is 0.5 acres and is located on the left bank adjacent to polygons 11 and 12 (Figure 3e) immediately west of the southwest end of Blanco Road Bridge. This location is the riverside edge of an agricultural/commercial operation so access and availability may be limiting factors. Revegetation of a strip along the river would provide bank protection in this area; and
Area 5 is greater than 5 acres and is iocated at the upstream end of the study area between Blanco Road, polygon 10 and the levee to the south. This area consists of disturbed ruderal vegetation and scrub shrub. The elevation of the adjacent levee is 21.1 feet msl. This area has good potential for restoration
with larger riparian tree species such as cottonwoods and box elder.
5.3 CONCLUSIOnS

The A proposed Altemative A diversion and impoundment for the SVWP is not expected to have a significant adverse affect on permanent jurisdictional wetlands, the adjacent riparian habitat, or. agricultural lands. Therefore, mitigation for the loss of riparian habitat associated with construction of the diversion and inundation of habitat above the OHWM is proposed on a to 1 basis through revegetation of approximately 2.5 acres of riparian habitat. Five potential restoration sites have been identified in the immediate vicinity of the impoundment study area.

Chapter 1 Background and Purpose

Chapter 1 Background and Purpose
1.1 Background
The groundwater supply in parts of the Salinas Valley is in jeopardy. Groundwater is the source for almost all water needs in the Valley, and localized pumping has changed groundwater conditions and enabled seawater to intrude into the coastal areas of the Valley, degrading groundwater supplies and forcing the abandonment or destruction of many urban and agricultural supply wells. Over the past 50 years, seawater intrusion has spread from 10,000 acres of land to approximately 25,000 acres, and is now encroaching upon the City of Salinas.
As a solution, the Monterey County Water Resources Agency (MCWRA) proposed the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP), which consists of reoperating the storage and release schedules of the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs, modifying the Nacimiento Dam spillway, and installing a diversion facility in
the Salinas River (Salinas River Diversion Facility, or SRDF) to improve the distribution of water and better regulate its flow. As documented in the June 2001 Draft Environmental Impact Report Environmental Impact Statement for the SVWP (DEIR), the reoperation of the reservoirs would halt seawater intrusion by shifting thousands of acre-feet (AF) of releases from winter to summer, thus enabling MCWRA to make more water available for groundwater recharge during the peak irrigation season. The reoperation would also combat seawater intrusion by using the SRDF to deliver water to
some coastal areas in lieu of pumping in those locations. The reoperation schedule includes additional
criteria for managing a new flood rule curve and maintaining streamflow during key periods to enhance migration opportunities for steelhead trout, a threatened species under the Federal Endangered Species
Act (ESA): MCWRA certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) on June 4, 2002.
Since the MCWRA Board of Supervisors certified the EIR, the SVWP has undergone a few refinements. In 2002, MCWRA began meeting with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)' pursuant to the ESA. The meetings focused on ways to modify the SVWP to provide even greater enhancements for steelhead trout, including consideration of spawning and rearing habitat and migration for juveniles and adults. As an outcome of these meetings, on October 11, 2005, MCWRA adopted a Supplemental Biological Assessment (SBA) and a Flow Prescription (FP)', setting forth new measures for protecting steelhead in the project area. The FP sets seasonal migration flow rate objectives to reflect steelhead• needs at different life stages, i.e., making targeted water releases when steelhead would receive the most benefit. Meeting these flow objectives will somewhat modify seasonal flow rates in the Salinas and Nacimiento rivers, water levels in the San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs, and flow rates in the Salinas River Lagoon (Lagoon).
Another refinement to the project is the relocation and modification of the SRDF. The SRDF will be
relocated about 200 feet upstream from the original location to avoid conflicts with MCWRA's existing
Castroville Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP) distribution mainline and to ensure shallow groundwater is
not affected on adjacent landfill property while keeping the facility within a well-defined, straighter portion of the river channel. The SRDF will also be redesigned to provide for a reduction in planned water surface diversions. The redesigned facility will be smaller in scale and occupy less space within the bed of the Salinas River. In addition, MCWRA will change the alignment of the pipeline connecting the

Additionally, refinements to the Salinas Valley Integrated Ground and Surface Water Model (SVIGSM) have resulted in a better representation and understanding of the effects of reservoir operations on flows in the Salinas River, resulting in more detailed analyses of the baseline and project conditions.
1.2 Purpose of This Addendum
This Addendum describes the modifications to the SVWP resulting primarily from ESA consultation with NMFS and documents MCWRA's determination that the modifications do not require preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR (SEIR). This determination is necessary because after an EIR has been certified, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires an agency to evaluate any project modifications that necessitate changes or additions to the EIR. If the project modifications are substantial and require major changes to the previous EIR due to new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified effects, then the agency must prepare an SEIR. For project modifications that do not rise to this level but necessitate some revisions to the EIR, the agency must prepare an addendum to describe the project modifications and explain why an SEIR is not required. Accordingly, a technical analysis a of the incremental environmental effects posed by the modifications was completed using the SVWP as described in the EIR as the baseline. This Addendum

3 By way of clarification, the FP includes mitigation measures for two existing projects that are not part of the SVWP: the Blanco Drain and the Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program. Though these fishery-related improvements are outside the scope of the SVWP, MCWRA agreed to implement them as the result of discussions that occurred during the consultation process with NMFS and therefore included them in the FP. in The Blanco Drain is a nine-mile-long, almost entirely privately owned drainage system southwest of Salinas that collects agricultural discharge and storm water from adjacent farmland for later discharge into the Salinas River. However, because diazinon and chlorpyrifos have been found in Blanco Drain water samples, NMFS is concerned about the potential effects on steelhead and their food organisms, and has requested that MCWRA mitigate the effects of the discharge. In turn, "MCWRA recognizes that benefits to fish habitat downstream of Blanco Drain, particularly the Salinas River lagoon if steelhead rear there during summer and fall, may occur with improved Blanco Drain water quality. MCWRA will therefore work to improve the quality of water discharging from Blanco Drain into the Salinas River" (FP 24-25). MCWRA is in the process of evaluating several alternative forms of mitigation, though this evaluation is still in the feasibility stage. Because the Blanco Drain is not part of the SVWP, those alternatives that may constitute a "project," once they are more clearly defined, will be evaluated in a separate CEQA document if appropriate. The FP also proposes the installation of a fish screen on the Old Salinas River slide gate, which is used to regulate flow out of the Lagoon into the Old Salinas River when sandbars block the Salinas River's passage into Monterey Bay. The fish screen will reduce the possibility of steelhead being impinged in the gate. The fish screen installation is not, however, part of the SVWP. The "lagoon management and breaching activities have always been identified as a separate action from the SVWP, and the two actions were [discussed together as part of the NMFS consultation process] solely as a matter of convenience" (BiOp 3). As part of the design process for the fish screen, MCWRA will evaluate the potential environmental effects in separate CEQA document. The MCWRA Board of Directors adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Salinas River Mouth Breaching Program on May 20, 2002, and is currently in the process of obtaining a Clean Water Act section 404 permit.

describes that analysis, which concludes that the modifications would not cause new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified effects. There are no changes in circumstances or new information substantially affecting the project.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP
2.1 Revised Flow Regime
The rate of flow in the Salinas and Nacimiento rivers depends largely on how much water is spilled or released at the Nacimiento and San Antonio dams. Historically, MCWRA has operated the dams primarily to prevent flooding and to reduce seawater intrusion into the Salinas Valley by enhancing groundwater recharge. Flood releases are governed by the reservoirs' flood "rule curves," the requirements for maintaining storage capacity in the reservoirs at various times of the year in order to preserve adequate space for high winter flows. Releases for groundwater recharge are made during the
dry season to assure a 40 cfs flow at the Spreckels bridge (FEIR 3-11). Releases are also made to meet minimum instream flow requirements in the Nacimiento and San Antonio rivers, which flow into the Salinas River near Bradley (FEIR 3-12 & -14). Despite operating the reservoirs to meet these criteria for approximately 50 years, seawater intrusion in the Valley has gotten progressively worse and is approaching the City of Salinas (DEIR 1-4 to -8).
Under the SVWP as analyzed in the EIR, MCWRA proposed to reoperate the reservoirs by changing the timing and extent of releases to more effectively combat seawater intrusion. In addition to this reoperation, part of the SVWP involves increasing the capacity of the Nacimiento Dam spillway to store more water during the wet season while reserving sufficient additional reservoir capacity to comply with the flood rulé curve criteria. This additional conservation storage can then be released during the irrigation season to increase groundwater recharge beyond historical rates and to enable surface water diversions at the SRDF for delivery to agricultural operations in place of groundwater pumping while still meeting agricultural irrigation needs (FEIR 3-19 to -20). MCWRA also proposed to release additional water to increase migration flows for steelhead trout during the spring migration period (DEIR 5.6-60).
The EIR analyzed the environmental effects of making these changes to the reservoir operating criteria and storage capacity. As discussed below, although reoperating the reservoirs would alter flow patterns in the Salinas River system, the EIR found that the altered flows would be consistent with the overall pattern of hydrology under current operations, and would pose no significant environmental impacts.
In connection with obtaining a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), MCWRA has worked with NMFS as part of the formal consultation process under the ESA. As a result of this consultation process, MCWRA agreed to modify the instream flow targets for steelhead as compared to those analyzed in the EIR. To reach those modified targets, Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoir operations would include a complex regimen of new release requirements for smolt, juvenile, and adult steelhead. Depending on hydrologic conditions, the flow requirements could be triggered from February through June, in accordance with naturally occurring flow levels in the Nacimiento River at Sapaque Creek and in the Arroyo Seco River at Reliz Creek. By modifying one of the dams' three primary operational criteria (i.e., criteria associated with flood control, water supply, steelhead habitat), the steelhead flow targets will alter the flow levels identified in the EIR for the
Nacimiento and Salinas rivers, as well as the Salinas River Lagoon. The modified flow targets are as
follows:
Adult passage flows will occur from February 1* to March 31#t when there are at least 220,000 AF in the reservoirs, when 340 cfs are flowing at Arroyo Seco near Soledad, and when 173 cfs are flowing at Arroyo Seco near Reliz Creek. When these triggers are in effect, MCWRA will
release sufficient water to achieve 260 cfs mean daily flow at Salinas River near Chualar for 5 or
more consecutive days (FP 6). However, flow releases for adults are not required during dry or wet years. (FP 4-5).
Smolt outmigration flows will occur from March-15th to May 315E when there are at least 150,000 AF of combined storage in Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs and minimum flows of at least

July 2007 2-1
823028.6

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

125 cfs at Nacimiento River near Sapaque Creek or 70 cfs at Arroyo Seco near Reliz Creek. At these times, MCWRA will operate the two reservoirs to achieve a 700 cfs stream flow for 5
consecutive days at Salinas near Soledad, then 300 cfs for days 6 through 20. Flows starting between March 15th and April 1#t will continue until April 20th and flows starting after April 14 will continue for 20 days. These are called "block flows."
Juvenile passage flow releases will occur from April 1# to June 30th when 220,000 AF of combined storage are in the two reservoirs. If block flows have been triggered, a minimum 15 cfs flow will be maintained at the Salinas Lagoon until June 30th after the 45 cfs flows cease. If no block flows occur, MCWRA will operate to achieve 10 days of flow at 45 cfs to the Lagoon followed by 15 cfs flows until June 30th (FP 14-15, 17).
Changes to the SVWP flow regime identified in the EIR have the potential to affect the following:
Hydrology and Flooding
Terrestrial Resources
Fish Resources
Cultural Resources
Visual Resources
Recreation
The following sections describe the incremental changes in the flow regime that would occur by meeting the modified seasonal flow targets for steelhead.
2.1.1 Modified Flows in Salinas River
As discussed above, the SVWP, as described and analyzed in the EIR, involves reoperating the Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs to increase flood control protection for the Salinas Valley and to increase groundwater recharge and enable supplemental water supply deliveries. The reoperation would shift approximately 40,000 AF of releases from winter to summer, with adjustments made to accommodate a new flood rule curve, which will be developed after construction of the Nacimiento Dam Spillway Modifications in accordance with a newly calculated Probable Maximum Flood event. (DEIR, Section 5.3).
In addition, the SVWP reoperation includes comprehensive criteria for maintaining flow in the main stem
of the Salinas River for steelhead migration. Page 5.6-60 of the DEIR describes the criteria as follows:
From December 1 to May 31 and while the Arroyo Seco daily average flow (as measured at the USGS Arroyo Seco near Soledad gage) is 173 cfs or more or if daily average flow in the Salinas* River measured at Paso Robles is 60 cfs or more, the project operational scheme would allow sufficient releases/spills from Nacimiento and/or San Antonio reservoirs, to ensure that Salinas River daily average flows upstream of Spreckels (measured at the USGS Spreckels gage or estimated from the Chualar gage) would not be below 155 cfs, and Salinas River daily average flows downstream of Spreckels would not be below 72 cfs.
Also, during the period of December 1 to May 31 while the surface diversion facility is in
operation and while the Arroyo Seco daily average flow as measured at the USGS Arroyo Seco
near Soledad gage has been 173 cfs or more within the preceding 10 day period or if daily
average flow in the Salinas River measured at Paso Robles has been 60 cfs or more within the
preceding 10 day period, sufficient flow would be bypassed at the diversion facility to allow passage of steelhead to the Salinas River lagoon. A flow of 45 cfs from the dam site to the lagoon has been estimated as sufficient for passage when the lagoon is open to the ocean. From December 1 to May 31 while the surface diversion facility is in operation and the lagoon is closed, the lagoon surface would be maintained at an elevation of not less than 3.0 feet NGVD by

regulating the flow through the lagoon outlet gate. The SRDF would bypass 15 cfs to the lagoon under these conditions.
The DEIR illustrated the effect that reoperating the reservoirs for flood control, water supply and the Salinas River by plotting average monthly flows at the af steelhead habitat would have on flow rates in
Bradley and Spreckels gages (DEIR, Figures 5.6-13 and 5.6-14). The DEIR concluded that these flow rates would generally be within the river's baseline overall seasonal flow patterns (DEIR 5.6-52). Under that flow regime, the EIR concluded that the SVWP would have a less-than significant effect on sediment transport, root zones, flooding, water quality, riparian habitat along the Salinas River, habitat of special- status species in the project area, habitat of native and introduced fish species, steelhead migration, temperature, visual appeal of the Salinas River and water-related recreation in the Salinas River (DEIR, 5.4-25, 5.5-33 to -35, 5.6-53, 5.6-56 to -68, 5.6-70, 5.8-22, 5.9-19; FEIR, 3-47 to -48, 3-68 to -69, 3.72). The EIR also concluded that the flow regime would provide substantial benefits by increasing groundwater recharge and halting seawater intrusion (FEIR, 3-58 to -67).
The following graph shows the effects that the modified flow targets would have on flows in the Salinas River at Bradley, as compared with the baseline flows • and the flows resulting from the reoperation analyzed in the EIR.

As shown, the FP's modified flow targets of 260 cfs at Bradley (for adult passage from February 15 to March 31") and up to 700 cfs at Soledad (from March 15th to May 31%) result in river flows that are generally well within the range of analysis completed in the EIR. Thus; the incremental flow modifications do not constitute a substantial change to the SVWP. In addition, because the flows are within the same range as baseline operation and the reoperation as analyzed in the EIR, the effects of those flows are also within the same range as those previously analyzed.
The only observable deviations from the range of the baseline and proposed flows analyzed in the EIR are a slight increase in average flows during April and June and a slight decrease in flows around November. The increase in flows at Chualar and Soledad between April and May are intended to ensure river flow to the ocean, whereas historically the reservoirs were operated to limit ocean outflow during those months to the extent possible. The higher flows in those months are intended to, and are expected to, enhance migration of steelhead adults and smolts throughout the mainstem Salinas River, and are expected to

restore flows to near the levels that occurred prior to the dams' construction (NMFS Biological Opinion
for the Salinas Valley Water Project (BiOp, 87).
The slightly lower average Salinas River flows around November could potentially cause a minor reduction in early-winter percolation into the Arroyo Seco cone, an alluvial (highly porous) area at the confluence of the Arroyo Seco and Salinas rivers that is conducive to percolation of water from the streambed into the groundwater basin. A possible consequence might be a slight reduction in surface flow in the lower Arroyo Seco River during the ensuing peak flow period in December and January, because part of the surface flow might more efficiently infiltrate into the cone, in effect making up for the percolation that would have occurred earlier in the season but for these reduced flows (BiOp 21, 68-69). However, such an effect is unlikely. The unregulated Arroyo Seco watershed probably contributes much
of the subterranean flow in the lower Arroyo Seco River, lessening the possibility of an effect from the minor reduction in Salinas River flows during the winter (BiOp 70). Accordingly, NMFS has assumed that, compared with baseline, the SVWP "would have only minor or possibly minimal effects on steelhead trout passage opportunities during December and January" (BiOp 70).1 Of this minor or
minimal effect, very little would be due to the project modifications. About 75 percent of the potential wintertime surface flow reduction at the Arroyo Seco cone would have occurred under the SVWP as originally proposed and, thus, was already analyzed in the EIR, which found a less-than-significant effect on steelhead migration. Given that the entire wintertime reduction under the SVWP as compared to baseline would have "would have only minor or possibly minimal effects on steelhead trout passage," the
small reduction in November flow under the project modifications would therefore, standing alone, have a
less-than-significant effect on steelhead migration.
More importantly, however, as modified, the SVWP will provide a substantial benefit to steelhead in the Salinas River system that will more than outweigh any potential marginal impact on adult migration into the Arroyo Seco during some winters. As explained in the BiOp, the FP "will likely contribute to the restoration of habitat conditions needed for the survivial of the steelhead," and will increase migration for smolts and juvenile steelhead (BiOp 93).3 In addition, the FP will maintain opportunities for adult migration, while shifting many of the December and January passage days to February and March (BiOp 93).
Accordingly, the modified flow rates will not cause significant impacts to the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant impacts in the Salinas River mainstem.
2.1.2 Modified Lagoon Flows
The flow to the Lagoon is depicted in Figure 5.6-26 of the DEIR, which shows an average range of approximately 500 cfs in April to almost no flow in June. The DEIR concluded the reoperation would result in no significant charige to hydrology or salinity in the Lagoon during either the dry or wet season, and would, as a result, not cause a significant effect on terrestrial or aquatic resources (DEIR 5.5-32 to -
33, 5.6-73 to -78).
Under the new flow requirements in the FP, the reservoir operation would be further modified to ensure a 45 cfs flow to the Lagoon followed by 15 cfs until June 30th when the reservoirs hold at least 220,000 AF
of combined storage. At other times, a flow of 2 cfs would be maintained to the Lagoon as long as SRDF
irrigation diversions are occurring or conservation releases are being made from the reservoirs (FP 14). As shown in Figure 2 below, throughout the year, this change in flow would be within the range

Significant steelhead migration does not occur in the mainstem Salinas River until mid-December (BO 70-71), when flows are virtually identical under the project as analyzed in the EIR and as modified by the FP. The Monterey County Department of Public Works also proposes enhancing steelhead migration passage by removing a low-water crossing at Thorne Road, near Soledad on the Lower Arroyo Seco River, and replacing it with
a bridge, using a recent grant from CDFG. This passage improvement is not part of the SVWP, and the installation
will be evaluated in a separate CEQA document.

previously evaluated in the EIR as compared with baseline flows and flows resulting from the reoperation of the reservoirs. Accordingly, effects on water quality, habitat, and terrestrial and aquatic resources from July through April would also be within the range evaluated in the EIR. The increased release during the a summer months would provide a slight improvement in the water quality in the Lagoon during the dry season; higher levels of freshwater inflow will help reduce salinity stratification and temperature, which would in turn have a beneficial effect on aquatic resources. The increase in flow from May through September is shown in more detail in Figure 3. Therefore, the modifications to the project would not cause a significant impact to the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant impacts, and no additional mitigation would be required due to this project change.

2.1.3 Minimum Flows in Nacimiento River
The DEIR analyzed the effect of the project on flows in the Nacimiento River compared with baseline conditions (DEIR 5.6-47 to -51). As shown in DEIR Figure 5.6-11, the average monthly flows in the river were to range from 30 to 550 cfs, with a low of 10 cfs during drought years and 25 cfs during non- drought years. The rate of 550 cfs would be reached annually during aquifer recharge operations. As analyzed in the DEIR, the project would involve relatively minor changes to baseline flows, not alter overall baseline hydrology, and be unlikely to substantially alter habitat conditions (DEIR 5.6-51).
The FP set a new minimum flow requirement in the Nacimiento River to increase the habitat available for steelhead spawning over both existing conditions and the proposed project. The new minimum release is 60 cfs® from the Nacimiento Reservoir starting the gtb day after the 1st passage day on the Salinas River near Spreckels from January 1 to May 31 (FP 30), an increase over the 10 and 25 cfs analyzed in the EIR. This criterion will be in effect as long the surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.8 feet mean sea level, the reservoir's minimum pool (FP 31). The FP would also impose tiered ramping rates, minimizing the change in flow rate and enabling fish to respond positively to changing stream conditions. The FP's modified flow release (60 cfs) is within the range analyzed in the DEIR (30 to 550 cfs). This change would not cause a significant impact to the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant impacts. As a result, no additional mitigation would be required. The increase in minimum flows could provide a benefit to steelhead and other aquatic resources in the Nacimiento River.

2.1.4 Other Impacts Due to Modified Operations
The other potential impacts due to the operations outlined in the FP are:
6 The 60 cfs will be released until a study can be conducted to determine how much water is needed to provide adequate rearing flow for the Nacimiento River below the dam (FP 31).

Recreation at the Reservoirs
The flow regime outlined in the FP would result in lower reservoir levels than the levels identified in the
DEIR at both the San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs. The lower reservoir levels would, in turn, have
an impact on recreation.
Peak Recreation Days

The EIR measures recreational impacts from additional SVWP releases in terms of the number of "peak recreation days" during the recreation season, May 1" through September 30th, when reservoir levels will drop below 730 feet compared to the number of days below 730 feet under the baseline condition. At San
Antonio Reservoir, the average percentage of days above 730 feet decreased from 86% under baseline operations to 50% under operations as analyzed in the EIR, a 55-day reduction from 132 days to 77 days (FEIR 3-82). Under the baseline condition, an average of 73% of the days during the peak season were above 730 feet at Nacimiento Reservoir compared to 56% for the project as analyzed in the EIR, a 26-day reduction from 112 days to 86 days (FBIR 3-83). These decreases in visitor days were considered significant because they exceeded a 5% decrease in the number of visitor days throughout the recreation season (i.e., 7.5 daÿs), with the 5% intended to represent a "substantial reduction in reservoir recreation days." Because no mitigation measures were available that would lessen the impact to below the level of significance, the reduction in visitor days was determined to be both significant and unavoidable.
In assessing any possible additional effects from the FP on recreation opportunities, it should be recognized that the 5% threshold was an attempt to represent what is largely a qualitative assessment of the relationship between recreation activities and reservoir levels. Gauging the FP impacts must therefore entail applying the qualitative elements inherent in the EIR's approach. For example, the EIR recognized that drawdowns at Nacimiento below 730 feet would "diminish the quality of the lake's recreation" and affect its "desirability" while leaving the resource "accessible to recreation users."? The quantification of this effect largely derived from reviewing the relationship between economic activity at the reservoirs and
fluctuations in water surface levels, a "general trend that suggests visitation increases as lake levels increase" (DEIR 5.9-7, italics added). • The EIR states that "the significance of this relationship is difficult to determine. (DEIR 5.9-8) and that "although there appears to be some correlation between unit sales and lake levels, this relationship is not linear and only reflects a general relationship. There may be many factors influencing recreational use, including among other things, facilities availability, weather
conditions, trends in rainfall over a several year period, etc." (DEIR 5.9-12).  Accordingly, any consideration of changes in the "desirability" of recreational facilities due to the FP must be done in qualitative terms, and bear in mind that the EIR's 5% threshold of whether an effect is significant in the first instance is fundamentally a rough quantitative figure.
The FP's additional decrease in days above 730 feet is projected to be another 6.5% and 7.2% at San Antonio and Nacimiento reseryoirs respectively (an addition of 10 days below 730 feet at San Antonio and 11 more days at Nacimiento). The reduction in peak recreation days identified in the EIR was 3.5 times (26 days for Nacimiento) to 7.3 times (55 days for San Antonio) greater than the 5% (7.5 day) significance threshold. The EIR found that the drop in peak recreation days under the SVWP as originally proposed would result in "substantially fewer visitations" due to reductions in the quality of the recreation resource, including impacts to shoreline use and the ability to use recreational facilities such as boat docks (DEIR 5.9-4, 5.9-16). The modified project's relatively small increase in the number of

7 This assessment has its source in a comment letter from the County Parks Director (DEIR 5.9-4).

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

reservoir elevation days below 730 feet would pose the same impacts identified in the EIR. However, in light of the much higher effect already occasioned by the project as analyzed in the EIR, the addition of a few additional days of reservoir level reduction would not substantially increase the severity of that significant and unavoidable impact. Any further analysis would repeat what is already addressed in the
EIR.

Bass Spawning and Sportfishing
Lower reservoir levels also have the potential to affect near-shore bass spawning habitat and sportfishing in the reservoirs. Although no special-status species live in Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs, the reservoirs do support self-sustaining largemouth black bass (Micropterus salmoindes) populations. Bass are a non-native, predatory fish that can pass downstream from the reservoirs during high-flow events, and can prey upon juvenile steelhead trout. However, despite recent health concerns over consumption of bass caught from Nacimiento,* bass fishing at the reservoirs is a popular recreational activity and will likely continue to be.
Factors that affect recruitment in largemouth bass populations include seasonal conditions (water temperature, duration of spawning period, photocycle), geographic origin of the stock, food availability, initial body size (Fullerton et al. 2000), nest predation, angling pressures (Philipp et al. 1997) and, in reservoirs, fluctuating water levels (Sammons and Betolli 2000, Lee 1999). Of these factors, the project modifications would have the greatest effect on fluctuating water levels. The FP's increased releases for the outmigration of steelhead smolts and juveniles would occur during the bass-spawning period, and would cause reservoir levels to drop more precipitously and potentially more often than would have occurred under the project as originally proposed.
The EIR evaluated the SVWP's potential effects on reservoir level fluctuation during the bass-spawning period, which in Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs occurs between mid-April and the end of May (DEIR 5.6-43). Reservoir level decreases during spawning can potentially drive bass off their nests or dewater bass nests, resulting in nest failure. Increases in reservoir levels can also interfere with spawning (DEIR 5.6-43). The EIR's focus was thus on the potential effect on spawning of a range of reservoir level
increases and decreases. For purposes of the analysis, the EIR defined five categories of change in reservoir elevation:
Substantially rising: more than 20 ft 4 20 ft +

Moderately rising: from 9 to 20 ft A 11 ft

Acceptably stable: from -2 to less than 9 ft 4 11 ft

Moderately falling: from -10 to more than -2 ft 4 + 8 ft t. ./..
Substantially falling: more than -10 ft A 10 ft

Table identifies the number of years each range of elevation would occur for baseline operations, operations as analyzed in the EIR and operations as modified in the FP.

Recently, the bass fishery in Nacimiento Reservoir was a subject of concern due to mercury contamination. The California Department of Health Services (CDHS) issued a health advisory for bass caught in Nacimiento Reservoir, warning everyone, including men and women beyond childbearing years, to avoid consuming black bass (largemouth, smallmouth and spotted bass) (CDHS 2007). Although mercury concerns may affect the popularity of bass fishing at Nacimiento, recreational bass fishing (i.e., catch and release) will continue to occur independently of
consumption.

Based on this data, the EIR determined that the SVWP would not have a significant effect on bass or bass fishing in San Antonio Reservoir. The project as analyzed in the EIR was projected to decrease the number of "stable" reservoir level years from 44 to 42, and to add 1 year of moderate rise in reservoir level and 1 year of a substantial fall in level. The EIR determined that this small decrease in the number of stable years "is not expected to result in significant effects on largemouth bass population structure or
fishing opportunities" (DEIR 5.6-45, 5.9-17).
The effects of the proposed modifications to the SVWP on bass spawning and fishing in San Antonio Reservoir are within the range previously analyzed in the EIR. The proposed modifications would increase the number of stable reservoir level days from 42 to 43 and add substantially falling day, while eliminating I moderately rising day and moderately falling day.
Regarding Nacimiento Reservoir, the EIR determined that reservoir level decreases due to the SVWP "may result in potentially significant effects on largemouth bass spawning success and largemouth bass populations" (DEIR 5.6-26). The potential impact on the bass population could also potentially lead to a significant effect on sportfishing. (DEIR 5.9-19). These determinations were based on the finding that the SVWP would decrease the number of stable reservoir level years from 23 to 16, while increasing the number of years with substantially falling levels from 3 to 7-(DEIR 5.6-26). Compared with the SVWP as analyzed in the EIR, the project modifications would further reduce the number of stable reservoir level years at Nacimiento from 16 to 9, and increase the number of substantially falling reservoir level years from 7 to 19, This means that bass spawning would potentially be disrupted more frequently than under the project as described and analyzed in the EIR, with the potential for an effect on bass population and fishing.
Under CEQA, MCWRA would need to prepare an SEIR if the project modifications would cause a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified effect. Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether further modifications to the SVWP would substantially increase the severity of potential significant environmental effects on the overall bass population and associated bass fishing in
Nacimiento Reservoir due to spawning impacts.
First, a reduction in bass spawning in some years, standing alone, would not be a significant environmental effect. Bass live for 10 to 15 years and spawn multiple times during their lives, and individual bass populations tend to vary widely in age distribution. Variable recruitment has been

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

documented in populations throughout the species' range (Jackson and Noble 2000): In fact, in most populations, several factors contribute to fishery recruitment. For example, late winter and early spring air temperatures (Jackson and Noble 2000), level of eutrophication (Greene and Maceina 2000), initial body size, food availability, severity of winter months (Fullerton et al. 2000), and impact of fishing pressure (Suski and Philipp 2004) can all affect bass population density and recruitment.
Fundamentally, the key to whether the SVWP modifications will substantially increase the severity of the significant effect on the bass population and the fishery is whether the modified reservoir elevation levels will substantially worsen the survivability of or substantially reduce the population base of bass in the reservoir compared with the project as proposed in the EIR. Making this determination requires evaluating the probability of nesting success under the modeled decreases in surface elevation, and determining the resulting effect on Nacimiento's bass population. The EIR analyzed the potential
spawning impacts by referencing the reservoir surface elevation categories, but did not isolate the effects of particular daily water level reductions on nesting success'. Although changes between the frequency distributions can serve as some measure of the degree of impact that elevation level changes may have on spawning (DEIR 5.6-43), Lee's largemouth bass nest survival curve provides a more accurate and refined tool for understanding the effect of the modified reservoir elevation levels. Lee's (1999) approach has been used in several recent evaluations of the effects of changes in reservoir elevation on bass recreational fisheries (e.g., Surface Water Resources Inc. 2004, COMB and Bureau of Reclamation 2003),
Lee investigated the effect of reservoir fluctuations on nesting success for largemouth black bass (1999). He summarized information from California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) files, the State Resources Library, US Fish and Wildlife Reference computer searches, and additional field observations at several California reservoirs. He found on average a nesting success rate of at least 20 percent is required to maintain long-term population levels of highly fecund warmwater fish like black bass, including largemouth bass. Lee's analysis showed that surface water elevation reductions of less than 0.11 meters (3.6 inches) per day would be sufficient to maintain a nesting success rate of 20 percent (1999). Elevation reductions of less than 0.11 meters per day would provide for greater than 20 percent
nesting success.
Using this data, Lee (1999) established a spawning survival curve relating the percent of successful nests to the rate of decrease in water level. The percentage of successful nests was determined by dividing the nest depth by the estimated average number of days from nest development to free-swimming fry. The nest was deemed successful if the drawdown did not exceed the nest depth during the period of occupancy. Lee (1999) developed a separate curve for largemouth bass. The equation for the curve is:
Largemouth Bass: Y =-56.378*ln(X)-102.59
In this equation, Y is the percent of nesting success, and Xis the rate of decrease of surface elevation (m).
•Table 2 summarizes the number of years that largemouth bass nesting success at San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs would be would be less than 20%.

9 As discussed in the EIR, the categories were developed for the purpose of comparing different model scenarios, not for predicting the success or failure of largemouth bass spawning in individual years (DEIR 5.6-43).

This analysis of nesting success indicates that largemouth bass populations should sustain themselves at present levels to thrive in San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs. In San Antonio Reservoir, the modified project would potentially benefit the bass population by increasing nesting success rates above 20% in 5 out of 46 years over baseline operations. In Nacimiento Reservoir, bass nesting success under the modified project may be reduced in 9 years out of 46 as compared with 7 years under the project as identified and analyzed in the EIR. The number of years of relatively high nesting success (31 to 100 %) remains the same under both: 34 of 46 years. The number of years of moderate relatively low nesting success (less than 20%) is higher under the modified project, by an additional 2 years out of 46.
This incremental decrease in nesting success for of 46 years at Nacimiento (for the moderate nesting success rate, 20% to 30%) may have an occasional short-term effect on bass populations, but will not substantially increase the severity of the significant effect on the bass population or the recreational fishery under the SVWP as identified in the EIR. The recreational fishery targets adult bass. Since bass have a long life expectancy and spawn multiple times, spawning failures in one year should not reduce the number of catchable bass in the population in the future. In fact, having fewer bass of a particular age class can enhance survival of other age classes by reducing competition for food resources and cover. Depressed recruitment in three consecutive years may be of sufficient magnitude to reduce the number of adults in the population available to support a recreational fishery. However, the possibility of three consecutive years of spawning below 20% would be minimal under the project as analyzed in the EIR (0.35% likelihood over a 46-year period) and would remain minimal under the project as modified (0.75% likelihood over a 46-year period).16
Moreover, the long-term success of this species as a popular sportfish, managed across a wide geographic range in a variety of environmental conditions, speaks to its resiliency despite those factors that can affect recruitment. From this perspective, the potential effect of the periodic curtailment of the nesting period would not likely be apparent in the number of harvestable bass that support a recreational fishery, such as those present in San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs. In fact, in some instances high recruitment rates of juvenile fish can result in growth rate depression (Walters and Post 1993), while some periodic reductions in spawning numbers for a particular year (year-class strength), which are often observed in natural populations, may benefit a recreational fishery where larger fish are considered more desirable by
anglers.

10 7/46 = 1/6.57, with the probability of 3 consecutive years equal to 1/6.58°, which equals 1/284 or 0.35%. 9/46 = 1/5.11 with the probability of 3 consecutive years equal to 1/5.11%, which equals 1/133 or 0.75%.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

In conclusion, the nesting success analysis indicates that, in comparison with baseline operations, bass in
San Antonio Reservoir would potentially be benefited by implementation of the project as modified. In Nacimiento, decreases in reservoir levels would reduce bass spawning success below the 20% value needed for long-term population stability to a projected 9 of 46 years, compared with 7 of 46 years for the project as identified and analyzed in the EIR. Since the project modifications would be highly unlikely to reduce bass spawning for three consecutive years, bass populations would likely be sufficiently strong to support recreational fishery in all years without a decline in catch rates. Under these circumstances, the severity of the significant effect on the bass population and fishery identified in the EIR will not be
substantially increased by the project modifications.
Visual Resources at the Reservoirs
The thresholds of significance established for the EIR state that a project would have a significant impact on visual resources if the water surface elevations of the reservoirs were reduced an average of 10 feet or
more below what occurs during the peak visitation period of May through September under existing conditions (DEIR 5.8-17). Reductions in water surface elevation of greater than 10 feet are discernable by the public, and reductions of 15 feet or more are "demonstrably negative" (DEIR 5.8-17). As discussed in the EIR, the project would reduce surface water elevations at San Antonio Reservoir during the peak visitation period (May through September) an average of 19 to 25 feet (FEIR 3-80). At Nacimiento Reservoir, the elevations would drop during that period an average of 6 to 14 feet (DEIR 5.8- 19). Therefore, the effects on the aesthetic value of both San Antonio and Nacimiento reservoirs were considered significant. Further, given that no feasible mitigation measures were available that could affect the reservoir levels, the significant effects were also considered unavoidable (DEIR 5.8-25; FBIR 3- 81). Tables 2 and 3 show the changes in surface elevations from baseline operations for both reservoirs that would result from the FP's project modifications.

Under the modified project, the average surface water elevations for every month during the May to
September period for San Antonio Reservoir would be higher than under the project as analyzed in the EIR. Thus, the project modifications would possibly provide a slight benefit, At Nacimiento Reservoir,
the modified project would cause an incremental drop in projected average reservoir surface levels of 4 to 6 feet between May and August, but would result in a slightly higher water surface elevation in September. These additional projected reductions are less than the 10 foot significance threshold identified in the EIR. The further 4 to 6 foot decrease would not constitute a substantial increase in the severity of that significant and unavoidable impact. Any further analysis would repeat what is already in is the EIR.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

Terrestrial Species at the Reservoirs
The only special-status terrestrial wildlife species known to occur in the vicinity of the reservoirs is the bald eagle. The EIR concluded that reoperating the reservoirs could result in less favorable breeding conditions for some fish species, possibly resulting in a very slight decrease in food availability for bald
eagles, and that the impact would be less than significant. The very small reduction in reservoir levels during some months under the modified project falls within the overall range of the levels analyzed in the EIR and would not affect the conclusion that the lower reservoir levels would not have a significant effect
on bald eagles (DEIR 5.5-32).
Change to Timing and Frequency of Lagoon Opening
Since approximately 1910, the sandbar that separates the Salinas River Lagoon from the ocean has been artificially opened, or breached, in most years to allow high flows in the Salinas River to pass directly to the ocean without being conveyed down the Old Salinas River (OSR) channel. In some years, the sandbar opens without human intervention or else, due to low inflow, closes very quickly or is not opened at all. Under MCWRA's current Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program, when flows
to the Lagoon are low, MCWRA keeps the OSR slide gate open to pass Salinas River flow into the OSR
channel, which in turn empties into Moss Landing Harbor. However, when the water surface elevation in
the Lagoon reaches 6 feet-which occurs during sustained high flows or discrete storm events-it is
necessary to close the slide gate and open the sandbar to enable the Lagoon to discharge to the ocean to prevent flooding of property lying along the Lagoon and the OSR channel. Once the sandbar is open, Salinas River flows pass through the Lagoon and into the ocean until wave action causes the sandbar to reform, or close. At that point, the slide gate is opened, and flows are once more passed into the OSR channel.
The procedure for opening the sandbar is outlined in the Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Salinas River Mouth Breaching Program' (MND 9-2). Briefly described, when water levels in the Lagoon approach feet, a maintenance crew mobilizes and is led to the opening site by a park ranger, after which the crew uses an excavator to incise the sandbar. When water levels rise to approximately 6 feet, water pressure from the Lagoon will force the sandbar to open at the incision. The MND concluded that, although the Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program poses some potential environmental impacts, the incorporated mitigation measures reduce the. impacts to below the level of significance (MND 6-1 to -3).
The SVWP as envisioned in the BIR would not increase the frequency of Lagoon openings. However, with the release of engineered block flows proposed in the FP, the frequency of openings would increase by a small amount. The block flows are intended to mimic the somewhat higher inflow rates that would have occurred prior to construction and operation of the reservoirs. Under the project modifications, the frequency of openings prior to March 1 would remain unchanged. However, openings after March would increase by a small amount. SVIGSM modeling results indicate that, after March* 1, the Lagoon opening threshold of 6 feet WSE 8 would occur 8 times in 46 years. The project modifications would increase the number of openings after March 1 from 8 to 12 times over the same 46-year period (FP 18- 19), but would make no changes to the Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program itself.
Terrestrial Species at the Lagoon
Western snowy plover are listed as threatened under the ESA, and nest in the Lagoon beginning approximately March 1. An increase in Lagoon openings, after March 1, therefore, has some potential to affect snowy plover. The primary concern that openings pose for snowy plover is the direct impact from the transport and operation of the heavy equipment used to incise the sandbar.

11 The MND was adopted by the Monterey County Board of Supervisors on May 20, 2002.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

The MND notes that lagoon openings occur both before March 1 and after, and that snowy plover breed in the program area from March through September (MND 1-8, 5-10). As a consequence, mitigation measures were built into the Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program to specifically avoid impacts to snowy plover during this period. These measures include locating the opening activities away from nesting sites, limiting beach access with heavy equipment to specified access route, and having ranger from the California Department of Parks and Recreation guide the maintenance crew to the opening site. For openings that occur after March 1, the crew is accompanied by a qualified
ornithologist, who locates a safe passage route that avoids impacts to avian breeding pairs, nests, eggs and
chicks, and assists in selecting the location for an opening (MND 5-10 to -11). These measures would be implemented for the additional Lagoon openings that would occur under the modified SVWP and, as discussed in the MND, would prevent significant environmental effects. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the largest acreage of plover habitat affected is 0.5 to acre, which is only 0.05% to 0.075% of the entire habitat adjacent to the Salinas River mouth to and Monterey Bay for this species.
Other bird species also roost, nest and forage within the Lagoon area, including the California brown pelican. As discussed in the MND, the mitigation measures built into the Lagoon flood prevention and sandbar management program are expected to prevent any significant impact on the bird community (MND 5-10 to -11). The other special-status terrestrial species discussed in the EIR in connection with the Lagoon is the California red-legged frog (CLRF). The DEIR concluded that no CLRF occur within the lower Salinas River, from the SRDF to the Lagoon (DEIR 5.5-14). The MND concluded that CLRF are unlikely to become established in the Lagoon (MND 5-10). As a result, any changes in the timing or frequency of Lagoon openings will not affect CLRF.
Aquatic Species at the Lagoon
Under baseline conditions and under the SVWP, as analyzed both in the EIR and as modified, the hydrological Lagoon environment undergoes three stages: saltwater, transitional, and freshwater. When the Lagoon sandbar is open, saltwater enters the Lagoon from the ocean, and commingles with any freshwater flowing in the Salinas River. During this stage, the Lagoon environment is brackish, ocean aquatic species may reside in the Lagoon, and freshwater species move to the freshwater area upstream. When the sandbar reforms, freshwater inflow from the Salinas River transitions the Lagoon environment from brackish to freshwater. The length of the transitional stage depends on the rate of inflow from the
river and the transmissivity of the sandbar. During this stage, there is potential for salinity stratification to occur, along with low dissolved oxygen' levels in bottom water layers, Once the transitional stage is complete, the Lagoon is dominated by a is freshwater environment without salinity stratification or low dissolved oxygen levels.
Late-season openings due to isolated storms followed by very low flows may influence the duration of the transition process from saltwater to freshwater conditions in the Lagoon. When the sandbar is opened, saltwater from the ocean may flow into the Lagoon. When the sandbar reforms, saltwater is trapped within the Lagoon. If river inflow is low at that time, the transition process from saltwater to freshwater may be prolonged and create potentially stressful conditions for some fish and invertebrates as a result of a salinity stratification. (MND 1-9.) However, the increased number of Lagoon openings projected to occur under the modified project will not be followed by a period of low river flow, but by extended block flows capable of transitioning the Lagoon to freshwater conditions relatively quickly.
If the additional openings were to result in salinity stratification and a reduction in dissolved oxygen, a there could be an effect on any steelhead rearing in the Lagoon. However, under current conditions, few, if any, steelhead can successfully rear in the Lagoon (BiOp 44). Rearing opportunities will occur only because of the block flows proposed under the modified project itself. As consequence, the modified project itself will not cause a significant effect on the steelhead, but will improve possibilities for steelhead rearing in most if not all years.

July 2007 2-14
823028.6

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

Moreover, even if steelhead did currently spawn in the Lagoon, an additional risk to survival due 'to the modified project would be less than significant because the frequency of additional opening is low, additional breaches would only occur once in a given year, and they would most likely occur in late March or April prior to the high summer temperatures that contribute to anoxic conditions in strongly stratified waters BiOp 77).
The other special-status aquatic species discussed in the EIR in connection with the Lagoon is the tidewater goby. The DEIR concluded there no tidewater goby occurring in the Lagoon and there are no plans to reintroduce them (DEIR 5.6-38). As a result, any changes in the timing or frequency of Lagoon openings will not affect tidewater goby.
2.2 The Salinas River Diversion Facility
A core component of the SVWP is the delivery of surface water to coastal agricultural operations to
replace groundwater pumping, thereby substantially halting seawater intrusion and preserving water
quality in the Salinas Valley groundwater basin. The substitute water supply will be diverted from the Salinas River through the SRDF, which will consist of an in-stream dam and impoundment pool, an intake, a fish screen and fish ladder, and an on-shore pump station. A connecting pipe will carry the water to the existing 80 AF pond operated by the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) as part of the Salinas Valley Reclamation Project. From that point, water will flow into the existing CSIP distribution mainline, which will convey the water to users.
The environmental effects of installing and operating the SRDF were evaluated in the EIR. However,
since certifying the EIR, MCWRA has decided to move the SRDF to a new location approximately 200
•feet upstream in order to reduce proximity to a regional landfill. MCWRA has also modified the design
of the SRDF to reflect a reduction in diversion capacity, moved the location of the pump station, changed the alignment of the connecting pipeline, and proposed piping Blanco Drain water seasonally from its current discharge location to a point downstream from the SRDF.

2.2.1 Relocation of the SRDF
Moving the SRDF to a new location 200 feet upstream of the location identified in the EIR will not cause-
any new significant impacts to the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant impacts.
The EIR analyzed the effects of constructing and operating the SRDF approximately two miles upstream of Highway 1 near Moro Cojo at the approximate location of the Salinas River crossing of the CSIP mainline (DEIR 3-12). The EIR concluded that the SRDF posed no potential significant environmental effects on adjacent land uses, farmland conversion, seismic hazards, construction-related water quality, special-status terrestrial species, aesthetics, and operational noise (DEIR §§ 5.1 to 5.13). Mitigation measures reduced the potential for environmental effects to below the level of significance for water-. logging of crop roots near the inundationi zone due to increased groundwater levels, loss of about 2.5 acres of mixed riparian habitat and impacts to waters of the United States, interference with steelhead
migration, cultural resources, presence of construction-related gravel on roads, air quality, and
construction-related noise (DEIR §§ 5.5 to 5.12; FEIR 3-49 to -50, 3-77 to -78).
To reduce proximity to the regional landfill, MCWRA decided to move the location of the SRDF approximately 200 feet upstream' of the location described in the BIR. The new location is in the area previously analyzed in the EIR. The same habitat types are present in the new location, the surrounding

12 The CSIP / Salinas Valley Reclamation Project, together called the Monterey County Water Recycling Projects, currently consists of a recycled water treatment plant and a distribution system with supplemental wells. Under the SVWP, the new surface water supply will be blended with the existing recycled water.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

land uses are the same, the distance to the nearest residence (about 3,500 feet) is the same, and the channel width at the SRDF is the same. The density of the vegetation in the new location is also the same as in the old, generally covering the SRDF from view. The acreage of lost habitat as a result of the move will be the same, and will be subject to the same mitigation measures identified in the EIR (the effects of the design refinements on riparian habitat are discussed below). The 3.2-mile-long impoundment pool will cover essentially the same area, shifting upstream about 200 feet (FEIR Appendix A, Riparian Habitat Characterization for the Proposed Salinas Valley Water Project Diversion Impoundment, Salinas River, California).
Additional reports and surveys also indicate that the relocation of the SRDF will not cause any new significant effects on the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant effects. The California Red-legged Frog Site Assessment conducted in 1999 by EDA W indicates that the new location is not in an area with suitable habitat for CRLF. The nearest siting of a CRLF is greater than seven miles from the site. This assessment encompassed an area one mile long upstream of the relocated impoundment pool, two miles downstream and one mile on either side of the river. The modified project range is well within the study area of the CRLF evaluation.
The Wetland Delineation, also conducted by EDAW in 2001, provides clearly marked maps rather than numeric. text outlining the extent of the study area. The delineation extends an estimated 1,200 feet upstream of Blanco Road. The new impoundment created by the relocated diversion facility is estimated to be similar in area to the impoundment at the original site and remains within the original study area for the wetland delineation.
Regarding cultural resources, as part of the review conducted in connection with the DEIR, MCWRA consulted three studies that showed no cultural resources within ¼ mile of the project area. Though no survey was completed of the construction area itself, a pedestrian survey did not indicate the presence of any cultural resources (DEIR 5.7-6 & -10 to -12). No subsurface investigations were conducted (DEIR 5.7-10). The DEIR identified the potential for impacts to previously undiscovered subsurface cultural resources, but found the impacts to be below the level of significance because mitigation measures will be implemented to monitor and avoid impacts (DEIR 5.7-14 to -15).
2.2.2 Modification to SRDF Layout and Adjacent Facilities
MCWRA has made a few minor changes in connection with the installation and operation of the SRDF. First, out of financial considerations, MCWRA has decided to reduce the SRDF's diversion capacity, requiring minor modifications of the design.13 The modifications will generally reduce the capacity and footprint of the facility. Second, the smaller pump station and intake facility will be moved from the east side of the Salinas River to the west side. Third, instead of building a pipeline directly from the SRDF into the CSIP mainline, MCWRA will build a pipeline that will convey the water to MRWPCA facilities
for treatment, then convey the water into the CSIP mainline. Fourth, because the Blanco Drain empties
agricultural runoff into the Salinas River upstream from the proposed location of the SRDF, MCWRA
will build a pipeline to seasonally carry the discharge to a new point downstream of the SRDF. These changes will not cause any new significant impacts to the environment or substantially increase the severity of any existing significant impacts
SRDF Layout and Pumphouse
As discussed in the EIR, the SRDF was initially designed with a maximum diversion capacity of 85 cfs, with five 48"-diameter pipes (three for immediate use, and two for potential expansion). The pipes would be operated from a nearby pump station located one foot above the 100-year floodplain, using six pumps. The SRDF structure would incorporate 200-foot-long pneumatic gates to impound the water (i.e. the "dam"), and would extend 200 feet along the bed of the Salinas River. The foundation would consist of reinforced concrete, with vinyl sheet piles at the upstream and downstream ends, and rip-rap would be
13 The SRDF will be constructed to enable MCWRA to enlarge it to its original design capacity if warranted.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

installed to prevent riverbed scour. The SRDF would have the capacity to bypass up to 45 cfs for fish migration and other in-stream bypass requirements (DEIR 3-11 to -22; FEIR 3-2 to -6).
As modified from Figure 3-7 of the FEIR, the SRDF will function in the same manner as originally proposed, but on a smaller scale. The maximum diversion capacity will be reduced from 85 cfs to 48 cfs. Instead of five 48" river water intake pipes, the SRDF will have four 36" intake pipes, and instead of six pumps, the SRDF will use three 12 cfs pumps to meet an operational target of 36 cfs, with a fourth 12 cfs pump kept in reserve. The gate and underlying structure will be reduced from 200 feet in length to approximately 160 feet, though the foundation will be constructed in the same manner and will still consist of reinforced concrete. The dam structure itself will be slightly narrower, reducing in-channel excavation. The modified façility will have the same bypass capacity (45 cfs). The cbanges to the SRDF are depicted in the figure on the following page.

These changes will reduce the environmental impacts of constructing and operating the SRDF, and will not result in any increased environmental impacts. The footprint of the facility will be smaller, as will the
channel area to be covered in rip-rap. The facility will divert less water, at a lower rate, from the Salinas
River.
At the same time, however, additional modifications will result in a slight increase in loss of riparian habitat on the banks of the Salinas River. Further engineering analysis shows that more robust scour protection (i.e., rip-rap) will be necessary on the riverbanks to prevent erosion than originally anticipated.'4 In addition, due to difficulties in land acquisition, the SRDF pump station has been relocated from the east bank of the river to the west bank, to a location that will require removal of some additional riparian habitat. The SRDF connecting pipeline would also be moved from the east bank to the west (discussed below), requiring the temporary disturbance of some additional riparian habitat.
Combined, these modifications will increase the loss of riparian habitat caused by the SRDF from 2.5 acres to 3.2 acres*5 (FEIR 3-78; DEIR 5.5-38). The FEIR determined that the loss of an estimated 2.5 acres would not substantially reduce the potential habitat of local or statewide populations of special- status species that occur or potentially occur in the vicinity of the SRDF. Accordingly, the effect on special-status species was not considered significant. Because an additional 0.7 acre of habitat loss is not
a significant deviation from the estimated figure in the EIR, the modified SVWP will not substantially reduce the potential habitat of local or state population of special-status species. Moreover, the DEIR had estimated that 32 acres of riparian habitat would be lost due to construction and operation of the SRDF and the resulting impoundment. Though the estimated acreage figure was revised from 32 to 2.5 for the FEIR, no corresponding change was made to the underlying analysis. Given that the new figure of 1.9 acres is greatly below the originally analyzed 32 acres, any further analysis would repeat what is already in the EIR,
The FEIR found that the loss of 2.5 acres of habitat (including the 1.1 acres from construction and operation of the SRDF) would be significant because riparian habitat is sensitive habitat regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) and CDFG (FEIR 3-77 to 78; DEIR 5.5-37 to -38). The EIR stated that final mitigation measures would be established as part of the consultation process. with the Corps and CDFG, and would include one or more of the following: replacement and/or restoration, removal of non-native invasive plants, or efforts to minimize the impact. The EIR concluded that the final measures would reduce the impact to below the level of significance (DEIR 5.5-46). The SVWP
Mitigation Monitoring Program, Appendix A, Item 2 - Terrestrial Biology, adopted by the Monterey County Water resources Agency Board of Supervisors on June 4, 2002, requires replacement and/or restoration at a minimum ratio of 1:1. The 2007 NMFS BiOp requires restoration of 3"-diameter-plus riparian trees at a 3 to 1 ratio, with a minimum 80 percent success rate (BiOp 99). Additional mitigation may be imposed by the Corps or DFG. The clarification that an additional 0.7 acres would be lost does not alter the EIR's determination that the mitigation measures would reduce the impact to below the level of significance. In addition, the DEIR already considered the impacts of losing (and mitigating for) 32 total acres, including 2 acres from construction and operation of the SRDF. Thus, any further analysis would repeat what is already in the EIR.
Pipeline Installation
As part of the project modifications, MCWRA will change the alignment of the SRDF connecting pipeline and install an additional pipe to seasonally change the discharge point of the Blanco Drain. As
described in the EIR, MCWRA had planned to install a 550-foot-long connecting pipeline to carry Salinas

14 The Blanco Drain discharge pipeline will be installed partially within the riparian area that will be lost due to the additional scour protection and thus will not necessitate disturbance of any additional riparian habitat. 15 Of the 3.2 acres, 1.9 will be from the construction and operation of the SRDF itself, and the other 1.3 will be from the impoundment pool. The project modifications increased the riparian acreage to be disturbed from construction and operation of the SRDF; the total acres disturbed by the impoundment pool remains at 1.3.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

River water from the SRDF directly into the CSIP mainline for distribution to agricultural lands (DEIR 3- 21 to -22). However, out of a concern for food safety, it was determined that the raw river water should be treated before being added to the CSIP mainline for delivery to farming operations. MCWRA has therefore proposed to modify the project by installing an alternate 5,650-foot-long connecting pipeline to allow for water treatment. Toward the end of the conveyance, MCWRA will treat the water through chlorination. Then, instead of tying directly into the CSIP mainline, the connecting pipeline will carry the water to an existing 80-AF treatment pond operated by the MRWPCA. There, the water will be further
treated and then conveyed into the existing CSIP mainline. The existing CSIP mainline may be modified slightly to accommodate a backup river water chlorination system, but any construction would occur entirely within the existing regional treatment plant facilities. The new SRDF river water connecting :
pipeline would be buried and would primarily lie along existing roadways and pipe corridors as well as cross a small agricultural field. The figure on the following page shows the pipeline alignment. MCWRA also proposes to install a gravity flow pipeline to carry agricultural runoff from the Blanco Drain to a discharge point on the Salinas River downstream from the SRDF dam, thus preventing the runoff from ultimately entering the CSIP water supply. This pipeline was not proposed as part of the project as discussed in the EIR. The new discharge pipeline would be installed near an existing culvert in the Blanco Drain about 600 feet from where the drain flows into the Salinas River. MCWRA will modify the culvert so it can be closed when the SRDF is operating. When the culvert is closed, water will be piped about 1,500 feet to the north, approximately parallel to the river, and discharged about 50 feet downstream from the SRDF dam. Approximately 250 feet of the pipe will pass through an area of existing riparian vegetation, all of which is already being removed as part of the installation of the SRDF. Thus, there would be no temporary or permanent loss of riparian habitat due solely to the installation of the new Blanco Drain discharge pipeline. The pipeline will carry only existing Blanco Drain discharge water, and moving the discharge location 1,500 feet downstream will not alter the water quality in the Salinas River downstream from the point of discharge or alter the existing conditions for aquatic species.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

The installations would not have a new significant effect or substantially increase the severity of a previously identified significant effect. The pipelines will be installed according to the same protocols,
and subject to the same mitigation measures, that were specified in the EIR.
As with the original connecting pipeline, the modified pipeline installations would not have a significant effect on land use. The installations would not conflict with onsite adjacent land uses, zoning, General Plan land use designations, or adopted land use plans, and would not result in conversion of farmland (DEIR 5.1-22). Both pipelines would' be buried. The SRDF river water connecting pipeline would be installed partially within existing rights of way parallel to the existing CSIP mainline (2,300 feet) and beneath an existing gravel road (1,800 feet), with smaller sections crossing an agricultural field (750 feet), an undisturbed area within the boundaries of the regional landfill (550 feet) and a narrow strip of riparian habitat (250 feet, discussed above). The Blanco Drain discharge pipeline would primarily cross agricultural fields, with a few hundred feet crossing riparian habitat (discussed above). All pipe crossing farmland would be buried to a 5 foot depth or more to assure compatibility with onsite agricultural
operations. Pipe installed on non-farmland would be buried to a 3 foot depth. After installation, the land above the pipeline will continue to be available for farming, and there will be no net reduction in farmed
acreage.
The EIR determined that water conveyance pipelines would not pose seismic hazards. The pipe would be buried, flexible, and move with the ground in case of seismic activity, with the "criteria to which the,
connecting pipeline would be designed and constructed [to] be established through the project geotechnical investigation" (DEIR 3.2-16). The new pipelines would be built to the same criteria, and as discussed in the DEIR, they would be approved only if a seismically sound design is submitted. (DEIR 3.2-17). Likewise, the pipelines would not cross any water bodies, and therefore will not pose any water quality concerns.
The pipelines will also not have a significant effect on cultural resources. For any areas of pipeline alignment not covered by a previous subsurface investigation, a cultural resource survey, consistent with
State Office of Preservation requirements, will be conducted prior to installation. Given that the pipelines
would be buried, it is possible that site preparation (i.e., grading, filling) and construction activities could
disturb unknown and potentially important cultural resources, both prehistoric and historic. It is also possible that buried or otherwise obscured cultural resources will be discovered during project construction. As discussed in the EIR, such activities pose the risk of a potentially significant impact to cultural resources (DEIR 5.7-12). However, the EIR details mitigation measures that would reduce the potential impact to below the level of significance for both known and unknown cultural resources (DEIR
5.7-15 to -16). MCWRA will follow these mitigation measures in installing the pipelines. The resulting impact on cultural resources, if any, will be less than significant.
The pipeline installations will not cause a significant effect on visual resources or recreation. As
discussed in the EIR, the SRDF installation will not cause a significant impact on visual resources
because the components would not be readily visible or obstruct any viewsheds (5.8-22 to -23). Since the pipelines will be buried, they will not be visible after construction and are not expected to have any lasting visual effects. The EIR did not analyze the effect of underground pipeline installation on recreation because the pipelines would be primarily located along roadway rights-of-way and would not disrupt or bypass any existing recreational facilities (EIR 5.9-1). This conclusion also applies to the new pipelines, which again will be buried and located far from recreational facilties.
The EIR's analysis of traffic impacts covers the pipeline installations. According to the EIR, the construction of the SRDF, pumphouse and pipeline together are expected to last 16 months with an average of 48 workers and 20 to 68 trucks per day for delivery of materials (DEIR 5.10-13, 5.12-9). All pipeline construction would occur Monday through Friday, 7:00 AM to 6:00 PM at an average rate of 500
16 The zoning classifications for both proposed pipeline alignments are PQP-D-S (Public/Quasi-Public - Site Zoning District - Site Plan Review Zoning District) and F-40 (Farmland with a 40-acre minimum).

to 800 linear feet per day, adding only approximately 7 to 11 days of additional pipe installation activity. All soil displaced by the pipe installation would most likely be placed on nearby farmland or within the confines of the adjacent regional landfill, using roads that are not used by the public. All roads to be used in connection with installing the pipelines are listed in the EIR (DEIR 5.10-9) except Charlie Benson Lane, which is a gated, two-lane paved road running from Del Monte Road into the entrance to the regional landfill and the regional treatment plant. Charlie Benson Lane is maintained by the Monterey Regional Waste Management District, which operates the regional landfill. No lane closures would occur because of the expanded pipeline installation. The EIR found that the construction of the SRDF, pumphouse, and pipeline together would create less-than-significant traffic delays and pavement degradation, but that the potential to track mud or gravel onto Nashua and Reservation Roads poses a
potentially significant safety hazard (DEIR 5.10-13), These impacts were found to be less than
significant after implementation of a mitigation measure requiring all paved roads leading to construction sites to be swept (DEIR 5.10-20). Implementation of this measure would also reduce the impacts of the modified project to below the level of significance.
The air quality effects of installing the pipes are also accounted for by the analysis in the EIR. The installations would occur in the North Central Coast Air Basin under the jurisdiction of the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District (MBUAPCD). The only emissions associated with the operation of the pipes would come from the intake pump station, whose air quality effects were analyzed in the EIR (DEIR 5.11-18). No pump station would be required for the Blanco Drain pipeline, which will operate by
gravity. Short-term air quality impacts, however, would occur during construction. As discussed in the DEIR, ozone precursor pollutants ROG and NO, are accommodated for in air plan emissions inventories and their emission would not, therefore, have a significant impact on attainment (DEIR 5.11-15).
Emissions of CO (an estimated 174 lbs/day) would be well • below the significance threshold (550 Ibs/day), and the installation of 6,600 additional linear feet of pipe, and the modifications to the Blanco Drain culvert, would constitute a minimal source a of CO compared with construction of the adjacent SRDF and pumphouse and CO emissions would remain well below the significance threshold (DEIR
5.11-16). By contrast, the EIR found that fugitive dust from the construction activities would result in PM 10 emissions of an estimated 265.7 lbs/day, which is more than three times the significance threshold of 82 lbs/day. These temporary emissions would have a potentially significant short-term effect on air quality and on adjacent agricultural crops (DEIR 5.11-16). The EIR explained that the construction contractors will implement all mitigation measures recommended by MBUAPCD through the permitting process, but the resulting emissions "would remain above the applicable MBUAPCD threshoids." The EIR found this to be a significant and unavoidable impact. The project modifications would increase the short-term daily PM 10 emissions by a very small amount, for perhaps 11 days, which is within the general
range discussed in the EIR. This very small increase would not constitute a substantial increase in the
severity of the significant effect on air quality.
Other than the operation of the pump station, the effects of which were analyzed in the EIR (DEIR 5.12- 16), there will be no long-term noise associated with the operation of the pipelines. For short-term construction, the EIR found that required mitigation measures will reduce the noise-related effects to below the level of significance (DEIR 5.12-19). The same measures will apply to the additional linear feet of pipeline to be installed, keeping noise-related impacts below the significance level.
As discussed above, the loss of a small amount of riparian habitat would not pose a significant effect on
terrestrial species (DEIR 5.5-38 to -39; FEIR 3-78). The remainder of the pipeline would be installed on disturbed-farmland, under gravel roads, within an existing pipeline route, and in undisturbed property within the boundaries of the regional landfill. There would be no long-term impact because the pipelines will be buried and the property would be restored to the same condition after construction. As discussed in the EIR in the context of a possible expanded distribution system, although some common plant
species would be removed during construction, no plant or animal population would be substantially

reduced (EIR 5.5-39). The recent discovery of California tiger salamander southwest of the proposed connecting pipeline realignment warrants a separate analysis, and is discussed below.
California Tiger Salamander
Species Description
The California tiger salamander (CTS) is a lowland species wholly endemic to central California, and the population within Monterey County is listed as threatened pursuant to the Federal Endangered Species
Act." CTS persist in disjunct remnant vernal pool complexes in Sonoma County and Santa Barbara County, in vernal pool complexes and isolated ponds scattered along narrow strip of rangeland on the
fringes of the Central Valley from southern Colusa County south to northern Kern County, and in vernal pools and human-maintained stock ponds in the coast ranges from the San Francisco Bay Area south to the Temblor Range. CTS are restricted to grasslands and low-elevation foothill regions (generally under
1,500 feet), where they use seasonal aquatic habitats for breeding. CTS typically breed in natural ephemeral pools, or ponds that mimic ephemeral pools (stock ponds that go dry), and occupy substantial areas surrounding the breeding pool as adults.
The primary causes of the decline of CTS populations are the loss and fragmentation of habitat from human activities and the encroachment of non-native predators. CTS has lost a large portion of its habitat (including uplands and sites that were likely habitat but never sampled) due to human activities.
Location and Proximity to Modified Project
A breeding site for CTS has been documented at the agricultural basin on Armstrong Ranch southwest of
the new connecting pipeline route. Thirteen larvae and five eggs were identified on March 28, 2007. A second aquatic survey conducted on April 9, 2007, identified 34 CTS larvae. Current USFWS practice is to 'assume the presence of CTS in suitable upland habitat within 2 kilometers of documented breeding site. Portions of the connecting pipeline will lie within 2 kilometers of the Armstrong Ranch breeding site. Although this section of the alignment primarily follows an existing pipeline within a disturbed area
and occurs outside the breeding site itself, portions of the project area within the 2 kilometer area contain suitable upland habitat for the CTS and therefore, CTS may be present within the project area. The project is wholly outside the area designated as critical habitat for CTS (Federal Register August 23, 2005, 70 FR 49379 49458).
The EIR. lists the following thresholds of significance relevant to CTS for activities that would:
Have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modification, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special-status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by CDFG or USFWS;
Interfere substantially with the movement of any native wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites (DEIR
5.5-30).
Installation of the connecting pipeline could potentially adversely affect CTS and its habitat. The pipeline will not pose long-term impacts to CTS because it will be buried, the worksite will be restored to approximate present condition to prevent erosion, and maintenance/operational activities would be limited to repairs or emergency work in discrete areas. Construction activity within potential CTS habitat would most likely take no more than 2 days. The modified alignment also does not include wetlands or potential CTS breeding sites. Short-term construction activities, however, have the potential to adversely affect the
species, in particular by possibly destroying any small mammal burrows in the area where CTS may be present and by temporarily disturbing potential upland habitat. CTS utilizing any small mammal burrows disturbed during the installation may be crushed and/or fatally buried. The effects associated with the

construction activities would be temporary. The pipeline will be entirely subsurface and there will be no on-going operational activities. Disturbance would be temporary and restoration activities would begin after the completion of the construction project to prevent erosion. Maintenance activities may include
excavation of the pipeline for repair or emergency work. Thus, although the modified project is not likely to adversely affect CTS and is not likely to jeopardize its continued existence, the project has the potential to cause adverse effects on the species. Because the modified project is not located within any critical
habitat unit designated for CTS, the modified project will have no effect on critical habitat for this
species.
CTS Conservation and Minimization Measures
MCWRA will mitigate for the potential adverse effects on CTS by implementing the following conservation and minimization measures, or any equivalent measures identified in the Biological Opinion that the USFWS will prepare in connection with the Section 404 permit for the SRDF:

a. Ground-disturbing construction activities must not occur at night or during rain.
b. Ground-disturbing construction activities must be conducted during the dry season between March 15 and October 15.

C. Prior to ground-disturbing activities, any areas with dense concentrations of small mammal burrows must be flagged by a USFWS-approved biologist and avoided as much as possible.

d. A USFWS-approved biologist must conduct a brief training session for all project personnel before any project-related activities begin within the project area. At a minimum, the training must include a description of the CTS, their habitat, regulatory framework, the measures to be implemented during work activities to protect the species, and a review of project boundaries.

e. Prior to commencing excavation in upland areas that could injure or kill individual CTS, a
pre-construction survey must be conducted immediately preceding the activity. A USFWS- approved biologist for the project must carefully search all obvious potential hiding places for CTS, such as large downed woody debris or small mammal burrows. Any CTS found within these upland project areas must be captured and relocated into suitable habitat outside of the project area.
f. A USFWS-approved biologist must be onsite during all ground-disturbing activities to
monitor for the presence of CTS. The USFWS-approved biologist must have the authority to stop construction activities when CTS are encountered or unintended indirect effects to CTS habitat occur, until appropriate corrective measures are taken. If a CTS is observed within a designated work area and cannot be avoided, all work must stop until the animal leaves the work area or until it is captured and relocated outside the work area by a USFWS-approved biologist.

g. Prior to any construction or habitat enhancement activities, USFWS-approved biologists must identify appropriate areas to receive translocated CTS in the project area. These areas must be in proximity to the capture site but outside any area likely to be adversely impacted by construction activities, support suitable vegetation, and be free of exotic predatory species
(e.g., bullfrogs, crayfish) to the best of the USFWS-approved biologists' knowledge. Specifically, any accidentally exposed CTS found during project activities must be relocated
to another small mammal burrow outside of construction activities.

h. CTS must be captured with bare hands or vinyl gloves only. USFWS-approved biologists must not use soaps, oils, creams, lotions, repellants, or solvents of any sort on their hands before and during periods when they are capturing and relocating this species.
i. The USFWS-approved biologist must limit duration of handling and captivity of CTS to a minimum. While in captivity, individuals of this species must be kept in a cool, moist, aerated

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

environment, such as a bucket containing a a damp sponge. Containers used for holding or
transporting this species must not contain standing water.
j. If trenches are left open overnight, the trench area must be surrounded by silt fencing, installed in coordination with the USFWS-approved biologist, to ensure that the CTS do not enter the project area and become trapped in the trench. The bottom six inches of silt fencing must be folded over (facing away from the project area) and weighed down with rebar, rocks, or other suitable material to prevent CTS from squeezing under the silt fence and entering the trench area. Any trenches left open overnight must be inspected by the USFWS-approved biologist within two hours of sunrise each morning to remove any CTS that may have inadvertently entered the trench.
k. The project proponent/lead agency must request written approval from USFWS of any
biologist employed to capture, move, and survey for CTS in the project area and to conduct the training sessions. The request must be in writing and be received by the USFWS at least 15 days prior to the onset of activities onsite.
1. To ensure that diseases are not conveyed to the project worksite by the. USF WS-approved biologists, the fieldwork code of practice developed by the Declining Amphibian Populations
Task Force must be followed at all times.

m. All staging areas, equipment storage areas, and project boundaries must be defined with fencing.

n. Pets shall be prohibited from the project site.

0. During project activities, all trash that may attract predators to the site shall be properly contained and removed from the worksite.
If more than one CTS adult or juvenile is found dead or injured during construction activities in any single calendar year, the project applicant/lead agency must contact the USFWS office immediately so that the Service can review the project activities to determine if additional protective measures are needed. Project activities may continue pending the outcome of the review, provided that the proposed protective measures are fully implemented. With the implementation of these mitigation measures, the project is not expected to result in significant impact on the California tiger salamander.
Cumulative Effects
Installing the proposed SRDF river water connecting pipeline within the unpaved areas of the alignment could potentially cause loss or disturbance of CTS, though as discussed above, with the implementation of the proposed mitigation measures, the project is not expected to result in a significant impact on the species. However, the development of other, separate projects in the Armstrong Ranch area-in
particular, the Marina Station Project and the Regional Urban Recycled Water Project (RWP)-require
analysis of whether the incremental effects of the SVWP modifications, combined with the effects of other projects, are cumulatively considerable.
The Marina Station Project is located within the City of Marina a and proposes a mixed-use 325-acre development, which includes 1,360 residential units of varying types, 60,000 square. feet of mixed commercial uses, 143,808 square feet of general office uses, and 651,624 square feet of industrial uses. In addition, approximately 58 acres of open space and parkland is proposed, which includes a buffer area
between this project and existing neighborhoods. The mitigation measures outlined in the Draft EIR for this project reduce impacts to CTS to a less-than-significant level. In addition, the EIR determined that, although growth and urbanization outside of the former Fort Ord boundaries may impact similar biological resources, these projects would be required to provide mitigation for potentially significant
impacts consistent with regulatory agency requirements.

Chapter 2 Description of Changes to SVWP

The Récycled Water Project, to be developed by Marina Coast Water District (MCWD) in cooperation with the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA), consists of constructing recycled water distribution system to provide up to 1,727 acre-feet per year of recycled water from the existing MRWPCA Salinas Valley Reclamation Project facility (SVRP) to urban users. With the
implementation of the mitigation measures outlined in the Draft Biological Assessment for the RWP, the project is not likely to adversely affect the CTS.
In addition to these projects, changes are planned onsite at the MRWPCA Reclamation Plant. This is developed sitè and thus no impacts to the CTS are anticipated. MCWRA is unaware of any other potential projects in the area with the potential to adversely affect CTS.
The proposed connecting pipeline, combined with other projects in the area, could contribute incrementally to the cumulative loss of CTS. However, for all projects in the area, extensive measures to avoid and minimize effects on CTS are expected to reduce any potential significant effects to below the level of significance. Any potential effects from the proposed connecting pipeline installation will be temporary, resulting from construction activity within potential CTS habitat that would most likely take no more than 2 days. Moreover, as part of the Marina Park Project, the U.S. Army has arranged to set aside more than 15,000 acres of contiguous CTS upland and breeding habitat at the former Fort Ord to be managed for the conservation of CTS and other species. The USFWS has determined that the habitat reserves "will result in improved habitat for" CTS, and the Army has begun transferring much of the area to land management agencies (USFWS, Biological Opinion, Cleanup and Reuse of Former Ford Ord, March 14, 2005), In light of the mitigation measures and the extehsive management actions taken to ensure the viability of CTS, the two-day pipeline installation within the potential CTS upland habitat area is not expected to contribute to a cumulatively considerable effect on the species.

Chapter 3 Conclusions

Chapter 3 Conclusions
The following changes have occurred to the project since the certification of the Salinas Valley Water Project Final EIR:
Revised Flow Regime
O Modified Flows in the Salinas River

O Modified Lagoon Flows
o Minimum Flows in the Nacimiento River
Relocation and reconfiguration of the Salinas River Diversion Facility (SRDF)
None of the project changes will, after mitigation, result in new significant environmental effects or substantially increase the severity of previously identified significant effects. There are no changes in circumstances or new information substantially affecting the project. Therefore, no supplemental EIR is required to address the changes to the proposed project.

ADDITIONAL FINDINGS FOR THE ADDENDUM TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT
REPORT FOR THE SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT

I; INTRODUCTION

The Monterey County Water Resources Agendy ("MCWRA") ls the public egency charged with the long- term management and preservation of water resources in the Salinas Valley. In this capacity, MCWRA adopted the Salinas Valley Water Project ("SVWP") to stop seawater Intrusion into the Salinas Valley, provide adequate water supplies to meet ourrent and futurc needs, and improve the hydrologic balance of the groundwater basin. The SVWP also included flow targets to enhance migration opportunities for steelhead trout

Since the MCWRA Board of Supervisors centified the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the
SVWP on June 4, 2002, the SVWP has undergone a few refnements. In 2002, MCWRA began meeting with the National Marine Fisheries Service ("NMFS") pursuant to the Endangered Species Act. The meetings focused on ways to modify the SVWP to provide even greater enhancements for steelhead trout, including consideration of spawning and rearing habitat and migration for juveniles and adults, As an outcome of these meetings, MCWRA proposed new measures for protecting steelhead in the project arca, MCWRA'y Salinas Valley Water Projoct Now Prescription for Steelhead Trout in the Salinas Rivet sets forth seasonal migration flow rate objectives to reflect steelhead needs at different life steges, 1.e., making targeted water releases when steelhead would receive the most beneft: Meeting these flow objectives will somewhat modify seasonal now rates in the Salinas and Nacimiento rivers, water levels in the San Antonio and Nacimiento roservoirs, and flow rates in the Salinas River Lagoon ("Lagoon").
In addition, MCWRA has moved the location of the Salinas River Diversion Facilhty ("SRDF") upstream by approximately 200 feet to avoid confliets with MCWRA's existing Castroville. Seawater Intrusion Project (CSIP") distribution mainline and to ensure shallow groundwater is not affected on adjacent landfill property, and has moved the pump station from the east bank of the Salinas Riverto the west. The SRDF has also undergone a few design refinements to provide for a reduction in planned water surface diversions. In addition, MCWRA will change the alignment of the pipeline connecting the SRDF to the ÇSIP distribution systom and will install another pipeline to seasonally relocate the point of discharge from
the Blanco Drain.

AMENDMENT TO THE MITIGATION MONITORING PROGRAM FOR THE SALINAS VALLEY WATER PROJECT
The California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") requires public agoncies to adopt a mitigation reporting or monitoring program for all projects for which an environmental impact report has been prepared. This requiremem is intended to ensure the Implementation of all mitigation measures adopted through the CEQA process. The Monterey County Water Resources Agency ("MCWRA") cerufied the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Salinas Valley Water Project ("SVWP*) and adopted the Mitigation Monitoring Program for the Salinas Valley Water Project on June 4, 2002. The Addendum to the SVWP EIR Identifies additional mitigation measures lo reduce potential impacts to California liger salamander and avian species to below the level of significance. Accordingly, the following mitigation measures are added to the SVWP Mitigation Monitoring Program as if set forth in SVWP Mitigation Monitoring Program Appendix A: Inventory of Mitigation Measures.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Procedural Background
The Salinas Valley Water Coalition (Coalition or Plaintiff) initiated the action giving rise to this
report on January 13, 2017, by filing a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief against the defendant Monterey County Water Resources Agency (Agency, Defendant, or MCWRA) in the Monterey County Superior Court. The is Coalition is a non-profit corporation formed to represent the interests of its members in
protecting the members' water rights, and furthering the sustainable management of water
resources in that portion of the Salinas Valley that lies within Monterey County. The Coalition
states that its members include individual and business entities that own, lease, or otherwise
control real property, including riparian and overlying rights to water, in the Monterey County
portion of the Salinas Valley. On May 23, 2017, the Coalition filed a Verified Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief
(Complaint), which is the operative complaint as of the drafting of this report.
The Complaint alleges twelve causes of action, of which the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth
allege violations by the Agency of the terms of its water rights or injury to water rights held by
Coalition members. The remaining causes of action allege violations by the Agency of
Proposition 218 and the Public Records Act.
On August 1, 2017, the Monterey County Superior Court entered an Order of Reference to the State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board or Board) pursuant to Water Code
section 2000 et seq. to investigate and report upon the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth Causes of
Action. The Court directed the parties to stipulate to the issues of fact and law that the Board
would report on in connection with the reference. On September 8, 2017, the Court issued a
subsequent order specifying the issues for reference to the Board and directing the State Water Board to investigate and report upon as many of the issues as it reasonably can by August 1, 2018, but at least items 3(a)-(d) which the Court defined as Phase I of the reference proceeding.

1.2 Reference Issues
Items 3(a)-(d) as listed in the Court's order of September 8, 2017, are addressed in this report:
a. Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from
Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015;

b. If the Board concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 cfs water release requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River, whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to the Salinas River Groundwater Basin's ("Basin") Upper Valley and Forebay subareas and, If so, whether that recharge reduction reduced water availability
(i.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater quality) for any riparian and overlying
rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas;

C. Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and $an Antonio reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624(Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) are junior in priority to any downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin;

d. To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in
the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir
operations in 2014 and 2015.

1.3 State Water Board Process
Water Code section 2000 et seq. allows a court to order a reference to the Board, as referee,
a when a suit involves a determination of rights to water. The reference may be for any or all issues involved in the suit (Wat. Code, § 2000.) or for investigation of and report upon any or all of the physical facts involved. (Wat. Code, §2001.) The Board may base its report solely uponi
its own investigations or may hold hearings and take testimony. (Wat. Code, § 2010.)
Following the September 8, 2017 order from the Court specifying issues for reference to the
Board, the Board specified the reference team, communication protocols, and process for
presentation of evidence and arguments by the parties and preparation of the report by the Board. (Letter from State Water Board to All Parties October 5, 2017.) Given the relatively short
time period in which to conduct the reference proceeding, the process was styled as a "paper hearing," in which both parties prepared and submitted legal briefs, technical analyses, and supporting évidence to the Board in writing. in Parties had the opportunity to review and respond to information submitted by the opposing party in responding briefs.

1.3.2 Discovery
The Coalition sought to obtain information and documents from the Agency, including files
related to computer modeling work performed for the Agency under contract by RMC, A
Woodard and Curren Company (RMC); and Luhdorff and Scalmanini Consulting Engineers
(LSCE). The Coalition requested that initial briefings be due no sooner than 45 days after receipt of all of the requested information and documents. After attempting to meet with the
former contractors of the Agency, the Coalition filed an ex parte application to lift the stay in the court proceeding for the limited purpose of allowing the Issuance of deposition subpoenas to
obtain the requested evidence. (Plaintiffs Ex Parte Application (November 8, 2017).) The
Agency opposed lifting the litigation stay, citing the authority of the State Water Board to issue
administrative subpoenas for purposes of obtaining testimony and evidence. The Court denied the Coalition's application and the Coalition subsequently served deposition subpoenas pursuant to Water Code section 1100.
In lieu of depositions, the Board invited the subpoenaed witnesses to participate in a Modeler's
Conference held on January 25, 2018, to explore the characteristics of the various groundwater models relied upon by the Agency in support of its planning and public works projects and to

5

identify the relevant computer files necessary to operate the model. (Letter from State Water Board to All Parties (December 21, 2017).) The witnesses' attendance and participation in the Modeler's Conference was deemed to satisfy all obligations under the subpoenas. (Letter from
State Water Board to All Parties (January 24, 2018).) The experts' statements and testimony at the conference were made under oath. After the Modeler's Conference, the Coalition requested
additional information from one of the Agency's former consultants, Mr. Taghavi, about
computer files used to operate the preferred model identified during the Modeler's Conference.
Following some delays in scheduling a discussion with Mr. Taghavi, a meeting between the
partles and Mr. Taghavi was held on April 23, 2018.

1.3.3 Briefing and Post-Briefing Submittals
The Board established a final briefing schedule of June 7, 2018, for submission of initial
briefings and July 9, 2018, for submission of responsive briefings. (Letter from State Water
Board to All Parties (April 26, 2018).) The parties submitted timely briefings and responses in
accordance with the Board's schedule.
On July 17, 2018, the Agency filed a motion to strike and objections to the Declaration of John
Romans, the Declaration of Steven Mclntyre, the Declaration of Jerry J. Rava II, the Declaration
of Allan Panziera, and the Declaration of Curtis V. Weeks, submitted by the Coalition in support
of its Phase 1 Responding Brief as improper new evidence and for lack of foundation. (Defendants' Motion to Strike and Objections to Evidence Filed by Salinas Valley Water Coalition in Support of its Phase 1 Responding Brief, (July 17, 2018).) The Coalition responded
on August 24, 2018..
On August 24, 2018, the Coalition submitted objections and a motion to strike the the July 9,
2018 Declaration of Anthony Daus in Support of Brief in Response to Petitioner/Plaintiff's Phase
Opening Brief of Salinas Valley Water Coalition; the June 7, 2018 Declaration of Anthony
Daus in Support of Defendants' Response to Reference Order; the June 7, 2018 Declaration of Anne Williams in Support of Defendants' Opening Brief; and those portions of the Agency's® June 7, 2018 Opening Brief and July 9, 2018 Brief in Response that rely upon the listed
declarations. (Plaintiff Salinas Valley Water Coalition Objections and Motion to Strike
Defendants' Daus and Williams Declarations and Related Phase 1 Opening and Responding Briefs Arguments (August 24, 2018).) The Coalition's objections and motion are made on the
basis that the declarations lack foundation and are irrelevant, confusing, and misleading. With its motion, the Coalition submitted an additional declaration by Mr. Durbin, dated August 16, :,
2018, that included modified modeling results. The Agency submitted a consolidated response a
on September 28, 2018, to the objections, motion to strike and the August 16, 2018, declaration of Mr. Durbin and related exhibits. (Defendants' Response to Plaintiffs Objections and Motions to Strike Daus and Williams Declarations and Related Phase 1 Opening and Responding Brief Arguments and Objections and Motion to Strike Improper Argument and Evidence Filed with Defendant's Phase | Responding Brief (September 28, 2018).) The Board's response to these motions and additional submittals is addressed by ruling letter dated November XX, 2018.

2.0 BACKGROUND
2.1 Physical Setting
The a Salinas Valley is a northwest-southeast trending alluvial valley extending 90 miles from Monterey Bay to the San Ardo oil field. The lateral extent of alluvium thins toward the southeast
narrowing to the width of the riparian zone of the Salinas River near San Ardo oil field. The
valley sits within the California Coast Ranges geomorphic province between the San Joaquin Valley and the Pacific Ocean. The Sierra de Salinas and Santa Lucia Mountains bound the valley to the west and the Diablo Range and Gabilan Range bound the valley to the east. The
Salinas River drains the valley flowing south to north.
The Salinas River runs approximately 175 miles from the La Panza Range in San Luis Obispo
County to the Monterey Bay. The Salinas River watershed drains approximately 4,600 square
miles. (Central Coast RWQCB, 1999.) The river flows through the Paso Robles groundwater
basin in San Luis Obispo County before entering the Salinas Valley. The Salinas River's main tributaries from south to north are: Estrella, Nacimiento, San Antonio, and Arroyo Seco Rivers. Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs are located on the Nacimiento and San Antonio
tributarles of the Salinas River. (Exhibit 1.)
The•Salinas Valley has a Mediterranean climate. The rainy season, in which 90% of
precipitation occurs, generally begins in November and ends in April. Summer months have
typically little to no precipitation. Precipitation fails as rain in the surrounding mountain ranges
with less annual precipitation reaching the valley floor. Orographic lift produces rain.in the
Gabilan and Santa Lucia ranges recelving mean annual precipitation of 20 to 25 inches,
respectively, The valley floor annually receives an average of 10 to 15 inches of rain. (MCWRA,
2006.) Dry, drought like conditions are not uncommon in the valley with extended drought occurring in the late 1970s, late 1980s to early 1990s, and from 2012 to 2017. (Brown and
Caldwell, 2015.)
Agriculture and range land dominate the land use in the valley. Agriculture represents the primary water consumption using a combination of surface water and groundwater for irrigation.
(MCWRA, 2006.) Irrigated acreage within the Salinas Valley increased steadily in the 1940s
through 1950s and rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Total irrigated acreage has remained
relatively constant since the 1980s. (Brown and Caldwell, 2015, at p. 2-5.) Since the 1980s, water use has increased in urban centers such as Castroville, Gonzales, Greenfield, King City,
Salinas, and Marina. Other types of land use include: natural riparian zone, oil production, shrub
and forested uplands. (bid.)
Agricultural pumping represents more than 90% of total groundwater extractions in the Salinas
Valley. Reported total agricultural pumping remained stable in recent years, changing from
462,628 acre-feet in 1995 to 478,113 acre-feet in 2015, while total irrigated acres changed from
173,158 acres in 1996 to 181,610 acres in 2016. (MCWRA, 1996, Table 7; MCWRA, 2017,
Table 7.) A summary of 2015 groundwater extractions by subarea and type of use is provided
below in Table 1.

There are three existing surface water supplies in the Salinas Basin: (1) a small amount of surface water is diverted from the Arroyo Seco for agricultural uses; (2) recycled urban wastewater is treated and applied to agricultural land under the Castroville Seawater Intrusion Program (CSIP); and (3) the Salinas River Diversion Facility (SRDF) diverts surface water from

8

the Salinas River north of Marina and distributes it to the CSIP system. (Brown and Caldwell,
2015, pp. 2-4 to 2-5.)

2.2 Hydrogeology
The Salinas Valley is the largest groundwater basin in California's Central Coast. (MCWRA, 2006, p. 1-3.) The Agency divides the portion of Salinas Valley within Monterey County into five management areas or subareas: Upper Valley Area, Arroyo Seco Area, Forebay Area, East Side Area, and Pressure Area. Exhibit 2 depicts the subareas in the Salinas Valley groundwater basin within Monterey County. Not included is the Paso Robles subbasin, which is located in San Luis Obispo County,
The basin is geologically complex containing multiple structural controls and stratigraphic units. Two major tectonic processes form the geologic structure of the basin:
Late Oligocene [approximately 30 million years ago (Ma)] subduction along the western edge of the North American plate resulting in uplift of the Coast Ranges' mountain
system
Middle Miocene (approximately 15 to 10 Ma) dextral strike-slip stress from the San
Andreas Fault Zone

The Rinconada Fault Zone (RFZ) also acts as a major structural element in the basin. The RFZ
runs along the western edge of the valley and extends approximately 143 miles from the Paso
Robles area to King City. North of King City, the Reliz Fault continues as a right stepover of the
RFZ terminating in the Monterey Bay. Other smaller faults, such as the Los Lobos Thrust Fault,
relieve stress within the basin. The Los Lobos Thrust exists near the town of San Lucas and the
San Ardo Oil Fleld. The Los Lobos Thrust generates relatively frequent seismic activity,
The basement granitic rock consists of the Mesozoic Salinian Block. The Monterey Formation, an oil bearing Miocene marine shale, overlays the basement complex and forms the base of the
water bearing sedimentary units. The arkosic sandstone Santa Margarita Formation overlies the Monterey Formation with the Purisima Formation intermittently overlying the Santa Margarita Formation. The Paso Robles Formation functions as the primary aquifer. Permeable unconsolidated to semi-consolidated interbedded gravel, sand, and silt constitute the lithology of the Paso Robles Formation. The unconsolidated Aromas Sand and valley fill sediments overlay the Paso Robles Formation and act as groundwater storaäge material.
In the southern portion of the valley (i.e. the Upper Valley and Forebay Subareas) the aquifer systems are mostly unconfined whereas confining units are present in the norther portion of the
basin. Below are excerpts from the Agency's Groundwater Management Plan that describe the five main groundwater subareas in detail, presented from South to North. (MCWRA, 2006.)

2.2.1 Upper Valley Area
The Upper Valley Area extends from approximately three miles south of Greenfield to
about. six miles south of the town of San Ardo. The primary aquifer in this area is

9

unconfined and generally considered a single unit. This aquifer consists of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated and interbedded gravel, sand, and silt of the Paso Robles Formation, alluvial fan, and river deposits. Deposits west of the Salinas
River tend to be coarser grained than those to the east. These deposits represent the lateral equivalents of the 180-Foot and 400-Foot Aquifers found in the lower Salinas Valley (Pressure and East Side Areas). (DWR, 2004.) However, no aquitard comparable to those separating the aqulfers in those areas exists in the sedimentary
.sequence of the Upper Valley Area: The Deep Aquifer is not present in the Upper Valley Area due to the southward shallowing of the basement complex. (DWR, 2004.) Specific capacities for wells completed in the Upper Valley Area are reported to be on
the order of 150 gal/min/f.

2.2.2 Arroyo Seco Area
Although considered a separate area in this GWMP, the Arroyo Seco Area is an area sometimes considered to be within the Forebay Area. The Arroyo Seco Area is
considered herein as a separate areadue to a different (non-Salinas River) source of
water replenishment. The •Arroyo Seco Area encompasses approximately 22,000 acres on the west side of the Salinas Valley between Mission Soledad and the bluff line about two miles south of Greenfield. (DWR, 1946.) This area is the alluvial fan of the Arroyo Seco, and adjoins the Forebay Area on the north and east and the Upper Valley Area on the south. The rincipal source of replenishment for the Arroyo Seco Area is the percolation from the channels of the Arroyo Seco and its tributary Reliz
Creek. (DWR, 1946.) The primary water-bearing units of the Arroyo Seco Area consist of alluvial fill with a predominant heavy strata of boulders and coarse gravels to depths of 500 to 700 feet. Moderate layers of coarse sand and reddish yellow clay are also
found within the fill. (DWR, 1946.)

2.2.3 Forebay Area
iS The Forebay Area is located in the center of the Salinas Valley and extends from the
town of Gonzales in the north to approximately three miles south of Greenfield. The
primary water-bearing units in the Forebay Area are the same (stratigraphically-
equivalent layers) as those found in the Pressure and East Side Areas; however, the
near-surface confining unit and Salinas Valley Aquitard (SVA) do not extend into the Forebay Area. Groundwater in this area is unconfined and occurs in lenses of sand and gravel that are interbedded with massive units of finer grained material. (DWR, 2004.) The deep or 900-Foot Aquifer found in the Pressure and East Side Areas is also present in the Forebay Area. This deeper aquifer consists of alternating layers of sand-gravel mixtures and clays rather than a distinct aquifer. and aquitard. (Montgomery Watson, 1994.) Specific capacities for wells in the Forebay Area have been reported to be on the order of 100 gal/min/ft. The Forebay Area is so named as
it is the primary zone for recharge of the Pressure and East Side Areas of the Salinas
Valley Groundwater Basin. This occurs primarily due to the pinching out of the SVA at

10

the southern end of the Pressure and East Side Areas and the northern end of the
Forebay Area. The principal sources of groundwater replenishment in the Forebay
Area are percolation from the Salinas River (and its tributaries) and groundwater outflow from the Upper Valley Area and the Arroyo Seco Area. (DWR, 1946.)

2.2.4 East Side Aquifer
The East Side Aquifer is located in the northeast portion of the Salinas Valley from approximately Santa Rita to Gonzales, east of the Pressure Area. This area is
generally bounded by the foothills of the Gabilan Range on the northeast and State Highway 101 on the southwest. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) Hydrogeologically, this area is characterized by a series of connected alluvial fans that are built up by small streams draining the Gabilan Range, creating a sloping, fan-shaped topography that is visible today. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) The Department of Water Resources (DWR) originally defined this area in 1946 as the area bounded by the Pressure Area on the west and the Forebay Area on the south, containing unconfined groundwater that is typically recharged by streams draining the Gabilan Range and directly from precipitation
during wet years.
The East Side Area generally consists of a poorly bedded sequence a of gravel, sand, silt, and sandy and gravelly clay. (MCFCWCD, 1960.) The sand and gravel beds of the East Side area are generally thinner and less continuous than in the Pressure Area, and typically do not correlate well between boreholes due to the relatively thin- bedded nature of the gravel and sand, the discontinuity of beds in both the lateral and down-dip direction, and the complex erosional nature of streams feeding the alluvial
fans resulting in complex records of sediment deposition. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.)
The Pressure 180-Foot and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer zones are not observed in the East Side Area; however, the East Side sediments can be time-stratigraphically correlated to equivalent zones. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) The designation of these
stratigraphic zones has been used to analyze the lateral connectivity between the
aquifers of the Pressure and East Side Areas. Earlier studies (e.g., MCFCWCD, 1960;
SGD, 1990; Hall, 1992; and J.M. Montgomery Engineers, 1993) have designated the East Side Area aquifers as the East Side Shallow Zone and the East Side Deep Zone. As reported by. DWR in 1946, the aquifers in this area are generally unconfined with some localized areas of slight pressure due to local confinement. Specific capacities of wells completed in the East Side Area have been reported to be on the order of 26
gal/min/ft.

2.2.5 Pressure Area
The Pressure Area is located in the northern part of the Salinas Valley, west of the East Side Aquifer. This subarea consists of three aquifers, and the area itself is sometimes referred to by the names of these aquifers: the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer, the Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer, and the Deep Aquifer (also referred to as the 900-Foot
Aquifer).

11

Shallow groundwater in the in Pressure Area is typically found perched on top or located
within the SVA, a blue or yellow sandy clay formation overlying and confining the
Pressure 180- Foot Aquifer. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) The SVA has been identified (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004) as scattered, thin, laterally discontinuous sandy layers typically less than 100 feet thick in the area west of Salinas, thinning to approximately 25 feet near Salinas (DWR, 1973) and pinching out east of Salinas. The formation
typically extends vertically from the ground surface to approximately -100 to -150 feet
mean sea level (MSL) and extends laterally from Monterey Bay south 1o Chualar
(approximately ten miles south of Salinas) and from Fort Ord east to an irregular
contact at the Pressure Area/East Side Area boundary. The SVA thins and pinches
out near the Pressure Area/East Side Area boundary; and is therefore roughly the
demarcation between fluvial and alluvial fan deposits. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) Two
potential gaps in the SVA were identified by Kennedy/Jenks Consultants (2004).
These gaps may create locally unconfined or semiconfined conditions in the Pressure
180-Foot Aquifer.
Underlying the SVA is the Pressure • 180-Foot Aquifer, the uppermost laterally
extensive aquifer in the Northern Salinas Valley. The location of this aquifer within the
Salinas Valley is varlable and spans more than one stratigraphic unit. DWR (1970 &
1973) correlates the aquifer to lower valley terrace deposits and upper Aromas Sands,
whereas Leedshill-Herkenhoff, Inc. (1984) correlates the aquifer with the Paso Robles
Formation, DWR (1973) and Harding ESE (2001) assign the aquifer to Valley Fill, and
Greene (1970) places it in the lower Valley Fill - upper Aromas Sands.

Consisting predominantly of sand and gravel depositions with subordinate sand/clay
and gravel/clay components, the shape of the sand bodies of the Pressure 180-Foot
Aquifer appear to reflect their fluvial deposition origin - lenticular shape sand in what
appears to be a fluvial channel migrating and shifting over time. (Kennedy/Jenks,
2004.) The depth and thickness of the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is variable, but
generally the top is encountered at about -100 feet MSL, increasing in depth slightly
from southeast near Salinas to the northwest near the ocean. Individual sand bodies
are typically 100 to 150 feet thick, although they range in thickness from less than 50 feet to greater than 200 feet where the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer and the Pressure
400-Foot Aquifer appear to be in contact. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004; DWR,1970 and
1973).
The Pressure. 180-Foot Aquifer is recharged where SVA pinches out (e.g. Forebay
Area)' and is exposed on the floor of the Monterey Bay. (Todd, 1989.) Generally
consisting of hydraulically-connected sand and gravel beds with intervening clay
layers (Harding ESE, 2001; Greene, 1970, Kennedy/Jenks, 2004), the Pressure 180-
Foot Aquifer is sometimes separated into the Lower 180-Foot Aquifer, which is
considered confined under the SVA, and the Upper 180-Foot Aquifer which is also
called the uppermost-perched zone or Shallow Groundwater Aquifer and is
unconfined.

12

Underlying the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is the 180/400-Foot Aquitard. This aquitard separates the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer and consists
of clay or clay and sands layers. The aquitard is widespread in the Salinas Valley basin
and varies in thickness and quallty from thick layers of blue clay to thin layers of brown clay, (MCFCWCD, 1960.) The aquitard is rarely as much as 200 to 250 feet thick and more commonly 50 to 100 feet thick. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) MCFCWCD (1960) describes two "holes" in the aquitard, one under the Salinas River near Blanco and the
other under the old Salinas River bed near the coast. The Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer
and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer also appear to be interconnected in places between
Salinas and Chualar and south of Chualar. (MCFCWCD, 1960.) Brown (1986) describes the aquitard as generally lenticular in shape and discontinuous in places, notably near the mouth of the Salinas River and near Fort Ord. Todd (1989) indicates
several areas between Castroville and the coast where the aquitard is thin or absent,
indicating that the 180-foot and 400-foot aquifers interact in certain places.
The Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer underlies the 180/400-Foot Aquitard and is an
extensive layer of coarse- and fine-grained sand and gravel typically encountered between 270 and 470 feet bgs. The top of the aquifer is typically encountered at 300 to 350 feet below MSL (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004), however the depth of the top of the
aquifer, thickness of the aquifer and degree of complex interbedding with clay layers is quite variable (Thorup, 1976) with more variability in depth, thickness and discontinuity from the southeast to the northwest (I.e. in the downstream direction). DWR (1970, 1973) indicates that near Salinas, the aquifer consists of a single thick
permeable bed approximately 200 feet thick which, northwest towards Castroville,
divides into two 25-foot thick sandy beds and one 100-foot thick sandy bed separated
by clay layers. The uppermost beds of the aquifer merge and interfinger with the lower
beds of the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer in some areas (DWR, 1970, 1973) where the
intervening aquitard thins or pinches out.
The term Deep Aquifer is typically used to describe the 800-Foot Aquifer, 900-Foot Aquifer, 1,000-Foot Aquifer, and the 1,500-Foot Aquifers. (Harding ESE, 2001.) The
Deep Aquifer and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer are separated by an aquitard that can be
several hundred feet thick. (Kennedy/Jenks, 2004.) Historically, the Deep Aquifer has
not been utilized as a groundwater production zone.

2.3 Recharge of the Salinas Valley Basin
The Salinas River is the primary source of recharge to the Salinas Basin as a whole. a Durbin
(1978) states that the subarea designations of thè Salinas Basin are simply a form of
convenience and that groundwater moves among the areas of the Basin. In this context, Durbin
(1978) stated that a distinguishing characteristic of the subareas is their sources of recharge. Durbin (1978) states that infiltration from the channel of the Salinas River is the principal source
of groundwater recharge for the Salinas Basin and directly recharges the Pressure, Forebay,
and Upper Valley Areas, while indirectly recharging the East Side Area by the movement of
water across the area boundaries. According to Durbin (1978, at pp. 8-11), the Salinas River

13

accounts for roughly 50 percent of recharge (excluding irrigation return water), while tributaries to the Salinas River account for an additional 30 percent of recharge (excluding irrigation return
water) to the Basin.
Subsequent investigations and reports confirm that infiltration from the Salinas River is the
primary source of recharge to the basin. Yates (1988, at Abs. p. 1) states the Salinas River
provides 58 percent of the Salinas Basin's recharge, excluding irrigation return flows and that small stream and Arroyo Seco recharge accounts for 32 percent of recharge to the basin,
excluding irrigation return flows. Regarding the subareas of the basin, Yates (1988) identifies
that recharge occurs through the subsurface from the Upper Valley to the Forebay Area, the
Forebay Area to both the Pressure and East Side Areas, and between the Pressure and East
Side Areas. Yates (1988, at pp. 10-11) also identifies that the Salinas River provides recharge directly to the Pressure, Forebay, and Upper Valley Areas. Montgomery and Watson (1997)
found comparable numbers for recharge percentages (Figure 3-2, at p. 3-7; Figure 3-3, at p. 3-
8), although their report did not provide distinctions for Salinas River recharge versus recharge
from other tributaries.

The stream recharge räte (e.g. acre-feet per year for a section of stream) is proportional to the hydraulic gradient between stream water and groundwater, and the wetted area of stream channel. Groundwater extraction can increase stream recharge rates by decreasing the water
table and increasing the hydraulic gradient between surface water and groundwater. This
increased amount of recharge is called pumping-induced increased recharge, in comparison to
natural recharge before the development of well pumping (Bouwer and Maddock, 1997; Zhou,
2009).
In the Upper Valley, groundwater wells are distributed within a narrow band of the Salinas River
(MCWRA, 2017, at p. 8.) In the Forebay subarea, groundwater wells are located both along the
Salinas River and the Arroyo Seco tributary, and throughout the valley (MCWRA, 2017, at p. 7.)
In the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas, groundwater pumping occurs in unconfined aquifers
that interacts directly with the Salinas River. (MCWRA, 2006; Brown and Caldwell, 2015.) This Interaction between pumping activities and the river, as well as recharge to the Basin being dependent on the Salinas River indicates that the groundwater and surface water within the
Salinas Valley constitute a single common source.

2.4 Water Rights Held by the Agency for Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs
The Agency holds two water rights authorizing diversion and storage of water in Nacimiento
Reservoir, and one water right authorizing diversion and storage of water in San Antonio
Reservoir. License 12624 (Application 16761, Permit 12261) was Issued to the Agency by the State Water Board on April 26, 1990. The right authorizes the Agency to divert wup to ** acre- feet per annum (afa) of water from the San Antonio River to storage onstream in San Antonio Reservoir from October 1 of each year to July 1 of the succeeding year, with a priority date of December 2, 1955. License 7543 (Application 16124, Permit 10137) was issued to the Agency
predecessor in interest by the State Water Board on November 4, 1965. The right authorizes
the Agency to divert up to 350,000 afa of water from Nacimiento* River to storage onstream in

14

Nacimiento Reservoir from October 1 of each year to July 1 of the succeeding year, with a priority date of November 4, 1954. (0008_Permit 10137 - License 7543, Coalition opening briefing.) Permit 21089 (Application 30532) was issued by the State Water Board to the Agency on March 23, 2001. The right authorizes the Agency to divert an additional 27,900 af to storage in Nacimiento. Reservoir from October 1 of each year to July 1 of the succeeding year, with a priority date of April 23, 1996. (0012_Permit 21089, Coalition opening briefing.) The Agency submitted Application 30532 after new surveys of Nacimiento Reservoir revealed that the actual
storage capacity of the reservoir at 800 feet elevation was 377,900 af as compared to the
estimate of 350,000 af on which License 7543 was based. (0010_Application 30532, Coalition
opening briefing.)
The Agency is authorized to collect a total of 377,900 afa of water to storage in Nacimiento
Reservoir pursuant to License 7543 and Permit 21089. Water diverted under both rights is stored in Nacimiento Reservoir and released for municipal, domestic, industrial, and irrigation uses within the boundaries of the Agency's Zone 2 and Zone 2C as depicted on the map
attached as Exhibit 3, excluding lands annexed to Zone 2 after November 4, 1965, and 7,500 acres within San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District. The rights also authorize recreational use of the water while stored in Nacimiento Reservoir.:
Historically, the Agency has operated Nacimiento Reservoir to store winter flows for release
during the summer season to maximize recharge to the groundwater basin by infiltration through the streambed of the Salinas River. The purpose of the reservoir at the time of its construction
was to capture stormwater runoff that would otherwise discharge to the ocean and then release
these diversions during the spring, summer, and fall, to maximize recharge of the gröundwater basin. The water is then extracted from the basin by individual users, and beneficially used for the purposes Identifled in the Agency's water rights. (SVWP Engineer's Report, at p. 2-2.) As
described in the original application:
The water stored will be released at rates at which it will be absorbed it in Its flow
down the channels of the Nacimiento and Salinas Rivers.... The rate of storage
release will be adjusted to the absorptive capacity of the Salinas River.... The stored water so released and absorbed will mingle with the naturally available percolating groundwater in the Salinas Valley and the mingled supply will be used by the landowners in Zone 2 of the District for the various uses for which they have
beneficial needs;

(Application 16124.)
In 2004, the Agency filed petitions with the State Water Board seeking to change the place of use and add points of rediversion for Licenses 7543, 12624, and Permit 21089 for purposes of operating the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). The project consisted of reoperation of the
storage and release schedules of the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, modification of
the Nacimiento Dam spillway, and installation of a diversion facility in the Salinas River (the
Salinas River Diversion Facility). The intent of the changes was to halt further seawater
intrusion into the basin by making more water available to recharge the basin during the

15

summer months and by providing surface water deliveries for irrigation to offset groundwater
pumping in certain areas. (SVWP Final EIR Addendum, at p. 1-1.)
NMFS filed a protest against the change petitions on the basis that the Salinas Valley Water
Project could adversely impact steelhead in the Salinas River and its tributaries. (NMFS protest,
Division of Water Rights), By letter dated June 23, 2006, NMFS informed the State Water Board
that it would withdraw its protest to the proposed changes if the Board included terms and conditions in the amended license and permit that incorporated the flow prescriptions jointly developed by the Agency and NMFS through consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. (Letter, from NMFS to State Water Board (June 23, 2006), Division of Water
Rights; also Agency Opening Brief, Exhibit 38, MCWRA-038 NMFS June 23, 2006 Letter to
State Board.) That consultation process resulted in the Salinas Valley Water Project Flow
Prescription for Steelhead Trout in the Salinas River (2005 Flow Prescription) which the Agency provided to NMFS on October 11, 2005. (Coalition Opening Brief, Exhibit 21, 0021_2005 SVWP
Flow Prescription.) NMFS issued a biological opinion for the project on June 21, 2007, based in
significant part on the Flow Prescription report. (Coalition Opening Brief, Exhibit 20, 0020_2007
SVWP Biological Opinion.) The description of the project in the Biological in Opinion included flow provisions to address the needs of various life stages of steelhead in the Salinas River
watershed. Respecting rearing flows in the Nacimiento River, the Biological Opinion states that
"[u]ntil further studies are conducted to determine adequate rearing flows in the Nacimiento River below the reservoir during summer and fall, MCWRA will release a minimum of 60 cfs
throughout the year as minimum rearing flow as long as the water surface elevation of
Nacimiento Reservoir is above the elevation 687.8 feet mean sea level (msl), the reservoir's
minimum pool." (Id., at pp. 16-17.)
On August 4, 2008, the State Water Board sent to NMFS for review, a draft of the amended
license and permit that included terms and conditions incorporating the flow prescriptions.
(Letter from State Water Board to NMFS (August 4, 2008), Division of Water Rights.) NMFS
responded by letter dated August 28, 2008, stating that the agency had reviewed the terms and conditions in the draft amended rights and would dismiss its protest if the terms and conditions were included in the final amended rights. (Letter from NMFS to State Water Board (August 28,
2008), Division of Water Rights.)
The State Water Board approved the Agency's petition for changes to License 7543 and Permit 21089 in State Water Board Order WR 2008-0037-DWR. The Order purports to "[a]dd terms to
incorporate the flow prescriptions included in the June 20, 2007 NMFS biological opinion." (State Water Board Order WR 2008-0037-DWR, at p. 2.) The Order also requires the Agency to "(1) install any devices necessary to measure or calculate the quantities of water placed Into underground storage, and (2) install devices to measure, or provide documentation of the method to be used to determine, the quantity of water recovered from underground storage and placed to beneficial use." As amended, the water rights require the Agency to "malntain records of stream flow, well levels, and groundwater storage as are required by the State Water Board so as to determine the amount stored underground and extracted thereafter..." (Term 0080117)

2.4 Drought Operations
The water years between fall 2011 to fall 2015 were some of the drlest on record in California.
In January 2014, Governor Brown issued a Proclamation of a State of Emergency due to drought conditions in California.1 The water surface of Nacimiento Reservoir fell below 748 feet
msi on August 8, 2013, and did not rise above this level until January 9,.2017. (Agency Opening
Brief, Decl. Brent Buche, at p. 3.) In January 2014, San Antonio Reservoir was at 5% of its
storage capacity and close to physical dead pool and Nacimiento Reservoir was at 23% of its
storage capacity.
On February 20, 2014, Agency staff.met with NMFS to discuss a reduction in minimum
releases from Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. At the time, all portions of
Monterey County were either in extreme or exceptional drought and the Salinas River Watershed was projected to have very little additional rainfall for the remainder of the
2014 water year. Based on the Agency's projections that assumed no significant additional inflow to the reservoir, maintenance of the release of 60 cfs would result in operational minimum pool elevation of 687.8 feet msl in the reservoir in February or -March 2015 and physical dead pool in May or June 2015. Reduction of the releases
from 60 cfs to 25 cfs would allow the Agency to maintain releases from the reservoir for approximately 180 additional days, assuming no significant inflow to the reservoir in the
intervening period. (Agency Opening Brief, at pp. 19-20.)
The Agency formally requested a reduction in releases from Nacimiento Reservoir from
60 cfs to 25 cfs from NMFS by letter dated March 18, 2014, and continued to consult
.with NMFS regarding the request. (Agency Opening Brief, at p. 20.) NMFS- responded formally by letter dated April 25, 2014. The April 2014 letter states that a reduction in
releases could result in adverse impacts to steelhead habitat but suggested measures to
mitigate the impact if the Agency implemented the proposed reduction in outflow. In
response to the recommendations by NMFS, the Agency developed a ramping rate for
reducing flows and temperature and fish monitoring measures to evaluate whether the
flow reduction had resulted in "instances of stranding, isolation, or extreme loss of
habitat" that could result in a take.

On June 4, 2014, the Agency reduced releases from Nacimiento Reservoir from 60 cfs to 25
cfs. At the time, the elevation of the water level at Nacimiento Reservoir was 723.1 feet msl and
storage was at 20% capacity. In accordance with its monitoring plan, the Agency provided NMFS with water temperature data, habitat descriptions, air temperature data, and streamflow data at various monitoring locations. On May 28, 2015, the Agency increased minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir to 60 cfs.

The State Water Board takes official notice of the Governor's Drought Emergency Proclamation, Proclamation No. 1-17-2014. Official notice is taken pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 648.2 (authorizing the State Water Board to take official notice of matters that may be judicially noticed) and Evidence Code section 452, subdivision (c) (authorizing judicial notice of official acts of the legislative, executive, or judicial departments of the State).

3.0 ISSUE (A) - COMPLIANCE WITH THE FLOW PRESCRIPTION PERMIT TERM

Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit
21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through
May 27, 2015?

The Coalition alleges in its Petition that the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River (hereafter, "Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription") in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cfs of water from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014 through May 27, 2015. The Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription states:
Permittee shall augment flow in the Nacimiento River by releasing 60 cfs MDF [mean daily flow] from Nacimiento. Reservoir beginning the 8th day after the first adult steel head passage day occurs on the Salinas River after January 1 of each water-year. The first passage Is day is the first day in a period of 5 consecutive days with mean daily flow of 260 cfs or higher at USGS gage No. 11152300 (Salinas River near Chualar). The release of 60 cfs MDF will continue at least through May 31. After May 31, Permittee will continue to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder of the calendar year as long as the water surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.8 feet mean sea level.

There is no factual dispute that the actual rate of release was less than 60 cfs during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015. After an initial ramp-down period, flow releases from the Nacimiento Reservoir for this period ranged between approximately 25 and 30 cfs. (Agency, Opening Brief, Exhibit 44, MCWRA-044 MCWRA Stream and Reservoir Data
(MCWRA000002).xlsx.)

The Agency defends that the release of less than 60 cfs of water from Nacimiento Reservoir
during the relevant period did not violate the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the
Agency's water rights because the Agency operated the reservoir in a manner consistent with
the drought provision in the 2005 Flow Prescription. (Agency Opening Brief, at p. 16.) The Agency asserts that the drought provision was incorporated by reference into the flow
prescription in the Agency's water rights and allowed for reduction in minimum releases from
Nacimiento. Reservoir under certain conditions with approval by NMFS.

3.1 Analysis
3.1.1 Plain Meaning of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
The Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription operates on a calendar year basis, beginning January 1.2 The term divides the year into the period from January 1 through May 31, and June
2 The term states that flow shall be augmented beginning the eighth day after the first adult steel head passage day occurs on the Salinas River "after January 1 of each water-year." The reference to water year (which begins on October 1 and ends September 30) in this sentence is superfluous. The final sentence of the term clarifies that the flow prescription operates on a calendar year.

18

through December 31. Until May 31 of each year, the minimum release requirement of 60 cfs
from Nacimiento Reservoir is triggered beginning the eighth day after the first adult steelhead passage day occurs on the Salinas River. Data from USGS gage No. 11152300 is available on the USGS website. During the 2014 and 2015 calendar years, there were no flows recorded at USGS gage No. 11152300. (USGS data at <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=11152300>[as of September 3, 2018]; USGS.11152300 SALINAS R NR CHUALAR CA - 2013-2018.xlsx.)
Because there were no flows, no adult steelhead passage days occurred as defined by the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription. "The first passage day is the first day in a period of 5
consecutive days with mean daily flow of 260 cfs or higher at USGS gage No. 11152300 (Salinas River near Chualar).". The Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription only requires releases beginning on the eighth day after the first adult steelhead passage day, and this
condition precedent did not occur either in 2014 or 2015.

After May 31 of each year, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription requires the Agency to "continue to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder of the calendar year as long as the water
surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.8 feet mean sea level." The parties do
not dispute that the surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir remained above 687.8 feet mean
sea level throughout the calendar years of 2014 and 2015. Whether the Agency was required to release 60 cfs starting in June 2014 and 2015 therefore depends on whether the Spawning
and Rearing Flow Prescription requires releases after May 31 even if there were no adult
steelhead passage days earlier in the year. We read the plain language of the Spawning and Rearing Flow.Prescription to require a release of 60 cfs after May 31 only If adult steelhead
passage days triggered the requirement prior to May 31. Key to our interpretation is the word
"continue" in the flow prescription. To read the provision to require the permittee to begin releasing 60 cfs after May 31 when not required to do so previously would be inconsistent with the meaning of the word "continue," and is not a reasonable interpretation of the term.
As interpreted by the State Water Board, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription did not require the Agency to make minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir in 2014 and 2015, either before or after May 31, because there was no first adult steelhead passage day to trigger
the requirement.

3.1.2 2007 Biological Opinion
The State Water Board's interpretation and application of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription is based on the plain meaning of its language. Both parties, however, point to the analogous term for spawning and rearing flows in Nacimiento River in the 2007 NOAA
Biological Opinion as relevant extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the condition in the Agency's
water rights. Because of key differences in the language of the terms, however, we conclude
that the 2007 NOAA Biological Opinion does not alter the meaning of the flow prescription as
stated in the Agency's water rights.
The 2007 Biological Opinion describes the minimum releases that the Agency will provide for
spawning and rearing habitat in the Nacimiento River as follows:

19

To provide spawning opportunities, [the Agency] proposes a release of 60 cfs from
Nacimiento Reservoir beginning the eighth day after the first adult steelhead
passage day occurs on the Salinas River near Spreckels after Jañuary 15t. These flows will be continued through May. 31st. Until further studies are conducted to
determine adequate rearing flows in the Nacimiento River below the reservoir during summer and fall, MCWRA will release a minimum of 60 cfs throughout the year as minimum rearing flow as long as the water surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above the elevation 687.8 feet mean sea level (msl), the reservoir's minimum pool.
(Biological Opinion (June 21, 2007), at p. 17 (emphasis added).)
The difference between this release requirement and the Spawning and Rearing Flow
Prescription in the Agency's water rights is indicated in bolded type. The Biological Opinion explicitly commits.the Agency to. releasing 60 cfs throughout the year as long as the water surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above the elevation of 687.8 feet msl, unless and
until further studies are conducted. In effect, the third sentence of the passage quoted above renders the trigger of the first adult steelhead passage day superfluous. If, however, the Agency were to conduct additional studies to demonstrate that flows other than year-round. flows of 60 cfs are appropriate to maintain rearing habitat, then the trigger conditions may come
into effect. The Blological Opinion sets up a path for adaptive management, such that the flow
requirements may be altered based on future information gathered pursuant to additional
studies.

n contrast, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the Agency's water rights is not
conditioned on additional future studies. It therefore would be unreasonable to read the term to
require a release of 60 ofs year-round regardless of the presence of the triggering conditions. To do SO would be to read the triggering conditions out of the term.
Water Right Order 2008-0037 twice refers to the flow prescriptions in the 2007 Biological
Opinion, but nelther reference explicitly incorporates by reference the flow prescriptions in the Biological Opinion. Paragraph 9 of the Order finds that NMFS withdrew its protest to the change petition "based on inclusion of the biological opinion's flow prescriptions in the amended
licenses and permit." (State Water Board WR Order 2008-0037, 1 9.) Paragraph 4(c) of the
order directs that the Agency's water rights be amended to "[a]dd terms to incorporate the flow in prescriptions included in the June 20, 2007, NMFS biological opinion." (State Water Board WR Order 2008-0037, 1 4.) Both statements suggest that the Board intended to incorporate the flow
prescriptions of the 2007 Biological Opinion into the Agency's water rights. And the Board did
incorporate the flow prescriptions in substantial part. All five flow prescriptions from the 2007 Biological Opinion are listed as terms of the Agency's water rights, with flow charts and diagrams to track the detailed triggering conditions. The only apparent difference in the flow in prescriptions as they are stated in the Agency's water rights as compared to the.2007 Biological Opinion is the difference in the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription raised in this proceeding. Whether or not that difference was intentional cannot be discerned from the
language in the underlying order or any extrinsic evidence raised in this proceeding. Ultimately,
neither the Order nor the amended water rights state in operative language that the flow

20

prescriptions in the 2007 Biological Opinion are incorporated by reference as terms and conditions of the Agency's rights.

3.1.3 2005 Flow Prescription
The Agency takes the argument of incorporation by reference a step further. The Agency
asserts that the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the Agency's water right is merely a
summary of the analogous conditions in the 2005 Flow Prescription on which the 2007
Biological Opinion was based, and that the language in the 2005 Flow Prescription was
incorporated "in full" into the Agency's water rights. (Agency Opening Brlef, at pp. 23-24.) Unlike the 2007 Biological Opinion, the 2005 Flow Prescription Report includes a "drought provision" that allows reduction in the minimum releases required by the flow prescriptions
during drought conditions upon approval by NMFS. (Agency Opening Brief, Exhibit 16,
MCWRA-016 Flow Prescription.pdf, SVWP Flow Prescription, at p. 31.)
Like the 2007 Biological Opinion, the 2005 Flow Prescription Report explicitly states that the
"minimum release from Nacimiento Reservoir is 60 cfs for the entire year until a rearing habitat flow is identified." (lbid., at p. 30.) The report alsò describes the triggering conditions for spawning flows included in both the 2007 Biological Opinion and the Agency's water rights,
which triggers are effectively moot until the referenced flow study has been conducted because
of the year-round 60 cfs release requirement.
The Drought Provision in the 2005 Flow Prescription Report states:
Under dröught conditions, the [Agency] will evaluate reservoir storage with regard
to the continuation of minimum releases. When the water surface of Nacimiento
Reservoir is at or below elevation 748 feet msl recommendations may be presented
to NMFS for a reduction of the minimum flow criterion.
The Agency relies on the Drought Provision to defend its release of less than 60 cfs in 2014 and 2015 because the Agency consulted with NMFS about the proposed reduction in the minimum releases prior to implementation. The Agency met with NMFS in early 2014 and requested a reduction in minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir from 60 cfs to 25 cfs by letter dated
March 18, 2014, raising the possibility that without the requested reduction, Nacimiento
Reservoir would reach minimum pool if there were no inflows- to the reservoir in the 2015 water
year. By reducing releases from the reservoir, the Agency would extend the period of time that it could guarantee some release to the Nacimiento River. (Agency Opening Brief, Exhibit 46,
MCWRA-046 MCWRA March 18, 2014 Letter to NMFS.pdf.) NMFS responded to the Agency's request by letter dated April 25, 2014, stating that a reduction in releases could result in adverse
impacts to steelhead habitat but offering various measures that could reduce the risk of impacts
(Agency Opening Brief, Exhibit 51, MCWRA-051 NMFS April 25, 2014 Letter to MCWRA.pdf.) These measures were adopted and implemented by the Agency, including a gradual ramp down
of flows and a monitoring program to identify impacts to steelhead. (Agency Opening Brief, at p.
24.)

21

We are not persuaded by the Agency's argument that the Drought Provision was incorporated by reference into the Agency's water rights for the same reasons that we are not persuaded that
the 2007 Biological Opinion was incorporated by reference into the Agency's water rights. In addition, there is no reference at all to the 2005 Flow Prescription Report in WR Order 2008- 0037. Because the Drought Provision was not incorporated into the Agency's rights, we do not
address the Coalition's argument that the Agency failed to obtain approval from NMFS before
reducing releases from Nacimjento Reservoir.
In sum, the evidence does not clearly demonstrate an intent that the Agency's water rights strictly adopt the flow prescriptions in the 2007 Biological Opinion. Because the extrinsic evidence is inconclusive, it is the Board's recommendation that the language of the Spawning
and Rearing Flow Prescription be interpreted according to its plain meaning.

3.2 Additional Matters
The Coalition claims in its briefing that "It]he criteria triggering Naciemento Reservoir's 60 cfs minimum flow release requirement were present from June 4, 2014 through May 27, 2015.... That includes five consecutive days with mean daily flow of 260 ofs or higher at USGS gage No.
11152300…." (Coalition Opening Brief, at p. 35.) This statement seems to contradict facts
established by available gage data. The Coalition relies on the declaration of Mr. Weeks for this argument, but Mr. Weeks does not explain how he came to his conclusion. We are unsure whether the Coalition disputes the USGS gage data, made a factual error in its consideration of the triggering criteria, or is interpreting the flow prescription in a manner that requires a minimum release of 60 cfs even if no adult steelhead passage days occurred during the year.
The Coalition also claims that the Agency admitted during meetings of the Agency's Board of
Directors in 2014 that a minimum release of 60 cfs was legally required. (Coalition Opening
Brief, Exhibit 26, 0026_June 2, 2014 Agency meeting minutes.pdf.) An admission that 60 cfs was legally required to be released is not, however, an admission that 60 cfs was legally required to be released by the terms of the Agency's water rights. Independent of its water rights, the Agency must operate Nacimiento Reservoir in compliance with the 2007 Biological
Opinion. Even If the Agency was not required to make minimum releases pursuant to its water
rights, the Agency may have been required to make minimum releases to comply with the
Endangered Species Act.

Finally, we have focused in this report on the requirements of the Spawning and Rearing Flow
Prescription in the Agency's water rights because that was the issue presented by the court.
We believe it is also worth addressing, however, the term in the Agency's water rights which
states that "nothing in this license/permit shall be construed as authorizing any diversions
contrary to the provisions of the [2007] biological opinion(], either as written as of the date of this of
permit/license or as they may be amended..." (Permit 21089, at p. 8.) The purpose of this
provision is to make clear that no diversions are authorized in violation of the Endangered
Species Act (ESA) so as to ensure compliance by the right holder with the ESA and to shield the Board and its staff against citizen suits alleging liability pursuant to the doctrine articulated in Strahan v. Coxe, (1st Cir. 1997) 127 F.3d 155. (ld. (licensing of gilinet and lobster pot fishing by

22

the State of Massachusetts that result in injuries to northern right whales was "takings" by the state in violation of the ESA).) The provision does not incorporate by reference the whole of the
applicable biological opinions to render them independently enforceable terms and conditions of the Board's permit. If the Board had intended that result, it would have made the incorporation
by reference explicit.

3.3 Findings and Conclusions
The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency has not violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532).

4.0 ISSUE (B) - EFFECTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH FLOW PRESCRIPTION TERM

If the State Water Board concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 CFS water release requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River, whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to the Salinas River Groundwater Basin's ('Basin') Upper Valley and Forebay subareas and, if so, whether that recharge reduction reduced water availability (I.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater quality) for any riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay
subareas?

This issue need only be addressed if the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimlento River addressed in issue (a). Because the Board
concludes that the Agency was not in violation of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat, issue (b) is not addressed further.

5.0 ISSUE (C) - PRIORITIES OF AGENCY WATER RIGHTS

Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs -- License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624 (Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any downstream
riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin?

5.1 Summary of Contentions
The parties do not disagree about the basic principles of water rights priorities in California. In general, riparian and overlying users have a senior claim to the natural flow of a stream, or the safe yield of a groundwater basin, superior to the claim of an appropriative right holder. Because

23

the Agency holds appropriative water rights, the Agency's rights are junior in priority to the rights
of overlying and riparian users. The Agency defends that its diversions to storage in Nacimiento
Reservoir during the winter months was storage and use of "salvaged water," or water that
otherwise would not have been diverted and used by any senior right holder but would have run off unused to the Pacific Ocean, and therefore, is water to which the Agency has a superior
right.

5.2 Overview of California Water Rights

"Ownership of California's water is vested generally in the state's residents, but individuals and
entities can acquire twater rights,' the right to divert water from its natural course for public or
private use." (Light V. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1478-
1479; see also, Millview County Water District v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (Millview I)
(2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 879, 888.) California law recognizes a dual system of property rights in
surface water consisting of riparian and appropriative rights and a parallel dual system in
groundwater consisting of overlying and appropriative rights. (United States v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82, 101.) Other types of water rights are also
recognized, including prescriptive rights, pueblo rights, and federally reserved rights, but these
have not been asserted by the parties in this proceeding and therefore are not discussed further
in this report.
A. Riparian rights.
Riparian rights are recognized under the common law as part and parcel of the riparian land to
which they attach. A water right permit from the State Water Board is not required to exercise a
riparian right. Generally, riparian rights attach to the smallest parcel of real property contiguous to the watercourse held under one titie in the chain of title leading to the present owner.
(Pleasant Valley Canal Co. V. Borror (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 742, 774-775.) The right is limited
to the natural flow of the watercourse (ld. at p. 118), and to reasonable and beneficial use on
the riparien parcel. The rights of riparian users are correlative, consisting of an equitable share of the available supply. (Lux v. Haggin (1886) 69 Cal. 255, 390; Cal. Const., art. X, § 2.) The right is not a fixed quantity of water, but will vary based on available natural flow, the right
holder's riparian demands, and the needs of other riparian users. Water diverted under a
riparian right may not be stored and may not be transferred for use outside of the watershed. Unlike an appropriative right, a riparian right is not lost for non-use.
'B. Appropriative Surface Water Rights.
Appropriative surface water rights are acquired by diverting and applying water to beneficial
use. The maxim "first in time, first in right" governs the relative priority of appropriative rights,
and the rights of senior appropriators are served completely before those of junior appropriators. (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra (1949) 33 Cal.2d 908, 926.) Appropriators may develop rights regardless of land ownership or location of use on the land, may use the water outside of the watershed, and.may lose rights through non-use. (Miller v. Bay Cities Water Co. (1910) 157

24

Cal. 256; Smith v. Hawkins (1898) 120 Cal. 86, 88; Crandell v. Woods (1857) 8 Cal. 136, 142;
Wat. Code, § 1241.)
Prior to December 19, 1914, the effective date of the Water Commission Act, compliance with
statutory requirements was not necessary to obtain a valid appropriative right. Appropriative
rights established before that time are referred to as "pre-1914 rights." "So long as the diverter
acted with due diligence to achieve the intended diversion, did in fact divert within a reasonable
time, and used the diverted water for a beneficial purpose, the claim was perfected and had
priority over any later established claim." (Millview County Water Dist. v. State Water Resources
Control Bd. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 879, 890 [citing Haight v. Costanich (1920) 184 Cal. 426, 431-33].) Since 1914, the exclusive means to obtain an appropriative surface water right is by obtaining a water right permit from the State Water Board (or Its predecessor agency) pursuant
to the statute now codified as Division 2 (commencing with section 1000) of the Water Code. (Wat. Code, § 1225; Pleasant Vailey Canal Co., supra, 61 Cal.App.4th at p. 777.) "Once an
appropriative right permit is issued, the permit holder has the right to take and use the water
according to the terms of the permit." (United States v. State Water Resources Control Bd.,
supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at.p. 102; Wat. Code, §§ 1381, 1455.) Upon perfection of the right by
diversion and beneficial use, the State Water Board will confirm. the appropriative right by
issuing a license. (Wat. Code §§ 1600-1610.)
C. Groundwater Rights.
An overlying groundwater right is analogous to a riparian right to surface water. (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra (1949) 33 Cal.2d 908, 925.) An overlying right attaches to land overlying a groundwater basin and is correlative to the rights of other overlying users in the safe yield of the basin. (See Katz.v. Walkinshaw (1903) 141 Cal. 116.) A water right permit from the
State Water Board is not required to exercise an overlying right,ª and like a riparian right, an overlying right is not lost for non-use. The rights of overlying users are correlative, consisting of an equitable share of the available supply. The available supply for a groundwater basin is termed the "safe yield", or "sustainable yield," and is discussed further in the Subsection D.
Like appropriative rights to surface water, appropriative rights to groundwater are governed by
the principle of first in time, first in right, and allow use of water outslde of the groundwater
basin. The State Water Board does not have permitting jurisdiction over groundwater, so an
appropriative groundwater right can be obtained simply.by extraction and beneficial use and
does not require permit from the state. Water may be appropriated for beneficial uses subject
to the rights of those who have a lawful priority. Any water not needed for the reasonable
beneficial uses of those having prior rights is excess or surplus water. In California, surplus

3 The State Water Board does exercise permitting authority over the diversion and use of water from "subterranean streams flowing in known and definite channels." (See, Wat. Code, §.1200; see generally N. Gualala Water Co. V. State Water Res. Control Bd: (2006) 139 Cal. App. 4th 1577, as modified on
denial of reh'g (June 15, 2006).) The State Water Board has not found that the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin is a subterranean stream subject to its permitting jurisdiction.

25

water may rightfully be appropriated on privately owned land for nonoverlying uses, such as devotion to a public use or exportation beyond the basin or watershed.
D. Safe or Sustainable Yield
The concept of a volume of water that may be extracted from a basin on an annual basis
without incurring injury to other uses and users or causing other undesirable results, is termed the safe yield or sustainable yield of the basin. This concept is well described in the following
passages from a The National Judicial College Groundwater Benchbook:
Safe yield and sustainable yield are terms that generally refer to the maximum possible groundwater extraction rate that will not cause unacceptable harm to a groundwater system, the human and natural environments supported by it; and the environment supporting the groundwater system. These terms are difficult to define because
groundwater systems are in a dynamic balance with their surroundings, and are thus in a constant state of change and also because "unacceptable harm" is a (subjective) policy decision, not a scientific term. As such, what is sustainäble or safe at one point in time may not be at another point in time. Most commonly, safe yield or sustainable yield is understood as the amount of water that can be withdrawn annually from an aquifer for many years without causing harm. Safe or sustainable yield is typically measured in acre-feet per year.

The difference between the two terms is often vague. Safe yield is a mass balance equation, and can fail to take into account the delay of multiple stresses and non- steady conditions, such as climate variabllity. Sustainable yield holds a longer-term, dynamic view, and is defined as the (possibly varying) amount of water that an aquifer can indefinitely yleld without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or social
consequences.

(Adjudicating Groundwater: A Judge's Guide to Understanding Groundwater and Modeling, Dividing the Waters, The National Judicial College (2018), at pp. 29-30.)
Judge Jack Komar, of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, described the safe yield in decisions in both the Santa Maria Groundwater Adjudication and the Antelope Valley Groundwater Adjudication as the amount of annual extractions of water from the aquifer over
time that equals the amount of recharge to the groundwater aquifer such that groundwater levels are maintained in some equilibrium, plus any temporary surplus. (Santa Marla Phase Three Statement of Decision; Antelope Valley Phase Three Statement of Decision.) Temporary surplus is defined as that amount of water that may be pumped from an aquifer to make room to store future water that would otherwise be wasted and unavailable for use. (Antelope Valley Groundwater Cases - Statement of Decision Phase III Trial (2011), at p. 4.) The judgment in the Upper Los Angeles River Area adjudication defined safe yield as the maximum quantity of water which can be extracted annually from a ground water basin under a given set of cultural
conditions and extraction patterns, based on the long-term supply, without causing a continuing reduction of water in storage. (City of Los Angeles v. City of San Femando (1979) Judgment, at
p. 4.)

26

The safe yield of a basin under a particular set of surface conditions will depend upon limits within which water levels in the basin are allowed to fluctuate. (Krieger and Banks, 1962,
Ground Water Basin Management, Vol. 50, Issue 1 of California Law Review, at p. 57.) The
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 codifies the elements to be considered by a
groundwater sustainability agency in establishing the sustainable yield of the basin, defined as
the "maximum quantity of water, calculated over a base period representative of long-term
conditions in the basin and including any temporary surplus, that can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply without causing an undesirable result." (Wat. Code, 10721(w).) Undesirable results are defined as:
"[O]ne or more of the following effects caused by groundwater conditions occurring throughout the basin:
(1) Chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and unreasonable depletion of supply if continued over the planning and implementation horizon. Overdraft during a period of drought is not sufficient to esteblish a chronic lowering of groundwater levels if extractions and groundwater recharge are managed as necessary to ensure that reductions in groundwater levels or storage during a period of drought are offset by increases in groundwater levels or storage during other periods. (2) Significant and unreasonable reduction of groundwater storage. (3) Significant and unreasonable seawater intrusion. (4) Significant and unreasonable degraded water quality, including the migration of contaminant plumes that impair water supplies. (5) Significant and unreasonable land subsidence that substantially interferes with surface land uses.
(6) Depletions of interconnected surface water that have significant and unreasonable adverse impacis on beneficial uses of the sunface water.

This definition of the sustainable yield of a basin, and the factors to be considered in identifying
the sustainable yleld is consistent with the general common law definition that has been
articulated by the courts. It is the sustainable yield that defines the volume of water to which an
overlying users' correlative share attaches and defines whether any surplus water is available for appropriation, and therefore is central to any adjudication of groundwater rights or
determination of injury.
As part of SGMA implementation, the Department of Water Resources (Department) is charged with developing regulations for evaluating the groundwater sustainability plans that will define sustainable yield. (Water Code § 10733.2.) These regulations direct the process by which
groundwater sustainability agencies are to quantitatively define undesirable results. (Cal. Code
Regs., tit. 23, div. 2, chap. 1.5, subchap.2, subart. 3, Sustainable Management Criteria.) Additionally, groundwater sustainable agencies are required to consider the interests of all
beneficial uses and users in the basin when developing definitions of undesirable results and sustainable yield. (Ibid.; Water Code § 10723.2) Although SGMA does not directly. determine or alter surface or groundwater rights, the definition of undesirable results and sustainable yield by groundwater sustainability agencies will likely assist future findings necessary for a
determination of water.rights or demonstration of injury to specific water right holders. (Wat.
Code, § 10720.5.) The Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin subareas are categorized as high and medium priority basins, for which a groundwater sustainability plan must be submitted by January 31, 2020 for portions of the Pressure Area and January 31, 2022 for the remaining subareas of Salinas Valley.(Wat. Code 10720.7.)

E. Relative Priority of Groundwater and Surface Water Rights.
With limited exceptions, riparian and overlying rights are senior in priority to appropriative water
rights. Riparian users along a stream system may consume all available supply, leaving none
for appropriative users, even of the most senior priority. This is-true regardless of the date on
which the riparlan use commenced, so long as the use is reasonable and the water is used on
riparian lands. Similarly, overlying users have a right to exhaust the safe yield of a groundwater
basin such that no water may remain for use by-appropriative right holders in the basin.
Because riparian and overlying users are limited to water that would be naturally available,
water that is foreign in time or source are not subject to riparian or overlying claims. Such
foreign water may include water that has been imported from a source outside of the watershed,
or water that is made available out of season by storage and deferred release at a time when it
would not otherwise be naturally available.
The common source doctrine applles to groundwater and surface waters that are hydrologically
• interconnected, and integrates the relative priorities of the rights without regard to whether the
diversion is from surface or groundwater. (Hudson v. Dailey (1909) 156 Cal. 617.) Another example is the Mojave adjudication, where the court stated "Because these basins are
interconnected, some of the surface in-flow to one basin is out-flow from another. The ground
and surface water within the entire Mojave River Basin constitute-a single interrelated source."
(City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) Decision, at p. 3.) In general, riparian and
overlying users have correlative rights to water naturally occurring in the watershed and are senior in priority to. approprlative users of surface and groundwater. In considering the relative
rights of surface and groundwater right holders, it is important to consider the physical
availability of the water and whether the source would be naturally available to the right holder.
For example, an appropriative user of surface water should only be curtailed to avoid injury to
an overlying groundwater right holder to the extent that the appropriative user Is diverting water is
that would otherwise be available to the overlying user.
F. Salvaged Water
Salvaged water is water native to the basin that, but for its capture by some artificial means, would escape the basin before it could be beneficially used. "Simply stated, salvaged water is water that is saved from waste as when winter floodwaters are dammed and held in a reservoir."
(City of Santa Maria v. Adam (2012) 211 Cal.Appl.4th 266, 304.) Salvaged water belongs to the person who succeeded in its capture and made the water available for use. (Ibid. (citing Pomona etc. Co. v. San Antonio eto. Co. (1908) 152 Cal. 618, 620).) Although salvaged water
is in a sense native to the basin, it is water that iS made available for use only by the efforts of
another, and therefore the rights of riparian and overlying users do not attach. "[T]he priority of
the overlying right does not extend to water made available by the efforts of another. Salvaged
water may be native to the extent it would naturally flow within the stream to which it is released but it is 'foreign in time.' It would not find its way into the Basin absent a reclamation project to divert it, store it, and release it on a schedule to augment natural recharge." (Id. at 304-05 (internal citations omitted).)

28

5.3 Analysis
The parties agree that the appropriative water rights held by the Agency that authorize storage of water in Nacimiento Reservoir are junior in priority to the rights of overlying and riparian users in the Basin. The Agency defends that the water stored in Nacimiento Reseryoir is salvaged water to which overlying and riparian users have no claim. As noted by the Agency, the State Water Board found in issuirig the Agency's water rights that water was available for appropriation and that its diversion would not injure downstream overlying and riparian users. The finding by the State Water Board that unappropriated water is, at times, available is not a finding that unappropriated water is available at all times, in all hydrologic conditions, or in all iS future circumstances. A permit is not a right to divert, but an authorization to divert subject to the prior rights of other users. Pointing to the Board's finding in issuing the permits is therefore
only a beginning and not an end to the inquiry as to whether other more senior users have been
injured.
That said, overlying and riparian users have no right to water that has been rightfully stored by the Agency during those periods when water was available to divert and cannot demand its release. The mere fact that water continued to be held in Nacimiento Reservoir at times when
the demands of overlying and riparian users were not being met is not itself a violation of the
right of prlority, so long as Nacimiento was operated to bypass any inflows to which overlying and rilparian users had a senior claim. We also agree with the Agency's assertion that water released from storage to satisfy the conditions of the Agency's permits to maintain minimum stream flows for fish iS not available for diversion by other users, at least not until the water has
infiltrated into the basin and ceases to be used for instream purposes.

5.4 Findings and Conclusions
The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs: License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624 (Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any
downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin. That basic legal issue is not contested by the parties. The issue about which the parties disagree is whether surplus water was available for diversion by junior right holders in 2014 and 2015 or, if surplus water was not available, whether the reservoirs were operated in such a manner over time to
provide adequate replacement water to effectuate a physical solution. These issues are presented 2 in Phase 2 of this proceeding.

6.0 ISSUE (D) - CONSIDERATION OF WATER USE IN OTHER SUBAREAS

To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying
rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subarea were injured by the Agency's
reservoir operations in 2014 and 2015?

29

In general, the parties do not disagree that water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley
Groundwater Basin must be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in
the Upper Valley and Forebay subarea were injured. The Agency argues, however, that an
adjudication is necessary to determine injury because of the correlative nature of riparian and
overlying rights. It is the State Water Board's recommendation that an adjudication is not necessary to determine, whether an injury occurred, Insofar as the rights of riparian and
overlying users are considered in the aggregate. A determination of whether and the extent to
which particular right holders may have been injured may, however, require a more detalled
analysis of water use in the basin to determine the share of water to which a correlative user is
entitled and the reasonableness of the particular uses and methods of diversion.

6.1 Injury
Injury to a water right is an unreasonable interference with the exercise of the right, whether by interference with physical availability, water quality, method of diversion, or by other types of
harms. Typically, injury occurs from diversion of water by a junior right holder that causes water
to be unavailable to a user with senior priority. In other cases, injury occurs from interference in
the senior user's access to water that causès the senior user to sustain material costs to divert
and use the quantity of water to which the user has a right. Here, the Coalition alleges that its members were injured by lowered groundwater levels caused by the Agency's diversions that
resulted in decreased pumping capacity, increased pumping costs, and reduced water quality.
(Coalition Opening Brief, at p. 36.)

6.1.1 Physical Availability
Interference with the physical availability of water can occur by diversion from a stream system or extraction from a groundwater basin. In a stream, a downstream right holder may be injured
If an upstream right holder diverts water so as to prevent an adequate quantity of water from reaching the downstream point of diversion. If the upstream junior diverter completely dewaters the stream, the injury to downstream users is clearly visible. In other circumstances, water may
continue to flow in the stream, but is not legally available to the downstream injured party because it is subject to the claims of more senior right holders or protected from diversion for instream beneficial uses.
Not. all interference with the exercise of a water right constitutes injury. Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution requires that the state's water resources "be put to beneficial use to
the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or unreasonable use or
unreasonable method of use of water be prevented." A right holder may be required to incur some reasonable expense that will allow another to beneficially use available water. "The mere
inconvenience, or even the matter of extra expense, within limits which are not unreasonable, to
which a prior user may be subjected, will not avail to prevent a subsequent appropriator from utilizing his right.' (Peabody v. Vallejo (1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 376 (quoting Waterford Irr. Dist. V. Turlock Irr. Dist., 50 Cal.App. 213, 221).); see also in the Matter of Application 8884 of the City of Redding to Appropriate Water from the Sacramento River in Shasta County for Municipal Purposes (June 22, 1938) p. 3; Rancho Santa Margarita v. Vall (1938) 11 Cal.2d 501, 561 ("[I]t

30

would be an unreasonable use to require the flow of the surface stream if such cattlé can if reasonably be watered at reasonable expense by some artificial means.").)
A senior right holder is, however, entitled to a remedy if an interference is material and the costs that would be necessary to avoid the harm are unreasonable, "Although the [senior right holder] may be required to make minor changes in its method of appropriation in order to render available water for subsequent appropriators, it cannot be compelled to make major changes or to incur substantial expense." (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhamibra (1940) 33 Cal.2d 908
(quoting City of Lodi v. East Bay Mun. Utility Dist. (1936) 7 Cal.2d 316, 341).) An appropriate remedy could include curtallment of the junior user's diversion, or physical solution that allows
a junior right holder to provide replacement water to the senior user to make up for losses that might otherwise occur due to the junior's use. Physical solutions have been upheld by California courts as within the authority of the court to maximize the beneficial use of water. and avoid "a waste of water which would be entailed if the paramount water right were upheld and protected absolutely." (Governor's Commission to Review California Water Rights Law, Groundwater Rights in California, Background and Issues (1977) at p. 17.)
In a groundwater basin, injury is often more difficult to identify than in a surface stream. • •Overdraft of a basin will lower groundwater levels but generally will not entirely eliminate the supply. Groundwater is still available but may be more costly to extract, may have impaired water quality, or the extractions may cause, over time, significant and unreasonable results in
the basin such as land subsidence, seawater intrusion, or unreasonable impacts to public trust resources or other beneficial uses of surface waters. In Pasadena v. Alhambra, the couit
described the injury to groundwater users from overdraft as not "an immediate disability to
obtain water, but, rather, It consisted of the continual lowering of the level and gradual reducing of the total amount of stored water, the accumulated effect of which, after a period of years; would be to render the supply insufficient to meet the needs of the rightful owners." (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, (1949) 33 Cal.2d at 922; see also Lodi v. East Bay Municipal Utility Dist. (1936) 7 Cal.2d 316, 354-55.)4 "Each taking of water in excess of the safe yield was wrongful and was an injury to the then existing owners of water rights, because the overdraft, from its very beginning, operated progressively to reduce the total available supply."
(Id.)
Extraction of water from a basin that is not in excess of the safe yield of the basin may cause
temporary impacts such as lowered groundwater levels. Changes in groundwater storage in the basin will occur with natural hydrologic cycles. Reasonable fluctuations that do not cause long-
term undesirable impacts are within the variation that may occur within the bounds of the
sustalnable yield of the basin. Conversely, diversion or extraction of water in excess of the safe or sustainable yield of the basin is wrongful and resulting impacts that interfere with the exercise of senior water rights constitutes injury. Therefore, a determination of injury due to extractions
or diversions that result in decreased groundwater levels first requires an estimate of the safe or
sustainable yield of the basin to determine whether the basin was in overdraft.

4 This section does not address injury that may occur from circumscribed impacts to groundwater levels from extractions (i.e., a cone of depression) that may interfere with extractions from nearby wells. This type of injury is not raised in this case,

31

6.1.2 Water Quality
The proprietary interest in-water includes the right to divert and use water of a quantity and quality necessary for the use. An impairment of water quality may infringe upon a water right even if an adequate quantity of water is available. (Joerger v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (1929) 207 Cal. 8 (upholding cause of action for temperature pollution of waters from power generation resulting in water quality not suited for stock or domestic use); Phoenix Water Co. V. Fletcher (1863) 23 Cal. 481 (finding that a right holder is "clearly entitled to protection against acts which materially ... deteriorate [the water's] quality for the uses to which he wishes to apply it.").) Like impairments to the physical access to water, impairments to water quality are judged on the basis of reasonableness and the materiality of the impact. If the avoidance of water quality impacts would require a quantity of water so as to impair the maximum beneficial use of water, courts have hesitated to order upstream junior users to cease their diversions. "But while the common law clearly affords water rights holders relief from pollution, it is debatable whether
such protection included the right to require upstream subsequent appropriators to curtail their use of water solely to permit a sufficient flow to resist natural saltwater intrusion." (United States V. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82; Antioch V. Williams Irr. Dist. (1922) 188 Cal. 451.)

6.1.3 Sustainable Yield and Overdraft
An allegation of injury due to groundwater conditions caused by the overdraft of the basin, or diversion of surface water that otherwise would recharge the basin, generally requires a comparison of the safe or sustainable yield and the volume of annual extractions to determine
whether overdraft is occurring. This type of analysis necessarily includes consideration of uses and users of groundwater in all subareas of the basin that are hydrologically connected to the
common source.

In some instances, the presence of undesirable results can demonstrate a condition of overdraft
without the need for an explicit mass balance calculation. "[O]verdraft can be determined ... by evidence of observed physical conditions in the Basin, such as declining underground water levels, seawater intrusion, declining water quality, or land subsidence over time ...." (Santa Maria Adjudication, Phase 3, at pp. 6-7.) These physical conditions may be sufficient evidence that extractions from the basin are exceeding available supply to a degree that is causing unreasonable impacts. In those instances, a determination of overdraft is possible without
explicitly considering the quantity of extractions from the basin. In the Santa Maria adjudication,
the court rejected the contention that it was "impossible to make any determination of overdraft
for any purpose without the [overlying users] proving the amounts and the reasonableness of
their groundwater pumping, and thus quantifying one portion of the demands in the Basin."
(Santa Maria Adjudication, Phase 4, at p. 8.) Water use throughout the basin will likely still need
to be considered to ascertain whether the observed impacts are significant and unreasonable,
but overlying users do not have the burden of proving up the specific quantity of their rights.
Lowering of groundwater levels alone, over a relatively short period of time, is generally not sufficient evidence to indicate overdraft of the basin. Water levels in a basin that is managed within its sustainable yield would be expected to fluctuate within a reasonable range. "Generally, neither overdraft nor safe yield can be determined by looking at a groundwater basin in a single year but must be determined by evaluating the basin conditions over a sufficient period of time to determine whether pumping rates have or will lead to eventual permanent

32

lowering of the water level in the aquifer and ultimately depletion of the water supply or other
harm." (Antelope Valley, Statement of Decision on Phase Three p. 4 (citing City of Los Angeles
V. City of San Fernando (1975) 14 Cal.3d 199, 278-709.).) For example, in the Santa Marla
Basin adjudication, the court found that although groundwater levels would fall during dry periods, those levels rebounded during wet periods, supporting the conclusion that the basin was not in overdraft. (Santa Maria Adjúdication, Phase 3, at p. 13.)

6.1.4 Priority of Right
If a basin is determined to be in overdraft, a determination of injury and the extent of injury requires consideration of the relative priority of users of water from the common source. In the case of a basin with highly interconnected groundwater and surface water, this analysis will
include both surface and groundwater users.. Such an analysis does not necessarily require a
right-by-right adjudication but can be based on estimates of other users' rights and demands.
For example, the State Water Board routinely considers the relative rights and priorities of other
water users in reviewing new applications for a permit to approprlate water to determine
whether water is available for appropriation and in enforcement actions to determine whether a
partlcular user has diverted water out-of-priority. Both determinations require a general consideration of other users of water and their respective rights, and the courts have consistently confirmed the need to consider water rights priorities in apportioning liability when demands exceed the available supply. (El Dorado Irrigation Dist. V. State Water Resources
Control Bd. (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 937, 961.) Typically, however, resolution of these types of
water rights disputes will not require comprehensive adjudication that includes every user in
the basin. The relative priority of uses can often be considered by category or class; for
example, by considering the rights of overlying users and riparian right holders as a single block
of demand without parsing the relative rights of each user vis-à-vis one another. Whether
certain details of relative priority are or are not relevant will depend on the particular case.

6.2 Analysis of Injury in the Salinas River Basin
The parties agree that water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin must be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and
Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014 and 2015. The disagreement arises not about whether water use in other subareas should be considered, but
how those uses should or must be considered, and to what degree of specificity.
The Agency asserts that because the water rights and water use of other parties in the basin have not been joined in this action, the Coalition's claims of injury are procedurally defective and
should be dismissed. The Agency's rationale is as summarized as follows: (a) riparian and
overlying rights are correlative in nature; (b) due to the interconnected nature of the
groundwater and surface water in the Salinas Valley, it is impossible to determine whether one
group of right holders has been injured without simultaneously determining the nature, priority and extent of other water rights; and (c) a determination of whether coalition members have suffered legally cognizable injury requires consideration of the reasonableness of coalition
members' use and methods of diversion of water during the drought. (Agency Opening Brief, at
pp. 29-35.)

33

We agree that flow in the Salinas River affects recharge in all subareas of the basin and is a common source for users in all of the subareas of the Salinas Basin, Any calculation of the
sustainable yield of the Basin must be evaluated across the entire system that is reliant on this common source. Given, however, certain hydrogeologic differences between the various subbasins in the basin and that each subarea relles on sources of inflows in addition to the
Salinas River, it may be appropriate to also consider the sustainable yield for particular subareas in addition to the sustainable yield of the basin as a whole. (See Antelope Valley Adjudication, Phase 3, at p. 9 ("The Antelope Valley basin is not like a bathtub where lowering
and raising of water levels is equal in all parts of the 'tub.' Therefore, assigning a safe yleld number . may require different numbers for different parts of the aquifer ..").).
We disagree with the Agency only in its assertion that a determination of whether overlying right
holders have been injured necessarily requires a consideration of the reasonableness of
coalition members' uses and methods of diversion. We do not dispute that an analysis of the
degree of injury to a particular right holder would require consideration of the scope of that right, and where correlative rights are involved, this exercise necessarily involves consideration of all
other correlative users in the basin - though, not necessarily an adjudication of all other users'
rights. In addition, determining whether the use of the allegedly injured right holder is itself reasonable requires consideration of "all the needs of those in the particular water field," in light of current conditions. (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1242.) "[What is a reasonable use of water depends on the circumstances of each case, such an inquiry cannot be resolved in vacuo isolated from statewide considerations of transcendent importance. Paramount among these we see the ever-increasing need for the conservation of water in this state, an inescapable reality of life quite apart from its express recognition in the 1928 amendment." (Joslin v. Marin Mun. Water Dist. (1967) 67 Cal.2d 132, 140, fn. omitted.)
In many cases, however, a determination of whether certain categories of right-holders have been injured can be made without reaching the scope and validity of individual rights, Whether any particular plaintiff has been injured will of course depend in part on whether the claimed in
water right is valid, and the degree of injury will depend on the scope of that right. But Insofar as the injured right holders are considered as a class, whether injury has occurred to a class of right-holders can be determined while reserving the details as to the validity of particular rights and the extent of injury.
In Strong v. Baldwin, a case relied upon by the Agency, the plaintiff, defendant, and cross- defendants claimed riparian rights. The court declined to find and decree the relative rights to water of each party given that there were at least nine other riparian users on the stream not
joined as parties to the action. "The extent of the riparian rights of the parties to this action
could not be determined without taking into consideration the rights of these other riparian
proprietors, as to which there was no evidence whatever, and concerning which there could. of
course, be no binding determination in the absence of such owners." (Strong V. Baldwin (1908)
154 Cal. 150, 162.) Our reading of the facts of the case differs from that of the Agency as we
understand the court to have held that all of the parties to the case were riparian owners, the
riparian rights of severed parcels having been preserved. (ld. at 156-58.) The court declined to
adjudicate the proportions of water to which each party was entitled, noting that the amount of
water to which one riparian user is entitled cannot be determined without consideration of the
rights of others. The holding in this case seems only to support the principle that all riparian

34

users must be joined as parties to determine the relative proportions of competing riparian
rights.
This reference proceeding does not require a determination of relative rights amongst individual
riparian and overlying users. Here, the defendant is a junior appropriator, and holds a water
right that is junior in priority to all of the overlying and riparian users in the basin. A
determination of the relative rights of the overlying and riparian users is unnecessary to
determine whether the defendant's diversions injured the rights of overlying and riparian users
as a class. Insofar as the members of the Coalition are in fact overlying or riparian right- holders, all of their priorities of right as relative to those of the Agency are the same. In a procedural ruling granting a motion to quash in the proceeding that resulted in Decision 1642,
the Board's hearing officer ruled that for purposes of determining water availability, It was the amount extracted by overlying landowners in the aggregate not the amount that was extracted
by any individual user that was relevant to the hearing issues. As stated in the Board's final
decision, "[a] determination of whether water is available ... including a determination of whether senior rights are harmed, can be accomplished without adjudicating water rights. (Decision 1642, at pp. 10-11.) The same is true here.
The Agency seems to argue that no claim of injury by a riparian or overlying right-holder may be sustained without the joinder of every other riparian or overlying user in the watershed. This holding would render riparian and overlying rights essentially unenforceable absent a comprehensive adjudication. Although the Agency points to the court's opinion in Sanfa Barbara Channelkeeper v. City of San Buenaventura, (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1176, that case concerned permissive cross-complaints under section 428.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The appellate court allowed the City's cross-complaint because the causes of action arose out of the same
transaction alleged in the initial complaint - diversion of water that allegedly reduced surface
flows in the Ventura River in a manner that was unreasonable and harmed public trust resources. The court did not hold that joinder of all water users in the basin was necessary to sustain the underlying cause of action.
Here, the Agency may, as a defense, point to users in the in basin alleged to be taking water in excess of their rights thereby contributing to overdraft and injury. When seeking a remedy other than a declaration of relative rights, the burden is on the riparian or overlying user claiming injury to prove the quantity of water that they have been using, and that such amount is
necessary for their reasonable beneficial purposes. (Tulare Irr. Dist. v. Lindsay Strathmore Irr.
Dist., 3 Cal.2d 535.) Upon such proof, the burden shifts to the appropriator to demonstrate available surplus. "[WJhen one enters a field of water supply and seeks by appropriation to take water from such supply on the claim that there is more than sufficient for all reasonable beneficial uses by those who have the prior and preferential right, it would seem to comport with the principles of fairness and justice that the appropriator, in whatever way the issue may arise, should have the burden of proving that such excess exists." Peabody v. City of Vallejo, (1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 381.

6.3 Findings and Conclusions
The State Wäter Board finds and concludes that water use in other subareas of the Basin must
be considered to the extent necessary to develop an estimate of the safe or sustainable yield of

35

the basin and to determine whether the basin was in overdraft at the time of the alleged injury,
Given that water users in the basin share a common source, any calculation of the sustainable yield of the Basin must be evaluated across the entire system that is reliant on this common
source. Whether injury has occurred to riparian and overlying users as a class of right-holders
can be determined while reserving the details as to the validity of particular rights and the extent
of injury. An analysis of the degree of injury to a particular right holder would require
consideration of the scope of that right, and where correlative rights are involved, this exercise
necessarily involves consideration, though not necessarily adjudication, of all other correlative
users in the basin. In addition, determining whether the use and method of diversion of the
allegedly injured right holder is itself reasonable requires consideration of other users and
current conditions.

7.0 ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION
Both parties submitted evidence briefing materials on issue (b) of the reference proceeding.
Although issue (b) has been rendered moot by the findings on issue (a), some of the issues
raised in the parties' briefings will likely be relevant to Phase 2 of this proceeding. Therefore,
the State Water Board includes the following discussion not as findings and conclusions but as commentary on certain matters to assist in the development of evidence relevant to Phase 2.

7.1 Agency Reservoir Operations as a Physical Solution
The Agency objects that the Coalition's claims of injury cannot be assessed without considering the long-term, and allegedly beneficial, impacts of reservoir operations on groundwater
conditions in the Basin. "By focusing only on alleged harm resulting from reservoir operations in 2014-15, the Coalition overlooks the average annual benefit that the Agency's reservoir
operations provide to groundwater users in the Upper Valley and Forebay areas." (Agency,. Response Brief. at p. 14.)
Although this Issue is not directly raised in this phase of the proceeding which does not reach
the substantive question of injury, the Board generally agrees with the Agency's observation. Although the Agency's appropriative rights are junior in priority to the rights of overlying users, a technical violation of priority is not a remediable injury if replacement water is provided in adequate quantity and quality so as to avoid harm. Such arrangements may be termed
"physical solutions" or "augmentation plans," where the junior diverter is permitted to take diversions that are technically out of priority so long as replacement water is provided is to avoid Injury to senior users. The Agency claims that operation of the reservoirs over time produced a
net benefit to the basin through capture and storage of salvaged water at times of surplus. This storage might be characterized as a "credit" of stored water in the basin that is available to.
overlying users as replacement water if and when the Agency diverts surface water at a time
that would otherwise be out of priority.

36

The Board encourages the parties to address whether such a physical solution did in fact prevent injury to Coalition members, or, whether a similar type of physical solution could be an
appropriate remedy.

7.1 Numerical -Model Used by Coalition
The Coalition's expert, Tim Durbin, developed a numerical surface water/groundwater model for the Salinas Basin using the FEMFLOW3D modeling program. The application of this modeling program to-the Salinas Valley is referred to as "FFM18" and incorporates information from
Durbin and others (1978), Yates (1988), Montgomery Watson (1997) and information from the
Agency. The information used to construct the FFM18 model was sourced from the cited
reports and additionally from model files provided by the Agency. (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum, Coalition Opening Brief Exhibit 2, at p. 9.)

The discussion among experts during the Modeler's Conference made it clear that the term
"model" as used by the parties and their experts includes distinct components: 1) the modeling program, or source code, 2) the specific application of the source code to simulate a physical
setting, including calibration of aquifer parameters, and 3) the simulation of scenarios based on
the calibrated model application. (Transcripts of Modeler's Conference, January 25, 2018.) The
source code includes the generic mathematical equations that govern three-dimensional
groundwater movement and related physical processes. This source code must then be applied to the specific physical conditions, such as the basin geometry, hydraulic conductivity, and specific storage, of a location. Values that represent certain physical conditions are adjusted
until outputs from a model application match actual conditions through a process called
calibration.

The FFM18 model was calibrated to quarterly observations of groundwater levels at 56 wells
during 1995 through 2015, with 28 wells within the Forebay subarea and 8 wells within the
Upper Valley subarea. (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum, Coalition Opening Brief Exhibit 2, at p. 27.) The model simulations within the calibration process were for 1949 through 2015 and
had one-month time steps for 1950 through 2015. (Ibid.) Mr. Durbin did not rely on the model
application or model source code discussed during the January 25, 2018 Modeler's Conference.
(ld., at pp. 6-8.)
•Mr. Durbin used the model to simulate three scenarios of reservoir operations and their impacts
on groundwater elevations, including: 1) a "baseline" simulation of the reservoir releases as they
actually occurred during 2014 and 2015; 2) a "required-releases" simulation of the
counterfactual had 60 CFS had been released during the period of interest; and 3) a "bypassed- Inflows" simulation of the counterfactual that all inflows to the reservoirs had been bypassed. (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum, Coalition Opening Brief Exhibit 2, at pp. 30-34.)

It is standard scientific practice for a model application to be reviewed before its results are
relied upon. (Reilly and Harbaugh, 2004.) Although reliance on model results were not
necessary to the Board's findings and recommendations in Phase 1 of this reference
proceeding, peer review of the particular application is recommended by the Board to assist in

37

an assessment of the reliability of the model. The review could focus on the FFM18 application
of the FEMFLOW3D modeling program, since FEMFLOW3D has been well-documented and validated. (Exhlbit 2 to Tim Durbin Decl., Coalition's Responding Brief.) Below are specific issues that may warrant further.consideration in model review and an assessment of reliability.
A. Difference Between the Bradley Gage and the Model Domain.
The model may introduce error by assuming no surface water loss along the five-mile river channel between the Bradley gage and the model domain. The Agency's expert witness, Mr.
Daus, claimed that eight surface water diversion locations and other losses between the
southern end of the model domain and the Bradley gage were not accounted for in-Mr. Durbin's model. A total of 3,427 AF were extracted from the eight locations during the period of interest
(May 27, 2014 through June 4, 2015). (Daus Decl., Agency Responding Brief, at pp. 9-10.)
The effects of assuming no surface loss between the Bradley gage and the model domain
would likely be more pronounced when analyzing low flow reservoir releases in 2014 to 2015,
as in Mr. Durbin's "Baseline" and "Required-Release" scenarios. The southern boundary of the model domain was at River Mile 91 and the USGS Bradley gage is located at River Mile 96-97. The end of river flow was between River Mile 77-78 on April 2, 2015, roughly 20 miles downstream of Bradley. (Coalition Opening Brief, Exhibit 47,
"SVWC_Files_20180625/0047_April 2, 2015 ResOp Minutes.pdr".) The Agency data shows that the end of river flow was between River Mile 84-87 during May 28 through July 30, 2015 and July 27, 2016 through October 26, 2016. (Agency Data, Excel File "MCWRA000002.xlsx",
Sheet "4_END_OF_FLOW".)

Given that the total length of river flow was most likely no greater than 20 miles from the USGS
Bradley gage for the irrigation season of 2014 to 2015, stream leakage from the 5-mile section
between the USG$ Bradley gage and model domain is likely important to an accurate
simulation of the recharge processes that occurred over this 20-mile reach.

B. Estimated Changes in Upper Valley Groundwater Elevations.
The difference in modeled water levels in the southern part of the Upper Valley subarea due to releasing 30 is ofs Instead of 60 cfs is comparable to the observed variation of water levels over the period of 1989 through 2017, a period which includes variations in reservoir releases that
are significantly larger than 30 cfs. (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum, Coalition Opening Brief Exhibit 2; Agency Opening Brief Exhibit 43, "MCWRA-043 Historical Reservoir Releases, Elevation and Storage Data (MCWRA001356).xlsx".) The comparison raises a question of whether water levels in this portion of the Basin are insensitive to large increases in reservoir in
releases or whether the model may be overpredicting the water level changes in the southern
part of the Upper Valley.
Mr. Daus evaluated the model calibration and asserted that Mr. Durbin's model overpredicted
groundwater elevation responses during periods when reservoir releases were curtailed düe to
drought (for example 1991 and 2014-2015) at three monitoring wells located at the southern

38

part of the Upper Valley. (Daus Decl., Agency Responding Brief, at pp. 12-13.) The eight
monitoring wells used in Durbin's model calibration for the Upper Valley are located within 1.4 miles of the river channel. The three monitoring wells at the southern part are located within 0.7
mile of the Salinas River, nearer to the river and Nacimiento Reservoir than the other five
monitoring wells used for the Upper Valley.
Mr. Daus argued that the measured groundwater elevations at the three wells did not show
significant impacts from the reduced flows during the period of interest, which was contrary to
Mr. Durbin's "baseline" model results. Recorded groundwater elevations in these three
monitoring wells show fluctuations in physical measurements that were much less than the fluctuations that were simulated by the model. (Daus Decl. Exhibits G-2 through G-4, Agency Responding Brief.) Because the three monitoring wells are located in areas of the Upper Valley where Mr. Durbin's model predicted large changes in groundwater elevations in the "required- releases" counterfactual (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum Figures 3-3(a)-(d), Coalition
Opening Brief) and where the river was likely still flowing during the irrigation season of 2014 to 2015, model calibration for the three monitoring wells is likely important for evaluating modeled impacts. Board staff believe It would be helpful to explore the observed differences between simulated and observed water level elevations in the southern part of the Upper Valley Area
during a model review process.

C. Vertical Hydraulic Conductivity Used for Model

State Water Board staff suggest that the effects of assumptions and calibrations related to
vertical hydraulic conductivity be evaluated. FFM18 was constructed with four layers to
represent the physical system, where the top layer was defined as five percent of the total aquifer thickness. In portions of the Upper Valley where the aquifer thickness is 200 feet for example, the top layer of the model would be 10 feet thick. This was done in order to more
accurately simulate the stream-aquifer interaction.: (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum,
Coalition Opening Brief Exhibit 2, at pp. 15-16.) Vertical hydraulic conductivity, among other
variables, affects the simulation of movement of water between these layers. Mr. Durbin cites his Durbin (1978) modeling study as the basis for selecting 0.1 feet per day as representative of
fine-grained deposits, and that fine-grained deposits compose about 50 percent of the Salinas Basin. • This results in an effective vertical hydraulic conductivity of 0.2 feet/day for the model. This value was in turn used to assume a uniform anisotropy (ratio of horizontal hydraulic conductivity to vertical hydraulic conductivity) of 500 for the entire valley. (ld., at p. 17.)
Board staff noted that anisotropy values after calibration deviated from the pre-calibration value
of 500. (Tim Durbin Technical Memorandum, Coalition Opening Brief, at p. 28.) The calibrated
vertical hydraulic conductivity has a median of 0.10 ft/d and a range of 0.0049 to 0.81 ft/d, while
the corresponding horizontal hydraulic conductivity has a median of 100 ft/d and a range of 1.6 to 480 ft/d. (Ibid.) State Water Board staff recommend the Parties evaluate whether the model is sensitive to values of vertical hydraulic conductivity, particularly in the Forebay and Upper
Valley subareas.

39

7.2 Agency's Estimation of Groundwater Level Response
The Agency claims that the reduction in Nacimiento releases did not have a significant effect on water availability in the Upper Valley and Forebay Subareas and that the overriding factor affecting groundwater and surface water conditions was the extreme severity of the drought.
(Agency Opening Brief, at p. 26.) The Agency calculated the impact of additional flow on
groundwater elevations by averaging the increased elevation across the entire Upper Valley and
Forebay subareas. (Daus Decl., Agency Opening Brief, at pp. 13-14.) The Coalition's expert
responds that stream recharge causès groundwater elevations to slope away from the stream channel instead of being uniform across the valley; therefore, assuming uniform increases throughout the entire subareas cannot provide a complete depiction of the spatially variable changes in groundwater elevations. (Durbin Decl., Coalition Responding Brief, at pp. 9-10.) State Water Board staff agrees with Mr. Durbin that the impact of increased streamflow will vary spatially and should be evaluated as such, rather than assumed to apply uniformly across the
basin.

8.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Issue (a): Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089
(Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("ofs") of water from
Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015.
The State Water Board firds and concludes that the Agency has not violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 in (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532).

Issue (b): If the Board concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 cfs water release
requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River,
whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to the Salinas River Groundwater Basin's ("Basin") Upper Valley and Forebay subareas and, if so, whether that recharge reduction reduced water availability (i.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater
quality) for any riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas.
This issue need only be addressed the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River addressed in issue (a). Because the Board
concludes that the Agency was not in violation of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and
Rearing Habitat, issue (b) is not addressed further.

Issue (c): Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624(Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any downstream riparian and overlying
water rights in the Salinas River and Basin.

40

The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs -- License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624 (Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin. That basic legal issue is not contested by the parties. The issue about which the parties disagree is whether surplus water was available for diversion by junior right holders in 2014 and 2015 or, if surplus water was not available, whether the reservoirs were operated in such a manner over time to
provide adequate replacement water to effectuate a physical solution. These issues are presented in Phase 2 of this proceeding.

Issue (d): To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the in Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in the
Upper Valley and Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014
and 2015.
The State Water Board finds and concludes that water use in other subareas of the Basin must
be considered to the extent necessary to develop an estimate of the safe or sustainable yield of the basin and to determine whether the basin was in overdraft at the time of the alleged injury. Given that water users In the basin share a common source, any calculation of the sustainable
yield of the Basin must be evaluated across the entire system that is reliant on this common
source. .Whether injury has occurred to riparian and overlying users as a class of right-holders can be determined while reserving the details as to the validity of particular rights and the extent of injury. An analysis of the degree of injury to a particular right holder would require consideration of the scope of that right, and where correlative rights are involved; this exercise necessarily involves consideration of all other correlative users in the basin. In addition, determining whether the use and method of diversion of the allegedly injured right holder is Itself reasonable requires consideration of other users in light of current conditions.

RESPONDENTS' AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

I. INTRODUCTION

2 Respondents and defendants Monterey County Water Resources Agency, County of

3 Monterey, and Monterey County Board of Supervisors (collectively "Respondents") respectfully

4 submit these comments on the November 2018 Draft Report of Referee ("Draft Report") prepared

5 by staff of the State Water Resources Control Board ("State Board"). Respondents appreciate the

6 work of State Board staff in preparing the Draft Report. Following is a brief summary of

7 Respondents' comments (issue lettering corresponds to the Draft Report):

8 As to Issue (A), the Draft Report correctly finds and concludes that the Monterey
County Water Resources Agency ("Agency") did not violate the Flow Prescription for Spawning

10 and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River contained in License 7543 (Application 16124) and

11 Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water

12 from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period June 4, 2014 through May 27, 2015.
d'TI INVAE AANMOI 13 As to Issue (B), the Draft Report correctly finds and concludes that this issue need
14 not be addressed in light of the resolution of Issue (A).

15 As to Issue (C), the Draft Report correctly finds and concludes that, with limited

16 exceptions, riparian and overlying water rights are senior in priority to appropriative rights and

17 that salvaged water belongs to the person who succeeded in its capture and made the water

18 available for use. The Draft Report also correctly finds and concludes that an issue about which

19 the parties disagree is whether surplus water was available for diversion by junior right holders in

20 2014 and 2015 or, if surplus water was not available, whether Nacimiento and San Antonio

21 Reservoirs were operated in such a manner over time to provide adequate replacement water to

22 effectuate a physical solution. The Draft Report properly concludes that the latter issues should

23 be addressed in Phase 2 of this proceeding. Respondents request that the discussion of Issue (C)

24 in the Draft Report be modified slightly to make clear that an additional issue that will be

25 addressed in Phase 2 is whether Coalition members suffered a legally cognizable injury to their

26 water rights as a result of the Agency's reservoir operations. As the Draft Report correctly states,

27 injury to a water right is an unreasonable interference with the exercise of the right. It has been

28 and remains the position of Respondents that (i) Coalition members suffered no unreasonable

2 1540957.1

RESPONDENTS' AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

1

2 interference with the exercise of their claimed water rights; (ii) the Coalition has grossly inflated

3 the amount of natural inflow to Nacimiento Reservoir that was not released by the Agency during

4 the winters of 2014 and 2015, and (iii) the Coalition's groundwater model grossly over-predicts
the decline of groundwater levels (if any) that occurred in 2014-2015 as a result of the Agency's

6 reservoir operations. The Draft Report should identify the latter issues as within the scope of

Phase 2.

8 As to Issue (D), the Draft Report correctly finds and concludes that an analysis of

9 the degree of injury to a particular water right holder would require consideration of the scope of

10 that right and, where correlative rights are involved, this exercise involves consideration though

11 not necessarily adjudication, of all the correlative users in the Basin. The Draft Report also

12
LLP correctly finds and concludes that determining whether the use and method of diversion of an

13 allegedly injured water right holder is reasonable requires consideration of other water users in

DOWNEY BRAI 14 the Basin and current conditions. As discussed in detail below, Respondents request that the

15 Draft Report be modified to more accurately reflect the Respondents' position regarding the

16 procedurally defective nature of the Coalition's water right claims.

17 As to other matters, the Draft Report correctly states that reliance on model results

18 was not necessary to the State Board's findings and recommendations in Phase 1 of this reference

19 proceeding. Nonetheless, Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Draft Report contain a discussion

20 (characterized as "commentary") of the numerical model used by the Coalition, and related

21 technical issues. (Note: the numbering of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Draft Report are out of

22 sequence.) It has been and remains Respondents' position that the Coalition's model is unreliable

23 and that the expert opinion testimony of Mr. Durbin that is based on that model is entitled to no

24 evidentiary weight in this proceeding. Although Respondents agree with many of the comments

25 regarding the deficiencies of the Coalition's model set forth in Section 7.2 of the Draft Report,

26 Respondents believe that a discussion of the reliability of the model is premature at this juncture.

27 The issue of model reliability should be reserved to 2 Phase 2 so that the parties can present

28 additional expert testimony regarding that issue. Accordingly, Respondents request that Sections
7.2 and 7.3 be deleted from the Draft Report on the ground that they are premature.

1540957.1 3
RESPONDENTS'. AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

t
3 II. COMMENTS

A. Issue (A) - Compliance with the Flow Prescription Permit Term
The Draft Report finds and concludes that the Agency did not violate the Flow

o Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimento River ("Flow Prescription")

7 contained in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by

8 releasing less than 60 cfs of water from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period June 4, 2014

9 through May 27, 2015. (Draft Report, p. 23). This finding is based on the "plain meaning" of the

10 Flow Prescription. Specifically, the Draft Report finds and concludes that the Flow Prescription

11 only requires releases beginning on the eighth day after the first adult steelhead passage day. The

12 first passage day is the first day in a period of 5 consecutive days with the mean daily flow of 260
dTT ONVNI AENMOG 13 cfs or higher at USGS gage No. 11152300. The Flow Prescription only requires releases

14 beginning on the eighth day after the first adult steelhead passage day, and this condition

15 precedent did not occur in 2014 or 2015. (Draft Report, p. 19.)

16 Respondents accept the State Board's analysis and conclusions regarding Issue (A). Since

17 Issue (A) involves the interpretation of terms and conditions of an appropriative water right

18 license and permit issued by the State Board, the State Board's interpretation of such terms and

19 conditions is entitled to deference. Respondents reserve all arguments previously presented in

20 this reference proceeding regarding Issue (A). (E.g., County Opening Brief, pp. 23-24.)

21 B. Issue (B) - Effects of Compliance with Flow Prescription Term

22 The Draft Report finds and concludes that Issue (B) need not be addressed in light of the

23 conclusion that the Agency was not in violation of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and
24 Rearing Habitat. (Draft Report, p. 23.) Respondents concur with this finding and conclusion.

25 C. Issue (C) - Priorities of Agency Water Rights

26 The Draft Report finds and concludes that, with limited exceptions, riparian and overlying

27 water rights are senior in priority to appropriative rights and that salvaged water belongs to the

28 person who succeeded in its capture and made the water available for use. (Draft Report, p. 28.) p.

4 1540957.1

RESPONDENTS' AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

1 The Draft Report further finds and concludes that an issue about which the parties disagree is

2 whether surplus water was available for diversion by junior right holders in 2014 and 2015 or, if

3 surplus water was not available, whether the reservoirs were operated in such a manner over time
tn to provide adequate replacement water to effectuate a physical solution, and that the latter issues
should be addressed in Phase 2 of this reference proceeding. Respondents concur with these

6 findings and conclusions.
Respondents request that the discussion of Issue (C) in the Draft Report be modified to

8 make clear that an additional issue that will be addressed in Phase 2--and that is interrelated with

9 Issue (C)--is whether Coalition members suffered a legally cognizable injury to their water rights

10 as a result of the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014-2015. As the Draft Report correctly
11 points out, injury to a water right is an unreasonable interference with the exercise of the right.

12 (Draft Report, p. 30.) It has been and remains the position of Respondents that Coalition
dTI ANVAA AANMOG 13 members suffered no unreasonable interference with the exercise of their claimed water rights as
14 a result of the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014-2015 and that the Coalition has grossly

15 inflated the amount of natural inflow to Nacimiento Reservoir that was not released by the
16 Agency during the winters of 2014 and 2015. (See Declaration of Anthony Daus in Support of

17 Brief in Response to Petitioner/Plaintiff's Phase 1 Opening Brief, paragraphs 3-5.) Further it is

18 Respondents' position that the Coalition's groundwater model grossly over-predicts the decline of

19 groundwater levels a (if any) that occurred as a result of the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014-
20 2015. The Draft Report should be modified to state that these factual issues will be addressed in

21 Phase 2 as part of the State Board's analysis of the validity of the Coalition's claim of injury to its

22 members' water rights.

23 D. Issue (D) - Consideration of Water Use in Other Subareas
24 The Draft Report finds and concludes that an analysis of the degree of injury to a

25 particular right holder would require consideration of the scope of that right and, where

26 correlative rights are involved, this exercise involves consideration though not necessarily

27 adjudication, of all the correlative users in the Basin. (Draft Report, p. 36.) The Draft Report

28 also finds and concludes that determining whether the use and method of diversion of an
5 1540957,1

RESPONDENTS' AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

allegedly injured water right holder is reasonable requires consideration of other water users in

2 the Basin and current conditions. (Id.) Finally, the Draft Report finds and concludes that "water

3 use in other subareas of the Basin must be considered to the extent necessary to develop an
estimate of the safe or sustainable yield of the basin and to determine whether the basin was in
overdraft at the time of the alleged injury. Given that water users in the basin share a common
source, any calculation of the sustainable yield of the Basin must be evaluated across the entire

7 system that is reliant on this common source." (Draft Report, pp. 35-36.)

8 Respondents generally concur with the findings and conclusions described in the

9 preceding paragraph. In order to properly evaluate the Coalition's claim of injury, Phase 2 will

10 a require a comprehensive factual analysis of the sustainable yield of the Basin evaluated across the
11 entire system that is reliant on the common source of supply.
12 The Draft Report contains the following statement: "The Agency argues, however, that an
dTI (INVæE AENMOI 13 adjudication is necessary to determine injury because of the correlative nature of riparian and

14 overlying rights." (Draft Report, p. 30.) This statement is inaccurate. It has been and remains

15 Respondents' position that the Coalition's water right claims are procedurally defective because
16 they implicate (and will prejudicially affect) the rights of other water users in the Basin who are

17 not parties to this proceeding. Taking the position that a litigant's claims are procedurally

18 defective is not the same as taking the position that "an adjudication is necessary." Indeed,

19 Respondents have consistently stated that they have no interest in adjudicating the water rights of

20 the Basin or the Salinas River. (E.g., Respondents' Opening Brief in Reference Proceeding, p. 4,

21 lines 29-28.) Respondents do however reserve the right to vigorously pursue dismissal of the

22 Coalition's water right claims in the Monterey County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil

23 Procedure section 389 and other applicable law. Specifically, water users in the Basin that are not

24 parties to this proceeding will be prejudiced by a determination by the Monterey County Superior

25 Court of the safe or sustainable yield of the Basin because such determination will impose a
26 numerical limit on the total common water supply available for use. Similarly, a determination
27 by the Court on the issue of overdraft could implicate prescriptive rights.

28 The question of whether the Coalition's water right claims are procedurally defective is a
6 1540957.1

RESPONDENTS' AND DEFENDANTS' COMMENTS AND OBJECTIONS TO DRAFT REPORT OF REFEREE

1 question of civil procedure, not water rights law. The latter question is beyond the scope of the

2 State Board's expertise and the Court's reference orders. Issue D seeks the State Board's input as

3 to whether "water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin [must] be
A considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley or Forebay
n subarea were injured by the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014 and 2015." Issue (D) does not

6 seek the State Board's input on issues of joinder, the indispensability of parties or other matters of

7 civil procedure. Accordingly, the statement in the Draft Report that the Agency argues that "an

8 adjudication is necessary" should be deleted and the Draft Report should be modified to

9 accurately reflect Respondents' position on the procedural issues discussed above. All discussion

10 of joinder and related procedural issues should be deleted from the Draft Report.

11 E. Additional Matters

12 The Draft Report states that reliance on model results was not necessary to the State
d'TI ANVIA AANMOC 13 Board's findings and 1 recommendations in Phase 1 of this reference proceeding. (Draft Report, p.

14 37.) Nonetheless, Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Draft Report contain a discussion (characterized as

15 "commentary") of the numerical model used by the Coalition in this proceeding as well as other

16 technical issues. (Note: the numbering of Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Draft Report is out of

17 sequence.) It has been and remains the Respondents' position that the Coalition's model is

18 unreliable and that the expert opinion testimony of Mr. Durbin that is based on that model is

19 entitled to no evidentiary weight in this proceeding. Although Respondents agree with many of

20 the comments regarding the Coalition's model contained in Section 7.2 of the Draft Report,
21 Respondents believe that a discussion of the adequacy of the Coalition's model is premature at
22 this juncture; issues involving the adequacy of the model should be reserved to Phase 2 so that the

23 parties may present additional evidence regarding the adequacy (or lack thereof) of the model.

24 Accordingly, Respondents request that Sections 7.2 and 7.3 be deleted from the Draft Report.

25 III. CONCLUSION

26 Respondents respectfully request that the Draft Report be modified as described in these

27 Comments.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Procedural Background
The Salinas Valley Water Coalition (Coalition or Plaintiff) initiated the action giving rise to this
report on January 13, 2017, by filing Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief against the defendant Monterey County Water
Resources Agency (Agency, Defendant, or MCWRA) in the Monterey County Superior Court.
The Coalition is a nion-profit corporation formed to represent the interests of its members in
protecting the members' water rights and furthering the sustainable management of water
resöurces in that portion of the Salinas Valley that lies within Monterey County. (Second Writ of
Mandate, 006322.) The Coalition states that its members Include individual and business
entities that own, lease, or otherwise control real property, including riparian and overlying rights
to water, in the Monterey County portion of the Salinas Valley. (Ibid.) On May 23, 2017, the
Coalition flled a Verified Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief (Complaint), which is the operative complaint as of the
drafting of this report.

The Complaint alleges twelve causes of action, of which the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth
allege violations by the Agency of the terms of its water rights or injury to water rights held by Coalition members. The remaining causes of action allege violations by the Agency of
Proposition 218 (Cal. Const., art. XIII D) and the Public Records Act (Gov. Code, § 6250 et
seq.).

On August 1, 2017, the Monterey County Superior Court entered an Order of Reference to the
State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board or Board) pursuant to Water Code
section 2000 et seq. to investigate and report upon the Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Twelfth Causes of
Action. The court directed the parties to stipulate to the issues of fact and law that the Board
would report on in connection with the reference. On September 8, 2017, the court issued a
subsequent order specifying the issues for reference to the Board and directing the State Water
Board to investigate and report upon as many of the issues as it reasonably can by August 1,
2018, but at least items 3(a)-(d) which the court defined as Phase I of the reference proceeding.
At the request of the parties and the State Water Board, the court later amended the deadline to
require submission of the final report on Phase l by February 1, 2019.

1

1.2 Reference Issues
Items 3(a)-(d) as listed in the court's order of September 8, 2017, are addressed in this report:

a. Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing
Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089
(Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from
Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015;

b. If the Board concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 cfs water release
requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the
Nacimiento River, whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have
been provided to the Salinas River Groundwater Basin's ("Basin") Upper Valley and
Forebay subareas and, if so, whether that recharge reduction reduced water availability
(i.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater quality) for any riparian and overlying
rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas;

C. Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio
reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624 (Application 16761) and
Permit 21089 (Application 30532) are junior in priority to any downstream riparian and
overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin;

d. To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley
Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparlan and overlying rights in
the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir
operations in. 2014 and 2015.

1.3 State Water Board Process
Water Code section 2000 et seq. authorizes a court to order a reference to the Board, as
referee, when a suit involves a determination of rights to water. The reference may be for any
or all issues involved in the suit (Id., 2000.) or for investigation of and report upon any or all of
the physical facts involved (Id., § 2001.). The Board may base Its report solely upon its own
investigations or may hold hearings and take testimony. (Id., § 2010.)

2

Following the September 8, 2017 order from the court specifying issues for reference to the
Board, the Board specified the reference team, communication protocols, and process for
presentation of evidence and arguments by the parties and preparation of the report by the
Board. (Letter from State Water Board to All Parties, October 5, 2017, 012591-012593.) Given
the relatively short period in which to conduct the reference proceeding, the process was styled
as a "paper hearing," in which both parties prepared and submitted legal briefs, technical
analyses, and supporting evidence to the Board in writing. Parties had the opportunity to review
and respond to information submitted by the opposing party in responding briefs.

1.3.1 Discovery

The Coalition sought to obtain information and documents from the Agency, including files
related to computer modeling work performed for the Agency under contract by RMC, A
Woodard and Curren Company (RMC); and Luhdorff and Scalmanini Consulting Engineers.
(Notice of Amended Ex Parte Application, November 14, 2017, 012949.) The Coalition
requested that initial briefs be due no sooner than 45 days after receipt of all of the requested
information and documents. (ld., 012951.) After attempting to meet with the former contractors
of the Agency, the Coalition filed an ex parte application to lift the stay in the court proceeding
for the limited purpose of allowing the issuance of deposition subpoenas to obtain the requested
evidence. (Plaintiff's Ex Parte Application, November 8, 2017, 012860.) The Agency opposed
lifting the litigation stay, citing, among other reasons, the authority of the State Water Board to
issue administrative subpoenas for purposes of obtaining testimony and evidence. (Defendants'
Opposition to Ex Parte Application, November 14, 2017, 012929.) The court denied the
Coalition's application and the Coalition subsequently served deposition subpoenas pursuant to
Water Code section 1100. (Deposition Subpoenas and Deposition Notices, December 8, 2017,
013095-013136.)

In lieu of depositions, the Board invited the subpoenaed witnesses to participate in a Modeler's
Conference held on January 25, 2018, to explore the characteristics of the various groundwater
models relied upon by the Agency in support of its planning and public works projects and to
identify the relevant computer files necessary to operate the model. (Letter from State Water
Board to All Parties, December 21, 2017, 012605-012606.) The witnesses' attendance and
participation in the Modeler's Conference was deemed to satisfy all obligations under the
subpoenas. (Letter from State Water Board to All Parties, January 24, 2018, 012622.) The
experts' statements and testimony at the conference were made under oath. (Modeler's
Conference Transcript, January 25, 2018, 014603-014604.) After the Modeler's Conference,

3

the Coalition requested additional information from one of the Agency's former consultants, Mr.
Taghavi, about computer files used to operate the preferred model identified during the
Modeler's Conference. (Email from Eric Robinson, March 15, 2018, 013653.) Following some
delays in scheduling a discussion with Mr. Taghavi, a meeting between the parties and Mr.
Taghavi was held on April 23, 2018. (Decl. of Eric Robinson in Support of Opening Brief, June
7, 2018, 005580.)

1.3.2 Briefs and Procedural Motions

The Board established a final briefing schedüle of June 7, 2018, for submission of opening
briefs and July 9, 2018, for submission of responsive briefs. (Letter from State Water Board to
All Parties, April 26, 2018, 012626.) The parties submitted timely opening briefs and responses
in accordance with the Board's schedule.

Both parties submitted several procedural motions objecting to evidence and argument
submitted by the other party, On July 9, 2018, the Coalition filed an objection to the Declaration
of Anthony Daus filed by the Agency In support of its Opening Brief (First Daus Declaration,
June 7, 2017, 000044-000103) and an objection to the Declaration of Anne Williams filed by the
Agency in support of its Opening Brief (Williams Declaration, June 7, 2017, 000104-000132.).
(Objections to Daus Decl., July 9, 2018, 009580-009584; Objections to Williams Decl., July 9,
2018, 009585-009589.) On July 17, 2018, the Agency filed a motion to strike and objections to
the Declaration of John Romans (July 6, 2018, 009543-009550), the Declaration of Steven
Mcintyre (July 5, 2018, 009551-009579), the Declaration of Jerry J. Rava II (July 9, 2018,
009531-009542), and the Declaration of Allan Panziera (July 6,.2018, 009367-009372)
(collectively Coalition Declarations) and the Declaration of Curtis V. Weeks (Weeks Declaration).
(July 6, 2018, 009451-009467), submitted by the Coalition in support of its Phase 1 Response
Brief, as improper new evidence and lacking foundation. (Agency's Motion to Strike &
Objections to Evidence, July 17, 2018, 011000-011016.) The Coalition responded on August
24, 2018. (Coalition's Response to Agency's Motion to Strike & Objections to Evidence,
011050-011063.)

Also on August 24, 2018, the Coalition submitted objections and a motion to strike the July 9,
2018 Declaration of Anthony Daus filed by the Agency in support of its Response Brief (Second
Daus Declaration, 005415-005458) (Coalition's Objections and Motion to Strike Daus & Williams
Decl., 011022-011040); reiterated its objections to the First Daus Declaration (ld., 011026-
011027); reiterated its objections to the Williams Declaration (ld., 011027-011028); and moved

to strike those portions of the Agency's June 7, 2018 Opening Brief and July 9, 2018 Brief in
Response that relied upon the objectionable declarations. (Coalition's Objections and Motion to
Strike Improper Arguments and Evidence, 011041-011049.) In support of its motion, the
Coalition submitted an additional declaration by Mr. Durbin, dated August 16, 2018. (Third
Durbin Decl., 011064-011199.) The Agency responded by letter dated August 30, 2018,
objecting to the August 24, 2018 submittals by the Coalition as untimely and inappropriate.
(012629-012633.) The Coalition responded to the Agency's letter on September 5, 2018.
(012634-012637.)

On September 28, 2018, the Agency submitted a consolidated response to the Coalition's
objections, motion to strike, and the August 16, 2018 declaration of Mr. Durbin and related
exhibits. (Agency's Response to Objections and Motions to Strike, September 28, 2018,
011200-011265) On October 11, 2018, the Coalition filed another response supporting its
August 24, 2018 submittals. (011266-011280.) The Board addressed outstanding procedural
a motions in a ruling letter dated December 28, 2018 (December 28, 2018 Ruling). (011281-
011290.)

On November 16, 2018, the State Water Board announced its report in the form of a draft
(hereafter Draft Report) pursuant to Water Code section 2013. (011362-011415.) The Board e-
mailed notice of the draft, together with a copy of the Draft Report, to the attorneys for the
parties. (Wat. Code, § 2014.) The Board allowed the parties until December 21, 2018, to file
comments or objections to the Draft Report. Both the Agency and the Coalition filed timely
comments and objections. The comments and objections of the parties have been considered
by the Board and are addressed in this report.
Both parties submitted additional motions and objections to the Board on January 15, 2019.
The Coalltion flled a response to the December 28, 2018 Ruling that included substantive
arguments about the Phase 1 issues and objections to the Board's December 28, 2018 Ruling.
(011329-011355.) The Agency filed an objection to the Board's December 28, 2018 Ruling
(011322-011328) and a motion to strike and objections to comments, objections, and supporting
evidence filed by the Coalition in response to the Draft Report (011291-011321). The Board
addressed the filings in a ruling on January 22, 2019. (January 22, 2018, Ruling, 011356-
011361.)

2:0 BACKGROUND

2.1 Physical Setting
The a Salinas Valley is a northwest-southeast trending alluvial valley extending 90 miles from
Monterey Bay to the San Ardo oil field. The lateral extent of alluvium thins toward the southeast
narrowing to the width of the riparian zone of the Salinas River. The valley sits within the
California Coast Ranges geomorphic province between the San Joaquin Valley and the Pacific
Ocean. The Sierra de Salinas and Santa Lucia. Mountains bound the valley to the west and the
Diablo Range and Gabilan Range bound the valley to the east. The Salinas River drains the
valley flowing south to north.

The Salinas River runs approximately 175 miles from the La Panza Range in San Luis Obispo
County to the Monterey Bay. The Salinas River watershed drains approximately 4,600 square
miles. (Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board Salinas River Watershed
Management Action Pian, 1999, 009845.) The Salinas River's main tributaries from south to
north are: Estrella, Nacimiento, San Antonio, and Arroyo Seco Rivers. Nacimiento and San
Antonio reservoirs are located on the Nacimiento and San Antonio tributaries of the Salinas
River. (Exhibit 1.)

The Salinas Valley has a Mediterranean climate. The rainy season, in which approximately 87
percent of precipitation occurs, generally begins in November and ends in April. (Agency
Groundwater Management Plan, 2006, 010516.) Summer months have typically little to no
precipitation. (lbid.) Precipitation falls as rain in the surrounding mountain ranges with less
annual precipitation reaching the valley floor. (Ibid.) Orographic lift produces rain In the Gabilan
and Santa Lucia ranges receiving mean annual precipitation of 20 to 25 inches, respectively.
(Ibid.) The valley floor annually receives an average of 10 to 15 inches of rain. (lbid.) Dry,
drought like conditions are not uncommon in the valley with extended drought occurring in late
1980s to early 1990s and from 2012 to 2017. (Brown and Caldwell Report, 2015, 010718.)

Agriculture and range land dominate the land use in the valley. (Agency Groundwater
Management Plan, 2006, 010516-010517.) Irrigated acreage within the Salinas Valley
increased steadily in the 1940s through 1950s and rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s. Total
irrigated acreage has remained relatively constant since the 1980s. (Brown and Caldwell
Report, 2015, 010682.) Since the 1980s, development and water use has increased in urban
centers such as Castroville, Gonzales, Greenfield, King City, Salinas, and Marina. Other types
of land use in the valley include natural riparian zones, oil production, and shrub and forested
uplands. (lbid.)

Groundwater is the primary water source in the Salinas Valley providing nearly all of the water
for agricultural and municipal use (agriculture represents approximately 90 percent of water
consumption). (Brown and Caldwell Report, 2015, 010660.) However, surface water is still a
significant portion of the Salinas Valley's water portfolio, mainly in the northern and Arroyo Seco
management areas. There are three sources of surface water supply to the Salinas Valley that
are diverted for direct use: (1) a small amount of a surface water is diverted from the Arroyo Seco
for agricultural uses; (2) recycled urban wastewater is treated and applied to agricultural land
under the Castroville Seawater. Intrusion Program (CSIP); and (3) the Salinas River. Diversion
Facility diverts surface water from the Salinas River north of Marina and distributes it to the
CSIP system. (Ibid., 010681-010682.)

Agricultural pumping represents more than 90 percent of total groundwater extractions in the
Salinas Valley. (Agency 2015 Groundwater Extraction Summary Report, 2017, 010890.) Total
agricultural pumping has remained relatively stable over the last two decadés across wet and
dry years. (Brown and Caldwell Report, 2015, 010682.) For example, in the very wet year of
1995 the total agricultural pumping was 462,628 acre-feet, and in the drought year of 2015, the
total agricultural pumping was 478, 113 acre-feet. (Agency Groundwater Extraction Summaries,
009822, 010890.) A summary of 2015 and 1995 groundwater extractions by subarea and type
of use is provided below in Tables 1 and 2.

2.2 Hydrogeology
The Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin (Salinas Valley Basin or Basin) is the largest
groundwater basin in California's Central Coast. (Agency Groundwater Management Plan,
2006, 010516.) Reports prepared by the Agency divide the portion of Salinas Valley Basin
within Monterey County into five management areas or subareas, as depicted in Exhibit 2:
Upper Valley Area, Arróyo Seco Area, Forebay Area, East Side Area, and Pressure Area. (ld.,
010519, 010521.) The Coalition refers to the Arroyo Seco Area and the Forebay Area
collectively as the Forebay Area. (Durbin Technical Memorandum in Support of Coalitión
Opening Brief, 006159.) The "Forebay Area" as used in this report includes the Agency's
Forebay Area and Arroyo Seco Area, described below in section 2.2.2. (Figure 1.2 of First
Durbin Decl., 006190.)

The Basin is physically complex, containing multiple faults that influence the shape and
topography of the valley. The faults and the development of the mountain ranges that bound
the valley are important geological phenomenon affecting the hydrologic system. There are
multiple distinct layers of sediment in the Basin which sit on top of a granite basement rock.
The primary water-bearing layers are the Paso Robles Formation, the Aromas Sand, and recent
alluvium. (Agency Groundwater Management Plan, 2006, 010525-010526.)
In the southern portion of the valley (i.e. the Upper Valley and Forebay Subareas, which is the
region in which the plaintiffs are located) the aquifers are mostly unconfined whereas confining

8

units are present in the norther portion of the basin. Below are excerpts from the Agency's
Groundwater Management Plan that describe the five main groundwater subareas in detail,
presented from south to north. (Agency Groundwater Management Pian, 2006, 010531-010534
[internal citations omitted].)

2.2.1 Upper Valley Area
The Upper Valley Area extends from approximately three miles south of Greenfield to about six miles south of the town of San Ardo. The primary aquifer in this area is unconfined and generally considered a single unit. This aquifer consists of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated and interbedded gravel, sand, and silt of the Paso Robles Formation, alluvial fan, and river deposits. Deposits west of the Salinas River tend to be coarser grained than those to the east. These deposits represent the lateral equivalents of the 180-Foot and 400-Foot Aquifers found in the lower Salinas Valley (Pressure and East Side Areas). However, no aquitard comparable to those separating the aquifers in those areas exists in the sedimentary sequence of the Upper Valley Area. The Deep Aquifer is not present in the Upper Valley Area due to the southward shallowing of the basement complex. Specific capacities for wells completed in the Upper Valley Area are reported to be on the order of 150 gal/min/ft.

2.2.2 Arroyo Seco Area
The Arroyo Seco Area encompasses approximately 22,000 acres on the west side of the Salinas Valley between Mission Soledad and the bluff line about two miles south of Greenfield. This area is the alluvial fan of the Arroyo Seco, and adjoins the Forebay Area on the north and east and the Upper Valley Area on the south. The principal source of replenishment for the Arroyo Seco Area is the percolation from the channels of the Arroyo Seco and its tributary Reliz Creek. The primary water-bearing units of the Arroyo Seco Area consist of alluvial fill with a predominant heavy strata of boulders and coarse gravels to depths of 500 to 700 feet. Moderate layers of coarse sand and reddish yellow clay are also found within the fill.

2.2.3 Forebay Area
The Forebay Area is located in the center of the Salinas Valley and extends from the town of Gonzales in the north to approximately three miles south of Greenfield. The primary water-bearing units in the Forebay Area are the same (stratigraphically-equivalent layers) as those found in the Pressure and East Side Areas; however, the near-surface confining unit and Salinas Valley Aquitard (SVA) do not extend into the Forebay Area. Groundwater in this area is unconfined and occurs in lenses of sand and gravel that are interbedded with massive units of finer grained
material. The deep or 900-Foot Aquifer found in the Pressure and East Side Areas is
also present in the Forebay Area. This deeper aquifer consists of alternating layers of sand-gravel mixtures and clays rather than a distinct aquifer and aquitard. Specific capacities for wells in the Forebay Area have been reported to be on the order of 100 gal/min/ft. The Forebay Area is so named as it is the primary zone for recharge of the Pressure and East Side Areas of the Salinas Valley. Groundwater Basin. This occurs

9

primarily due to the pinching out of the SVA at the southern end of the Pressure and East Side Areas and the northern end of the Forebay Area. The principal sources of groundwater replenishment in the Forebay Area are percolation from the Salinas River (and its tributaries) and groundwater outflow from the Upper Valley Area and the Arroyo Seco Area.

2.2.4 East Side Aquifer
The East Side Aquifer is located in the northeast portion of the Salinas Valley from approximately Santa Rita to Gonzales, east of the Pressure Area. This area is generally bounded by the foothills of the Gabilan Range on the northeast and State Highway 101 on the southwest. Hydrogeologically, this area is characterized by a series of connected alluvial fans that are built up by small streams draining the Gabilan Range, creating a sloping, fän-shaped topography that is visible today... Specific capacities of wells completed in the East Side Area have been reported to be on the order of 26 gal/min/ft.

2.2.5 Pressure Area
The Pressure Area is located in the northern part of the Salinas Valley, west of the East Side Aquifer, This subarea consists of three aquifers, and the area itself is sometimes referred to by the names of these aquifers: the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer, the Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer, and the Deep Aquifer (also'referred to as the 900-Foot Aquifer). Shallow groundwater in the Pressure Area is typically found perched on top or located within the [Salinas Valley Aquitard] (SVA), ä blue or yellow sandy clay formation overlying and confining the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer....
Consisting predominantly of sand and gravel depositions with subordinate sand/clay and gravel/clay components, the shape of the sand bodies of the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer appear to reflect their fluvial deposition origin - lenticular shape sand in what appears to be a fluvial channel migrating and shifting over time. The depth and thickness of the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is variable, but generally the top is encountered at about - 100 feet msl, increasing in depth slightly from southeast near Salinas to the northwest near the ocean. Individual sand bodies are typically 100 to 150 feet thick, although they range in thickness from less than 50 feet to greater than
200 feet where the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer and the Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer appear to be in contact.
The Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is recharged where SVA pinches out (e.g. Forebay Area) and is exposed on the floor of the Monterey Bay, Generally consisting of hydraulically-connected sand and gravel beds with intervening clay layers, the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is sometimes separated into the Lower 180-Foot Aquifer, which is considered confined under the SVA, and the Upper 180-Foot Aquifer which is also called the uppermost-perched zone or Shallow Groundwater Aquifer and is unconfined.
Underlying the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer is the 180/400-Foot Aquitard. This aquitard separates the Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer and consists of clay or clay and sands layers. The aquitard is widespread in the Salinas Valley basin and varies in thickness and quality from thick layers of blue clay to thin

10

layers of brown clay. The aquitard is rarely as much as 200 to 250 feet thick and more commonly 50 to 100 feet thick. [There are] two "holes" in the aquitard, one under the Salinas River •near Blanco and the other under the old Salinas River bed near the coast. The Pressure 180-Foot Aquifer and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer also appear to be interconnected in places between Salinas and Chualar and south of Chualar....
The Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer underlies the 180/400-Foot Aquitard and is an extensive layer of coarse- and fine-grained sand and gravel typically encountered between 270 and 470 feet bgs [below ground -surface). The top of the aquifer is typically encountered at 300 to 350 feet below msl, however the depth of the top of the aquifer, thickness of the aquifer and degree of complex interbedding with clay layers is quite variable with more variability in depth, thickness and discontinuity from the southeast to the northwest (i.e. in the downstream direction).....
The term Deep Aquifer is typically used to describe the 800-Foot Aquifer, 900- Foot Aquifer, 1,000-Foot Aquifer, and the 1,500-Foot Aquifers. The Deep Aquifer and Pressure 400-Foot Aquifer are separated by an aquitard that can be several hundred feet thick. Historically, the Deep Aquifer has not been utilized as a groundwater production zone.

2.3 Recharge of the Salinas Valley Basin
The Salinas River is the primary source of recharge to the Salinas Valley Basin as a whole.
(Yates Report, 1988, 009738.) Infiltration from the channel of the Salinas River is the principal
source of groundwater recharge for the Basin and directly recharges the Pressure, Forebay,
and Upper Valley Areas, while indirectly recharging the East Side Area by the movement of
water across the area boundaries. (Durbin Report, 1978, 009602.) With the exception of
recharge resulting from irrigation return water, the Sallnas River supplies approximately 50
percent of recharge to the basin while tributaries to the Salinas River account for approximately
30 percent of recharge to the basin. (Durbin Report, 1978, 009601-009602.) Groundwater
replenishment for subareas also occurs through movement of groundwater through the
subsurface among the subareas of the basin. (Yates Report, 1988, 005787.)
The stream recharge rate (e.g. acre-feet of recharge per year for a section of stream) is
proportional to the hydraulic head gradient between stream water and groundwater.
(Adjudicating Groundwater: A Judge's Guide to Understanding Groundwater and Modeling,
Dividing the Waters, The National Judicial College (2018), at p. 31.) Groundwater extraction
can increase stream recharge rates by lowering the water table and increasing the hydraulic
gradient between surface water and groundwater. This increased amount of recharge is called
pumping-induced increased recharge, in comparison to the natural recharge that would occur
without well pumping. (Bouwer and Maddock Article, 1997, 009834; Zhou Article, 2009, -
010614-010617.)

11

In the Upper Valley, groundwater wells are mainly located along the Salinas River. (Agency
2015 Groundwater Extraction Summary Report, 2017, 010895.) In the Forebay subarea,
groundwater wells are located along the Salinas River and Arroyo Seco but also distributed
throughout the valley. (Agency 2015 Groundwater Extraction Summary Report, 2017, 010894.)
In the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas, groundwater pumping occurs from an unconfined
aquifer system that is in direct hydrologic interaction with the Salinas River. (Durbin, 1978,
009633; Yates, 1988, 009753.) The dependency on the Salinas River as a source of recharge
for the Basin and the hydrologic connection between surface water and groundwater results in a
direct relationship between pumping and river flows; therefore, demonstrating that groundwater
and surface water within the Salinas Valley constitute a single source.1

2.4 The Agency's Surface Water Rights
At issue in this proceeding are the Agency's two surface water rights authorizing diversion and
storage of water in Nacimiento Reservoir, and one surface water right authorizing diversion and
storage of water in San Antonio Reservoir.
License 12624 (Application 16761, Permit 12261) was issued to the Agency by the State
Water Board on April 26, 1990. The right authorizes the Agency to divert up to 220,000
acre-feet per annum (afa) of water from the San Antonio River to storage onstream in
San Antonio Reservoir from October 1 of each year to July 1 of the succeeding year,
with a priority date of December 2, 1955. (006464-006472.)
License 7543 (Application 16124, Permit 10137) was Issued to the Agency's
predecessor in interest by the $tate Water Board on November 4, 1965. The right
authorizes the Agency to divert up to 350,000 afa of water from Nacimiento River to
storage onstream in Nacimiento Reservoir from October 1 of each year to July 1 of the
succeeding year, with a priority date of November 4, 1954. (006451-006459.)
Permit 21089 (Application 30532) was issued to the Agency by the State Water Board
on March 23, 2001. The right authorizes the Agency to divert an additional 27,900 afa to
storage in Nacimiento Reservoir from October of each year to July 1 of the succeeding
a year, with a priority date of April 23, 1996. (006528-006542.)
•The Agency is authorized to collect a total of 377,900 afa of water to storage in Nacimiento
Reservoir pursuant to License 7543 and Permit 21089. The Agency submitted Application

1 For a more general overview of groundwater processes, please refer to Adjudicating Groundwater: A Judge's Guide to Understanding Groundwater and Modeling, Dividing the Waters, The National Judicial College (2018).

30532 after new surveys .of Nacimiento Reservoir revealed that the actual storage capacity of
the reservoir at 800 feet elevation was 377,900 af as compared to the estimate of 350,000 af on
which License 7543 was based. (State Water Board Decision 1642 (2001), 005286.) Water
diverted under both rights is stored in Nacimiento Reservoir and released for municipal,
domestic, industrial, and irrigation uses within the boundaries of the Agency's Zone 2 and Zone
2C as depicted on the map attached as Exhibit 3, excluding lands annexed to Zone 2 after
November 4, 1965, and 7,500 acres within San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water
Conservation District. The rights also authorize recreational use of the water while stored in
Nacimiento Reservoir.

Historically, the Agency has operated Nacimiento Reservoir to store winter flows for release
during the summer season to maximize recharge to the groundwater basin by infiltration through
the streambed of the Salinas River. (Durbin Report, 1978, 009603; Yates Report, 1988,
009753; Exhibit 1 of Coalition Opening Brief, 006329-006330.) As described in the original
application for a water right submitted to the State Water Board (Application 16124), the
purpose of the reservoir is to capture stormwater runoff that would otherwise discharge to the
ocean and then release these diversions during the spring, summer, and fall, to maximize
recharge of the groundwater basin. (Application 16124, 006437-006446.) The water is then
extracted from the basin by individual users, and beneficially used for the purposes identified in
the water rights.

The water stored will be released at rates at which it will be absorbed in its flow down the channels of the Naçimiento and Salinas Rivers.... The rate of storage release will be adjusted to the absorptive capacity of the Salinas River.... The stored water so released and absorbed will mingle with the naturally available percolating groundwater in the Salinas Valley and the mingled supply will be used by the landowners in Zone 2 of the District for the various uses for which they have beneficial needs.
(Ibid.)

a According to a report prepared for the Agency, operation of San Antonio and Nacimiento
Reservoirs has resulted in an annual average increase in groundwater recharge of
30,000 acre-feet per year. (SVWP Engineer's Report, 2003, 002410.)
In 2004, the Agency filed petition's with the State Water Board seeking to change the place of
use and add points of rediversion for Licenses 7543, 12624, and Permit 21089 to authorize
operation of the Salinas Valley Water Project (SVWP). (SWRCB Order WR 2008-0037-DWR,
002615-002617.) The SVWP consists of reoperation of the storage and release schedules of

13

the Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs, modification of the Nacimiento Dam spillway; and
installation of a diversion facility in the Salinas River (the Salinas River Diversion Facility).
(lbid.) The purpose of the is SVWP is to halt further seawater intrusion into the basin by making
more water available to recharge the basin during the summer months and provide surface
water deliverles for irrigation to offset groundwater pumping in targeted areas that are
contributing to the advance of seawater intrusion. (SVWP Final EIR, 2002, 006966.)
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) protested the change petitions before the State
Water Board on the basis that the Salinas Valley Water Project could'adversely impact
steelhead in the Salinas River and its tributaries by decreasing instream flows. (Letter from
NMFS to State Water Board, January 14, 2005, 010507-010508.) By letter dated June 23,
2006, NMFS informed the State Water Board that it would withdraw its protest to the proposed
if changes if the Board included terms and conditions in the Agency's amended license and
permit that incorporated flow prescriptions to be jointly developed by the Agency and NMFS
through consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). (Letter from NMFS
to State Water Board, June 23, 2006, 002647-002650.) The consultation process resulted in a
report, titled Salinas Valley Water Project Flow Prescription for Steelhead Trout in the Salinas
River (2005 Flow Prescription), dated October 11, 2005. (008265-008404.) NMFS issued a
biological opinion for the project on June 21, 2007. (2007 Biological Opinion), based in
significant part on the 2005 Flow Prescriptlon. (008141-008263.) The description of the project
in the biological opinion included flow provisions to address the needs of various• life stages of
steelhead in the Salinas River watershed as provided in the 2005 Flow Prescription. (Ibid.)
On August 4, 2008, the State Water Board sent a letter to NMFS and enclosed drafts of the
amended license and permit.2 (Letter from State Water Board to NMFS, August 4, 2008,
010610-010611.) The drafts included terms and conditions that incorporated flow prescriptions
based on the 2007 Biological Opinion and the 2005 Flow Prescription. (ld., 010610.) NMFS
responded by letter dated August 28, 2008, stating that the agency had reviewed the terms and
conditions in the draft amended rights and would dismiss its protest if the terms and conditions
were included in the final amended rights. (Letter from NMFS to State Water Board, August 28,
2008, 010612.) The State Water Board approved the Agency's petition for changes to License

2 The draft amended license and permit enclosed with the Board's letter was not located by State Water
Board staff in the Board's records and has not been submitted by the parties as evidence in this proceeding. Therefore, the specific language of the terms and conditions in the draft is not known to the Board.

2.5 Drought Operations
The water years beginning October'1, 2011, and ending September 30, 2016, were some of the
driest on record in California.3 In January 2014, Governor Brown issued a Proclamation of a
State of Emergency due to drought conditions. (002725-002729.) The water surface of
Nacimiento Reservoir fell below 748 feet mean sea level (msl) on August 8, 2013, and did not
rise above this level until January 9, 2017. (Agency Opening Brief, Decl. Brent Buche, 000038.)
Based on the Agency's 2000 Reservoír Operations Pollcy, water levels below 748 feet msl were
considered drought conditions. (Nacimiento Dam Operation Policy, April 24, 2000, 006580.) In
January 2014, San Antonio Reservoir was filled to 5 percent of Its storage capacity and close to
physical dead pool,4 and Nacimiento Reservoir was filled to 23 percent of its storage capacity.
(Agency Opening Brief, 000017.)
On February 20, 2014, Agency staff met with NMFS to discuss a reduction in minimum releases
from Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs. (Agency Opening Brief, 000019.) At that time, alf
portions of Monterey County were either in extreme or exceptional drought and the Salinas
River watershed was-projected to have very little additional rainfall for the remainder of the 2014
water year. (lbid.) The Agency assumed no significant additional inflow to the reservoir in its
projection that maintenance of the release of 60 cfs would result in operational minimum pool
elevation of 687.8 feet mst in Nacimiento reservoir in February or March 2015, and physical
dead pool in May 2015. (ld., 000019-000020.) As projected by the Agency, reduction of
releases from 60 cfs to 25 cfs would allow the Agency to maintain releases from the reservoir
for approximately 180 additional days, assuming no significant inflow to the reservoir in the
intervening period. (ld., 000020.)
The Agency formally requested approval from NMFS to reduce releases from Nacimiento
Reservoir from 60 cfs to 25 cfs, by letter dated March 18, 2014, and continued to consult with
NMFS regarding the request. (004584-004585.) NMFS responded formally by letter dated April
25, 2014. (005028-005031.) The April 2014 letter states that a reduction in releases could
result in adverse impacts to steelhead habitat but suggested measures to mitigate the impact if

3 The water year is from October through September 30, and is designated by the calendar year in which it ends. The 2014 water year is the period from October 1, 2013, through September 30, 2014. * Physical dead pool is when the reservoir's water level falls below the outlets of the reservoir, thereby preventing any additional releases.

15

the Agency implemented the proposed reduction in outflow. (Id., 005029-005030.) Acting upon
the recommendations by NMFS, the Agency developed a ramping rate for reducing flows, and
temperature and fish monitoring measures to evaluate whether the flow reduction had resulted
in "instances of stranding, isolation, or extreme loss of habitat" that could result in a take.
(Agency Drought Conditions Fisheries Monitoring on the Nacimiento River, 005032-005034.)
On June 4, 2014, the Agency reduced releases from Nacimiento Reservoir from 60 cfs to 25
cfs. (Exhibit 44 of Agency Opening Brief, 004392.) At the time, the elevation of the water level
at Nacimiento Reservoir was 723.1 feet msl and storage was at 20 percent capacity. (Id., at
004357, 004417.) In accordance with its mönitoring plan, the Agency provided NMFS with
water temperature data, habitat descriptions, air temperature data, and streamflow data at
various monitoring locations on a monthly basis. (Agency Temperature Monitoring Report,
005197-005221.) On May 28, 2015, the Agency increased minimum releases from Nacimiento
Reservoir to 60 cfs. (Exhibit 44 of Agency Opening Brief, 004399.)

2.6 Summary of Claims
The Coalition flled suit against the Agency on January 13, 2017. Among other claims, the
Coalition alleges that (1) the Agency operated Nacimiento Reservoir in violation of the terms of
its water rights by failing to release water stored in the reservoir to maintain minimum flows in
the Naclmiento River, and (2) operated Nacimiento Reservoir in a manner that materially Injured
downstream overlying and riparian right holders. Specifically, the Coalition alleges that from
December 2014 through February 2015, the Agency unlawfully diverted and stored in
Nacimiento and San Antonio Reservoirs approximately 30,000 acre-feet of natural. inflow that
would not have wasted to Monterey Bay if it had been bypassed through the dams forming the
reservoirs. The Coalition claims that this water is natural recharge to which the Coalition members are entitled under their overlying and riparian water rights. As a result of the allegedly
illegal diversions to storage, the Coalition claims that the senior overlying and riparian right
holders were injured by the reduction in the quantity of water available to them, which was
to inadequate to supply their needs and caused reductions in water quality.

3.0 ISSUE (A) - COMPLIANCE WITH THE FLOW PRESCRIPTION PERMIT TERM
Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015?

16

The Coalition alleges that the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing
Habitat in Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application
30532) (hereafter "Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription" or "Flow Prescription"), by
releasing less than 60 cfs from Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014
through May 27, 2015. The Board finds and concludes that the Agency did not violate the
Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription because its requirements were not triggered to require
releases during the period from June 4, 2014 through May 27, 2015.
The Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in License 7543 and Permit 21089 states:
Permittee shall augment flow in the Nacimiento River by releasing 60 cfs MDF [mean daily flow] from Nacimiento Reservoir beginning the 8th day after the first adult steel head passage day occurs on the Salinas River after January 1 of each water-year. The first passage day is the first day in a period of 5 consecutive days with mean daily flow of 260 cfs or higher at USGS gage No. 11152300 (Salinas River near Chualar). The release of 60 cfs MDF will continue at least through May 31. After May 31, Permittee will continue to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder of the calendar year as long as the water surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.8 feet mean sea level.
The parties do not dispute the fact that the rate of release from Nacimiento Reservoir was less
than 60 cfs during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015. (Exhibit 44 of Agency
Opening Brief, 004392-004399.) After an initial ramp-down period, flow releases from the
Nacimiento Reservoir for this period ranged between approximately 25 and 30 cfs. (Ibid.)
The Agency defends that the release of less than 60 cfs of water from Nacimiento Reservoir
during the relevant period did not violate the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the
Agency's water rights because the Agency operated the reservoir in a manner consistent with
the drought condition in the 2005 Flow Prescription. (Agency Opening Brief, 000015-000017.)
The Agency asserts that the drought condition in the 2005 Flow Prescription was incorporated
by reference into the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescriptioni in the Agency's water rights and
allows a reduction in minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir under certain dry conditions
with approval by NMFS. (Ibid.)

17

3.1 Analysis

3.1.1 Plain Meaning of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
The Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription operates on a calendar year, beginning January
1.5 The term divides the year into the period from January 1 through May 31, and June 1
through December 31. Before June 1 of each year, the minimum release requirement of 60 cfs
from Nacimiento Reservoir is triggered on the eighth day after the first adult steelhead passage
day occurs on the Salinas River. As defined in the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription,
the first passage day is the first day in a period of 5 consecutive days with mean daily flow of
260 cfs or higher at USGS gage No. 11152300 (Salinas River near Chualar). During the 2014
and 2015 calendar years, there were no flows recorded at USGS gage No. 11152300. (Exhibit
44 of Agency Opening Brief, 004380-004384.) Because there were no flows, no adult steelhead
passage days occurred as defined by the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription and no
minimum releases were required by the term.
After May 31 of each year, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription requires the Agency to
"continue to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder of the calendar year as long as the water
surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above 687.8 feet mean sea level." (License 7543,
002609.) The parties do not dispute that the surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir
remained above 687.8 feet.msl throughout the calendar years of 2014 and 2015. (Exhibit 44 of
Agency Opening Brief, 004354-004369.) Whether the Agency was required to release 60 cfs
beginning in June 2014 and in 2015 therefore depends on whether the Spawning and Rearing
Flow Prescription requires releases after May 31 even if there were no adult steelhead passage
days earlier in the year. The plain language of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
requires a release of 60 cfs after May 31 only if adult steelhead passage days triggered
minimum releases on or prior to May 31: The key to this interpretation is the word "continue" in
the flow prescription. To read the provision to require the permittee to begin releasing 60 cfs
after May 31, when not required to do so previously, would be inconsistent with the meaning of
the word "continue" and is therefore not a reasonable interpretation.

5 The term states that flow shall be augmented beginning the eighth day after the first adult steel head passage day occurs on the Salinas River "after January of each water-year. The reference to water year (which begins on October 1 and ends September 30) in this sentence is superfluous because January of the water year is the same as January 1 of the calendar year. The final sentence of the term clarifies that the flow prescription operates on a calendar year.
18

The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
did not require the Agency to make minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir in 2014 and
2015, either before or after May 31, because there was no first adult steelhead passage day in
either calendar year to trigger the requirement.

3:1.2 2007 Biological Opinion

The Board's interpretation and application of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription is
based on the plain meaning of its language. Both parties, however, point to the analogous term
for spawning and rearing flows in Nacimiento River in the 2007 Biological Opinion as relevant
extrinsic evidence of the meaning of the term in the Agency's water rights. Because of key
differences in the language of the terms, however, the Board concludes that the 2007 Biological
Opinion does not alter the meaning of the flow prescription in the Agency's water rights.
The 2007 Biological Opinion describes the minimum releases that the Agency will provide for
spawning and rearing habitat in the Nacimiento River as follows:

To provide spawning opportunities, [the Agency] proposes a release of 60 cfs from
Nacimiento Reservoir beginning the eighth day after the first adult steelhead
passage day occurs on the Salinas River near Spreckels after January 1$1. These
flows will be continued through May 31st. Until further studies are conducted to
determine adequate. rearing flows in. the Nacimiento River below the
reservoir during summer and fall, MCWRA will release a minimum of 60 cfs
throughout the year as minimum rearing flow as long as the water surface
elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above the elevation 687.8 feet mean sea level
(msl), the reservoir's minimum pool.
(2007 Biological Opinion, June 21, 2007, 002448 [emphasis added].).
The difference between this release requirement and the Spawning and Rearing Flow
Prescription in the Agency's water rights is indicated in bold type. The 2007 Biological Opinion
explicitly commits the Agency to releasing 60 cfs throughout the year as long as the water
surface elevation of Nacimiento Reservoir is above the elevation of 687.8 feet msl, unless and
until further studies are conducted. The language in bold type effectively renders the trigger of
the first adult steelhead passage day in the prior sentences superfluous. If, however, the
Agency were to conduct additional studies to demonstrate that flows other than year-round
flows of 60 cfs are appropriate to aintain rearing habitat, theni the trigger conditions may come

19

into effect. The term in the 2007 Biological Opinion anticipates a process of adaptive
management, wherein the year-round flow requirement of 60 cfs to maintain adequate rearing
flows may be altered based on future information gathered pursuant to. additional studies.

In contrast, the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the Agency's water rights is not
conditioned on additional future studies. It therefore would be unreasonable to read the term to
require a release of 60 ofs year-round regardless of the presence of the triggering condition of
adult steelhead passage days. To do so would be to read the triggering conditions out of the
term.

State Water Board Order 2008-0037 approved changes to the Agency's water rights and
imposed terms and conditions that included the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription. (See,
e.g., License 7543, 002603-002605.) Order 2008-0037 twice refers to the flow prescriptions in
the 2007 Biological Opinion, but nelther reference explicitly incorporates them as conditions on
the rights. (Id., 002604.) Paragraph 9 of the Order finds that NMFS withdrew its protest to the
change petition "based on inclusion of the biological opinion's flow prescriptions in the amended
licenses and permit." (ld..002604.) Paragraph 4(c) of the order directs that the Agency's water
rights be amended to "[ajdd terms to incorporate the flow prescriptions included in the June 20,
2007, NMFS biological opinion." (lbid.) Both statements indicate an intent to incorporate flow
prescriptions in the 2007 Biological Opinion into the Agency's water rights - and the Board did
incorporate those flow prescriptions in substantial part.

There are five flow prescriptions in the 2007 Biological Opinion, each of which addresses flows
needed for various life stages of steelhead trout in the Salinas River and its tributaries. (2007
Biological Opinion, 002441-002448.) All five flow prescriptions from the 2007 Biological Opinion
are included as terms of the Agency's water rights, with flow charts and diagrams to track the
detailed triggering conditions. (See, e.g., License 7543, 002607-002611.) The only apparent
difference in the flow prescriptions as incorporated into the Agency's water rights compared to
the 2007 Biological Opinion, is the difference in the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
raised in this proceeding. Whether or not that difference was intentional cannot be discerned
from the language in the underlying order, or any extrinsic evidence that has been presented to
the Board in this proceeding. Ultimately, neither the Order nor the amended water rights state
in operative language that the flow prescriptions in the 2007 Biological Opinion are incorporated
by reference as terms and conditions of the Agency's rights.

20

3.1.3 2005 Flow Prescription
The Agency defends its reduction in releases from Nacimiento Reservoir as reductions that
were authorized by a "drought condition" in the 2005 Flow Prescription. (Agency Opening Brief,
000015-000018.) The Agency takes the position that the Spawning and Rearing Flow
Prescription in the Agency's water right is merely a summary of the analogous conditions in the
2005 Flow Prescription and that the language in the 2005 Flow Prescription was incorporated
"in full" into the Agency's water rights. (lbid.) Unlike the 2007 Biological Opinion, the 2005 Flow
Préscription includes a "drought condition" that allows reduction in the minimum releases
required by the flow prescriptions during drought conditions upon approval by NMFS: (Exhibit
16 of Agency Opening Brief, 001943.)
The 2005 Flow Prescription explains that a flow of 60 cfs "has been determined" to provide
adequate spawning habitat below Nacimiento Dam. (ld., 001942.) Therefore, the 2005 Flow
Prescription provides for a minimum flow release of 60 cfs from Nacimiento Reservoir for the
period of the eighth day after an adult steelhead passage day occurs on the Salinas River near
Spreckels after January 1 through May 31 (the same provision found in the 2007 Biological
Opinion and the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription in the Agency's water rights). In
contrast, the 2005 Flow Prescription states that "[a]dequate rearing flow for that reach of river
has not been determined. Therefore, [the Agency] will conduct a Steelhead Rearing Habitat
Flow Study for Nacimiento River below Nacimiento Dam... Until such study is completed and a
minimum rearing habltat flow is identified and concurred with by NMFS biology staff, 60 cfs will
be the minimum 'rearing flow' for Nacimiento River below Nacimiento Dam from June until the
following year's spawning flow criteria is met." (ld., 001943.) Like the 2007 Biological Opinion,
the 2005 Flow Prescription effectively moots the triggering condition for flow releases for
spawning habitat untll the referenced flow study has been conducted. Both documents describe
a process by which additional information will likely lead to refinements in the flow requirements
for rearing habitat that will cause the first passage trigger for spawning flows to take effect.

In addition to the flow prescriptions for Nacimiento River discussed above, the 2005 Flow
Prescription includes a "drought condition" which states:

Under drought conditions, the [Agency] will evaluate reservoir storage with regard
to the continuation of minimum releases. When the water surface of Nacimiento
Reservoir is at or below elevation 748 feet msl recommendations may be presented
to NMFS for a reduction of the minimum flow criterion.

21

(ld., 001943.)

The Agency relies on the drought condition to defend that its release of less than 60 cfs in 2014
and 2015 was authorized, because the Agency consulted with NMFS about the proposed
reduction in the minimum releases prior to implementation. (Agency Opening Brief, 000023-
000024.) The Agency met with NMFS in early 2014 and requested a reduction in minimum
releases from Nacimiento Reservoir from 60 cfs to 25 cfs by letter dated March 18, 2014,
because of the possibility that Nacimiento Reservoir would reach minimum pool if there were no
additional inflows to the reservoir in the 2015 water year. (Letter from Agency to NMFS, March
18, 2014, 004584-004585.) By reducing releases from the reservoir, the Agency could extend
the period of time that it could make releases to the Nacimiento River. (ld., 004585.) NMFS
responded to the Agency's request by letter dated April 25, 2014, stating that a reduction in
releases could result in adverse impacts to steelhead habitat but offering various measures that
could reduce the risk of Impacts. (Letter from NMFS to Agency, April 25, 2014, 005028-
005031.) These measures were adopted and Implemented by the Agency, including a gradual
ramp down of flows and a monitoring program to identify impacts to steelhead. (Agency
Opening Brief, 000024.).
The State Water Board is not persuaded by the Agency's argument that the drought condition
was incorporated into the Agency's water rights because there is no operative language in
either State Water Board Order 2008-0037 or the Agency's water rights that makes such an
incorporation by reference. In fact, there is no reference af all to the 2005 Flow Prescription
Report, in Order 2008-0037, or the Agency's rights. Because the Board finds that the drought
condition was not incorporated into the Agency's rights, this report does not address the
Coalition's argument that the Agency failed to obtain approval from NMFS before reducing
releases from Nacimiento Reservoir.

3.2 Additional Arguments Raised by the Coalition

The Coalition claims in its brief that "[t]he criteria triggering Nacimiento Reservoir's 60 cfs
minimum flow release requirement were present from June 4, 2014 through May 27, 2015....
That includes five consecutive days with mean daily flow of 260 cfs or higher at USGS gage No.
11152300..." (Coalition Opening Brief, 005513.) This statement seems to contradict facts
established by available gage data. The Coalition relles on the declaration of Mr. Weeks for this
argüment, but Mr. Weeks does not explain how he came to his conclusion. (Decl. of Curtis
Weeks in Support of Opening Brief, 005539-005543.) The Board is unsure whether the is

22

Coalition disputes the USGS gage data, made a factual error in its consideration of the
triggering criteria, or is interpreting the flow prescription in a manner that requires a minimurn
release of 60 cfs even if no adult steelhead passage days occurred during the year.
The Coalition also claims that the Agency admitted during meetings of the Agency's Board of
Directors in 2014 that a minimum release of 60 cfs was legally required. (Coalition Opening
Brief, 005513.) An admission that 60 cfs was legally required to be released is not, however, an
admission that 60 cfs was legally required to be released by the terms of the Agency's water
rights. Independent of its water rights, the Agency must operate Nacimiento Reservoir in
compliance with the 2007 Biological Opinion. Even if the Agency was not required to make
minimum releases pursuant to its water rights, the Agency may have been required to make
minimum releases to comply with the ESA.
Finally, this report focuses on the requirements of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription
in the Agency's water rights because that is the Issue presented by the court. It is also worth
noting, however, the term in the Agency's water rights which states that "nothing in this
license/permit shall be construed,as authorizing any diversions contrary to the provisions of the
[2007] blological opinion, either as written as of the date of this permit/license or as they may be
amended.... (License 7543, 002612.) The purpose of this provision is to make clear that the
water right permit does not affect any Independent obligations of the Agency under the ESA.
The water right permit sets requirements of state law that apply in addition to any federal law
requirements of the ESA, and the provision is intended to make clear the permit should not be
construed as permitting a violation of the ESA that would make the Board or its staff subject to
citizen suits alleging liability pursuant to the doctrine articulated in Strahañ v. Coxe (1st Cir.
1997) 127 F.3d 155 (licensing of gillnet and lobster pot fishing by the State of Massachusetts
that result in injuries to northern right whales was "takings" by the state in violation of the ESA).
The provision does not incorporate by reference the whole of the applicable biological opinions
to render them independently enforceable terms and conditions of the Board's permit. If the
Board had intended that result, it would have made the incorporation by reference explicit.

3.3 Comments and Objections to the Draft Report
3.3.1 Comments by the Agency

23

The Agency states in its comments on the draft report that it "accepted the State Water Board's
analysis and conclusions regarding issue (a)," while reserving the arguments that the Agency
presented in its opening and responsive briefs. (Agency Comments on Draft Report, 011433.)
3.3.2 Comments by the Coalition

The Coalition objects to the findings and conclusions of the Board on issue (a) in the draft
report. The Coalition raises objections based on the language of the Flow Prescription for
Spawning and Rearing Habitat; impacts to rearing steelhead in the Nacimiento Reservoir; and
the content of the Environmental Impact Report relied upon for the Board's issuance of the
Agency's amended water rights,

The Coalition first raises what appears to be a new argument about the proper interpretation of
the triggering conditions in•the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription that was not explicitly
raised in its opening or response brief. (Coalition Comments on Draft Report, 011447-011451.)
The Coalition argues that the trigger condition of the first adult steelhead passage day should be
interpreted to require a minimum release of 60 cfs from Nacimiento Reservoir not only through
May 31 of that year, but through the remainder of that year, and through the one to three years
necessary for rearing of juvenile steelhead. (ld., 011449.) For example, if a first adult steelhead
passage day occurred in 2012, a minimum release of 60 cfs would be triggered through 2013,
2014, and possibly 2015, even If no adult steelhead passage days occurred in any of those
years. This argument is unpersuasive because it directly contradicts the language of the term,
which explicitly states that the "Permittee will continue to release 60 cfs MDF for the remainder
of the calendar year .... (See, e.g., Permit 21089, 002622.) The term unambiguously operates
on a calendar year basis, and the triggering condition of the first adult steelhead passage day
must occur after January 1 to trigger the minimum release requirement during that calendar
year.

The Coalition's second objection is that the Board's interpretation of the Spawning and Rearing
Flow Prescription would conflict with the 2007 Biological Opinion, should be informed by the
analogous term in the 2007 Biological Opinion, and would fail to protect rearing steelhead in the
Nacimiento River. (Id., 011449-011450.) The Coalition seeks to introduce extrinsic evidence of
the Intent and purpose of the term to inform the interpretation. This extrinsic evidence was
excluded from evidence as untimely by the Board's procedural ruling of January 22, 2019.
(011358.) Even if timely submitted, however, the use of extrinsic evidence to ascertain the

24

meaning of a permit term is only appropriate where the language of the term is reasonably
susceptible to another meaning.

Permits are to be interpreted in the same manner as a contract or other legal document. Under
California law, extrinsic evidence of the meaning of a writing is only admissible "to prove a
meaning to which the contract is reasonably susceptible." (Founding Members of the Newport
Beach Country Club v. Newport Beach Country Club, Inc. (2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 944, 955.) "t
is the objective intent, as evidenced by the words of the contract, rather than the subjective
Intent of one or more of the parties, that controls interpretation." (Titan Group, Inc. v. Sonoma
Valley County Sanitation Dist. (1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1122, 1127.) In federal cases, extrinsic
evidence may not be relied upon to interpret a permit term unless the language is ambiguous; "if
'the language is plain and capable of legal construction, the language alone must determine' the
permit's meaning." (Piney Run Pres. Ass'n V. City Comm'rs of Carroll City (4th Cir. 2001) 268
F.3d 255, 270 [quoting FDIC v. Prince George Corp. (4th Cir. 1995) 58 F.3d 1041, 1046]; see
also Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. V. County of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2001) 725 F.3d 1194, '1205 [citing Piney Run Pres. Ass'n, 268 F.3d at 270]; Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n v.
Patterson (9th Cir. 1999) 204 F.3d 1206, 1210 ['"[Permit] terms are to be given their ordinary
meaning, and when the terms of a [permit] are clear, the intent of the parties must be
ascertained from the [permit] itself."].) In this case, even if the Coalition's proffered evidence
had been admitted, the language of the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription is not
reasonably susceptible to the meaning that the Coalition suggests.
Although not relevant to an interpretation of the plain language of the term, the Board disagrees
with the Coalition's assertion that the Board's interpretation of the Flow Prescription conflicts
with the requirements of the 2007 Biological Opinion. The Agency can comply with both
requirements by satisfying the more stringent of the two. As a practical matter, the 2007 a
Biological Opinion governs the Agency's operation of its facilities and will ensure minimum
releases from Nacimiento Reservoir to maintain appropriate habitat for rearing steelhead even if
the conditions in the Agency's water rights have not been triggered. If and when the Agency
conducts additional studies regarding the minimum flow needs for rearing steelhead in the
Nacimiento River, as contemplated by the 2007 Blological Opinion, NMFS can incorporate
those minimum flows into operations pursuant to the 2007 Biological Opinion, and the State
Water Board may opt to reopen the water rights and add an appropriate term'pursuant to its
continuing authority to protect public trust resources.

3.4 Findings and Conclusions
The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency did not violate the Flow
Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543
(Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cfs from
Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015.

4.0 ISSUE (B) - EFFECTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH FLOW PRESCRIPTION TERM
If the State Water Board concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 CFS water release requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River, whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to the Salinas River Groundwater Basin's
'('Basin') Upper Valley and Forebay subareas and, if so, whether that recharge
reduction reduced water availability (i.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater quality) for any riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas?

This issue need only be addressed if the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning
and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River addressed in issue (a). Because the Board
concludes that the Agency was not in violation of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and
Rearing. Habitat, Issue (b) is not addressed further.
Coalition Comments on the Draft Report:
The Coalition objected to the omission in the Draft Report of any conclusion regarding issue (b),
The Coalition requested that the Board's final report include a finding that releases of less than
60 cfs from Nacimiento Reservoir reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to
the Basin, and that this reduction reduced water availability for riparian and overlying rights in
the Upper Valley and Forebaÿ subareas. The Board declines to address the issue at this time,
based on-its findings and.conclusions on issue (a).

5.0 ISSUE:(C) - RELATIVE PRIORITIES OF WATER RIGHTS
Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624 (Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin?
The parties do not disagree about the basic principles of water rights priorities in California. In
general, riparian and overlying users have a senior claim to the natural flow of a stream, or the
safe yield of a groundwater basin, superior to the.claim of an appropriative right holder. Because

26

the Agency holds appropriative water rights, the Agency's rights are junior in priority to the rights
of overlying and riparian users.

The Agency defends that its diversions to storage in Nacimiento Reservoir during the winter
months was storage and use of "salvaged water," or water that otherwise would not have been
diverted and used by any senior right holder but would have run off unused to the Pacific
Ocean, and therefore, is water to which the Agency has a superior right. (Agency Opening
Brief, 000027-000028.) The Coalition responds that the Agency's diversions of water to storage
in Nacimiento Reservoir during 2014 and 2015 were not diversions of water that would have
"wasted" to the ocean, but water that would have recharged the Salinas Valley Groundwater
Basin, and therefore, ls water to which the Coalition members had a superior claim. (Coalition
Response Brief, 008684.)

5.1 Overview of California Water Rights
"Ownership of California's water is vested generally in the stäte's residents, but individuals and
entities can acquire *water rights,' the right to divert water from its natural course for public or
private use." (Light v. State Water Res.. Control Bd. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1463, 1477-1478;
see also, Millview County Water Dist. V. State Water Res. Control Bd. (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th
879, 888.) California law recognizes a dual system of rights to surface water consisting of
riparian and appropriative rights and a parallel dual system in groundwater consisting of
overlying and appropriative rights. (United States v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (1986) 182
Cal.App.3d 82, 101; Tehachapi-Cummings County Water Dist. v. Armstrong (1975) 49
Cal.App.3d 992, 1001) Other types of water rights are also recognized, including prescriptive
rights, pueblo rights, and federally reserved rights, but these have not been asserted by the
parties in this proceeding and therefore are not discussed further in this report.
5.1.1 Riparian Rights
Riparian rights are recognized under the common law as part and parcel of the riparian land to
which they attach. A water right permit from the State Water Board is not required to exercise a
riparian right. Generally, riparian rights attach to the smallest parcel of real property contiguous
to the watercourse held under one title in the chain of title leading to the present owner.
(Pleasant Valley Canal Co. v. Borrow (1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 742, 774-775.) The right is limited is
to the natural flow of the watercourse, and to reasonable and beneficial use on the riparian
parcel. The rights of riparian users are correlative, consisting of an equitable share of the
available supply. (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra (1949) 33 Cal.2d 908, 927.) The right

27

is not to a fixed quantity of water, but will vary based on available natural flow, the right holder's
riparian demands, and the needs of other riparian users. Water diverted under a riparian right
may not be stored and may not be transferred for use outside of the watershed. Unlike an
appropriative right, a riparlan right is not lost for non-use.

5.1.2 Appropriative Surface Water Rights

Appropriative surface water rights are acquired by diverting and applying water to beneficial
use. The maxim "first in time, first in right" governs the relative priority of appropriative rights,
and the rights of senior appropriators are served completely before those of junior appropriators.
(City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at p. 926.) Appropriators may develop
rights regardless of land ownership or location of use on the land, may use the water outside of
the watershed, and may lose rights through non-use. (Miller v. Bay Cities Water Co. (1910) 157
Cal. 256, 280-281 [overruled on other grounds by City of Lodi v. East Bay Municipal Utility Dist.
.(1936) 7 Cal.2d 316, 337]; Smith v. Hawkins (1898) 120 Cal. 86, 88; Crandell v. Woods (1857) 8
Cal. 136, 142; Wat. Code, § 1241.)
Prior to December 19, 1914, the effective date of the Water Commission Act, compliance with
statutory requirements was not necessary to obtain a valld appropriative right. Approprlative
rights established before that time are referred to as "pre-1914 rights." "So long as the diverter
acted with due diligence to achieve the intended diversion, did in fact divert within a reasonable
time, and used the diverted water for beneficial purpose, the claim was perfected and had
priority over any later established claim." (Millview County Water Dist. v. State Water
Resources Control Bd., supra, 229 Cal.App.4th at p. 890 [citing Haight v. Costanich (1920) 184
Cal. 426, 431-433].) Since 1914, the exclusive means to obtain an appropriative surface water
right is by obtaining a water right permit from the State Water Board (or its predecessor agency)
pursuant to the statute now codified as Division 2 (commencing with section 1000) of the Water
Code. (Wat. Code, § 1225; Pleasant Valley Canal Co., supra, 61 Cal.App:4th at p. 777.) "Once
an appropriative water right permit is issued, the permit holder has the right to take and use the
water according to the terms of the permit." (United States v. State Water Res. Control Bd.,
supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at p. 102; Wat. Code, §S 1381 & 1455.) Upon perfection of the right by
diversion and beneficial use, the State Water Board confirms the appropriative right by issuing a
license. (Wat. Code, §§ 1600-1610.)

5.1.3 Groundwater Rights

28

An overlying groundwater right is analogous to a riparian right to surface water. (City of
Pasadena V. City of Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at p. 925.) An overlying right attaches to land
overlying a groundwater basin and is correlative to the rights of other overlying users to the safe
yield of the basin. (Katz V. Walkinshaw (1903) 141 Cal. 116.) A water right permit from the
State Water Board Is not required to exercise an overlying right,° and like a riparian right, an
overlying right is not lost for non-Lise. The rights of overlying users are correlative, consisting of
an equitable share of the available supply. The available supply for a groundwater basin is
termed the "safe yield", or "sustainable yield," and is discussed further in the Subsection 5.1.4.
Like appropriative rights to surface water, appropriative rights to groundwater are governed by
the principle of first in time, first in right, and allow use of water outside of the groundwater
basin. The State Water Board does not have permitting jurisdiction over groundwater, so an
approprlative groundwater right can be obtained simply by extraction and beneficial use and
does not require a permit from the state. Water may be appropriated for beneficial uses subject
to the rights of those who have a lawful priority. Any water not needed for the reasonable
beneficial uses of those having prior rights is excess or surplus water. Surplus water can be
appropriated for non-overlying uses such as municipal use or exportation beyond the basin or
watershed.?

5.1.4 Safe or Sustainable Yield

The concept of a volume of water that may be extracted from a basin on an annual basis
without incurring injury to other uses and users, depleting the long-term supply, or causing other
undesirable results, is termed the safe yield or sustainable yield of the basin. This concept is
well described in the following passages from The National Judicial College Groundwater
Benchbook:

Safe yield and sustainable yield are terms that generally refer to the maximum possible groundwater extraction rate that will not cause unacceptable harm to a groundwater system; the human. and natural environments supported by it, and the environment supporting the groundwater

6 The State Water Board does exercise permitting authority over the diversion and use of water from "subterranean streams flowing in known and definite channels." (See Wat. Code, § 1200; see generally N. Gualala Water Co. V. State Water Res. Control Bd. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1577, as modified on denial of reh'g (June 16, 2006).) The State Water Board has not found that the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin is a subterranean stream subject to its permitting jurisdiction.
7 The extraction of groundwater for public use such as a municipal water supply, where not applied to a city's own property, iS an appropriative use of water rather than an overlying use. (City of San Bernardino V. City of Riverside (1921) 186 Cal. 7, 24-25.)

29

system. These terms are difficult to define because groundwater systems are in a dynamic balance with their surroundings, and are thus in a constant state of change and also because "unacceptable harm" is a (subjective) policy decision, not a scientific term. As such, what is sustainable or safe at one point in time may not be at another point in time. Most commonly, safe yield or sustainable yield is understood as the amount of water that can be withdrawn annually from an aquifer for many years without causing harm. Safe or sustainable yield is typically measured in acre-feet per year.
The difference between the two terms is often vague. Safe yield is a mass balance equation, and can fail to take into account the delay of multiple stresses and non-steady conditions, such as climate variability. Sustainable yield holds a longer-term, dynamic view, and is defined as the (possibly varying) amount of water that an aquifer can indefinitely yield without causing unacceptable environmental, economic, or social consequences.

(Adjudicating Groundwater: A Judge's Guide to Understanding Groundwater and Modeling,
Dividing the Waters, The National Judicial College (2018), at pp. 29-30.)
For purposes of this report, the Board uses the term safe yield and sustainable yield as distinct
but related concepts. The judgment in the Upper Los Angeles River Area adjudication defines
safe yield as the maximum amount of water which can be extracted annually from a
groundwater basin under a given set of cultural conditions and extraction patterns, based on the
long-term supply, without causing a continuing reduction of water in storage. (City of Los
Angeles v. City of San Femnando (1979) Judgment, at p. 4., 009689) In other words, safe yield
is "the maximum quantity of water which can be withdrawn annually from a ground water supply
under a given set of conditions without causing an undesirable result," where "undesirable
result" is defined as the "gradual lowering of the ground water levels resulting eventually in
depletion of the supply." (City of Los Angeles v. City of San Femando (1975) 14 Cal.3d 199,
278 [quoting City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, supra,33 Cal.2d at p. 929J.) Overdraft
occurs when extractions from the basin exceed the safe yield resulting in this chronic decline of
groundwater. (City of Los Angeles v. City of San Femando, supra,at p. 278.)
As the term is used in this report, the "sustainable yield" of a basin sweeps more broadly and
addresses undesirable results in addition to the chronic lowering of groundwater levels. The
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 (SGMA) (Wat. Code, § 10720 et seq.)
defines sustainable yield as the "maximum quantity of water, calculated over a base period
representative of long-term conditions in the basin and including any temporary surplus, that
can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply without causing an undesirable result."
(Wat. Code, § 10721, subd. (w).) The six undesirable results codified by SGMA generally

30

encompass the types of effects that California courts have identified as legally cognizable injury,
which is includes but is not limited to the chronic lowering of groundwater levels:
"[O]ne or more of the following effects caused by groundwater conditions occurring
throughout the basin:

(1) Chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and
unreasonable depletion of supply if continued over the planning and
implementation horizon. Overdraft during a period of drought is not
sufficient to establish a chronic lowering of groundwater levels if extractions
and groundwater recharge are managed as necessary to ensure that
reductions in groundwater levels or storage during a period of drought are
offset by increases in groundwater levels or storage during other periods.
(2) Significant and unreasonable reduction of groundwater storage.
(3) Significant and unreasonable seawater intrusion.
(4) Significant and unreasonable degraded water quallty, including the
migration of contaminant plumes that impair water supplies.
(5) Significant and unreasonable land subsidence that substantially interferes
with surface land uses.
(6) Depletions of interconnected surface water that have significant and
unreasonable adverse impacts on beneficial uses of the surface water.
(ld., subd. (x).)

Under SGMA, local groundwater sustainability agencies are required to develop a groundwater
sustainability plan to ensure that the basin is operated within its sustainable yield. Pursuant to
regulations developed by the California Department of Water Resources, groundwater
sustainability agencies must quantitatively define undesirable results for the basin, which in turn
define the sustainable yield. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23,§ 350 et seq.) Although SGMA does not
directly determine or alter surface or groundwater. rights, the definition of undesirable results and
sustainable yield developed by groundwater sustainability agencles for their basin would likely
assist a court or the Board in making findings necessary for a determination of water rights or
demonstration of injury to water right holders.8 (Wat. Code, § 10720.5.)

* This litigation may be resolved prior to the adoption of groundwater sustainability plans for the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin. The Salinas Valley Groundwaler Basin subareas arë categorized as high and

31

5.1.5 Relative Priority of Groundwater and Surface Water Rights
With limited exceptions, riparian and overlying rights are senior in priority to appropriative water
rights, Riparian users along a stream system a may consume all available supply, leaving none
for appropriative users, even of the most senior priority. This is true regardless of the date on
which the riparian use commenced, so long as the use is reasonable, and the water is used on
riparian lands. Similarly, overlying users have a right to exhaust the safe yield of a groundwater
basin such that no water may remain for use by appropriative right holders in the basin.
Because riparian and overlying users are limited to water that would be naturally available,
water that is foreign in time or source are not subject to riparian or overlying claims. Such
foreign water may include water that has been imported from a source outside of the watershed,
or water that is made available by storage and deferred release at a time when the water would
not otherwise be naturally available.
The common source doctrine applies to groundwater and surface waters that are hydrologically
connected and integrates the relative priorities of the rights without regard to whether the
diversion is from surface or groundwater. (Hudson v. Dailey (1909) 156 Cal. 617.) "[i]t has
been recognized by California decisions that a percolating groundwater supply, although not
part of the flow of a stream, may nevertheless be hydrologically connected with it, with the result
that the extraction of water from either source diminishes the amount of water in the other. In
such a situation, the percolating groundwater and the stream are regarded as one common
water supply .... (United States v. Fallbrook (S.D.Cal. 1958) 165 F.Supp. 806, 847 [internal
citations omitted].) "Because these basins are interconnected, some of the surface inflow to one
basin is outflow from another. The groundwater and surface water within the entire Mojave River
Basin constitute single interrelated source." (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000)
23 Cal.4th 1224, 1234.)
In general, riparian and overlying users have correlative rights to water naturally occurring in the
watershed and are senior in priority to appropriative users of surface and groundwater. In
considering the relative rights of surface and groundwater right holders, it is necessary to
consider the physical availability of the water and whether the source would be naturally
available to the right holder. An appropriative user-of surface water should only be curtailed if

medium priority basins, for which a groundwater sustainability plan must be submitted by January 31, 2020, for portions of the Pressure Area and January 31, 2022, for the remaining subareas of Salinas Valley. (Wat. Code § 10720.7.)

32

the curtailment will prevent injury to an overlying groundwater right holder by making more water
available.

5.1.6 Salvaged Water

Salvaged water is water native a to a basin that, but for its capture by some artificial means,
would escape the basin before it could be beneficially used. "Simply stated, salvaged water is
water that is saved from waste as when winter floodwaters are dammed and held in a reservoir."
(City of Santa Maria v. Adam (2012) 211 Cal.Appl.4th 266, 304.) Salvaged water belongs to the
person who succeeds in its lawful capture and makes the water available for use. (lbid, [citing
Pomona Land & Water Co. V. San Antonio Water Co: (1908) 152 Cal. 618, 620].) Although
salvaged water is native to the basin, it is water that is made available for use only by the efforts
of another, and therefore, the rights of riparian and overlying users do not attach. "[T]he priority
of the overlying right does not extend to water made available by the efforts of another.
Salvaged water may be native to the extent it would naturally flow within the stream to which it is
released but it is 'foreign in time.' It would not find its way into the Basin absent a reclamation
project to divert it, store it, and release it on a schedule to augment natural recharge." (City of
Santa Maria v. Adam, supra, 211 Cal.Appl.4th at pp. 304-305 [internal citations omitted].)
5.1.7 Physical Solution
The physical solution doctrine allows a court or an agency to "compel a senior right holder to
accept a a substituted source of water or a modification of his means of diversion, distribution or
use of water at a junior right holder's expense in order to benefit the junior and to achieve better
overall utilization of the resource." (Harrison C. Dunning, The 'Physical Solution' in Western
Water Law (1986) 57 U. Colo. L. Rev.445, 448.) Physical solutions have been upheld by
California courts as within the authority of the court to maximize the beneficial use of water and
avoid "a waste of water which would be entailed if the paramount water right were upheld and
protected absolutely." (Governor's Commission to Review California Water Rights Law,
Groundwater Rights in California, Background and Issues, 1977, 014929.)

5.2 Analysis
The appropriative water rights held by the Agency that authorize storage of water in Nacimiento
Reservoir are junior in priority to the rights of overlying and riparian users in the Basin. On that
point, at least, the partles have no dispute. The factual dispute between the parties is whether
surplus water was available for diversion by junior right holders in 2014 and 2015 or, if surplus
water was not available, whether the reservoirs were operated in such a manner over time to

33

provide adequate replacement water to effectuate a physical solution. Those factual questions
are to be addressed in Phase 2 of this proceeding.
The Agency defends that although its rights may be junior in priority, the water stored in
Nacimiento Reservoir is salvaged water to which overlying and riparian users have no claim,
(Agency Opening Brief, 000027.) The Agency points for support to the State Water Board's
finding in issuing the Agency's water rights that water was avallable for appropriation and that its
diversion would not injure downstream overlying and riparian users. (ld., 000028; Agency
Response Brief, 005397.) The finding by the Board that unappropriated water is, at times,
available for appropriation, is not a finding that water is available for appropriation at all times, in
all hydrologic conditions, or in all future circumstances. A permit is not a right to divert, but an
authorization to divert subject to water availability and the prior rights of other users. The
Board's finding of water availability in issuing the permits is therefore only a beginning and not
an end to the inquiry as to whether diversion by a junior right holder has injured a more senior
user,

Overlying and riparian users in the Salinas Valley have no right to water that has been rightfully
stored by the Agency during those periods when surplus water was available for diversion.
Although senior in priority, these right holders cannot demand the release of water stored at a
time when surplus water was available. The mere fact that water continued to be held in
Nacimiento Reservoir when the demands of overlying and riparlan users were not being met is
not itself a violation of the right of priority, so long as Nacimiento was operated 1o bypass any
Inflows to which overlying and riparian users a had a senior claim.

5.3 Comments and Objections to the Draft Report
Agency Comments:
The Agency generally concurs with the findings and conclusions in the Draft Report on this
issue. (Agency Comments on Draft Report, 011431-011432.) The Agency requests that the
final report make clear that an additional issue that will be addressed in Phase 2 - and that is
interrelated with issue (c) - is whether Coalition members suffered a legally cognizable injury to
a their water rights as a result of the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014 to 2015. (ld., 011434.)
The Board concurs that the reasonableness of any interference with the exercise of water rights
claimed by Coalition members will be an issue to be addressed if the Board is directed to submit
a report of referee on the remaining issues identified by the court in its order of September 8,
2017 (issues (e) through (h)).

34

Coalition Comments:

The Coalition generally concurs with the findings and conclusions in the Draft Report on this
issue. (Coalition Comment on Draft Report, 011463.)

5.4 Findings and Conclusions
The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency's appropriative water rights for
Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624
(Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) -- are junior in priority to any
downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin.

6.0 ISSUE (D) - CONSIDERATION OF WATER USE IN OTHER SUBAREAS

To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subarea were injured by the Agency's
reservoir operations in 2014 and 2015?

In general, the parties do not disagree that water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley
Groundwater Basin must be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in
the Upper Valley and Forebay subarea were injured. An adjudication determining each
individual water right is not, however, necessary to determine whether an injury occurred, so
long as the rights of riparian and overlying users are considered in the aggregate. A
determination of whether and the extent to which a particular right holder may have been injured
may require a more detailed analysis of water use in the basin to determine the share of water to which a correlative user is entitled and the reasonableness of the particular use and method
of diversion.

6.1 Injury
a Injury to a water right is an unreasonable interference with the exercise of the right, whether by
interference with physical availability, water quality, method of diversion, or other types of
harms. Typically, injury occurs from diversion of water by a junior right holder that causes water
to be physically unavailable to a user with senior prlority. In other cases, injury occurs from
interference in the senior user's access to water that causes the senior user to sustain material
costs to divert and use the quantity of water to which the user has a right. Here, the Coalition a
alleges that its members were injured by lowered groundwater levels caused by the Agency's

35

diversions that resulted in decreased pumping capacity and reduced water quality. (Coalition
Opening Brief, 005520-005521.)

6.1.1 Physical Availability
Interference with the physical availability of water can. occur by diversion from a stream system
or extraction from a groundwater basin. In a stream, a downstream right holder may be injured
if an upstream right holder diverts water so as to prevent an adequate quantity of water from
reaching the downstream point of diversion. If the upstream junior diverter completely dewaters
the stream, the injury to downstream users is clearly visible. In other circumstances, water may
continue to flow in the stream, but is not legally available to the downstream injured party
because it is subject to the claims of more senior right holders or protected from diversion for
instream beneficial uses.

Not all Interference with the exercise of a water right constitutes injury. Article X, section 2 of
the California Constitution requires that the state's water resources "be put to beneficial use to
the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or unreasonable use or
unreasonable method of use of water be prevented." A right holder may be required to incur
some reasonable expense to allow another to beneficially use available water. "The mere
inconvenience, or even the matter of extra expense, within limits which are not unreasonable, to
which a prior user may be subjected, will not avail to prevent a subsequent appropriator from
utilizing his right." (Peabody v. Vallejo (1935) 2 Cal.2d 351, 376 [emphasis in original] [quoting
Waterford Irr. Dist. v. Turlock Irr. Dist. (1920) 50 Cal.App. 213, 221]); see also State Water
Board Decision 421 (1938) at p. 9; Rancho Santa Margarita v. Vail (1938) 11 Cal.2d 501,
561["[l]t would be an unreasonable use to require the flow of the surface stream if such cattle
can reasonably be watered at reasonable expense by some artificial means."].)
A senior right holder is, however, entitled to a remedy if an interference is material and the costs
that would be necessary to avoid the harm are unreasonable. "Although the [senior right holder]
may be required to make minor changes in its method of appropriation in order to render
available water for subsequent appropriators, it cannot be compelled to make major changes or
to incur substantial expense." (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d 908
(Pasadena v. Alhambra) [emphasis in original] [quoting City of Lodi v. East Bay Mun. Utility
Dist., supra, 7. Cal.2d at p. 341].) An appropriate remedy could include curtailment of the junior
user's diversion, payment of damages, or a physical solution that allows a junior right holder to
provide replacement water to the senior user to make up for losses that might otherwise occur
due to the junior's use.

36

6.1.2 Water Quality
The proprietary interest in water includes the right to divert and use water of a quantity and
quality necessary for the use. An impairment of water quality may infringe upon a water right
even if an adequate quantity of water is avallable. (Joerger v. Pacific & Gas & Electric Co. (1929)
207 Cal. 8 (upholding cause of action for temperature pollution of waters from power generation
resulting in water quality not suited for stock or domestic use); Phoenix Water Co. v. Fletcher
(1863) 23 Cal. 481, 487 [finding that a right holder is "clearly entitled to protection against acts
which materially ... deteriorate [the water's] quality for the uses to which he wishes to apply it."].)
Like impairments to the physical access to water, impairments to water quality are judged on the
basis of reasonableness and the materiality of the impact. If the avoldance of water quality
Impacts would require a quantity of water so as to impair the maximum beneficial use of water,
courts have hesitated to order upstream junior users to cease their diversions. "But while
common law clearly affords water rights holders relief from pollution, it is debatable whether
such protection included the right to require upstream subsequent appropriators to curtail their
use of water solely to permit a sufficient flow to resist natural saltwater intrusion." (United States
V. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, 182 Cal.App.3d 82, 117; Town of Antioch v.
Williams Irrigation Dist. (1922) 188 Cal. 451.)
6.1.3 Injury to Groundwater Rights
In a groundwater basin, injury is often more difficult to identify than in a surface stream. a
Extractions in excess of the safe or sustainable yield of a basin will lower groundwater levels but
generally will not entirely eliminate the supply. Groundwater is still available but may be more
expensive to extract, may have impaired water quality, or the extractions may cause significant
and unreasonable results in the basin such as reduced groundwater supplies, land subsidence,
seawater intrusion, or unreasonable impacts to public trust resources or other beneficial uses of
surface waters.

Groundwater extractions in excess of the safe yield of the basin are Injurious even if there Is no s
Immedlate harm to other users. In Pasadena v. Alhambra, the court described the injury as not
"an immediate disability to obtain water, but, rather ... the continual lowering of the level and
gradual reducing of the total amount of stored water, the accumulated effect of which, after a
perlod of years, would be to render the supply insufficient to meet the needs of the rightful
owners." (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at p. 922; see also Lodi v.
East Bay Municipal Utility Dist. (1936) 7 Cal.2d 316, 339.) "Each taking of water in excess of
the safe yield ... was wrongful and was an injury to the then existing owners of water rights,

37

because the overdraft, from its very beginning, operated progressively to reduce the total
available supply." (City of Pasadena v. City of Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at p. 929.)
Demonstrating injury from groundwater conditions caused by overdraft generally requires a
comparison of the safe yield and the volume of annual extractions to show that overdraft is
occurring. This type of analysis necessarily includes consideration of uses and users of
groundwater in all subareas of the basin that are hydrologically connected to the common
source. As an alternative to a mass balance calculation, overdraft can sometimes be
demonstrated "by evidence of observed physical conditions in the Basin, such as declining
underground water levels, seawater intrusion, declining water quality, or land subsidence over
time ...." (Santa Maria Groundwater Litigation (Super. Ct. Santa Clara County, 2004, No.
770214) Phase 3, at p. 6.) Lowering of groundwater levels alone over a relatively short period
of time, however, Is generally not sufficient evidence to indicate overdraft of the basin.
"Generally, neither overdraft nor safe yield can be determined by looking at a groundwater basin
in a single year but must be determined by evaluating the basin conditions over a sufficient
period of time to determine whether pumping rates have or will lead to eventual permanent
lowering of the water level in the aquifer and ultimately depletion of the water supply or other
harm." (Antelope Valley Groundwater Cases (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, 2011, No. BC
325201) Statement of Decision Phase Three Trial, at p. 4, 010624 [citing City of Los Angeles v.
City of San Femando. supra, 14 Cal.3d at pp. 278-279.].)
Extraction of water from a basin not in overdraft can still result in injury to other users, however.
Impacts such as lowered groundwater leveis, subsidence, seawater intrusion, or interference
with surface water can occur even if the basin is not in an overall state of decline.9 Naturally
occurring changes in groundwater storage and groundwater elevation follow the hydrologic
cycle both seasonally and over a period of years. Reasonable fluctuations that do not cause
undesirable results are within the allowable bounds of the sustainable yield of the basin. (See
Krieger and Banks, 1962, Ground Water Basin Management, Vol. 50, Issue 1 of California Law
Review, at p. 57.) Conversely, extractions that contribute to undesirable results are wrongful,
even if the condition is relatively temporary. (See Santa Maria Groundwater Litigation (Super.
Ct. Santa Clara County, 2007, No. 770214) Partial Statement of Decision re Trial Phase 4, at
pp. 6-7, 010590-010594 [finding that adverse use of groundwater may occur for purposes of
prescription even when the basin is ultimately recharged during later years of abundant

9 This section does not explicitly address injury that may occur from circumscribed impacts to groundwater levels from extractions (i.e., a cone of depression) that may interfere with extractions from nearby wells, That type of injury has not been raised in this case.

precipitation.]; Newport v. Temescal Water Co. (1906) 149 Cal. 531, 536 [discussing damages
for temporary lowering of the water table that increased pumping costs]; Allen v. Cal. Water &
Telephone Co. (1946) 29 Cal.2d 466, 485-486 [finding that where there is a threat danger of
salt water intrusion, overlying owners are entitled to protection "against any exportation of the
water that would unduly increase their costs or lower the groundwater level below the danger
point."]; City of Lodi v. East Bay Municipal District, supra,7 Cal.2d at p. 345 [holding that the city
has a right to maintenance of groundwater levels above the "danger level" to protect its
municipal supply].) Although a reduction in groundwater levels may be temporary and may be
caused in part by current hydrologic conditions, senior right holders may call on junior right
holders to cease their diversions where the,senior is sustaining material costs or reductions in
pumping capacity.

6.1.4 Priority of Right
If a basin is determined to be in overdraft or groundwater conditions are causing an undesirable
result, a determination of injury and the extent of injury requires consideration of the relative
priority of users of water from the common source. In the case of a basin with highly
Interconnected groundwater and surface water, this analysis will include both surface and
groundwater users. Such an analysis does not necessarily require a right-by-right adjudication
but can be based on estimates of other users' rights and demands. For example, the State
Water Board routinely considers the relative rights and priorities of other water users in
reviewing new applications for a permit to appropriate water to determine whether water is
available for appropriation and in enforcement actions to determine whether a particular user
has diverted water out of priority. Both determinations require a general consideration of other
users of water and their respective rights, and the courts have consistently confirmed the need
to consider water rights priorities in apportioning liability when demands exceed the available
supply.(See, e.g., El Dorado Irrigation Dist. v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (2006) 142
Cal.App.4th 937, 961.) Typically, however, resolution of these types of water rights disputes will
not require a comprehensive adjudication that includes every user in the basin. The relative
priority of users can often be considered by category or class; for example, by considering the
rights of overlying users and riparian right holders as a single block of demand, or blocks of
demand within subareas of a basin, without parsing the relative rights of each user vis-à-vis one
another: Whether certain details of relative priority are or are not relevant will depend on the
particular case.

39

6.2 Analysis of Injury in the Salinas River Basin
The parties agree that water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin
must be considered when determining whether riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley
and Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014 and 2015.
The difference between the parties' arguments is the degree of specificity that each asserts is
necessary to prove injury to senior overlying or riparian users.

As a general matter, all uses and users of water from a common source must be considered to
determine injury to a senior correlative right holder. First, consideration of other uses and users
S necessary to determine whether the senior right holder's use is reasonable, as there is no
right to the wasteful or unreasonable use of water. Second, where the available supply is
Insufficient to meet the needs of all correlative users, other uses and users must be considered
to establish the scope of the senior right in question. Finally, other uses and users must be
considered in determining causation - whether it was diversions by the defendant or by other
users that caused the alleged injury to the senior right holder.
Article X, section 2, of the California Constitution prohibits all users of water, under any basis of
right, from wasting or unreasonably using water. What constitutes a "reasonable use" is a fact-
specific inquiry that must be made in the context of the particular geography, hydrologic
circumstances, and local conditions. "[W]hat is a reasonable use of water depends on the
circumstances of each case, such an inquiry cannot be resolved in vacuo isolated from
statewide considerations of transcendent importance." (Joslin v. Marin Mun. Water Dist. (1967)
67 Cal.2d 132, 140.) The reasonable use doctrine requires an analysis of all the competing
uses on a stream or river, and the public's interest in the waters of the state more generally.
"[T]he reasonablèness of a riparian use cannot be determined without considering the effect of
such use on all the needs of those in the stream system." (Light v. State Water Resources
Control Bd., supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 1479 [quoting In re Waters of Long Valley Creek
Stream System (1979) 25 Cal.3d 339, 354.J.) This type of inquiry necessarily involves
consideration of other uses and users diverting from the same source,

The demands of other correlative users in the basin must also be considered to determine the
quantity of water to which a correlative user has a right if total correlative demands exceed
available supply. "Necessity is not the sole measure of right in such cases." (Verdugo Canon
Water Co. V. Verdugo (1908) 152 Cal. 655, 667.) In shortage, the overlying right is "defined in
relation to other overlying water right holders in the basin." (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water
Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1253.) Although this analysis may not always be necessary to

40

determine whether an overlying right holder has been injured, it is necessary to determine the
extent of injury. For example, where a junior appropriator has diverted water out of priority at a
time of insufficient supply to satisfy senior demands, a senior overlying user may be able to a
demonstrate injury based on evidence of the state of overdraft and the out-of-priority diversion.
But the senior user cannot demonstrate the quantity of water to which he or she was entitled,
thät is, the extent of damages, without evidence of the demands of all other correlative users
with rights to extract from the common source.

Finally, consideration of other uses and users of water in the basin or watershed are often
necessary to establish causation. Where a senior right holder alleges that water was
unavailable to it because of the diversions of a junior user, resulting in injury, the junior may
defend that the diversions of even more junior users or illegal diversions, are the cause of the
unavailability. The Agency may, in its defense, point to other users in the basin alleged to be
taking water in excess of their rights, or without any valid basis of right, thereby contributing to
overdraft and injury.

The Agency asserts that the Coalition's claims of injury are procedurally defective and should be
dismissed because other water users in the basin have not been joined in this action. (Agency
Opening Brief, 000029-000033.) In many cases, however, a determination of whether a
category of right-holders has been injured can be made without reaching the scope and validity
of individual rights. A finding of injury to any particular plaintiff will of course depend in part on
.whether the plaintiff's water right is valid, and the degree of injury will depend on the scope of
that right. But insofar as the injured right holders are considered as a class, whether injury has
occurred to a class of right-holders can be determined while reserving the details as to the
validity of particular rights and the extent of injury. This report does not address the legal
question of whether California Code of Civil Procedure section 3B9 requires the joinder of all
other right-holders whose use may need to be considered in adjudicating the Coalition's claims,
as the Board does not understand that question to have been referred by the court. This report
concludes only that a determination of the extent of individual rights and the relative priorities of
other users in the basin is likely unnecessary to determine whether any member of the Coalition
has been injured.
The Agency points to the case of Strong V. Baldwin, in which the plaintiff, defendant, and cross-
defendants claimed riparian rights. (Strong v. Baldwin (1908) 154 Cal. 150, 162; Agency
Opening Brief, 000030-000031.) The court declined to find and decree the relative rights to
water of each party given that there were at least nine other riparian users on the stream not

joined as parties to the action. "The extent of the riparian rights of the parties to this action
could not be determined without taking into consideration the rights of these other riparian
proprietors, as to which there was no evidence whatever, and concerning which there could, of
course, be no binding determination in the absence of such owners." (Strong v. Baldwin, supra
154 Cal. at p. 162.) Therefore, the court declined to adjudicate the proportions of water to which
each party was entitled. The holding in this case seems only to support the principle that all
riparian users must be joined a as parties to make a binding determination as to the relative
proportions of competing riparian rights.
Unlike Strong, this reference proceeding does not require a determination of relative rights
amongst individual riparian and overlying users. Here, the defendant is a junior appropriator,
and holds a water right that is junior in priority to all of the overlying and riparian users in the
basin. A determination of the relative rights of the overlying and riparian users is unnecessary
to determine whether the defendant's diversions injured the rights of overlying and riparian
users as a class. Insofar as the members of the Coalition are in fact overlying or riparian right-
holders, all of their priorities of right as respecting those of the Agency are the same. In a
procedural ruling granting a motion to quash in the proceeding that resulted in Decision 1642,
the Board's hearing officer ruled that for purposes of determining water availability, it was the
amount extracted by overlying landowners in the aggregate, and not the amount that was
extracted by any individual user, that was relevant to the hearing issues. (Order Quashing
Subpoena of Clients of Mr. Maloney, July 6, 2000, 008648.) As stated in the Board's final
decision, "[a] determination of whether water is available ... including a determination of whether
senior rights are harmed, can be accomplished without adjudicating water rights." (State Water
Board Decision 1642 (2001), 005294-005295.) The same is true here.
The Agency may defend that the use of water by members of the Coalition was not reasonable
or beneficial. When seeking a remedy other than a declaration of relative rights, the burden is
on the riparian or overlying user claiming injury to prove the quantity of water necessary for their
reasonable beneficial purposes. (Tulare Irrigation Dist. v.Lindsay Strathmore Irrigation Dist.
(1935) 3' Cal.2d 489, 535.) Upon such proof, the burden shifts to the appropriator to
demonstrate available surplus. "[W]hen one enters a field of water supply and seeks by
appropriation-to take water from such supply on the claim that there is more than sufficient for
all reasonable beneficial uses by those who have the prior and preferential right, it would seem
to comport with the principles of fairness and justice that the appropriator, in whatever way the

42

issue may arise, should have the burden of proving that such excess exists." (Peabody v. City
of Vallejo, supra, 2 Cal.2d at p. 381.)
The Agency appears to take the position that no claim of injury by a riparian or overlying right-
holder may be sustained without the joinder of every other riparian or overlying user in the
watershed. Although procedural questions as to the joinder of indispensable parties is not an
issue referred to the Board, the Board notes that such a holding would seem to render riparian
and overlying rights essentially unenforceable absent a comprehensive adjudication. Although
the Agency points to the court's opinion in Santa Barbara Channelkeeper v. City of San
Buenaventura as an example, that case concerned a permissive cross-complaint under section
428.10 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Santa Barbara Channelkeeper v. City of San
Buenaventura (2018) 19 Cal.App.5th 1176 (Channelkeeper).) The appellate court allowed the
City's cross-complaint because the causes of action arose out of the same transaction alleged
in the Initial complaint - diversion of water that allegedly reduced surface flows in the Ventura
River in a manner that was unreasonable and harmed public trust resources. The court did not
hold that joinder of all water users in the basin was necessary to sustain the underlying cause of
action. Moreover, the cross-complaint in Channelkeeper was filed by a relatively senior water a
right holder seeking to establish that before its diversions were curtailed to protect instream
flows more junior right holders should be curtailed. The issue of whether the rights of those
more senior to the cross-complainant could be addressed in the aggregate instead of adjoining
each individual more senior right holder was not raised or addressed.

6.3 Comments and Objections to the Draft Report
Comments by the Agency:

The Agency generally concurs with the following conclusions in the Draft Report: (1) an analysis
of the degree of injury to a particular right holder would require consideration of the scope of
that right and, where correlative rights are involved, this exercise involves consideration though
not necessarily adjudication of all the correlative users in the basin; and (2) that determining
whether the use and method of diversion of an allegedly injured water right holder is reasonable requires consideration of other water users in the basin and current conditions. (Agency
Comments on Draft Report, 011434-011435.) The Agency sought only a clarification of its
position as to the asserted procedural defects in the Coalition's claims of injury. (ld., 011435-
011436.)

43

The Agency states in its comments on the Draft Report, that it has "no interest in adjudicating
the water rights of the Basin or the Salinas River," and that it is not taking the position that "an
adjudication is necessary." (ld., 011435.) The Agency is, however, taking the position that the
Coalition's water rights claims are procedurally defective and therefore should be dismissed
pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 389 and other applicable law because of the failure
to join all other water users (or at least all other correlative users) in the basin. (lbid.) The in
Board has attempted to clarify the characterization of the Agency's position in this final report.
Comments by the Coalition:

The Coalition agrees with the conclusion in the Draft Report that a right-by-right determination is
not necessary to determine whether injury occurred to Coalition members from the Agency's
operation of Nacimiento Reservoir in 2014 and. 2015. (Coalition Comments on Draft Report, at
011465.) The Coalition requests that the final report address an alleged change in the Agency's
legal position on this question. (lbid.) The Board declines to do so because any change in the
Agency's position is not relevant to the questions referred by the court.
The Coalition further comments on a matter relevant to the Board's analysis on issues (c) and
(d). Although the Coalition generally concurs with the Board's description of injury to a water
right, the Coalition objects to the Draft Report's conclusion that a demonstration of overdraft is a
necessary prerequisite to show injury. (ld., 011466-011468.) The Coalition's comments on this
point are well taken, and this final report Includes a discussion of the terms "safe yield,"
"sustainable yield," and "overdraft" as used in this report. This final report has been amended to
use the term "overdraft" to mean the long-term extraction of groundwater in excess of the safe
a yield, such that, over time, results in a chronic lowering of groundwater levels and depletion of
the available supply. "Overdraft" as generally used in California case law does not include
extractions that cause other types of undesirable results without a long-term decline in
groundwater levels. (See, e.g., City of Los Angeles v. City of San Fernando, supra, 14 Cal.3d at
pp. 278-279.) Given this definition of overdraft, which is narrower than that presumed in the
Draft Report, the Board agrees with the Coalition's argument that a senior correlative right
holder can demonstrate injury resulting from groundwater conditions in the basin without
demonstrating that the basin is in overdraft.

6.4 Findings and Conclusions
The State Water Board finds and conciudes that water use in other subareas of the Basin must
be considered to determine injury to an overlying or riparian right holder. Where the common

44

supply is insufficient to meet the needs of all correlative users, other uses and users must be
considered to establish the scope of any senior right in question. Consideration of other uses
and users is also necessary to determine the reasonableness and therefore the validity and
extent of any allegedly injured right. Finally, other uses and users must be considered in
determining whether the defendant's diversions or diversions by other users caused the alleged
injury. In general, whether injury has occurred to senior correlative users as a class, a can be
determined while reserving the details as to the validity of particular rights and the extent of
injury. Therefore, a right-by-right evaluation is likely unnecessary in this case to determine
whether members of the Coalition were injured by the Agency's operation of Nacimiento
Reservoir in 2014 and 2015.

7.0 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Issue (a): Whether the Agency has violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing
Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089
(Application 30532) by releasing less than 60 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of water from
Nacimiento Reservoir during the period from June 4, 2014, through May 27, 2015.
The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency has not violated the Flow
Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River in License 7543
(Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532).
Issue (b): If the Board .concludes the Agency did not comply with the 60 cfs water release
requirement of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River,
whether such failure reduced recharge that otherwise would have been provided to the Salinas
River Groundwaler Basin's ("Basin") Upper Valley and Forebay subareas and, if so, whether
that recharge reduction reduced water availability (i.e., groundwater elevations and groundwater
quality) for any riparian and overlying rights in the Upper Valley and Forebay subareas.
This issue need only be addressed if the Agency violated the Flow Prescription for Spawning
and Rearing Habitat in the Nacimiento River addressed in issue (a). Because the Board
concludes that the Agency was not in violation of the Flow Prescription for Spawning and
Rearing Habitat, issue (b) is not addressed further.
Issue (c): Whether the Agency's appropriative water rights for Nacimiento and San Antonio
reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624(Application 16761) and Permit
21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any downstream. riparian and overlying
water rights in the Sallnas River and Basin.

The State Water Board finds and concludes that the Agency's appropriative water rights for
Nacimiento and San Antonio reservoirs - License 7543 (Application 16124), License 12624
(Application 16761) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532) - are junior in priority to any
downstream riparian and overlying water rights in the Salinas River and Basin. Questions about
water that may be diverted out of priority, such as salvage water or pursuant to a physical
solution where replacement water is provided, will be addressed in Phase 2 of this proceeding.
Issue (d): To what extent, if any, must water use in other subareas of the Salinas Valley
Groundwater Basin be considered in concluding whether riparian and overlying rights in the
Upper Valley and Forebay subareas were injured by the Agency's reservoir operations in 2014
and 2015.

The State Water Board finds and concludes that water use in other subareas of the Basin must
be considered to determine injury to an overlying or riparian right holder. Where the common
supply is insufficient to meet the needs of all correlative users, other uses and users must be
considered to establish the scope of any senior right in question. Consideration of other uses
and úsers is also necessary to determine the reasonableness and therefore the validity and
extent of any allegedly injured right.. Finally, other uses and users must be considered in
determining whether the defendant's diversions or diversions by other users caused the alleged
injury. In general, whether injury has occurred to senior correlative users as a class, can be
determined while reserving the details as to the validity.of particular rights and the extent of
injury. Therefore, a right-by-right evaluation is likely unnecessary in this case to determine
whether members of the Coalition were injured by the Agency's operation of Nacimiento
Reservoir in 2014 and 2015.

1 I. INTRODUCTION

t cn v Respondents/Defendants MONTEREY COUNTY WATER RESOURCES AGENCY (the
"Agency"); BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF MONTEREY COUNTY WATER RESOURCES
AGENCY; BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MONTEREY COUNTY WATER RESOURCES

5 AGENCY; COUNTY OF MONTEREY; and BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY

6 OF MONTEREY (collectively "Respondents") hereby respectfully submit this exception to the

7 January 2019 Report of Referee lodged by the State Water Resources Control Board (the "2019

8 Report'). Respondents do not take exception to the State Water Board's conclusions in the 2019

9 Report. However, the 2019 Report's reference to California's rules of contract interpretation is

10 inconsistent with the Report's reasoning and ultimate conclusion that extrinsic evidence offered

11 by Petitioner/Plaintiff Salinas Valley Water Coalition should not be considered in the face of the

12 plain meaning of the Nacimiento Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription. In interpreting the
dTT INVIE AANMOI 13 Agency's water rights, the Court should apply California's rules of statutory interpretation and

14 refuse to insert additional terms into the Agency's water rights. Instead, the Court should direct

15 the State Water Board to continue the reference proceeding and address the remaining issues set

16 out by order of this Court.

17 II. BACKGROUND

18 In response to this Court's August 1, 2017 and September 8, 2017 orders, the State Water

19 Resources Control Board (the "State Water Board") issued its Report of Referee dated January

20 2019 (the "2019 Report). The 2019 Report addresses the four issues identified as Issues (a)

21 through (d) in paragraph 3 of this Court's September 8, 2017 order. As to Issue (a), the 2019

22 Report concluded that the Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription contained within the

23 Agency's water right License 7543 (Application 16124) and Permit 21089 (Application 30532)

24 "did not require the Agency to make minimum releases from Nacimiento Reservoir in 2014 and

25 2015, either before or after May 31, because there was no first adult steelhead passage day in

26 either calendar year to trigger the requirement." (2019 Report, at 19.) The 2019 Report relies on

27 the plain language of the Agency's water rights and concludes that it unambiguously "operates on

28 a calendar year basis." (2019 Report, at 18-19; 24.)
2 1546432.1

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE I REFEREE REPORT

1 In responding to objections asserted by the Coalition, the State Water Board stated that it

2 interprets the Agency's water rights "in the same manner as a contract or other legal document."

3 (2019 Report, at 25.) Although the Respondents agree with the State Water Board's ultimate

4 conclusion that the release requirement was not triggered, the Respondents take exception to the

5 State Water Board's reference to the California rules of contract interpretation for interpreting a

6 permit term, Instead, the State Water Board should rely on standards of statutory interpretation

7 that preclude the use of extrinsic evidence to counter the plain meaning of a permit term that is

8 unambiguous on its face.

9 III. ARGUMENT

10 A. Respondents Raised its Exception to the State Water Board.

11 Water Code section 2017 provides that a party may file an exception to a report of the

12 State Water Board as referee. Such an exception will not be considered unless it had first been
d'TI INVHE ARNMOI 13 raised before the State Water Board in the form of an objection. (Wat. Code, § 2018.) Here,

14 Respondents take exception to the State Water Board's reference to California rules of contract

15 interpretation principles in its 2019 Report. This reference did not appear in the State Water

16 Board's draft report. (See generally Record of Proceeding, Bates No. 011362-011415.)

17 However, prior to the issuance of the 2019 Report, Respondents filed a Motion to Strike the

18 Coalition's Response to Phase 1 Draft Report of Referee and objected to the admission of
19 extrinsic evidence because the State Water Board should apply rules of statutory construction
20 when interpreting the permit term at issue here. (Record of Proceeding, Bates No. 011299-

21 011300.) The State Water Board declined to address this argument because it excluded the

22 Coalition's extrinsic evidence as untimely. (Record of Proceeding, Bates No. 011358.)

23 However, if the Court opts to consider the Coalition's extrinsic evidence before the State Water

24 Board so considers it, then it should consider the arguments raised by Respondents in the form of

25 objections to admission of the evidence.

26 B. Standard of Review

27 Courts treat the interpretation of a permit term by the State Water Board as an

28 interpretation of the State Water Board's own regulation. (North Gualala Water Co, v. State
3 1546432.1

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE I REFEREE REPORT

Water Resources Control Bd. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1607 (North Gualala).) An
2 administrative agency's interpretation of its own language is afforded "considerable deference"

3 unless the interpretation is "unauthorized, unreasonable, or clearly erroneous." (North Gualala,

4 supra, at p. 1607.)

5 C. The Rules of Statutory Interpretation Are More Suitable to the Interpretation
O of a Permit Because the Rules of Statutory Interpretation Afford Greater
Certainty to Permit Holders.

7 The 2019 Report incorrectly refers to California rules of contract interpretation in

8 responding to the Coalition's objections to the Board's interpretation of the plain meaning of the

9 Spawning and Rearing Flow Prescription. (2019 Report, at p. 25.) To avoid the confusion

10 created by the State Water Board's citation to California authorities for contract interpretation, the

11 Court should adopt the Report's conclusion, but clarify that such conclusion is based on the

12 application of principles of statutory construction, not contract interpretation.
JTT ONVHI AINMOC 13 The State Water Board starts with the proposition that "[p]ermits are to be interpreted in

14 the same manner as a contract or other legal document." (2019 Report, p. 25.) This proposition

15 is not supported by any authority, however. The State Water Board then cites two California

16 cases for some general background principles of contract interpretation. (Id., citing Founding

17 Members of the Newport Beach Country Club v. Newport Beach Country Club, Inc. (2003) 109

18 Cal.App.4th 944, 955; Titan Group, Inc. V. Sonoma Valley County Sanitation Dist. (1985) 164

19 Cal.App.3d 122, 127.) Specifically, the 2019 Report cites Founding Members of the Newport

20 Beach Country Club for the proposition that extrinsic evidence is admissible "to prove a meaning
21 to which the contract is reasonably susceptible." (2019 Report, at 25.) This is consistent with the

22 rule in California that

23 Extrinsic evidence is admissible to prove that a contract's term is ambiguous despite no

24 apparent ambiguity on the face of the contract. (Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. G.W. Thomas

25 Drayage Co. (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33, 38 (Pacific Gas).) Pacific Gas is a departure from the

26 traditional plain meaning rule of contract interpretation, whereby the interpretation of a contract is
27 limited to the contract's four corners and the words are given their plain meaning unless the

28 meaning is ambiguous. (See, e.g., J.F. Hall-Martin Co. v. Hughes (1912) 18 Cal. 513, 517 (J.F.

1546432.1 4

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE I REFEREE REPORT

1 Hall-Martin) [concluding that extrinsic evidence was inadmissible to interpret a contract that was

2 clear on its face].) Under the traditional rule, whether the contract is ambiguous is a matter of

3 law. (See Gardner v. Mozingo, (S.C. 1987) 358 S.E.2d 390, 392 (Gardner) [excluding extrinsic

4 evidence to prove the meaning of a term that was clear on its face and stating that the question of

5 ambiguity was a matter of law].) Thus, courts following the traditional rule only resort to
6 extrinsic evidence to resolve a term that is ambiguous on its face. (J.F. Hall-Martin, supra, at p.
517; Gardner, supra, at p. 392.)
Despite its citation to cases involving California rules of contract interpretation, the State

9 Water Board immediately contradicts such authorities with the statement that "extrinsic evidence

10 may not be relied upon to interpret a permit term unless the language is ambiguous . .. ." (2019

11 Report, p. 25, emphasis added; citing Piney Run Preservation Ass'n v. Cnty. Commissioners of

12 Carrol Cnty. (4th Cir. 2001) 268 F.3d 255,270 (Piney Run); Natural Resources Defense Council,
d'TT ANVNE AINMOC 13 Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (9th Cir. 2013) 725 F.3d 1194, 1205 (NRDC).) Each of these cases

14 involves the interpretation of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES")

15 permits. Both rely on contract interpretation authorities other than California's rules of contract

16 interpretation and its departure from the traditional rule limiting the use of extrinsic evidence.

17 Indeed, both cases support the proposition that extrinsic evidence cannot be used to prove a
18 permit term that is ambiguous.

19 Both cases reach the correct result because each relies on authorities that apply the
20 traditional plain meaning rule to contract interpretation. In Piney Run, the Fourth Circuit Court of

21 Appeals stated that "if 'the language is plain and capable of legal construction, the language alone

22 must determine' the permit's meaning." (Piney Run, supra, a p. 270, quoting FDIC v. Prince

23 George Corp. (4th Cir. 1995) 58 F.3d 1041, 1046 (FDIC).) FDIC, the case Piney Run relied on

24 for this proposition, involved an attempt to enforce a promissory note secured by real property,

25 (FDIC, supra, at p. 1046.) The court was applying South Carolina's rules for contract

26 interpretation. (Id. at p. 1045.) South Carolina follows the traditional plain meaning rule that

27 courts may only resort to extrinsic evidence when a contract is ambiguous on its face. (Gardner,

28 supra, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392.) The plaintiff in Gardner attempted to show on summary judgment

1546432.L

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE I REFEREE REPORT

1 that there was a disputed question of material fact based on extrinsic evidence that cast doubt on

2 the meaning of a contract term that was clear on its face. (Id. at p. 391.) The South Carolina

m Supreme Court upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgment because the instrument at
4 issue "was not ambiguous on its face. It only becomes ambiguous when extrinsic evidence is

5 considered." (Id. at p. 392.)

6 The other case relied on by the State Water Board, NRDC, relies on-a prior Ninth Circuit

7 authority for the proposition that '"[NPDES permit] terms are to be given their ordinary meaning,

8 and when the terms of a [permit] are clear, the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the

9 [permit] itself." (lbid., alterations in original, quoting Klamath Water Users Protective Ass'n y.

10 Patterson (9th Cir. 1999) 204 F.3d 1206, 1210 (Klamath Water).) The case the court relies on,

11 Klamath Water, involved the interpretation of a contract between the Bureau of Reclamation and

12 the private operator of Klamath Dam. Because the federal government was a party to the a
d'TT ONVHA AANMOI 13 contract, federal law controlled the interpretation of the agreement. (Klamath Water, supra, at p.
14 1210.) And the Ninth Circuit applied the traditional approach of contract interpretation to federal

15 contracts. (Ibid. "Contract terms are to be given their ordinary meaning, and when the terms of a

16 contract are clear, the intent of the parties must be ascertained from the contract itself."); see also
17 Trident Center v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co. (9th Cir. 1988) 847 F.2d 564, 569 (severely

18 criticizing California's departure from the plain meaning rule while applying it in a diversity a

19 action).)

20 Piney Run and NRDC apply the traditional plain meaning rule and in that way are

21 consistent with California's approach to statutory construction as opposed to contract

22 interpretation: A statute will be given its plain meaning unless the language is ambiguous.

23 Coburn v. Sievert (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1483, 1495.) Absent ambiguity, there is no need to

24 resort to extrinsic evidence. (Ibid.) Both Piney Run and NRDC relied on authorities that applied

25 the traditional plain meaning rule of contracts, without reference to traditional principles of

26 statutory interpretation. But in both, there was no discrepancy between applying principles of

27 contract interpretation and statutory construction because the rules of statutory and contract

28 interpretation in both jurisdictions all reject the use of extrinsic evidence to prove that a facially

1546432.1

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE REFEREE REPORT

• 1 clear term is ambiguous.

2 Such a focus on applying plain meaning comports with the State Water Board's own

3 historic sensitivity to permit-holders' needs for predictability. (See, e.g., In the Matter of Petition

4 for Changes in the Water Rights Authorizing Diversion and Use of Waters in the Watershed of the

5 Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (June 8, 1995) Order WR 95-6, 1995 WL 17907858
(Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta).) In Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the Department of Water

7 Resources and the Bureau of Reclamation urged the State Water Board to adopt their

8 recommendations for changes in the Bay-Delta water quality objectives, and to interpret all

9 permit conditions consistently with those recommendations. (Id, at *2 & *15.) The State Water

10 Board declined to do so. (ld. at *15.) It was swayed by concern that if such an approach to

11 interpretation was adopted, a permit term could "be read as providing an opening for substantially

12 changing a pèrmit or license term without notice." (Ibid.)
J'TT ONVNE AINMOC 13 Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta demonstrates the importance of applying the plain
14 meaning for the sake of permit-holders. In situations such as here, where the unambiguous
15 meaning of a permit's term is consistent with the purpose of that term, the State Water Board

16 should avoid upsetting the reasonable expectations of the permit holder that it can rely on the

17 permit's plain language.

18 The contrast between California's approach and the traditional plain meaning rule creates
19 a unique tension here. If the State Water Board were to apply California contract interpretation
20 principles to the interpretation of the permits it issues, it would be undermining the very certainty

21 that its permits are intended to convey. This is exactly what the Coalition is attempting to do in

22 this litigation; the interpretation proffered by the Coalition would insert additional flow

23 restrictions into the permit that was never part of the permit. The Coalition, of course, thinks its

24 proffered interpretation would enhance the protection of steelhead. But it is false to say that the

25 State Water Board's plain language interpretation does not serve the purpose of protecting

26 steelhead already. The fact that the protections might be greater than the plain language already
27 affords does not give the State Water Board license to unilaterally redefine a term that is

28 unambiguous with a definition that exceeds what the term's plain meaning supports. (Cf. Code
7 1546432.0

EXCEPTIONS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCE CONTROL BOARD'S PHASE I REFEREE REPORT

Civ. Proc., § 1858 [providing that the purpose of statutory construction is "not to insert what has

2 been omitted ...."]; California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28
Cal.3d 692, 698 ["If the words of the statute are clear, the court should not add to or alter them to
accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative
history." [interior quotation marks and citations omitted]].) In addition to exceeding the

6 permissible boundaries of construction, doing so would undermine the predictability afforded by

7 the permit process. (Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, supra, Order WR 95-6, 1995 WL

8 17907858, *15.)

9 In the end, the State Water Board's own analysis refuses to inject such uncertainty in the
10 permit at issue by refusing to admit extrinsic evidence to prove that the permit is ambiguous. To

11 resolve this tension between the State Water Board's citation to contract interpretation authorities

12 and its refusal to use extrinsic evidence to vary the terms of the unambiguous permit, the Court
d'TI ONVHI AUNMOI 13 should apply the rule of statutory interpretation that, absent ambiguity, there is no need to resort

14 to extrinsic evidence to construe a statute. (Coburn v. Sievert, supra, 133 Cal.App.4th 1483,

15 1495.) Doing so would protect the expectations of permit holders while remaining consistent

16 with California law.

17 IV. CONCLUSION

18 The difference between California's rules for statutory construction and contract

19 interpretation means that California authorities on contract interpretation and statutory

20 construction are not interchangeable. To preserve the reliability and predictability of permits, the

21 State Water Board's decision that the permit term is unambiguous should rely solely on principles

22 of statutory construction, and the Court should reject references in the 2019 Report to cases

23 relating to California authorities on contract interpretation.
