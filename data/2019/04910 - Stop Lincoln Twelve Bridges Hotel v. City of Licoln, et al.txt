16 Respondents

17 JG LAND & INVESTMENT, LLC., a

18 Limited Liability Corporation; and DOES 21-40

19 1. Petitioner Stop Lincoln Twelve Bridges Hotel petitions this Court for a Writ of
20 Mandate, directed to Respondents City of Lincoln and City Council of the City of Lincoln
21 ("Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' October 22, 2019, approval of La Quinta
22 Inns & Suites - Conditional Use Permit and Specific Development Plan and Development
23 Permit ("Project"). The Project is the construction and operation of a four story, 104 room
24 56,914 square foot La Quinta Inn & Suites and associated site improvements on property within
25 the Main Village area of Twelve Bridges. Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals for
26 the Project violate the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code

27 section 21000 et seq., City of Lincoln Municipal Code section 18.56.010 and Government Code

28 §§ 65300 et seq. et Petitioner alleges as follows:

FNm tnnOn co PARTIES

2. Petitioner Stop Lincoln Twelve Bridges Hotel is an unincorporated association
whose mission is to protect and enhance the environment and community in the City of Lincoln.
Members of Petitioner have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that
Respondents comply with CEQA, the Lincoln Municipal Code, and the State Planning and
Zoning Law. Members live, work and/or recreate in City of Lincoln and throughout the areas
that will be impacted by the Project. Petitioner's members have long-standing interests in the
area adjacent to the Project site, as well as in the surrounding community and City as a whole.

9 Petitioner's members' environmental, aesthetic and property interests will be severely injured if

10 the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance with CEQA and all other

11 applicable laws. Petitioner's members enjoy the City's and State's natural resources.

12 Petitioner's members will be harmed by the Project unless court action is taken and Petitioner's

13 requested relief is granted. Petitioner brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly
14 situated who are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners.
15 Petitioner is within the class of persons and entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by,

16 the acts of Respondents as alleged below. Petitioner and its members participated in the
17 administrative processes herein, with many members submitting comment letters and objecting

18 tO the Project. Petitioner and its members have exhausted their remedies. Accordingly,

19 Petitioner has standing to sue.

20 3. Respondent City of Lincoln is a political subdivision of the State of California and

21. a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. City of Lincoln is the CEQA -

22 "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the City of Lincoln is responsible

23 for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and if

24 necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant

25 environmental impacts. The City also has principal responsibility for determining whether

26 projects within its jurisdiction are consistent with applicable land use ordinances and other

27 applicable laws.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

- 4. Respondent City Council of the City of Lincoln is a legislative body duly
authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on
m t uno behalf of the City of Lincoln. Respondent City Council of the City of Lincoln is responsible for|
regulating and controlling land use within the City including, but not limited to, implementing
and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of
Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable land use ordinances
7 and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City, the City Council
8 establishes overall City priorities and sets policy. The City Council is the governing body of the|
9 County and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project.
10 5. Real Party in Interest JG Land & Investments, LLC is a California limited liability
11 corporation. Real Party in Interest JG Land & Investments, LLC is the applicant for the Project
12 and the recipient of the Project approvals. The City of Lincoln's October 25, 2019, Notice of
13 Exemption, however, fails to identify Real Party in Interest JG Land & Investment as entity
14 carrying out the Project and instead states the City of Lincoln will be carrying out the Project.
15 6. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and 21|
16 through 40, inclusive, and sue such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
17 respectively, by their fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believe, and based thereon
18 alleges, that fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are responsible for all
19 acts and omissions described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents and
20 Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary,
21 amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.
22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
24 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the
25 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and
26 Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

- 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
California in and for the County of Placer pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code
of Civil Procedure.
†1000 BACKGROUND FACTS

A. THE PROJECT AND PROJECT SITE

9. The Project entails the construction of a four story, 104 room, 56,914 square foot
La Quinta Inns & Suites and associated site improvements on vacant property within the Main
8 Village area of Twelve Bridges. The property is located directly north of the existing Terra
9 Cotta Village (currently partially constructed with two buildings and site improvements), on the
10 east side of Colonnade Drive, and south of the future extension of Red Rock Road. (Assessor's

11 Parcel Number 329-010-068.)

12 10. The property is bounded by General Commercial (GC-1) zoned properties to the
13 north, east, and south (Terra Cotta Village) and Employment Center (EC) zoned property to the
14 west (see below). The site is 3.1 acres in size. The La Quinta Inn & Suites and associated
15 improvements are proposed on 1.73 acres, while the remainder of the property is to be set aside
16 for review of a building at a later date. The La Quinta is proposed be located in the middle part
17 of the property (on an east-west axis) and approximately 70-feet west of the eastern property
18 line. The building elevations will be visible on all sides.

19 B. APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

20 11. On August 21,2019 the Planning Commission voted 5-2 to approve Resolution No.l
21 2019-40 approving a Conditional Use Permit and Resolution No. 2019-39 approving the Specific
22 Development Plan and Development Permit for the operation of La Quinta Inns & Suites. As
23 part of the approval, the Planning Commission held that the Project is categorically exempt from |
24 the environmental review requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
25 Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. per CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

26 12. On August 30, 2019, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the Planning
27 Commission's approval of the Project. Petitioner's appeal challenged the Planning
28 Commission's determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines,

-

N section 15183; the Planning Commission's resolution approving the Specific Development Plan
and Development Permit (Design Review); and the Planning Commission's resolution approving]
71no the Conditional Use Permit for the operation of the La Quinta Inn & Suites.
13. On October 22, 2019, the City Council adopted Resolution 2019-242 denying
Petitioner's appeal and upholding the Planning Commission's Resolution No. 2019-40 and

7 Resolution No. 2019-39. The City Council also upheld the Planning Commission's

8 determination that the Project is exempt from environmental review under CEQA Guidelines
section 15183.

9 14.

10 On October 25, 2019, Respondents filed a Notice of Exemption with the County

11 Clerk of Placer County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

13 15. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

14 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

15 16. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

16 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written

17 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

18 17. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

19 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings

20 relating to this action.

21 18. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

23 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in

24 effect in violation of State law.

25 19. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the Notice of

26 Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(d).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

2 20. STANDING

NOU A U Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because 1

Petitioner's aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by|
Respondents' approval of the Project.

21. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

8 overturn Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

9 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioner's attorneys' fees in actions to

this action.

10 agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question in

11

12 CAUSES OF ACTION

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion

14 22. Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

15

16 Petitioner realleges and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 21.
23.

17

18 Respondents' action in determining the Project is categorically exempt violates

19 CEQA in that Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law and their decision to
approve the Project based upon a categorical exemption is not supported by substantial evidence.
24.

20 Respondents determined the Project was exempt under CEQA Guidelines section

21

22 15183. Section 15183 provides for an exemption from further environmental review for projects
that are

23 consistent with the development density established by existing zoning, community plan
or general plan policies for which an EIR was certified. Section 15183, however, does not

24

25 exempt analysis of impacts that are "peculiar to" the parcel or the project if those impacts were
not addressed as significant impacts in the previous EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15183(a).)

26

27 Section 15183 also does not exempt analysis of significant impacts that are peculiar to the parcel
or project if substantial new information shows that -

28 the impact will be more severe than was
described in the prior EIR. Thus, significant impacts peculiar to the parcel or project that were

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

P not evaluated or that were treated as insignificant in the previous EIR are not exempt from
~ further review.
au A w 25. Public Resources Code section 21083.3(c) requires that the City must make a
finding that any mitigation measures in the prior EIR that apply to the project's specific effects
will be undertaken. If the required finding relating to an applicable mitigation measure is not
made, then the related significant effect is not exempt from further environmental review. (See
Pub. Resources Code, § 21083(c); see also CEQA Guidelines, § 15183(e).)
c 26. The Planning Commission's Resolution states that "the project shall comply with
9 the Subsequent Environmental Impact Report for the Revised Twelve Bridges Specific Plan EIR
10 Mitigation Measures." The Resolution, however, fails to identify which specific mitigation
11 measures apply to this project and instead just makes a general statement about compliance with
12 mitigation measures.

13 27. There are impacts that are "peculiar to" the parcel or the project that were not
14 addressed as significant impacts in the previous environmental documents. (CEQA Guidelines,
15 § 15183(a).) For example, with the brief exception of noise, nothing in the SEIR discusses
16 hotels within the general commercial area. Nothing in the SEIR addresses the impacts of placingl
17 a hotel adjacent to or in close proximity to a school or a residential neighborhood. Also, nothing|
18 in the SEIR addresses the construction of a four-story structure that may impact aesthetics and
19 views from the adjacent neighborhood.

20 28. Section 15183 also does not exempt analysis of significant impacts that are peculiar|
21 to the parcel or project if substantial new information shows that the impact will be more severe
22 than was described in the prior EIR. As the SEIR did not address or discuss hotels within -
23 General Commercial area, the public has provided substantial new information that placing a
24 hotel in this particular location will impact residential uses as well as the future/under
25 construction schools.

26 29. In order for section 15183 to apply the Project must be consistent with the General
27 Plan. (See Guidelines, § 15183(d)(1)(C); see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21083.3(a)-(b).) The
28 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

Project is not consistent with the General Plan with respect to Floor Area Ratio ("FAR"). (See
discussion below.)
m +10D 0g 30. Reliance on CEQA Guidelines section 15183 for an exemption from further
environmental review is not consistent with CEQA's requirements. Thus, the City's reliance
upon section 15183 violates CEQA and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is
contrary to law.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of City of Lincoln Municipal Code § 18.56.010; Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5)
31. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 30. 10
32. Lincoln Municipal Code section 18.56.010 provides that "The consideration of a 11

12 conditional use permit application shall result in the issuance of written findings in support of

13 the planning commission decision, which shall be based on substantial evidence in view of the

14 whole record. To grant a conditional use permit, the planning commission shall find that the

15 establishment, maintenance or operation of the use, building or structure applied for will not,
under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, 16

17 comfort or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed

18 use or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the

19 general welfare of the city."

33. As a result the City must make findings that (1) that the use is substantially similar 20

21 in characteristic to a use or uses currently within the district; (2) that the use would be

22 appropriate in the district applicable to the property a as a permitted or conditional use; (3) that the

23 proposed use, with the appropriate conditions, will not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace

24 and morals, comfort and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood or

25 injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the city;

26 and (4) that at least one of the findings in Section 15.32.250 of the municipal code is satisfied.
34. Respondents' Findings and 3 do not adequately address the required finding and 27

28 are not supported by substantial evidence.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

P 35. Substantial evidence does not support the finding that the Project is substantially
2 similar in characteristic to the uses currently within the district. Respondents' findings that the
c t v' 0 Project is substantially similar in characteristics to uses currently within the District. Moreover,
the findings with respect to the proposed use do not address the construction and operation of a .
hotel at this location, but instead focuses on the size of the building, the set-backs and
landscaping. The findings also fail to address how the use of a hotel is consistent or
7 substantially similar to uses such as the high school and other schools currently planned for the
8 area. Also, the hotel will be four stories and significantly taller than other structures in the

9 vicinity and quite visible from nearby neighborhoods. A four story building is not similar in
10 characteristic to the uses currently within the district.

11 36. Substantial evidence does not support the finding that the Project will not be
12 detrimental to the health, safety, peace and morals, comfort and general welfare of the persons
13 residing or working the neighborhood or injurious to property and improvements in the
14 neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City. Respondents failed to adequately address the
15 hotel's proximity to homes and a school.

16 37. As Respondents' findings are not supported by substantial evidence, approval of
17 the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 2 s (Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.; Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

38. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 37.
21 39. The State Planning and Zoning Law prohibits the City from approving the Project
22 if it conflicts with its General Plan and other applicable land use plans. Local land use and
23 development decisions must be consistent with the applicable general plan. (Families Unafraid

24 to Uphold Rural etc. County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336
25 (FUTURE).) "A project is consistent with the general plan "if, considering all its aspects, it
26 will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." -L
27 [Citation.] A given project need not be in perfect conformity with each and every general plan
28

9 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 policy. [Citation.] To be consistent, a project must be *compatible with' the objectives,

wO Ut m 7 policies, general land uses and programs specified in the general plan." (Ibid.)
40. The record demonstrates that the Project is not consistent with the applicable
General Plan regarding Floor Area Ratio ("FAR"). Under the General Plan, the Project site has
a. maximum FAR of 0.35. (General Plan, Page 4-4, table 4.1.) As approved, the FAR is 0.42,

7 which exceeds the maximum 0.35. On the Project site for just the hotel, which is 1.73, the FAR
is 0.76, more than double allowed under the General Plan.
8 41.

9 As the Project is inconsistent with a critical portion of the General Plan, and it is

10 that inconsistency that leads to a structure significantly larger than nearby structures and that

11 may have aesthetic impacts, approval of the Project violates the State Planning and Zoning
Law.

12 42.

13 As the Project conflicts with the General Plan and the General Plan,
the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law. approval of
