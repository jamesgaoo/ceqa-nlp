3 injunctive relief against Respondents and Defendants City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles

7 subsequent actions in approving a variance from the Los Angeles Municipal Code

8 ("LAMC"), and a finding of Categorical Exemption from the California Environmental

9 Quality Act ("CEQA"). The entitlements granted by the City enable the owner of a new,
10 mixed-use building comprising the addresses of 6150-6240 West Hollywood

8 13 3,707 sq. ft. storefront on the ground floor of the seven story project as a boxing
Pasadena, 14 gymnasium/health club, which is a use not permitted by the underlying zoning. The
15 variance granted to the owner provides relief from the restrictions of LAMC Section
16 12.16.A.2(p) and Los Angeles Ordinance 177,103, which prohibit gymnasiums, health
17 clubs and other similar uses in the C4 Commercial Zone. ("Land Use Entitlements").

18 2. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's determination
19 that the Project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), based
20 upon violations of CEQA.

21 3. Petitioner further alleges that the City's approval of a variance from the

22 LAMC violates Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") Section 12.27.D and City Charter

23 Section 562. Petitioner also alleges that the City's Planning Department exceeded its
24 authority under Charter Section 561 in approving the variance. Petitioner seeks a writ of
25 mandamus invalidating and setting aside the variance and other entitlements granted for
26 the Project.

- 5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Project approvals.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 2

3 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Does Not Comply with CEQA)
4 23. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 22, inclusive, of this Petition.
24. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to comply with the requirements
7 of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on the

8 project and associated environmental documentation. An agency must provide sufficient

9 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
10 consequences when acting on proposed projects.
% 8 11 25. The City's action in approving a Categorical Exemption for the Project
WHI MYT NIELSH3ATIS 3HL POSL-LOLI 12 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner

8 uuE 'enuary oßuaJEW qUON SIZ 13 required by law.
Pasadena, 14 26. Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires the CEQA Guidelines
15 to include a list of categories of projects which have been determined not to have a
16 significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the

17 provisions of CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15300). These exemptions are commonly
18 referred to as "categorical exemptions."

19 27. On its face, the CEQA exemption relied upon by Respondents does not
20 apply to the Project. The City exempted the Project from CEQA pursuant to the City's
21 CEQA Guidelines, Article III, Section One, Class 1, Category 22, stating "there is no
22 substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exemption pursuant

23 to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies."

24 28. The categorical exemption identified by the City applies to the granting or
25 renewal of a variance "for a nonsignificant change of use in an existing facility." By law,

of 26 it must be narrowly construed. Real Parties' proposed project does not fit into the scope
27 this exemption including because: (1) the site is not an existing facility, but the second
28 phase of a new 1.13 million sq. ft. mixed-use development consisting of 1,042 apartment
- 6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF M'ANDAMUS

1 units and 175,000 sq. ft. of commercial retail uses; (2) a gymnasium, health club and other

2 similar uses is not permitted by the site's underlying C4 Zone, which was sought by Real

3 Party in 2007 for its mixed-use development, which was approved by the City through its

4 approval of a Zone and Height District Change, and therefore the City's grant of a variance

5 to allow the gymnasium and other non-conforming uses involves a significant expansion of

6 use; (3) the 2007 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and Supplemental EIR for the

7 property's Zone and Height District Change did not analyze traffic, parking, noise and

8 other impacts related to the more intensive use of the prohibited gymnasium; and (4) the

9 applicant has received piecemeal approval to expand the scope of the development beyond
10 what was approved by the City in 2007 through its grant of the requested Zone and Height
11 District Change, seeking and receiving separate grants of variances for two other
%o APC *WAIH MY NIELSH3ATIS 3H1 OSL-LOLL6 12 gymnasium uses in the first phase of the mixed-use development, in addition to requesting

8 13 and receiving exceptions for otherwise unpermitted signage on the site, and further seeking
'euepesec 14 and receiving 17 alcohol licenses, all absent necessary environmental analysis. By
15 attempting to squeeze the Project into a narrow CEQA exemption that, on its face, does not
16 apply, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA,

17 29. CEQA further prohibits exemption of the Project from CEQA review

18 because there is a reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the
19 environment due to cumulative impacts. By CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2,
20 subdivision (b), "All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative
in the same place, over time is significant." 21 impact of successive Projects of the same type

22 By exempting the Project from environmental review under CEQA, in the face of a

23 demonstrated reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment,

24 Respondents further failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.

25 30. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis
26 in response to comments, to address recommendations and objections in detail, and to

27 explain why specific comments and suggestions, especially those of experts, were not

28 accepted. The City failed to respond adequately to comments regarding land use and
- 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 planning, noise, parking, and traffic and circulation.

2 31. As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in

3 that Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the

4 significant environmental impacts of the Project prior to the City's approval of the Project

5 and approval of the Project as Categorically Exempt.

6 32. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its

7 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and by
8 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, the City's approval of the finding

9 that the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA, and approval of the Project and the
10 Land Use Entitlements, must be set aside. Petitioner as well as members of the general
11 public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the POSL-L0LL6 OdV 'wHl MVI J001 p€ 'anuary North Mareng AAA SA OS SAIL 12 Project is allowed to operate in the absence of full and adequate CEQA review, and absent

8 13 compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.
Pasadena, 14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation Of LAMC § 12.27.D; Improper Grant Of Variances to LAMC)
16 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
17 Paragraphs 1 through 32, inclusive, of this Petition.
18 34. Section 12.27.D of the Los Angeles Municipal Code and Section 562 of the

19 City Charter require that a Variance be supported by written findings of all of the
20 following:

21 a) That the strict application of the zoning
22 ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of 23 the zoning regulations;
24 b) That there are exceptional circumstances applicable to the subject property such as size, shape,
25 topography, location or surroundings that do not apply

26 generally to other property in the same zone and vicinity;
c) That the variance is necessary for the
27 preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use generally possessed by other property within the same 28 zone and vicinity but which, because of the special

e)

6 That the granting of the variance will not
adversely affect any element of the general plan.

7 35.

8 Section 562 of the City Charter further states: "A variance shall not be used

9 to grant a special privilege, or to permit a use substantially inconsistent with the limitations

10 upon other properties in the same zone and vicinity."
