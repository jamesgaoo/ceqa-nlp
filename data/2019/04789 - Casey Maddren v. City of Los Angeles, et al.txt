1 INTRODUCTION

2

3 This petition challenges all approvals granted by the City of Los Angeles/Los
4 Angeles City Council related to the construction of the Selma Wilcox Hotel Project,
5 including: (a) the Mitigated Negative Declaration, CEQA No. ENV-2016-2602-
6 MND, adopted as the environmental assessment for the project; (b) the Vesting Zone
7 Change and Height District Change from C4-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D; and (c) the
8 Conditional Use for the on-site sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages incidentall
9 to the proposed restaurant and throughout the hotel including the ground floor lobby
10 bar, in-room mini-bars, and a rooftop amenity deck with bar/lounge area.

11

12 Over about the past ten years, entities associated with Richard Heyman and Grant
13 King (Hollywood International Regional Center, Five Chairs, Relevant Group) have
14 raised funds for and engaged in the construction of a number of hotels near the
15 intersection of Selma and Wilcox in Hollywood, including the Dream 1 (6417
16 Selma), the Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2 (6421 Selma), the tommie (6516 Selma),
17 and the Thompson (1541 Wilcox). The Dream 1 has been completed, and the other
18 three are currently under construction. In each case, Heyman and King have
19 submitted applications for the projects using LLCs associated with the site's address,
20 i.e. 6417 Selma Hotel LLC, 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC, 6516 Tommie Hotel
21 LLC, and 1541 Wilcox Hotel, LLC.
22

23 In 2015 an application was filed with the City of Los Angeles for a project that at that
24 time was called Tao Restaurant and Retail Project, ENV No. ENV-2015-2672-MND.
25 The entity used to file the application was called "6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC".
26 The Statement of Information filed with the State of California for the LLC bears the
27 name Richard Heyman. The project was described as restaurant and retail space with
28 three levels of parking. During the approval process, community members contacted

- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Department of City Planning (DCP) to point out the contrast between the project
2 described and the name given the LLC.

3

4 Also, while the DCP was processing the Tao Restaurant and Retail Project,
5 Hollywood resident David Carrera submitted evidence to the DCP showing that back
6 in 2014 Space Global, a company that partnered with Heyman and King's Hollywood
7 International Regional Center (HIRC) to raise funding for new hotels, had published
8 an on-line brochure describing a hotel complex on Selma between Cahuenga and
9 Wilcox which included the Dream 1, Dream 2, the restaurant Tao, and the bar Beauty
10 & Essex. The brochure shows the Dream 2 occupying the same site as the proposed
11 Tao Restaurant and Retail Project. The brochure describes the Dream 2 as the second
12 phase of the hotel complex, referring to it as a "$43 million extension" of the first
13 hotel.

14

15 In spite of having received this evidence, the DCP saw no reason to question the
16 developer's intentions and proceeded to process the project application for the Tao
17 Restaurant and Retail Project.
18

19 After the original restaurant/retail project had been approved and construction begun,
20 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC filed an application for a different project on the same
21 site, an 8-story hotel with a rooftop bar/lounge featuring live entertainment. The
22 name was now changed to Selma Wilcox Hotel Project.
23

24 Though it originally seemed that Heyman and King had used the Tao restaurant/retail
25 project as a placeholder to start construction of the Selma Wilcox Hotel, in light of
26 the evidence it seems clear that as far back as 2014 the developers intended to build a
27 complex which included the Dream 1, the Dream 2 (Selma Wilcox Hotel), Tao, and
28 Beauty & Essex. Had Heyman and King disclosed the full scope of their intention to

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- build two hotels with rooftop bars featuring live entertainment, along with the newly
2 constructed Tao and the refurbished bar to be called Beauty & Essex, and that every
component of this complex would require a CUP for a full line of alcohol, it is
4 reasonable to assume an EIR would have been required.

6 CEQA requires that an applicant submit plans for a project in its entirety SO that it can
7 be comprehensively evaluated as part of the environmental assessment. In Laurel
8 Heights vs. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, the court said:
9

10 We hold that an EIR must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future
11 expansion or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
12  initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will
13 likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.
14

15 Given that the name of the LLC used by the applicant for both projects at 6421 Selma
16 was "6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel", and that before the Tao restaurant/retail application
17 was submitted the developer's funding partner had published a description of the
18 complete project, this "extension" was certainly "a reasonably foreseeable
19 consequence of the initial project". The Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2 project also
20 fulfills the court's second requirement which says that "the future expansion or action
21 will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project
22 or its environmental effects."

23

24 In addition to violating CEQA, the City of Los Angeles/Los Angeles City Council
25 also violated Section 12.24.W of the Los Angeles Municipal Code by granting a
26 Conditional Use Permit for the sale and dispensing of alcohol on the hotel premises.
27 Under Section 12.24.W, the City must find: (1) that the proposed use will not
28 adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community; (2) that the granting of the

- 4 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 application will not result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or
2 dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, in the
3 area of the City involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the
4 California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
5 concentration; and also giving consideration to the number and proximity of these
6 establishments within a one thousand foot radius of the site, the crime rate in the area
7 (especially those crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of
8 narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct), and whether
revocation or nuisance proceedings have been initiated for any use in the area; and (3)
10 that the proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
11 communities in the area of the City involved, after giving consideration to the
12 distance of the proposed use from residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals,
13 public playgrounds and other similar uses, and other establishments dispensing, for
14 sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine.
15

16 In making its findings regarding the approval of the CUP for the sale and dispensing
17 of alcohol, the DCP ignored substantial evidence in the record that: (1) The
18 Hollywood area already is already oversaturated with ABC locations. According to
19 the August 17, 2018 letter of determination issued for the Selma Wilcox Hotel by the
20 DCP, there are currently 62 active licenses, including 59 on-site and 3 off-site
21 licenses within 1,000 feet of the project site; (2) Within Crime Reporting District No.
22 646, which has jurisdiction over the subject property, a total of 1,777 crimes were
23 reported in 2017, compared to the Citywide Average of 191 crimes. In other words,
24 crime in this reporting district is 9 times higher than the citywide average. Alcohol-
25 related crimes reported in 2017 include Narcotics [167], Liquor Laws [58], Public
26 Drunkenness [27], Disturbing the Peace [2], Disorderly Conduct [159], and DUI
27 related [29]; and (3) There are numerous sensitive uses within 1,000 feet of the
28 project site which could be detrimentally affected by an additional business serving

1 alcohol, including Selma Park (6561 W. Selma, approx. 400 feet away) Selma
2 Avenue Elementary School (6611 W. Selma, approx. 600 feet away), the YMCA
3 (6560 W. Selma Avenue), Blessed Sacrament Church (6660 W. Selma), King's

4 Education (1555 Cassil Place) and First Baptist Church (6682 W. Selma).
5

6 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside all approvals and
7 entitlements associated with the Selma Wilcox Hotel Project that were granted in
8 violation of CEQA, including (a) the Mitigated Negative Declaration, CEQA No.
9 ENV-2016-2602-MND, adopted as the environmental assessment for the project; (b)
10 the Vesting Zone Change and Height District Change from C4-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D;
11 and (c) the Conditional Use for the on-site sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages
12 at the proposed restaurant and throughout the hotel.
13

14 Additionally, Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside the
15 approval of the CUP for the sale and dispensing of alcohol which was which was
16 granted in violation of LAMC Section 12.24.W. The data presented in the DCP's
17 own letter of determination for the project makes it clear that the findings are not
18 based a on a reasonable assessment of factual evidence.

19

20 Petitioner also seeks a writ of mandamus enjoining 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel/Real
21 Parties in Interest from continuing with further construction activities on the site until
22 the legal questions involved in this suit have been resolved.
23

24 PARTIES

25

26 Petitioner Casey Maddren is an individual who has lived in Hollywood for over 20
27 years, and who has serious concerns about the project's impacts on the Hollywood
28 community. Petitioner is a former board member of the Hollywood Hills West

1 Neighborhood Council and a current member of United Neighborhoods for Los
2 Angeles, a community group that advocates for better planning and governance in the
3 County of Los Angeles. Petitioner will be adversely impacted by the addition of yet
4 another establishment serving alcohol in an area which is already oversaturated with
5 ABC locations. Research shows a relationship between alcohol density and violent
6 crime. The addition of another party hotel in central Hollywood will likely push the
7 crime rate higher than it already is, and is also likely to result in an increase in DUIs.
8 Petitioner is also concerned that the dense concentration of party hotels planned for
9 the area immediately around the intersection of Selma and Wilcox, all offering a full-
10 line of alcohol from the ground floor to the rooftop deck (including hotel room mini-
11 bars), as well as live entertainment, will have multiple adverse impacts on
12 surrounding residential uses, in addition to having adverse impacts on surrounding
13 public and private educational facilities.

5 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

California Environmental Quality Act

8

9 The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), PRC Section 21000, was
approved by the State Legislature and signed into law in 1970 in response to
10 increasing concern regarding the impacts of development on the communities we live
11 in and on our natural resources.

12 The CEQA Guidelines tell us, "The purpose of
CEQA is not to generate aper, but to compel government at all levels to make
13 decisions with environmental consequences in mind." The Guidelines go on to say
14 that, "The lead agency must consider the whole of an action, not simply its
15 constituent parts, when determining whether it will have a significant environmental
16 effect."

17

18 CEQA outlines specific procedures which are designed to examine the environmental
19 consequences of a proposed project, whether through a Negative Declaration (ND), a
20 Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), or an Environmental Impact Report (EIR).
21 The purpose of these procedures is to gather credible information regarding a
22 proposed project's potential impacts, and to fully disclose that information to allow
23 the public to participate in the approval process. CEQA is designed to make the
24 public aware of any significant project impacts, to help decision-makers identify the
25 means of mitigating those impacts, and to ensure full disclosure of significant impacts
26 that cannot be mitigated.
27

1 California Public Resources Code Section 21002.1. (d) says that: "[...] The lead
2 agency shall be responsible for considering the effects, both individual and collective,
3 of all activities involved in a project." [Emphasis added.] And the CEQA Guidelines

4 Section 15378 defines a "Project" as "I[..] the whole of an action, which has a
5 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a

6 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment [....]" [Emphasis
7 added.]

8

9 California Public Resources Code, Sec. 21005 states: "(a)The Legislature finds and
10 declares that it is the policy of the state that noncompliance with the information
11 disclosure provisions of this division which precludes relevant information from
12 being presented to the public agency, or noncompliance with substantive
13 requirements of this division, may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion within
14 the meaning of Sections 21168 and 21168.5 regardless of whether a different
15 outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied with those
16 provisions." The same section further states: "(c) It is further the intent of the
17 Legislature that any court, which finds, or, in the process of reviewing a previous
18 court finding, finds, that a public agency has taken an action without compliance with
19 this division, shall specifically address each of the alleged grounds for
20 noncompliance."

24 The Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Section 12.24.W states that in order to
25 approve a Conditional Use for the sale and dispensing of alcohol the City must find:

27 community; (2) that the granting of the application will not result in an undue
28 concentration of premises for the sale or dispensing for consideration of alcoholic

1 beverages, including beer and wine, in the area of the City involved, giving
2 consideration to applicable State laws and to the California Department of Alcoholic
3 Beverage Control's guidelines for undue concentration; and also giving consideration

4 to the number and proximity of these establishments within a one thousand foot

5 radius of the site, the crime rate in the area (especially those crimes involving public
6 drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace
7 and disorderly conduct), and whether revocation or nuisance proceedings have been
8 initiated for any use in the area; and (3) that the proposed use will not detrimentally
9 affect nearby residentially zoned communities in the area of the City involved, after
10| giving consideration to the distance of the proposed use from residential buildings,
11 churches, schools, hospitals, public playgrounds and other similar uses, and other
12 establishments dispensing, for sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages,
13 including beer and wine.
14

15 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

16

17 In 2007 an application was filed by 6417 Selma Hotel LLC, a company associated
18 with Richard Heyman, to build a 9-story, 120-room hotel which included a restaurant,
19 banquet facility and 2 bars. A Mitigated Negative Declaration, ENV-2007-3932-
20 MND, was prepared and adopted, but the project did not begin construction at that
21 time and was on hold for a number of years.
22

23 In November 2013 applicant 6417 Selma Hotel applied for reconsideration of the
24 earlier adopted MND with some revisions to the project. The project would now be a
25 10-story hotel with 182 rooms, a pool, restaurant uses, a rooftop deck and parking on
26 the 1st and 2nd levels. After further revisions, the DCP issued a letter on April 4,
27 2014 approving the project and stating the conditions of approval. The letter also
28

- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

stated that the approved project would contain 77 parking spaces. This is the project
2 that would become the Dream Hotel, located at 6417 Selma in Hollywood.
3

4 In 2015 an application was filed with the City of Los Angeles for a project that at that
5 time was called Tao Restaurant and Retail Project, ENV-2015-2672-MND. The
6 entity used to file the application was called "6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC". The
7 Statement of Information filed with the State of California for this LLC bears the

8 name Richard Heyman.

10 While the DCP was processing the Tao Restaurant and Retail Project, Hollywood
11 resident David Carrera submitted evidence to the DCP showing that back in 2014
12 Space Global, a company that partnered with Heyman and King's Hollywood
13 International Regional Center (HIRC) to raise funding for new hotels, had published
14 an on-line brochure describing a hotel complex on Selma between Cahuenga and
15 Wilcox which included the Dream 1, Dream 2, the restaurant Tao, and the bar Beauty
16 & Essex. The brochure shows the Dream 2 occupying the same site as the proposed
17 Tao Restaurant and Retail Project. The brochure describes the Dream 2 as the second
18 phase of the hotel complex, referring to it as a "$43 million extension" of the first
19| hotel.

20

21 After the original restaurant/retail project had been approved and construction begun,
22 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC filed an application for a different a project on the same
23 site, an 8-story hotel with 114 rooms and a rooftop bar/lounge featuring live
24 entertainment. The name was now changed to Selma Wilcox Hotel Project.
25

26 Though it originally seemed that Heyman and King had used the Tao restaurant/retail
27 project a as a placeholder to start construction of the Selma Wilcox hotel, in light of the
28 evidence it seems clear that as far back as 2014 the developer intended to build a

- 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

complex which included the Dream 1, the Dream 2 (Selma Wilcox Hotel), Tao, and
2 Beauty & Essex. Had Heyman and King disclosed the full scope of their intention to
3 build two hotels with rooftop bars featuring live entertainment, along with the newly

4 constructed Tao and the refurbished bar to be called Beauty & Essex, and that every
5 component of this complex would require a CUP for a full line of alcohol, it is

6 reasonable to assume an EIR would have been required.

7

8 Petitioner alleges that DCP staff had ample evidence to be aware of the fact that Real
9 Parties in Interest 6417 Selma Hotel LLC and 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC had
10 failed to disclose the full scope of the planned project, which included the Dream 1
11 Hotel, 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2, the restaurant Tao and the bar Beauty &
12 Essex.

13

14 Petitioner further alleges that DCP staff knowingly violated both the letter and the
15 spirit of CEQA by completing the approval process for the Tao Restaurant and Retail
16 Project in spite of clear evidence that it would be replaced by a larger hotel project,
17 the 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2.

18

19 Petitioner further alleges that DCP staff knowingly violated both the letter and the
20 spirit of CEQA by failing to start the approval process over from the beginning once
21 it had received the funding brochure posted in 2014 showing that the Real Parties in
22 Interest actually planned to build a complex containing the Dream 1 (6417 Selma
23 Hotel), Dream 2 (6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel), the restaurant Tao and the bar Beauty &
24 Essex.

25

26 CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 (a) states that:
27

28

- 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

" 'Project' means the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either
2 a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
3 physical change in the environment [ ....]"

4

5 CEQA requires that an applicant submit plans for a project in its entirety so that it can
6 be comprehensively evaluated as part of the environmental assessment. In Laurel
7 | Heights vs. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, the court said:
8

9 We hold that an EIR must include an analysis of the environmental effects of future
10 expansion or other action if: (1) it is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
11 initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will
12 likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects.
13

14 Given that the DCP was made aware of the fact that before the Tao restaurant/retail
15 application was submitted the developer's funding partner had published
16 description of the complete project, this "extension" was certainly "a reasonably
17 foreseeable consequence of the initial project". The Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2
18 project also fulfills the court's second requirement which says that "the future
19 expansion or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature
20 of the initial project or its environmental effects."
21

22 California Public Resources Code Section 21005 says that failure to disclose
23 information relevant to a project may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion:
24

25 (a) The Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that
26 noncompliance with the information disclosure provisions of this division which
27 precludes relevant information from being presented to the public agency, or
28 noncompliance with substantive requirements of this division, may constitute a

- 14 -

1 prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Sections 21168 and 21168.5
2 regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency
3 had complied with those provisions.

4

5 California Public Resources Code Section 21005 further states:

6

7 (c) It is further the intent of the Legislature that any court, which finds, or, in the
8 process of reviewing a previous court finding, finds, that a public agency has taken
9 an action without compliance with this division, shall specifically address each of the
10 alleged grounds for noncompliance.
11

12 PRC Section 21080.(d) states:
13

14 If there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead agency,
15 that the project may have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental
16 | impact report shall be prepared.
17

18 Petitioner alleges that if the whole record had included all of the information
19 available to the DCP about the Real Party in Interest's intention to build a complex
20 containing 2 hotels containing almost 300 rooms total, each containing restaurants
21 and bars and each offering live entertainment, in addition to the separate Tao
22 restaurant, and that all components of the project would require CUPs for the sale
23 and dispensing of alcohol, it is reasonable to assume that an unbiased review of such
24 information would lead to the conclusion that the whole project would have had a
25 significant impact on the environment, and that an EIR would have been required.
26

27 Petitioner further alleges that the City of Los Angeles/Los Angeles City Council also
28 violated Section 12.24.W of the Los Angeles Municipal Code by granting a

- 15 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Conditional Use Permit for the sale and dispensing of alcohol on the hotel premises.
2 Under Section 12.24.W, the City must find: (1) that the proposed use will not

3 adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community; (2) that the granting of the

4 application will not result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or
dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, in the
6 area of the City involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the
7 California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
8 concentration; and also giving consideration to the number and proximity of these
9 establishments within a one thousand foot radius of the site, the crime rate in the area
10 (especially those crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of
11 narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct), and whether
12 revocation or nuisance proceedings have been initiated for any use in the area; and (3)
13 that the proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
14 communities in the area of the City involved, after giving consideration to the
15 distance of the proposed use from residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals,
16 public playgrounds and other similar uses, and other establishments dispensing, for
17 sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine.

18

19 In making its findings regarding the approval of the CUP for the sale and dispensing
20 of alcohol, the DCP ignored substantial evidence in the record that: (1) The
21 Hollywood area already is already oversaturated with ABC locations. According to
22 the August 17, 2018 letter of determination issued by the DCP for the Selma Wilcox
23 Hotel Project, there are currently 62 active licenses, including 59 on-site and 3 off-
24 site licenses within 1,000 feet of the project site; (2) Within Crime Reporting District
25 No. 646, which has jurisdiction over the subject property, a total of 1,777 crimes were
26 reported in 2017, compared to the Citywide Average of 191 crimes. In other words,
27 crime in this reporting district is 9 times higher than the citywide average. Alcohol-

28 related crimes reported in 2017 include Narcotics [167], Liquor Laws [58], Public

16 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Drunkenness [27], Disturbing the Peace [2], Disorderly Conduct [159], and DUI
2 related [29] and (3) There are numerous sensitive uses within 1,000 feet of the project
3 site which could be detrimentally affected by an additional business serving alcohol,
4 including Selma Park (6561 W. Selma, approx. 400 feet away) Selma Avenue
5 Elementary School (6611 W. Selma, approx. 600 feet away), the YMCA (6560 W.
6 Selma Avenue), Blessed Sacrament Church (6660 W. Selma), King's Education
7 (1555 Cassil Place) and First Baptist Church (6682 W. Selma).
8

9 Subsequent to the approval of the 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2 Project by the
10 City Planning Commission, Petitioner filed an appeal in August of 2018. The appeal
11 was heard by the Planning & Land Use Management Committee of the Los Angeles
12 City Council near the end of 2018, and was denied by the Committee.
13

14 Petitioner has complied with all conditions imposed by law before filing this action,
15 having provided notice to the City that this action would be filed pursuant to Public
16 Resources Code Section 21167.5.

17

18 Petitioner will serve a copy of the petition, and each amended petition, to the
19 California Attorney General.
20

21 Petitioner has no other adequate remedy available to redress the claims alleged in this
22 petition.
23

24 Petitioner and members of the Hollywood community will suffer irreparable harm if
25 the relief requested in this petition is not granted and the Project is allowed to proceed
26 based on the flawed conclusions resulting from an environmental review process that
27 was clearly inadequate.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 The record for the Selma Wilcox Hotel Project contains clear evidence that the
4 project was planned as the second phase of a complex which will include the Dream
5 Hotel, the Selma Wilcox Hotel/Dream 2, the restaurant Tao, and the bar Beauty &
6 Essex. This complex will contain almost 300 hotel rooms, feature two rooftop decks,
7 offer live entertainment, and serve alcohol in every component of the project. There
8 is substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project may
9 cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the environment, including impacts with
10 regard to air quality, greenhouse gasses, pedestrian safety, public safety, noise, public
11 services, and traffic.
12

13 CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 (a) states that: "'Project' means the whole of an
14 action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the
15 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
16 [....]" PRC Section 21082.2.(d) states: "If there is substantial evidence, in light of
17 the whole record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect
18 on the environment, an environmental impact report shall be prepared." By preparing
19 and adopting separate MNDs for the Dream 1 Hotel, the Tao Restaurant and Retail
20 Project, and the Selma Wilcox Hotel Project, decision-makers for the City of Los
21 Angeles have violated State law by breaking the project into separate components
22 requiring a lower level of environmental review rather than preparing a full EIR.
23

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25

26 The MND prepared for the Selma Wilcox Hotel Project, ENV-2016-2602-MND, is
27 inadequate in many ways, but especially in its analysis under Public Services of the
28 need for police protection. The only crime data provided is for the first four weeks of

- 18 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the year 2017, with no meaningful comparisons offered to crime rates in previous
2 years or to crime rates in other LAPD divisions throughout the City.
3

4 The MND does not refer to the December 31, 2016 COMPSTAT Profile for the
5 Hollywood Division which records 1,268 violent crimes committed in 2016, a 6.2%

6 increase over 2015 and a 38.1% increase over 2014. Oddly, the August 17 2018
7 determination letter for the Selma Wilcox Hotel contains far more detailed
8 information than the MND and shows that crime in Hollywood was 9 times higher
9 than the Citywide average when it was published.
10

11 In spite of the exceedingly high existing crime rate in Hollywood, the MND asserts
12 that crime generated by the project's operation can be reduced to insignificant levels
13 by implementing two measures: (1) Incorporating into the hotel design features
14 suggested by the "Design Out Crime Guidelines" published by the LAPD; and by (2)
15 Providing the LAPD Hollywood Area commanding officer with a diagram of each
16| portion of the property. The "Design Out Crime Guidelines" is a two-page pamphlet
17 with general design recommendations. It does not appear that any data has been
18 compiled to gauge the effectiveness of the guidelines.
19

20 CEQA Guidelines Section 15070 states that: [ ...] the Negative Declaration shall be
21 adopted when two conditions are met: (1) the project or plan or proposals as agreed to
22 by the applicant prior to public review of the proposed Negative Declaration has been
23 revised to avoid significant effects or the effects have been mitigated down to a point
24 where the effects are clearly insignificant and (2), there is no substantial evidence
25 before the agency that the project as revised may have a significant effect.
26

27 Given that the Selma Wilcox Hotel will have 114 rooms, operate 24/7, will contain a
28 bar and a restaurant that will both operate from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. daily, and will

- 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 offer live entertainment, it seems likely that it will generate additional crime in an
2 area that is already suffering from an extremely high crime rate. The MND offers no
3 analysis of increased crime from the project, and for mitigation measures during the
4 operational phase offers only two passive measures, producing absolutely no
5 statistical evidence to prove that they will be effective. The MND clearly fails to
6 meet the criteria set in CEQA Guidelines Section 15070.
7

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9

10 Approval of the Selma Wilcox Hotel violates Section 12.24.W of the Los Angeles
11 Municipal Code by granting a Conditional Use Permit for the sale and dispensing of
12 alcohol on the hotel premises. As demonstrated above, there is already an
13 exceedingly high concentration of ABC locations within a 1,000 foot radius of the
14 project. The determination letter for the project attests to the high crime rate in the
15 area, including crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of
16 narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct. The
17 required findings made by the DCP to approve the CUP for alcohol are not supported
18 by the evidence given in the determination letter. The DCP clearly erred in making
19 those findings and approving the CUP, and the Los Angeles City Council's approval
20 of the CUP clearly violates LAMC Section 12.24.W.
