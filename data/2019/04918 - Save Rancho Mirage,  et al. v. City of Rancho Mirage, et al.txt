27 10. The Project applicant, and Real Party in Interest, In-N-Out Burgers proposes to

28 construct a high-volume fast-food restaurant in a zone a that, hitherto the above action of the City

-3 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 in approving the Project, did not allow for the operations of fast-food drive-through restaurant.

2 The Project is in direct contravention to the City's own General Plan and zoning requirements,

3 and the requirements of well-established law under CEQA. The Project was not properly

4 analyzed the City under CEQA. Indeed, the City did not require the Project to undergo an

5 environmental impact report at all. The aim of the Project, and the City's haste in approving the

6 Project during the doldrums of summer when the merits of the Project could not properly be

7 tested under the rigor of a true CEQA review and an environmental impact report, was to turn a

8 shopping center located adjacent to large residential neighborhood, into an island of "fast
food" restaurants. This is not what the residents had intended when the General Plan was 9

10 is recently adopted nor is such a decision allowed under CEQA.
5 * uoÁueo zunbyeI l og nisg 1800] 11 11. The consideration of a Project required an analysis under CEQA, which is

12 California's broadest environmental law. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest

13 protection of the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all

14 discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a California public agency,

15 including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California Public

16 Resources Code, §§ 21000 - 21178. and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3,

17 §§ 15000 - 15387.

18 12. CEQA requires that an agency, such as the City, analyze the potential

19 environmental impacts of its proposed actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR")

20 (except in certain limited is circumstances.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. 14 CCR § 15003.

21 "The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended [CEQA] to be

22 read SO as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

23 scope of the statutory language." Communities for a Better Environment v. Calif. Resources

24 Agency (2002) 103 Cal. App. 4th 98.

25 13. An In-N-Out Burgers restaurant, with a drive-through, is not a typical project

26 that should be run through without careful consideration especially when it comes to its

27 environmental impact. In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurants are notorious for their impact on

28 the surrounding environment. The Project portends real and troubling problems, in the form of

-4-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 traffic gridlock, noise (the Project is slated to operate until 1:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturday

3 and until 1:00 Sunday through Thursday), litter, etc. for the adjoining neighbors. The traffic,

4 noise, gas-house emissions and otherwise overall environmental degradation of these

5 restaurants on surrounding neighborhoods is known to the public at large and is storied. It is a

6 love affair that the public has with this restaurant that also brings an unfathomable burden on a

7 surrounding neighborhood. A simple search reveals the full specter of this impact:

8 September 20, 2016 Los Angeles Magazine article entitled, "In-N-Out Drive-

9 Thru Lines Are a Menace, and Here's How They Can Be Stopped." The article's by-line including "They're too long and cars leak out into the street and block traffic and cause accidents and something must be done."

Palm Springs, 79TZ6 V. 12 Another article, posted on www.complex.com, is entitled "Ranking In-N-Out

13 Locations Based On Their Drive-Thru Lines." According to that article, some In- N-Outs have drive-thru wait times of 30-40 minutes.

16 If anyone has ever been to an In-N-Out Burgers, they know of some of the

17 problems attendant with such a restaurant with (1) traffic; (2) wait times and congestion; and (3)

18 noise, etc. These problems are obvious to any person who has patronized an In-N-Out Burgers
restaurant during a lunch or dinner hour, or even outside of those times ordinarily busy for any

19 other restaurant. An In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant is unique in the restaurant business

20 as being busy during all of its operating hours. Not surprisingly, given the overall impact of an

21 In-N-Out Burgers, municipalities that have considered the impact of In-N-Out recently and
have said no:

-5-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 understandable why, here, the City does not want an environmental impact report prepared.

2 Such a report would reveal significant and meaningful impacts to the surrounding environment

3 that would likely have doomed the Project from inception.

4 15. The Project is proposed to be built in the Las Palmas Shopping Center, located
5 at the juncture of Magnesia Falls Drive, Highway 111 and Bob Hope Drive (the "Center").
6 There has never been a fast-food restaurant in the Center. There is a good reason for that fact.
7 No such fast-food was ever permitted under the City's prior or existing zoning and General

8 Plan. That did not stop the City from pushing the Project through for approval. Despite

9 evidence of all of the foregoing having been presented to the City, and the vigorous opposition
d'TI Kousuid y Kydmyy Kodug worg YpAoiS 10 to the Project by the residents of the City, including RSM, the City nonetheless approved the

11
9 Project without the proper CEQA review.
1800 E. Tahquitz Canyon' 797761 12 THE CITY AVOIDED AN EIR BY AVAILING ITSELF OF AN EXEMPTION TO 8
Palm Springs, 13 CEQA THT SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY.
14
16.
15 It is beyond dispute that CEQA should apply to the Project unless there was,

16 and is, an exemption to its requirements that would otherwise apply. Given the Project's
expected dramatic impact on the public (there is at least one homeowner is within stone's-
17 throw from the Project), the need for a thorough analysis by the City was underscored. Instead,
18 the City wrongfully availed itself of an exemption under CEQA, the infill exemption, that
19 simply does not apply to the Project.
20

21 17. Despite the impact that the Project is expected to bring to the City and

22 surrounding neighbors the City had determined that the Project does not require the rigor

23 required of an EIR. Instead, to satisfy the City's obligations under CEQA, the City exempted
the Project utilizing the Categorical Exemption (CE) of Environmental Impact pursuant to
24 CEQA, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332, In-fill Development Project (the "Infill Exemption"). The
25 Infill Exemption consists of projects characterized as satisfying the following conditions:
26 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all
27 applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and

28 regulations.

- 6-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L4 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than

2 five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.

3 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to
traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
6 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332 (Emphasis added.)

8 18. The Infill Exemption may be used where above-noted conditions are fulfilled

9 and where it can be seen with certainty that the Project could not have a significant affect on the

10 environment. Thus, for the City to utilize the Infill Exemption, it must prove that the Project is

66
11 consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan
E 11 Kauyuld Audmm Kodwg UOrg YBAOIS 1800 E. Tahquitz Canyon 4 12 policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." 14 Cal. Code Regs. §
15332(a). Moreover, even were the Infill exemption to apply to the Project (and it does not), the 13 City must still comply with the requirements of an EIR.
14

15 19. The Project does not qualify for the Infill Exemption because (1) existing

16 zoning does not allow for it (and the City cannot "bootstrap" amendments to its zoning to cure

17 the problem); (2) the Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City has adopted

18 mitigation measures in the form of specialized conditions of approval for the Project; (3) the

19 Project is also not exempt from CEQA because the City has deferred application of mitigation
measures to another date; and (4) The Infill exemption does not apply because the Project will 20
have a significant environmental impact due to traffic, noise, air quality, etc., due to the
21 "unusual circumstances" of an In-N-Out Burgers which us unlike any other fast-food restaurant
22 out there.
23 (1) The Infill Exception Does Not Apply Because the Project is Not
24 Consistent with All Applicable Zoning Requirements.

25 20. The Infill Exemption is not applicable here because the Project is not consistent
26 with all applicable zoning requirements. As noted above, a categorical exemption for infill
27 development is not available where the project is not "consistent with the applicable general
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning

2 designation and regulations." 14 CCR § 15332(a).

LJ 21. The Project is within the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) zone. Under that
4 zone designation, Section 17.10.012 of the Municipal Code governs the allowable uses, permit
5 requirements and project review authority for said zone. The permitted uses in a C-N
6 (Neighborhood Commercial) Zone are as follows:
7 The C-N zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for neighborhood-scale
8 shopping centers compatible with adjacent residential areas, including supermarkets and drugstores on sites generally eight to ten acres in size providing 9 approximately a maximum of eighty thousand to one hundred thousand square feet

TI Keuguid  AydmiN Kadurg torg JEAOIS 10 of gross floor area. The C-N zoning district is consistent with the neighborhood
commercial land use esignation of the general plan.
11 Rancho Mirage Municipal Code 17.10.010.
E uoÁueo zunbyel 79Z6 VI söuuds wed 12 22. Simply stated, while the C-N zoning does allow for supermarkets and
13 drugstores, e.g., it does not presently allow for a fast-food restaurant. The City's Municipal

14 Code defines "Restaurants, fast-food" as "establishments whose primary business is the sale of
uai 1800 15 food and beverages to customers for consumption on-site or offsite. Less than fifty percent of

16 the floor area is used for customer seating. Interior furnishings include standardized floor plans,

17 stationary seats, and tables. Food is primarily pre-packaged rather than made to order.

18 Condiment bars and trash disposal are self-service. Drive-in or drive through facilities may be

19 allowed with a conditional use permit, granted in compliance with Chapter 17.48. Fast-food

20 restaurants have a higher turnover rate than standard restaurants."

21 23. The City concedes that the proposed use of the Project is presently not

22 permitted where the Project is proposed to be situated (in a C-N zone):

23 "The proposed use, a fast-food restaurant is currently an unpermitted use in
24 the subject zone. Fast-food establishments are permitted within the Community Commercial (C-C) zone with approval of a Conditional Use Permit and in the
25 Regional Interstate Commercial zone with the approval of a Development Plan." Agenda, Staff Report, 5-20. (Emphasis added.)
26

27 24. Thus, the City cannot approve the Project under the Infill Exemption. The

28 exemption is clear: if the Project is "not consistent with the applicable general plan designation

- 8-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and

2 regulations" it is not subject to that exemption. It is plain that the Project, as a "fast-food

3 restaurant" cannot be approved in the C-N zone as that designation is presently constituted.

4 Since it cannot be approved under the City's current zoning regiment, the Infill Exemption

5 under CEQA does not apply and the Project cannot proceed as currently promulgated.

6 (2) The City Cannot "Bootstrap" to the Zoning Problem to Avail Itself of Infill Exemption by Attempting to Amend Its Zoning Concurrently with 7 the Approval of the C.U.P.
8
25. Nor can the City attempt to remedy the above problem with its "bootstrapping" 9

10 amendments to the zoning designation for the Project. The Infill Exemption is not written

11 prospectively. Rather, that exemption only refers to the present zoning requirements. This

3 § d'1T Kouyuid Slovak: Baron Empey Murphy d 79TZ6 V. makes sense. If a party could merely amend the zoning requirements along with an application (OS M5 Siore u eoer 12 for a Conditional Use Permit, then such a "runaround" would render this exemption 13 meaningless. All an applicant would have to do to avail itself of this exemption is to assert
14 there was "no change" to zoning by concurrently filing for an amendment to the zoning.
15 Despite the clear language of the Infill Exemption, the City is nonetheless trying to bootstrap
16 two amendments to its zoning code to remedy this glaring defect. These two proposed
17 amendments are as follows:
18 The Fast-food Amendment. A Zoning Text Amendment
19 application was submitted with the development package for the Project (1)

pursuant to Section 17.72.020 of the RMMC. Since the Project is within
20 the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) zone, one of the two proposed Zoning Text Amendments sought to modify allowable uses in the 21 Neighborhood Commercial zone, the proposal is to modify Section 17.10.012 to allow "Restaurant, Fast-Food" as a conditional use in large- 22 scale shopping centers (minimum 15-acre site) within the C-N
23 (Neighborhood Commercial) and C-G (General Commercial) zones .
(2) The Large-Scale Shopping Center Amendment. Staff also 24 recommended an amendment to Section 17.90.020 of the RMMC,
25 "Definitions of specialized terms and phrases" of Title 17, "Zoning" of the
Rancho Mirage Municipal Code be amended to include the definition of a 26 large-scale shopping center, which reads as follows: A "Large Scale Shopping Center" is a comprehensively planned shopping center 27 comprising 15 acres or more.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. As described in the Staff Report submitted in support of the Project, the City's

2 zoning text amendments . will simply modify the operational standards for a restaurant to

3 allow it to use drive-through for customer service similar to what is already permitted at the

4 surrounding Shopping Center for Starbucks and CVS Pharmacy." Agenda, Staff Report, p. 5-

5 12. But for this modification, the Project could not operate a drive-through for customer service.

6 Therefore, as demonstrated by the City's own zoning text amendments, the Project, as proposed

7 and including a drive-through, is not consistent with the applicable zoning designation and

8 regulations and therefore is precluded from qualifying for the Infill Exemption.

9 27. In any event, even were the City's attempt at "bootstrapping" permissible (and

d'TT kauqurd 3 Audimw Kadwg uorg SeAoiS 10 it is not), the two proposed zoning text amendments submitted by the City to rectify the zoning

11 problem that the Project faces post hoc must fail because the City has not conducted the
KEM uoÁueO zunbuel 1800 E. Palm Springs, 9ZZ6 VO 12 required CEQA analysis of those amendments. Both the (1) Fast-food Amendment; and the (2)

13 Large Scale Shopping Center Amendment themselves are subject to CEQA review. The

14 administrative guidelines provide that the enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances are

15 discretionary projects which are subject to the provisions of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080

16 and 14 Cal. Admin. Code 15378(a)(1). Accordingly, it has been held that in it rezoning matters a

17 city or county must comply with the provisions of CEQA; and if an environmental impact

18 report is required, it must be prepared and considered before the ordinance is adopted.
Rosenthal v. Board of Supervisors (1975) 44 CA3d 815, 821, 119 CR 282 • People v. County of
19 Kern (1976) 62 CA3d 761,769,133 CR 389; and Kleist v. City of Glendale (1976) 56 CA3d
20 770, 128 CR 781. The City has failed to conduct an independent analysis of CEQA as to the
21 proposed amendments and, therefore, the proposed amendments by themselves cannot be
22 passed in the manner currently proposed.
23
28. Also, an ordinance does not take effect until 30 days after adoption or second 24

25 reading. Since 30 days had not lapsed since the City Council's action, the reliance on the

26 passage of the zoning amendments was premature, on October 3, 2019, in that the City Council
lacked the legal authority to take the contemplated actions as though the zoning amendments
27 were a fait accompli. The Council was required first to address the proposed zoning text
28 amendments because this action impacted all properties zoned C-N and C-G. That process - 10 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

required a second reading and 30 days before the ordinance would go into effect. The City

2 Council could not, as it did, approve a Conditional Use Permit before these ordinances went

3 into effect and the list of "permitted uses", adding fast food restaurants in C-N, and changing

4 the designation of a "large scale shopping center," had been codified.
(3) The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Adopted 5
Mitigation Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval
6 for the Project.

7 29. The Infill Exemption is not appropriate because of the Project's impacts on
8 traffic, noise and other problems that have been noted in the record and further detailed below.
9 A categorical exemption for Infill development is not appropriate if the developer cannot show
10 d'T1 Kouyuid y Aydmy Kodug uorg yeAoIs that approval would not result in "any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or
11 water quality." 14 CCR § 15332(d). In this case, the neighborhood is already experiencing
79776 VO *sSuuds wrd Kem uoÁueo zunbuel 1800 I 12 significant effects relating to traffic from other similar developments.
13 30. Significantly, in evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the
14
Lí agency may not rely on mitigation measures as a basis for concluding that project is
15 categorically exempt, or as a basis for determining that one of the significant effects exceptions
16 does not apply. Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125
17 Cal.App.4th 1098. The Staff Report prepared for the City Council contains admissions that the
18 City has sought mitigation measures to determine that significant effects exceptions does not
19 apply in the area of smell and traffic. See, e.g., the statements of Majna Dukic, Senior Planner
20 for the City that admits that "... the installation of air scrubbers was an added condition in order

21 to mitigate potential odor from the restaurant." See, the City's Agenda for the October 3, 2019

22 meeting, Staff Report, p. 5-44. In addition, other mitigating measures have been made a part of

23 the development agreement with In-N-Out Burgers.

24 31. These conditions of approval simply "kick the can" down the road and defer
25 required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
26 Conditioning a project on future review of environmental impacts, without evidence of the
27 likelihood of effective mitigation is insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency
28 that potentially significant impacts will be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. Of Mendocino (1988)
- 11-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring formulation of mitigation measures at a future time

2 violates the rule that members of the public and other agencies must be given an opportunity to

3 review mitigation measures before a project is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See
League for Protection of Oakland Architectural & Historic Resources v. City of Oakland

5 (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896.
(4) The Infill Exemption Does Not Apply Because the Project Will Have a Significant Environmental Impact to Traffic, Noise, Air Quality due to
7 "Unusual Circumstances" of an In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant.

32. The above Infill Exemption only applies where *Approval of the project would
9 not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality." This
10 simply is not the case here. As pointed out above, categorical exemptions to CEQA are to be
11 construed strictly. Even assuming arguendo that the Project is actually subject to the Infill 8 d'TI Kougurd y Audmy Kadwg uog yeaois uofueo zunbyej 3 0081 ui 12 Exemption, it does not mean that it is automatically exempt from CEQA. It is still subject to
§ T9ZT6 y Palm Springs, 13 CEQA if it is shown that there is significant impact on traffic, noise, and air quality. In
14 McQueen v. Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 1136, the court

15 reiterated that categorical exemptions are construed strictly, shall not be unreasonably expended

16 beyond their terms, and may not be used where there is substantial evidence that there are

17 unusual circumstances (including future activities) resulting in (or which might reasonably

18 result in) significant impacts which threaten the environment.

19 33. Certain types of projects, such as construction of small structures or minor
20 changes to existing structures and Infill projects (when the above requirements are satisfied),
21 are considered "categorically exempt" from the often time-consuming and expensive process of

22 CEQA review. The reasoning behind these exemptions is that projects in the specified

23 categories are limited in nature and ordinarily do not pose a risk of causing adverse
24 environmental impacts. However, even when projects meet the requirements for a categorical

25 exemption, they may nevertheless be subject to CEQA review if the project would have a

26 significant effect on the environment due to "unusual circumstances," which constitutes an

27 exception to the exemption. See, 14 Cal Code Regs § 15300.2.

28 /111
- 12 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. Thus, if there is a showing of "unusual circumstances" then an exemption under 1

2 CEQA does not apply. However, with the exception of a one-sentence statement that "The

3 proposed project will not have a significant environmental impact due to unusual

4 circumstances" (see, Agenda, Staff Report, p. 5-13), there is no analysis considering whether

of fast food establishment 5 the Project could create an unusual circumstance. Based on study of other In-N-Out

6 developments, there are circumstances unique to this specific type

N due to its popularity, high volume of customers, and queuing wait-time. None of these

g circumstances were addressed by the City, nor were resulting impacts analyzed and never were
they labeled, as most assuredly they are, "unusual circumstances." It is therefore improper to 9 determine that the Project will not have a significant impact due to "unusual circumstances." 10 d'TI Äounyuld  Aydini Kodug uorg yeAoIs 11 35. As pointed out, an In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant, with a drive-through,
29Z76 VO 's8uuds wed ÁEM UOÁureO zunbrei 3 0081 12 is not a typical project that should be run through without careful consideration. If ever there

13 a was a case of "unusual circumstances" demonstrating a "one-off" from the analysis of a

14 proposed project that most certainly must be the case when considering an In-N-Out as just

15 "another" fast food restaurant. An In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant is NOT just another
fast-food restaurant. In-N-Out Burges restaurants are notorious for their impact on the 16

17 surrounding environment. The traffic, noise, gas-house emissions and otherwise overall
environmental degradation of these restaurants on surrounding neighborhoods is known to the 18 public at large and is storied. It is a love affair that the public has with this restaurant that also
19 brings an unfathomable burden on a surrounding neighborhood. The serious environmental
20 impacts need to be more thoroughly studied.
21 i. Negative Impacts to Water Quality from the Project were Not
Considered. 22

23 36. In order to properly apply for the In-fill Exemption, the City was required to
24 demonstrate that there will be no significant effects to water quality. The Project would result in
25 the conversion of an unpaved area to a predominantly paved area. Doing so would substantially
26 decrease the permeability of that area and could cause an increase in off-site stormwater.
27 Further, uses associated with the Project generate high levels of waste, in addition to hazardous

28 materials associated with idling vehicles. Without proper controls and design, this would create
- 13 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a significant impact to water quality. However, the City has failed to analyze impacts to water

2 quality at all, instead asserting, with no verifiable analysis or reports, that "the proposed project

3 would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality."

4 Of note, the City offers nothing to support the conclusion related to water quality. As such, the

5 City has not reasonably demonstrated that the Project would not result in significant impacts to

6 water quality and therefore does not qualify for the In-fill Exemption.

7 ii. The Traffic Analysis Contains Key Errors That Underestimate
Significant Impacts.
8
37. 9 In its traffic analysis, the City relief on a traffic analysis provided by the

Way Tahquitz Canyon' 18001 10 Applicant that contains key errors which underestimated impacts. The traffic study relied on

11 data collected in August 2019 and applies a 50% increase since the data was collected during
the off season. It was derelict for the City to have considered the Project based on a traffic study
12 that was conducted in August 2019, when we all understand that traffic flow is at a fraction of
13 what traffic might be expected during the winter months. After all, it is common knowledge that
14 the population of the Coachella Valley swells during the winter months from the influx of
15 "snowbirds." Data from nearby La Quinta shows that the valley has a full-time population of
16 200,000 out of season, and 800,000 in season. Further, there are 3.5 million visitors to the
17 valley during the high season, in addition to the full and part time residents. These numbers are
18 from 2013, so there has been a steep increase since those numbers were complied. The City has
19 utilized a multiplying fact of 50% to its factoring of "summer" versus "winter" traffic which,
20 then, is off-base. Based on the above numbers, there should be an appropriate 200% multiplying

21 factor not a 50% increase.

22 38. Further, there are inconsistencies between the size of the restaurant proposed
23 and that utilized in the traffic study. The plans presented for the project show 3,885 square feet
24 (SF) with an additional patio of 1,762 SF, but the traffic study fails to account for the additional
25 patio space (instead using only 1,102 SF). Because Project-generated traffic is dependent on
26 area, this error underestimates the amount of traffic generated by the Project. There are further
27 inconsistencies within the report where project generated trips are reported to be 1,184, reduced

28 to 858, but a in a different location reported as 754.
- 14-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Neither the traffic study nor the City Staff addressed the Project's potential 1

2 impacts under Senate Bill 743 (SB 743). SB 743 changes the focus of transportation impact 39.

3 analysis in CEQA from measuring impacts to drivers, to measuring the impact of driving. The

4 change is being made by replacing level of service ("LOS") with vehicle miles of travel (VMT)

5 and providing streamlined review of land use and transportation projects that will help reduce

6 future VMT growth. This shift in transportation impact focus is expected to better align
transportation impact analysis and mitigation outcomes with the State's goals to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, encourage infill development, and improve public health
through more active transportation. In January 2019, the Natural Resources Agency finalized
updates to the CEQA Guidelines including the incorporation of SB 743 modifications. The 10
Guidelines changes were approved by the Office of Administrative Law and are now in effect.
11
E The Project is certainly not consistent with State guidelines to reduce GHG emissions and 79T6 V 2oay mnbhirel & d'T1 Kouquid  Kydmys adug uorg seaois 12 enhancement of active transportation. In fact, the drive-through restaurant encourages idling
ssuuds wjed 13 and exacerbates GHG emissions. Further, unusual circumstances surrounding In-N-Out given
14 its popularity actually encourage patrons to drive further and choose to visit the establishment 3 0081 15 when compared to other similar restaurants. Not only does the traffic study fail to address the
16 project's compliance with SB 743, it does not disclose potential impacts from an increase in
17 VMT. These potentially significant impacts are neither analyzed nor disclosed and render the
18 use of the In-fill Exemption noncompliant with CEQA.

19
40. The City also violated fundamental Due Process requirements by not providing
20 referenced data that is relied upon to make its conclusions. In the City's In-N-Out Burger study
21 submitted by Linscott, Law & Greenspan, Engineers (LLG), dated August 26, 2019, there was a
22 reference to a traffic a study performed in 2014. On page 3 of that report there is reference to an
23 "Updated Site Access Analysis Report for the proposed Rancho Las Palmas Center
24 Redevelopment Project, dated April 30, 2014" prepared by LLG. LLG states that that 2014
25 study was "enclosed Under separate cover". However, it was not included.
26
41. The failure to provide all the available data to the public is a glaring omission
27 and a violation of elementary precepts of Due Process. The only study provided was the one in
August 2019 between the hours of 4 pm and 5 PM (the time at which traffic is unreasonably, - 15• 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and unseasonably, slow.) The study specifically states that "during the peak hour of traffic

2 between four and five there would be no impact on traffic." In fact, the study did not say that

3 there wouldn't be any significant impact on traffic during any other hours. Since the full study,

4 and the 2014 Study, was not disclosed it is not possible to see when there might be other peak

5 traffic hours and perhaps there would be a peak hour in the morning or lunch or some other

6 time that might have an impact on the traffic. A traffic study with only a few hours test is not

7 availing. The public should be entitled to a review of the full report. We know from the 2017

8 study the City conducted that the peak traffic was not at 4-5 pm but rather the greatest flows

9 were 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. but most often at the lunch hours (2017 ITE traffic data for a fast
food restaurant with a window peak percentage of traffic occurs between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 10 p.m.). So, the City, in conjunction with In-N-Out Burgers, supplied traffic data that may have 11 just ignored the peak lunch hour and just made a statement that "during the peak pm hour that
& 79TZ6 SEM uoÁueo znbyeI d'TT Kauyuid Áydmy Kodwg uog yesois 12 there would be no significant impact on traffic". It is clear that the entire traffic study and data 5 13
are not being provided for a reason. Before the City can proceed with the proposed project, our
14 clients, and the public deserve that information. L 1800 's8uuds wped 15 ili. Negative Impacts to Sound Quality from Noise from the Project will
be Considerable. 16

17 42. The City also failed to properly analyze and mitigate significant impacts from
18 noise from the Project. The City gives short shrift to its goal to maintain the quiet environment
19 that it refers to on its website referring to its General Plan:

20 Rancho Mirage generally enjoys a quiet noise environment, with existing
21 community noise being dominated by highway and local traffic, intermittent aircraft flyovers, and commercial operations. The Noise Element is intended to
22 help align the community's various land uses with the existing and future noise environment and thus ensure that any negative effects of noise are minimized or
23 completely avoided.

24 Low noise levels are considered to be major economic asset of Rancho Mirage's resort and residential atmosphere. As development continues, the City shall 25 carefully review proposals to ensure that land uses incompatible with the noise
26 environment are avoided. It is the purpose of this element to identify noise problems in Rancho Mirage and the SOI and to minimize future noise impacts
27 resulting from continued growth.

1 43. The Project would be located very close to many noise- sensitive receptors,

2 including residential units located nearby. The proposed restaurant would operate seven days a

3 week, from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and from 10:00 a.m. to 1:30 a.m.

4 Friday and Saturday. These types of establishments are known to create many noise impacts,

5 including noise from patrons shouting, operating stereos in their cars, slamming doors, and

6 honking in the drive-thru lane. Despite the City's alleged committed to "quietude" in the City, it

7 only discusses the potential impact of the operational noise generated by the Project in one short

8 paragraph (most of which only pertains to the construction of the Project):
Construction of the project would generate sporadic, temporary vibration effects
adjacent to the project area but would not be expected to exceed the significance
IrT cm4, De ditia y soaeeg R0R8 10 thresholds. Operation of the project would generate noise from project-related traffic or from on-site sources (drive-through queuing, parking, amplified speech
11 emanating from the speaker and trash compactor) that would not exceed the significance thresholds. 12
Agenda, Staff Report, p. 5-22. 13

44. The City has failed to properly analyze and mitigate significant impacts from 14
LOUEg YEAOIS 79Zt6 VO 'sSuds wrd 15 noise. As such, the City has not reasonably demonstrated that the Project would not result in

16 significant impacts to noise quality and therefore does not qualify for the In-fill Exemption.

iv. Negative Impacts to Air Quality from the Project will be 17 Considerable.
18
45. The Project could result in significant impacts health effects from air quality 19
emissions. In Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (Friant Ranch, L.P.) (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, the 20
Court held that air quality analysis must make a reasonable effort to substantively connect a 21 project's air quality impacts to likely health consequences. While the air quality analysis
22 provided summarizes Friant Ranch, it makes no effort to address the health effects to nearby
23 sensitive receptors from the large quantity of idling vehicles consistent with In-N-Out
24 establishments. The analysis, in order to actually demonstrate that there are no significant
25 impacts to air quality, is required to "connect" adverse human health effects to the levels of
26 pollutants that would be emitted by the project. Until or unless this has been completed, the
27 project cannot be shown to be consistent with the In-fill Exemption.
28

- 17-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 46. As such, the City has not reasonably demonstrated that the Project would not

2 result in significant impacts to air quality and therefore does not qualify for the In-fill

3 Exemption.

4 47. In approving the Project under these circumstances, the County violated the
5 requirements of CEQA and California Code of Regulations, tit.14, sections 15000 et seq.

6 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"), which provide that the City must prepare, consider, and

7 certify an EIR prior to the approval of any project that may have a significant impact on the

8 environment. CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR whenever there is a "fair argument" that

9 the project may have significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment.

d'1T Kouyuid y Audmy Kodtg UOIRE YEAOIS 10 The County's failure to prepare an EIR prior to its approval of Project, despite the existence of

11 substantial evidence that the Project may have significant adverse effects on the environment,

14 48. The Project is subject to CEQA and Petitioner made a fair argument regarding

15 the significant environmental effects of the Project. Respondent thereby violated its duties to
16 conduct an Initial Study conforming to the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

17 Accordingly, the City's adoption of the Project must be set aside.

19 clear legal duties under CEQA. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate
20 setting aside the County's certification of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of
21 the Conditional Use Permit for the Project and enjoining any activity pursuant to the Project
22 approval until the City prepares, considers, and certifies a legally adequate EIR. Issuance of the
23 requested relief will confer significant benefit on the public and will result in the enforcement

24 of important public rights, including the public's right to disclosure of the potentially significant

IN-N-OUT BURGERS FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT AND THE NEED FOR PROPER

i 25 CEQA REVIEW AND AN EIR. 26

27 10. The Project applicant, and Real Party in Interest, In-N-Out Burgers proposes to

28 construct a high-volume fast-food restaurant in a zone that, hitherto the above action of the City

-3• '

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.-.

1 in approving the Project, did not allow for the operations of fast-food drive-through restaurant.

2 The Project is in direct contravention to the City's own General Plan and zoning requirements,

3 and the requirements of well-established law under CEQA. The Project was not properly
analyzed the City under CEQA. Indeed, the City did not require the Project to undergo an

5 environmental impact report at all. The aim of the Project, and the City's haste in approving the
Project during the doldrums of summer when the merits of the Project could not properly be
tested under the rigor of a true CEQA review and an environmental impact report, was to turn a

8 shopping center located adjacent to a large residential neighborhood, into an island of "fast

9 food" restaurants. This is not what the residents had intended when the General Plan was

8 JT1 Kaujuid 2 Kudmin Aadwug uoreg yrAois 10 recently adopted nor is such a decision allowed under CEQA.

11 11. The consideration of a Project required an analysis under CEQA, which is -*

18001 Tahquitz LOÁUEC 12 California's broadest environmental law. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest

13 protection of the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all

14 discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a California public agency,
uí 79T6 VO sSuuds wed 15 including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California Public

16 Resources Code, 8§ 21000 - 21178. and Title 14 Cal, Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3,

17 §§ 15000 - 15387.

18 12. CEQA requires that an agency, such as the City, analyze the potential

19 environmental impacts of its proposed actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR")

20 (except in certain limited circumstances.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. 14 CCR 15003.

21 "The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended [CEQA] to be :

22 read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

23 scope of the statutory language." Communities for a Better Environment v. Calif. Resources

24 Agency (2002) 103 Cal. App. 4th 98.

25 13. An In-N-Out Burgers restaurant, with a drive-through, is not a typical project

26 that should be run through without careful consideration especially when it comes to its -SR

27 environmental impact. In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurants are notorious for their impact on

28 the surrounding environment. The Project portends real and troubling problems, in the form of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

traffic gridlock, noise (the Project is slated to operate until 1:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturday
2 and until 1:00 Sunday through Thursday), litter, etc. for the adjoining neighbors. The traftic,

3 noise, gas-house emissions and otherwise overall environmental degradation of these

4 restaurants on surrounding neighborhoods is known to the public at large and is storied. It is a

5 love affair that the public has with this restaurant that also brings an unfathomable burden on a

6 surrounding neighborhood. A simple search reveals the full specter of this impact:
September 20, 2016 Los Angeles Magazine article entitled, "In-N-Out Drive- 7 Thru Lines Are a Menace, and Here's How They Can Be Stopped." The article's
8 by-line including "They're too long and cars leak out into the street and block
traffic and cause accidents and something must be done." 9 https://www.lamag.com/digestblog/i-drive-thru-lines-public-menace-heres-can-
d'11 Kounquid 2 Aydumiat Kodug uong yeaols 10 stopped/
11 Another article, posted on www.complex.com, is entitled "Ranking In-N-Out KEM DOÁUEO ZUNOLEI 3 0081 Locations Based On Their Drive-Thru Lines." According to that article, some In- 29zc6 VO Springs, wjed 12 N-Outs have drive-thru wait times of 30-40 minutes.
13 https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/in-n-out-drive-thru-lines/
14
14. If anyone has ever been to an In-N-Out Burgers, they know of some of the 15 problems attendant with such a restaurant with (1) traffic; (2) wait times and congestion; and (3) 16 noise, etc. These problems are obvious to any person who has patronized an In-N-Out Burgers
17 restaurant during a lunch or dinner hour, or even outside of those times ordinarily busy for any
18 other restaurant. An In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant is unique in the restaurant business
19 as being busy during all of its operating hours. Not surprisingly, given the overall impact of an
20 In-N-Out Burgers, municipalities that have considered the impact of In-N-Out recently and
21 have said no:

27

28 In each of the above instances, an environmental impact report was prepared. It is

- 5-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

l

understandable why, here, the City does not want an environmental impact report prepared.

2 Such report would reveal significant and meaningful impacts to the surrounding environment

3 that would likely have doomed the Project from inception.

4 15. The Project is proposed to be built in the Las Palmas Shopping Center, located
5 at the juncture of Magnesia Falls Drive, Highway 111 and Bob Hope Drive (the "Center").
6 There a has never been a fast-food restaurant in the Center. There is good reason for that fact.
No such fast-food was ever permitted under the City's prior or existing zoning and General

evidence of all of the foregoing having been presented to the City, and the vigorous opposition - 7

8 Plan. That did not stop the City from pushing the Project through for approval. Despite

9

10 to the Project by the residents of the City, including RSM, thè City nonetheless approved the

11 Project without the proper CEQA review. ÁeAl voÁueo zumbrel dT Koujuid y Áudnw Kadug uorg yeAOIs COES IDO MDNES Y BORE 12 THE CITY AVOIDED AN EIR BY AVAILING ITSELF OF AN EXEMPTION TO
CEQA THT SIMPLY DOES NOT APPLY. 13

• ** 14
16. It is beyond dispute that CEQA should apply to the Project unless there was, 15 and is, an exemption to its requirements that would otherwise apply. Given the Project's 16 expected dramatic impact on the public (there is at least one homeowner is within a stone's-
17 throw from the Project), the need for thorough analysis by the City was underscored. Instead,
18 the City wrongfully availed itself of an exemption under CEQA, the infill exemption, that
19 simply does not apply to the Project.
20
17. Despite the impact that the Project is expected to bring to the City and 21

22 surrounding neighbors the City had determined that the Project does not require the rigor
required of an EIR. Instead, to satisfy the City's obligations under CEQA, the City exempted 23 the Project utilizing the Categorical Exemption (CE) of Environmental Impact pursuant to
24 CEQA, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332, In-fill Development Project (the "Infill Exemption"). The
25 Infill Exemption consists of projects characterized as satisfying the following conditions:
26 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all
27 applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and • aI au .u.4 *.. regulations.

- 6- 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. 2
(c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. cov (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noisc, air quality, or water quality.
5 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
6 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332 (Emphasis added.)
7
18. The Infill Exemption may be used where above-noted conditions are fulfilled 8

9 and where it can be seen with certainty that the Project could not have a significant affect on the

10 environment. Thus, for the City to utilize the Infill Exemption, it must prove that the Project is
"... consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan

8 d'TT Aauyuid Audumi Aodug vog yesots 11
29226 VO Paim Springs, Kem uolueo zunbuRl 300ST 41 12 policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." 14 Cal. Code Regs. §
15332(a). Moreover, even were the Infill exemption to apply to the Project (and it does not), the 13 City must still comply with the requirements of an EIR.

The Project does not qualify for the Infill Exemption because (1) existing

cure 14
19. 15

16 zoning does not allow for it (and the City cannot "bootstrap" amendments to its zoning to

17 the problem); (2) the Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City has adopted

18 mitigation measures in the form of specialized conditions of approval for the Project; (3) the
Project is also not exempt from CEQA becausc the City has deferred application of mitigation 19

20 measures to another date; and (4) The Infill exemption does not apply because the Project will
have a significant environmental impact due to traffic, noise, air quality, clc., due to the 21 "unusual circumstances" of an In-N-Out Burgers which us unlike any other fast-food restaurant
22 out there.
23 (1) The Infill Exception Does Not Apply Because the Project is Not Consistent with All Applicable Zoning Requirements. 24

25 The Infill Exemption is not applicable here because the Project is not consistent
with all applicable zoning requirements. As noted above, a categorical exemption for infill 20.

I plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning

2 designation and regulations." 14 CCR 15332(a).

3 21. The Project is within the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) zone. Under that
4 zone designation, Section 17.10.012 of the Municipal Code governs the allowable uses, permit
5 requirements and project review authority for said zone. The permitted uses in a C-N
6 (Neighborhood Commercial) Zone are as follows:
7 The C-N zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for neighborhood-scale 8 shopping centers compatible with adjacent residential areas, including supermarkets and drugstores on sites generally eight to ten acres in size providing 9 approximately a maximum of eighty thousand to one hundred thousand square feet
d'T1 Kauyurd 3 10 of gross floor area. The C-N zoning district is consistent with the neighborhood commercial land use designation of the general plan.
11 Rancho Mirage Municipal Code § 17.10.010.,
E Canyon Tahquit 1800 12 22. Simply stated, while the C-N zoning does allow for supermarkets and
13 drugstores, e.g., it does not presently allow for a fast-food restaurant. The City's Municipal
14 Code defines "Restaurants, fast-food" as "establishments whose primary business is the sale of
15 food and beverages to customers for consumption on-site or offsite. Less than fifty percent of

16 the floor area is used for customer seating, Interior furnishings include standardized floor plans,

17 stationary seats, and tables. Food is primarily pre-packaged rather than made to order.

18 Condiment bars and trash disposal are self-service. Drive-in or drive through facilities may be

19 allowed with a conditional use permit, granted in compliance with Chapter 17.48. Fast-food

20 restaurants have a higher turnover rate than standard restaurants."

21 23. The City concedes that the proposed use of the Project is presently nol
22 permitted where the Project is proposed to be situated (in a C-N zone):

23 "The proposed use, a fast-food restaurant is currently an unpermitted use in
24 the subject zone. Fast-food establishments are permitted within the Community Commercial (C-C) zone with approval of a Conditional Use Permit and in the
25 Regional Interstate Commercial zone with the approval of a Development Plan." Agenda, Staff Report, 5-20. (Emphasis added.)
--. 26
24. 27 Thus, the City cannot approve the Project under the Infill Exemption. The

28 exemption is clear: if the Project is "not consistent with the applicable general plan designation

- 8-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

+ 4.

1

2 and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and

3 regulations" it is not subject to that exemption. It is plain that the Project, as a "fast-food
restaurant" cannot be approved in the C-N zone as that designation is presently constituted.
Since it cannot be approved under the City's current zoning regiment, the Infill Exemption

5 under CEQA does not apply and the Project cannot proceed as currently promulgated.

6

7 (2) The City Cannot "Bootstrap" to the Zoning Problem to Avail Itself of Infill Exemption by Attempting to Amend Its Zoning Concurrently with

8 the Approval of the C.U.P.

9 25. Nor can the City attempt to remedy the above problem with its "bootstrapping"

d'Tt Kaurjuga y Audsnix Kadug UOIcE SPAOIS 10 amendments to the zoning designation for the Project. The Infill Exemption is not written -

11
E prospectively. Rather, that exemption only refers to the present zoning requirements. This

79ZZ61 12 makes sense. Ifa party could merely amend the zoning requirements along with an application

8
Palm Springs, 13 for a Conditional Use Permit, then such a "runaround" would render this exemption

*

3 1800 E. Tahquitz Canyon 14 meaningless. All an applicant would have to do to avail itself of this exemption is to assert

15 there was "no change" to zoning by concurrently filing for an amendment to the zoning.

16 Despite the clear language of the Infill Exemption, the City is nonetheless trying to bootstrap

17 twO amendments to its zoning code to remedy this glaring defect. These two proposed
amendments are as follows:
18 (1)
19 The Fast-food Amendment. A Zoning Text Amendment
application was submitted with the development package for the Project

20 pursuant to Section 17.72.020 of the RMMC. Since the Project is within the Neighborhood Commercial (C-N) zone, one of the two proposed
21 Zoning Text Amendments sought to modify allowable uses in the

22 Neighborhood Commercial zone, the proposal is to modify Section 17.10.012 to allow "Restaurant, Fast-Food" as a conditional use in large-

23 scale shopping centers (minimum 15-acre site) within the C-N (Neighborhood Commercial) and C-G (General Commercial) zones .

24 (2) The Large-Scale Shopping Center Amendment. Staff also

25 recommended an amendment to Section 17.90.020 of the RMMC,
"Definitions of specialized terms and phrases" of Title 17, "Zoning" of the ..i

26 Rancho Mirage Municipal Code be amended to include the definition of a

27 large-scale shopping center, which reads as follows: A "Large Scale
Shopping Center" is a comprehensively planned shopping center comprising 15 acres or more.
28

-9-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE .-.

1 26. As described in the Staff Report submitted in support of the Project, the City's
2 zoning text amendments ".. will simply modify the operational standards for a restaurant to

3 allow it to use a drive-through for customer service similar to what is already permitted at the

4 surrounding Shopping Center for Starbucks and CVS Pharmacy." Agenda, Staff Report, p. 5-
12. But for this modification, the Project could not operate a drive-through for customer service.

6 Therefore, as demonstrated by the City's own zoning text amendments, the Project, as proposed

7 and including a drive-through, is not consistent with the applicable zoning designation and

8 regulations and therefore is precluded from qualifying for the Infill Exemption.

27. In any event, even were the City's attempt at "bootstrapping" permissible (and
10 it is not), the two proposed zoning text amendments submitted by the City to rectify the zoning
11 problem that the Project faces post hoc must fail because the City has not conducted the
Z9TC6 VO ÁEM Canyon zunbyrl EaEM MSNO d'TT Kourguid  Audmya Kadwug uoug SeAoiS 12 required CEQA analysis of those amendments. Both the (1) Fast-food Amendment; and the (2)

13 Large Scale Shopping Center Amendment themselves are subject to CEQA review. The

14 administrative guidelines provide that the enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances are
1800 1 15 discretionary projects which are subject to the provisions of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080

16 and 14 Cal. Admin. Code 15378(a)(I). Accordingly, it has been held that in rezoning matters a

17 city or county must comply with the provisions of CEQA; and if an environmental impact

18 report is required, it must be prepared and considered before the ordinance is adopted.
Rosenthal v. Board of Supervisors (1975) 44 CA3d 815, 821, 119 CR 282• People v. County of 19 Kern (1976) 62 CA3d 761,769,133 CR 389; and Kleist v. City of Glendale (1976) 56 CA3d 20 770, 128 CR 781. The City has failed to conduct an independent analysis of CEQA as to the
21 proposed amendments and, therefore, the proposed amendments by themselves cannot be
22 passed in the manner currently proposed.
23
28. Also, an ordinance does not take effect until 30 days after adoption or second 24

25 reading. Since 30 days had not lapsed since the City Council's action, the reliance on the
passage of the zoning amendments was premature, on October 3, 2019, in that the City Council 26 lacked the legal authority to take the contemplated actions as though the zoning amendments 27 were a fait accompli. The Council was required first to address the proposed zoning text
28 amendments because this action impacted all properties zoned C-N and C-G. That process . 10 • .. +
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 required a second reading and 30 days before the ordinance would go into effect. The City

2 Council could not, as it did, approve a Conditional Use Permit before these ordinances went

3 into effect and the list of "permitted uses", adding fast food restaurants in C-N, and changing

4 the designation of a "large scale shopping center," had been codified.

5 (3) The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Adonted Mitigation Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval 6 for the Project.

7 29. The Infill Exemption is not appropriate because of the Project's impacts on
traffic, noise and other problems that have been noted in the record and further detailed below.
9 A categorical exemption for Infill development is not appropriate if the developer cannot show
d'T7 Ratuia y Audunys Kodwg uorg qesois 10 that in approval would not result in "any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or
11
E water quality." 14 CCR § 15332(d). In this case, the neighborhood is already experiencing
uoÁuozunbtrL '3 008[ Springs, C9TCS V. 12 significant effects relating to traffic from other similar developments.
13 30. Significantly, in evaluating whether 1 categorical exemption may apply, the 14 agency may not rely on mitigation measures as a basis for a concluding that a project is
15 categorically exempt, or as a basis for determining that one of the significant effects exceptions
16 does not apply. Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125
17 Cal.App. 4th 1098. The Staff Report prepared for the City Council contains admissions that the
18 City has sought mitigation measures to determine that significant effects exceptions does not
19 apply in the area of smell and traffic. See, e.g., the statements of Majna Dukic, Senior Planner
20 for the City that admits that ' the installation of air scrubbers was an added condition in order
21 to mitigate potential odor from the restaurant." See, the City's Agenda for the October 3, 2019

22 meeting, Staff Report, p. 5-44. In addition, other mitigating measures have been made a part of

23 the development agreement with In-N-Out Burgers.

24 31. These conditions of approval simply "kick the can" down the road and defer
25 required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
26 Conditioning a project on future review of environmental impacts, without evidence of the
27 likelihood of effective mitigation is insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency
28 that poientially significant impacts will be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. Of Mendocino (1988)
- 11 -
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
ca 1 1m

1 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring formulation of mitigation measures at a future time
2 violates the rule that members of the public and other agencies must be given an opportunity to

3 review mitigation measures before a project is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See

4 League for Protection of Oakland Architectural & Historic Resources v. City of Oakland

5 (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896.

6 (4) The Infill Exemption Does Not Apply Because the Project Will Have a Significant Environmental Impact to Traffic, Noise, Air Quality due to 7 "Unusual Circumstances" of an In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant.

8 32. The above Infill Exemption only applies where "Approval of the project would
9 not result in any significant éffects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality." This
8 d'T1 Kaurjurd 2 Kudimyt Kadug uomeg SeAOfS 10 simply is not the case here. As pointed out above, categorical exemptions to CEQA are to be

Aem uoueo zunbeel 1800 l construed strictly. Even assuming arguendo that the Project is actually subject to the Infill
7976 VO 'sSuuds wped 12 Exemption, it does not mean that it is automatically exempt from CEQA. It is still subject to
13 CEQA if it is shown that there is a significant impact on traffic, noise, and air quality. In .

14 McQueen v. Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 1136, the court uí 15 reiterated that categorical exemptions are construed strictly, shall not be unreasonably expended
16 beyond their terms, and may not be used where there is substantial evidence that there are

17 unusual circumstances (including future activities) resulting in (or which might reasonably

18 result in) significant impacts which threaten the environment.

19 33, Certain types of projects, such as construction of small structures or minor
20 changes to existing structures and Infill projects (when the above requirements are satisfied),
21 are considered "categorically exempt" from the often time-consuming and expensive process of
22 CEQA review. The reasoning behind these exemptions is that projects in the specified
23 categories are limited in nature and ordinarily do not pose a risk of causing adverse

24 environmental impacts. However, even when projects meet the requirements for a categorical

25 exemption, they may nevertheless be subject to CEQA review if the project would have a

26 significant effect on the environment due to "unusual circumstances," which constitutes an

27 exception to the exemption. See, 14 Cal Code Regs § 15300.2.

2 Thus, if there is a showing of "unusual circumstances" then an exemption under
CEQA does not apply. However, with the exception of a one-sentence statement that "The -1

proposed project will not have significant environmental impact due to unusual :

3 ..*

4 circumstances" (see, Agenda, Staff Report, p. 5-13), there is no analysis considering whether

6 the Project could create an unusual circumstance. Based on study of other In-N-Out

7 developments, there are circumstances unique to this specific type of fast food establishment
due to its popularity, high volume of customers, and queuing wait-time. None of these
circumstances were addressed by the City, nor were resulting impacts analyzed and never were

Maiphy & Pinkney LLP 10 they labeled, as most assuredly they are, "unusual circumstances." It is therefore improper to

REM uoÁuzO zunbyel 11 determine that the Project will not have a significant impact due to "unusual circumstances."

35.

79ZZ6 VO 12 As pointed out, an In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant, with a drive-through,

13 is not a typical project that should be run through without careful consideration. If ever there

14 was a case of "unusual circumstances" demonstrating a "one-ofP" from the analysis of a

15 proposed project that most certainly must be the case when considering an In-N-Out as just

16 "another" fast food restaurant. An In-N-Out Burgers fast-food restaurant is NOT just another

17 fast-food restaurant. In-N-Out Burges restaurants are notorious for their impact on the

18 surrounding environment. The traffic, noise, gas-house eiissions and otherwise overall

19 environmental degradation of these restaurants on surrounding neighborhoods is known to the

20 public at large and is storied. It is a love affair that the public has with this restaurant that also

21 brings an unfathomable burden on a surrounding neighborhood. The serious environmental
impacts need to be more thoroughly studied.

22 i. Negative Impacts to Water Quality from the Project were Not
Considered.

23 36.
24 In order to properly apply for the In-fill Exemption, the City was required to

25 demonstrate that there will be no significant effects to water quality. The Project would result in

26 the conversion of an unpaved area to a predominantly paved area. Doing so would substantially

27 decrease the permeability of that area, and could cause an increase in off-site stormwater.

28 Further, uses associated with the Project generate high levels of waste, in addition to hazardous
materials associated with idling vehicles. Without proper controls and design, this would create
- 13 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
:

1 a significant impact to water quality. However, the City has failed to analyze impacts to water
2 quality at all, instead asserting, with no verifiable analysis or reports, that "the proposed project
3 would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality."

4 Of note, the City offers nothing to support the conclusion related to water quality. As such, the

5 City has not reasonably demonstrated that the Project would not result in significant impacts to

6 water quality and therefore does not qualify for the In-fill Exemption.
ii. The Traffic Analysis Contains Key Errors That Underestimate 7 Significant Impacts.
8
37. In its traffic analysis, the City relief on a traffic analysis provided by the 9

d'77 Aauyurd 3 Kydinyg Aodug uOrg IPAOiS 10 Applicant that contains key errors which underestimated impacts. The traffic study relied on

11 data collected in August 2019 and applies a 50% increase since the data was collected during
8 the off season. It was derelict for the City to have considered the Project based on traffic study 29tc6 y Tahquitz Canyon 12
§ that was conducted in August 2019, when we all understand that traffic flow is at a fraction of 13

ui 'sSuuds wed what traffic might be expected during the winter months. After all, it is common knowledge that 14 the population of the Coachella Valley swells during the winter months from the influx of 008I 15 "snowbirds." Data from,nearby La Quinta shows that the valley has a full-time population of
16 200,000 out of season, and 800,000 in season, Further, there are 3.5 million visitors to the
17 valley during the high season, in addition to the full and part time residents. These numbers are
18 from 2013, so there has been a steep increase since those numbers were complied. The City has
19 utilized a multiplying fact of 50% to its factoring of "summer" versus "winter" traffic which,
20 then, is off-base. Based on the above numbers, there should be an appropriate 200% multiplying
21 factor not a 50% increase.

22 38. Further, there are inconsistencies between the size of the restaurant proposed 23 and that utilized in the traffic study. The plans presented for the project show 3,885 square feet
24 (SF) with an additional patio of 1,762 SF, but the traffic study fails to account for the additional
25 patio space (instead using only 1,102 SF). Because Project-generated traffic is dependent on
26 area, this error underestimates the amount of traffic generated by the Project. There are further
27 inconsistencies within the report where project generated trips are reported to be 1,184, reduced
.. 28 to 858, but in a different location reported as 754.

~14- •

: PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P 39. Neither the traffic study nor the City Staff addressed the Project's potential
2 impacts under Senate Bill 743 (SB 743). SB 743 changes the focus of transportation impact

3 analysis in CEQA from measuring impacts to drivers, to measuring the impact of driving. The

4 change is being made by replacing level of service ("LOS") with vehicle miles of travel (VMT)

5 and providing streamlined review of land use and transportation projects that will help reduce

6 future VMT growth. This shift in transportation impact focus is expected to better align

7 transportation-impact analysis and mitigation outcomes with the State's goals to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, encourage infill development, and improve public health

9 through more active transportation. In January 2019, the Natural Resources Agency finalized

10 updates to the CEQA Guidelines including the incorporation of SB 743 modifications. The

Rem uoÁuco: atnbiei I1 Kouyurd  Áudnyn Kadurg uorg yesois 11 Guidelines changes were approved by the Office of Administrative Law and are now in effect.
The Project is certainly not consistent with State guidelines to reduce GHG emissions and
12 enhancement of active transportation. In fact, the drive-through restaurant encourages idling
13 and exacerbates GHG cmissions. Further, unusual circumstances surrounding In-N-Out given
14
ui its popularity actually encourage patrons to drive further and choose to visit the establishment 1800. 79ZZ6 VO 'ssuuds wed 15 when compared to other similar restaurants. Not only does the traffic study fail to address the
16 project's compliance with SB 743, it does not disclose potential impacts from an increase in
17 VMT. These potentially significant impacts are neither analyzed nor disclosed and render the
18 use of the In-fill Exemption noncompliant with CEQA.

19 40. The City also violated fundamental Due Process requirements by not providing 20 referenced data that is relied upon to make its conclusions. In the City's In-N-Out Burger study
21 submitted by Linscott, Law & Greenspan, Engineers (LLG), dated August 26, 2019, there was a
22 reference to a traffic study performed in 2014. On page of that report there is reference to an
23 "Updated Site Access Analysis Report for the proposed Rancho Las Palmas Center
24 Redevelopment Project, dated April 30, 2014" prepared by LLG. LLG states that that 2014
25 study was "enclosed Under separate cover". However, it was not included.
26
41. The failure to provide all the available data to the public is a glaring omission
27 and a violation of elementary precepts of Due Process. The only study provided was the one in
28 August 2019 between the hours of 4 pm and 5 PM (the time at which traffic is unreasonably, - 15 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and unseasonably, slow.) The study specifically states that "during the peak hour of traffic

2 between four and five there would be no impact on traffic." In fact, the study did not say that
3 there wouldn't be any significant impact on traffic during any other hours. Since the full study,

4 and the 2014 Study, was not disclosed it is not possible to see when there might be other peak

5 traffic hours and perhaps there would be a peak hour in the morning or lunch or some other

6 time that might have an impact on the traffic. A traffic study with only a few hours test is not
availing. The public should be entitled to review of the full report. We know from the 2017
study the City conducted that the peak traffic was not at 4-5 pm but rather the greatest flows
were 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. but most often at the lunch hours (2017 ITE traffic data for a fast
food restaurant with a window peak percentage of traffic occurs between 12:00 p.m. and 1:00
4 d'TI Keunuid 3 Kydmin Kodurg uoseg quAoIs 10 p.m.). So, the City, in conjunction with In-N-Out Burgers, supplied traffic data that may have 11
E just ignored the peak lunch hour and just made a statement that "during the peak pm hour that 29tZ6' 12 there would be no significant impact on traffic". It is clear that the entire traffic study and data 3 tofumg zunbyei 3008L säuuds sujed 13 are not being provided for a reason. Before the City can proceed with the proposed project, our
14 clients, and the public deserve that information.
15 iii. Negative Impacts to Sound Quality from Noise from the Project will
be Considerable. 16

17 42. The City also failed to properly analyze and mitigate significant impacts from
18 noise from the Project. The City gives short shrift to its goal to maintain the quiet environment
19 that it refers to on its website referring to its General Plan:

20 Rancho Mirage generally enjoys a quiet noise environment, with existing community noise being dominated by highway and local traffic, intermittent
22. aircraft flyovers, and commercial operations. The Noise Element is intended to help align the community's various land uses with the existing and future noise environment and thus ensure that any negative effects of noise are minimized or
23 completely avoided.

24 Low noise levels are considered to be a major economic asset of Rancho Mirage's resort and residential atmosphere. As development continues, the City shall 25 carefully review proposals to ensure that land uses incompatible with the noise environment are avoided. It is the purpose of this element to identify noise 26 problems in Rancho Mirage and the SOI and to minimize future noise impacts
27 resulting from continued growth.

only discusses the potential impact of the operational noise generated by the Project in one short

8 paragraph (most of which only pertains to the construction of the Project):
Construction of the project would generate sporadic, temporary vibration effects 9 adjacent to the project area but would not be expected to exceed the significance thresholds. Operation of the project would generate noise from project-related traffic or from on-site sources (drive-through queuing, parking, amplified speech J1 ouui 3 Kydma 8 Slovak Baron Empey 10

Court held that air quality analysis must make a reasonable effort to substantively connect a 21 project's air quality impacts to likely health consequences. While the air quality analysis 22 provided summarizes Friant Ranch, it makes no effort to address the health effects to nearby
23 sensitive receptors from the large quantity of idling vehicles consistent with In-N-Out
24 establishments. The analysis, in order to actually demonstrate that there are no significant
25 impacts to air quality, is required to "connect" adverse human health effects to the levels of

.- -* 26 pollutants that would be emitted by the project. Until or unless this has been completed, the
27 project cannot be shown to be consistent with the In-fill Exemption.

L 46. As such, the City has not

2 reasonably demonstrated that the Project would not

3 r'esult in significant impacts to air quality and therefore does not qualify for the In-fill
Exemption.

4 47.
5 In approving the Project under these circumstances, the County violated the

6 requirements of CEQA and California Code of Regulations, tit.14, sections 15000 et seq.

7 (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines"), which provide that the City must prepare, consider, and

8 certify an EIR prior to the approval of any project that may have a significant impact on the
environment. CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR whenever there is a "fair argument" that
the project may have significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment.

11 The County's failure to prepare an EIR prior to its approval of Project, despite the existence of

§ substantial evidence that the Project may have significant adverse effects on the environment,
L 1 800 E. Tahquitz Canyon 29776 VD 'söuuds wid 12 including on air resources, water resources, human health and safety, constitutes prejudicial

13 abuse of discretion.

15 The Project is subject to CEQA and Petitioner made fair argument regarding

16 the significant environmental effects of the Project. Respondent thereby violated its duties to

17 conduct an Initial Study conforming to the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
Accordingly, the City's adoption of the Project must be set aside.

18 49.
19 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the City's failure to discharge its

20 clear legal duties under CEQA. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate

21 setting aside the County's certification of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of

22 the Conditional Use Permit for the Project and enjoining any activity pursuant to the Project

23 approval until the City prepares, considers, and certifies a legally adequate EIR. Issuance of the

24 requested relief will confer t significant benefit on the public and will result in the enforcement

25 of important public rights, including the public's right to disclosure of the potentially significant
