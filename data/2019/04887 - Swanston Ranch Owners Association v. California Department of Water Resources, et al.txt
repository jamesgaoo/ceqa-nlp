21 UNITED STATES BUREAU OF RECLAMATIN, and DOES 21 through 100)

22 Real Parties in Interest

23 1. By this action, Petitioner Swanston Ranch Owners Association challenge

24 Respondent California Department of Water Resources certification of the Final Environmental

25 Impact Statement/Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Yolo Bypass Salmonid

26 Habitat Restoration and Fish Passage Project ("Project"), the required findings under the

27 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et

28 seq., and the approval of the Project.

- 2. Petitioners seek a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the

2 Project is invalid and void and that the EIR prepared for the Project fails to satisfy the

3 requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

11 with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

BACKGROUND FACTS

12

13 A. NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE'S BIOLOGICAL OPINION

8.

14 DWR and Reclamation operate the SWP and CVP in a coordinated manner to

15 deliver water to agricultural, municipal, and industrial contractors throughout California. On

16 June 4, 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Services ("NMFS") released Biological Opinion

17 ("BO") that concluded the CVP and SWP operations are likely to jeopardize the continued

18 existence of four anadromous fish species listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act

19 ("ESA"), 16 U.S.C., § 1531, et seq: 1) Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon; 2)

20 Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon; 3) Central Valley steelhead, and 4) the Southern

21 Distinct Population Segment ("DPS") of North American green sturgeon. NMFS's BO

22 concluded that operations were likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat

23 for these four anadromous fish species. The BO sets forth Reasonable and Prudent Alternative

24 ("RPA") actions that would allow CVP and SWP operations to remain in compliance with the

ESA.

25 9.

26 The BO identified acti vities in the RPA discussion actions I.7 and I.6.1 to improve

27 fish passage and habitat restoration actions in the lower Sacramento River basin, including the

28 Yolo Bypass. The Yolo Bypass currently experiences at least some flooding in approximately
70 percent of years and retains many characteristics of the historical floodplain habitat that are

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

1 favorable to various fish species. The RPA actions seek to enhance existing floodplain benefits
2 in the lower Sacramento River basin and improve fish passage in the Yolo Bypass. The primary |
0 10∞ function of the Yolo is Bypass is flood control, with much of it also managed as agricultural land
or wetland waterfowl habitat.

10. The two RPA actions that formed the basis for the Project are:

a. RPA Action I.6.1: Restore floodplain rearing habitat for juvenile
Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run Chinook salmon, and -
Central Valley steelhead through increased acreage of seasonal floodplain inundation within the
9 lower Sacramento River basin.

10 b. RPA Action I.7: Reduce migratory delays and loss of salmon, steelhead,
11 and sturgeon at Fremont Weir and other structures in the Yolo Bypass (NMFS 2009)
12 B. THE PROJECT SITE AND LOCATION
13 11. The Project area includes the lower Sacramento River basin, including the Yolo
14 Bypass, in Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, and Yolo counties, California. The major water bodies|
- 15 and infrastructure located within the Project area include the Sacramento River; Fremont,
16 Sacramento, and Lisbon weirs; Knights Landing Ridge Cut and Wallace Weir; Cache and Putah
17 creeks; Willow Slough Bypass; Tule Canal; and the Toe Drain. Project actions are primarily
18 located along Fremont Weir and within the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area south to Agricultural -
19 Road Crossing 1.

20 12. Project, which The Yolo Bypass is part of the Sacramento River Flood Control
21 includes levees, weirs, and bypass facilities that help manage the historic flooding in the
22 Sacramento Valley (DWR 2010). The Yolo Bypass is an approximate 59,000-acre area that can
23 convey a design flow of 343,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs"), which is about 80 percent of the
24 floodwaters in this area. The existing facilities in the Yolo Bypass area include the following:
25 the Fremont Weir; the Sacramento Weir; Tule Pond; Agricultural Road Crossing 1; Tule Canal;
26 Toe Drain; Lisbon Weir; and Wallace Weir Fish Rescue Facility. I-5 and I-80 both have
27 bridges that span the width of the Yolo Bypass.

28 13. The Project seeks to implement actions I.6.1 and I.7 identified in the National

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

0

- Marine Fisheries Service's ("NMFS") 2009 Biological Opinion and Conference Opinion on the

2 Long-term Operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project Reasonable and

3 Prudent Alternative. These actions consist of salmonid habitat restoration efforts within the

4 lower Sacramento River basin and fish passage through the Yolo Bypass. The Project seeks to
5 benefit Sacramento River winter-run Chinook salmon, Central Valley spring-run Chinook - -
salmon, Central Valley steelhead, and the Southern DPS of North American green sturgeon.
0 C. THE PROJECT

8 14. The Project consists of an intake channel, headworks structure, a transport

9 channel, and downstream channel improvements. Under different alternatives, each of these

10 facilities may be constructed in a different location as part of one of three different channel

11 alignments (east, center, and west) in the Yolo Bypass. Each alignment would terminate

12 downstream into the existing Tule Pond. The intake channel connects the Sacramento River to

13 the headworks structure at the appropriate elevation to facilitate an upstream fish passage
14 facility for adult fish and for passing rearing habitat flows and juvenile salmonids. The

15 headworks structure bisects the existing Fremont Weir at one of three locations (east, center, or

16 west) and controls the diversion of Project flow from the Sacramento River into the Yolo

17 Bypass. It will also serve as the primary upstream fish passage facility for adult fish and the

18 primary facility for passing rearing habitat flows and juvenile salmonids into the Yolo Bypass.

19 The headworks include a concrete control structure, an upstream vehicular bridge crossing, and

20 a concrete channel transition, which transitions the rectangular sides of the control structure to

21 the side channel slopes of the transport channel.

22 15. The transport channel serves as the primary facility for upstream adult fish passage

23 between the existing Tule Pond and the headworks structure. It will also serve as the primary

24 channel for conveying juvenile salmonids and rearing habitat flows from the headworks

25 structure to the existing Tule Pond. The Downstream Channel Improvements will be made to

26 the existing channel that extends from the Tule Pond outlet to the beginning of Tule Canal. The

27 improvements are to facilitate upstream adult fish passage between the existing Tule Canal and

28 Tule Pond.

14 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
28. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 26,

15

16 Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a

17 manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for

18 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.
29.

19 Respondent's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate

20 the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings of Fact are not supported by
substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)
30.

22 The EIR failed to adequately describe the environmental setting as it contains no
discussion of wetlands and recreational interests associated with

23 Swanston Ranch. (See EIR Section 1.5.)

24

25 The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

26 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by

27 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by
substantial evidence.

28 The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's
impacts to terrestrial resources. The EIR's discussion and analysis regarding hydrology/ -

O

H N m t1ON00 flooding failed to address the impacts to terrestrial resources, particularly those in the area that
constitute the area of the former Swanston Ranch. The EIR fails to adequately discuss, analyze -

and mitigate the Project's disturbance and/or mortality to nesting bird species of and loss of
suitable nesting and foraging habitat. The EIR fails to adequately address the Project's impacts
to movement of wildlife, impacts to nesting and foraging bird habitat and impacts to wetland

management.

b. The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

9 impacts to existing land uses. The EIR's discussion and analysis regarding hydrology/ flooding

10 failed to address the impacts to existing land uses, particularly those in the area of the former
Swanston Ranch. The EIR also fails to address the potential impacts associated with the loss of -

11

12 education, wildlife viewing and hunting days in the wildlife area. The EIR also fails to address

13 the impairment of the function of the thousands of acres of managed seasonal wetlands on the

14 Yolo Basin Wildlife Area that will be caused by the Project's additional flooding.

C.

15 The EIR fails to adequately address, analyze and mitigate the Project's

16 impacts to recreational uses. The EIR's discussion and analysis regarding hydrology/ flooding

17 failed to address the impacts to existing recreational uses, particularly those in the area of the

18 former Swanston Ranch. While the EIR concludes that there will be no significant increase in

19 the use of recreational facilities, it fails to address the adverse effects of the Project on existing -.

20 hunting and other recreational activities, which may result due to the loss, and decrease of

21 active management, of shallow-flooded wetlands for migratory waterfowl.

d.

22 The EIR also fails to adequately discuss and analyze the Project's

23 environmental justice issues associated with the loss of recreation opportunities for under-
priviliged children.

24 32.

25 Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under

26 CEQA. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the

27 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside the
certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

28 PRAYER FOR RELIEE

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
