Beneficial Use of Groundwater. •........................................ 9l

2. The RWQCB Basin Plan Prohibits Deliberate
Contamination......... 104

3. The Commission's Decision is Contrary to SGMA's
Objectives. .............. 107 **eecc.....................................
4. The Project Will Violate Monterey County's Recent
Moratorium on Certain New Wells...................................1.09
5. The Project, to the Extent it May Operate Lawfully But Will
Still Diminish or Degrade MCWD's Groundwater Supply
Sources, Will Work an Unconstitutional Taking of MCWD's
Water Rights Without Just Compensation............................. 111
B. D.18-09-017 Violates the Public Utilities Code.......................... 112
1. The MPWSP is Not Required by the Present or Future Public Convenience and Necessity....................................... .1.13
2. The Commission Failed to Condition its Approval to
Address MCWD's Complaint of Interference......................... 117
3. The Commission Failed to Give Fair Consideration to
Public Agency Alternatives.. ........................****..****:.*.*.122
4. The Costs of the MPWSP are not Just and Reasonable. .......... 126
C. The Commission's Decision Violates CEQA............................... 130
1. The Commission unlawfully approved the project based on an
improper project description and without considering a
reasonable range of potentially feasible alternatives, ignoring feasible alternatives proposed by sister and responsible agencies and public interest groups that would avoid or substantially reduce the MPWSP's environmental impacts. ......................... 130
a. The FEIR misidentified the "proposed project," which precluded the Commission from identifying and analyzing alternatives that would reduce or avoid impacts...............................................1..1
b. The FEIR failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives
by utilizing a strawman 9.6 MGD facility as the "proposed project" rather than the 6.4 MGD facility included in the Cal-Am's revised
application, despite the fact that Commission approval of the PWM Project rendered the initially proposed 9.6 MGD facility infeasible
and unnecessary.............. 134

C. The FEIR failed to evaluate potentially feasible reduced-capacity
alternatives, based largely on an erroneous and unsupported supply
and demand analysis....... 135

4

d. The Commission violated CEQA by ordering the project applicant to evaluate a potentially feasible alternative that would significantly lessen - if not avoid entirely - the MPWSP's significant and unavoidable impacts, after project approval and outside of the CEQA process. . . 139
e. The FEIR failed to analyze potentially feasible alternative intake technologies, including Horizontal Directional Drilling that would avoid or reduce ESHA and groundwater impacts. .............. 141
f. The FEIR's conclusion that Alternative 5a was the
environmentally superior alternative is not supported by
substantial evidence....... .......................................... 143
2. The Commission failed to integrate its review of impacts to ESHA with other procedures required by responsible agencies, which renders the FEIR's analysis of alternatives unusable
for responsible agencies' future decisions.............................144
3. The FEIR Failed to Disclose and Mitigate the MPWSP's
Significant Groundwater Impacts in Violation of CEQA. ...... 150
a. The FEIR failed to analyze and disclose the volume of
groundwater in the Project area aquifers that would be affected by the Project, including groundwater that meets the Basin Plan standards for beneficial uses.......................................................150
b. The FEIR violated CEQA by establishing baseline groundwater conditions and adopting its threshold of significance for the MPWSP without using the applicable water quality standards adopted in the RWQCB's Basin Plan or considering SGMA....... 158

C. The FEIR violated CEQA by failing to include a "substantively meaningful" analysis of cumulative impacts, relying instead on inaccurate assumptions and flawed groundwater modeling that, admittedly, by design did not evaluate water quality impacts or cumulative groundwater impacts................................................161
d. The Commission violated CEQA by adopting mitigation that (1) allows the project applicant to determine, after the fact, whether the project causes significant impacts; and
(2) requires the applicant to provide desalinated water only to
groundwater users located north of the Salinas River rather than
south of the Salinas River where all of the significant groundwater
impacts will occur......... ................................... 165

5

e. The Commission violated CEQA's requirement that decision- makers exercise their own independent judgment when it relied on evidence and analysis provided by persons known to the Commission to have a conflict of interest, did not require expert peer review, denied the request of the parties to examine the scope and nature of such conflicts in an evidentiary hearing, and then delegated authority to those conflicted persons to determine, after the fact, whether the project causes significant impacts to
groundwater................ .................................... 167
4. The Commission violated CEQA by failing to provide good faith, reasoned analysis in response to comments by sister agencies and the public on the RDEIR's analysis of water rights, likely significant impacts to groundwater and ESHA, demand analysis and the need for the project, and project alternatives. 169
5. The Commission violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the
RDEIR in light of significant new information demonstrating that
(1) the MPWSP's impacts to ESHA and groundwater are
substantially more severe than the RDEIR disclosed; (2) there are
feasible project alternatives and-mitigation-measures-that Cal-Am- has not adopted that would avoid or substantially lessen the proposed project's significant and unavoidable environmental impacts; and (3) the RDEIR's use of the initially-proposed 9.6 MGD facility, and its discussion of ESHA and groundwater
impacts, was so fundamentally and basically inadequate that
meaningful public review and comment were precluded......... 171
D. The Commission's Decision Prejudicially Violates Due
Process. ..................... ............................................ 172
1. The Parties a Were Denied a Hearing on Influence on the Environment, a CPCN Factor under Section 1002(a). ............. 174
2. The Commission Failed to Refer Groundwater Rights and
Groundwater Harm Questions to the SWRCB or the Courts... 176
3. The Commission Failed to Afford the Parties a Hearing on the Public Agencies' Further Progress with Feasible Alternatives, Including the Proposed PWM Expansion...............................178
4. The Commission Denied MCWD's Request for a Hearing on Conflicts of Interest. ............................................. 180
E. The Commission's Decision Violates MCWD's Right to be Free from Impairment of its Contracts. •-----..................... 181
1. MCWD Contracted for Protection of its Groundwater. ........... 182

6

2. MCWD Contracted for a 500 AFY a Limitation on
Groundwater Pumping at the CEMEX Property. .................... 185

TO THE HONORABLE CHIEF JUSTICE TANI G. CANTIL-SAKAUYE
AND THE HONORABLE ASSOCIATE JUSTICES OF THE COURT:

STATEMENT OF THE CASE AND ISSUES PRESENTED

Introduction

This verified petition for an original writ of review/mandate timely
raises the challenge of petitioner Marina Coast Water District ("MCWD") to

California Public Utilities Commission ("Commission" or "CPUC")

Decision ("D.") 18-09-017. In D.18-09-017, the Commission granted a
Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity ("CPCN") and certified a
Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR" or "Final EIR") under the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), approving the
construction and operation of a new public utility desalination project in the
City of Marina in Monterey County. (Pub. Util. Code § 1001; see Pub.
Resources Code § 21168.6; Pub. Util. Code § 1756, subd. (f).) The

challenged project is intended to serve the more affluent cities on the
Monterey Peninsula, such as Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel, all of
which are outside of MCWD's service territory. The project threatens grave

and irremediable harm to MCWD's existing municipal groundwater supply
in the Monterey Sub-basin of the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin
("SVGB"), as well as the immediately-adjacent, critically overdrafted

Public Resources Code, sections 21000 et seq.

16

180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin of the SVGB where the project's source

wells would be located. The sole source of water for MCWD's municipal

supply for its diverse customer base in Marina and the neighboring Fort Ord

community is its groundwater wells, which are located in close proximity to

the proposed well field for the project. (Ex. MCD-64 [26APP422, p.

A18955]2.)

MCWD contends that D.18-09-017 violates the reasonable and

beneficial use requirements of article X, section 2 of the California

Constitution, fundamental principles of California water law, established
requirements of the Public Utilities Code and CEQA, and the due process
guarantees of the California and U.S. Constitutions. The decision so far
deviates from applicable constitutional and statutory requirements, and the
Commission's duty to protect the public interest, which is the primary

justification for the agency's existence, that it appears the Commission

simply acquiesced in the regulated utility's will. The Court should give
MCWD's apparently meritorious claims of legal error the close and careful
scrutiny that those claims did not receive from the Commission.
The stated primary purpose of the desalination project is to enable

2 Appendix ("APP"), Volume 26, tab 422 at p. A18955. Volumes 1-81 of MCWD's Appendix were filed in Case No. S251935; MCWD is by separate
motion requesting the Court to take judicial notice of volumes 1 through 81 of MCWD's Appendix in Case No. S251935. Volume 82 of MCWD's Appendix is being filed concurrently with this petition.

17

applicant and real party in interest California-American Water Company

("Cal-Am"), a Commission-regulated water utility, to halt its longstanding

illegal diversions of water from the Carmel River, which the State Water

Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") concluded in 1995 were adversely
impacting endangered species and their riparian environment. (Amended
Application, App. H, p. 1 (first bullet) [14APP216, p. A10018]; see SWRCB
Order WR 95-10, pp. 28-29.) However, Cal-Am's need to exceed the lawful
limits of its existing supply sources in order to serve its present and future

customers has effectively been eliminated, due to the Commission's

regulatory policies, effective ratepayer conservation efforts, recently enacted

conservation legislation, state conservation policies embodied in the

Governor's Executive Orders, Cal-Am's repairs to leaks and losses in its

aging distribution system, Cal-Am's reduced and ever-declining demand for

potable water over the past five years, and the imminent arrival of a major

new source of supply approved by the Commission and currently under

construction. Without the proposed project, Cal-Am has already reduced

significantly and soon will likely eliminate entirely all illegal withdrawals

from the Carmel River, thereby achieving the project's primary objective
well before December 31, 2021, the latest deadline for halting its illegal

withdrawals from the Carmel River set by the SWRCB. (SWRCB Order WR

2016-0016, p. 2 [18APP300, p. A13545].) In sum, the challenged
desalination project is not needed.

18

Moreover, even if a small shortfall in lawful supply potentially could

remain at the end of 2021, or could develop at some time in the foreseeable

future, feasible supply alternatives capable of satisfying that shortfall are

ready and waiting for the Commission's prompt consideration and approval.

Such alternatives include the proposed public agency supply options of

expanding the Pure Water Monterey project and approving water sales to
Cal-Am from MCWD. These alternatives would be far less costly, much
sooner-available, and significantly less environmentally impactful than the
challenged desalination project. What is more, the public agency supply
alternatives are broadly supported by most of the public agency, consumer,
public interest, and environmental parties to the proceeding. At Cal-Am's

urging, the Commission chose not to seriously examine these apparently

viable and sufficient supply alternatives.

This petition is MCWD's sole means of seeking judicial review of
D.18-09-017. D.18-09-017 would permit Cal-Am to pump groundwater

from the shallow coastal aquifers of a designated critically overdrafted sub-
basin of the SVGB, in close proximity to MCWD's municipal wells and in a
volume five times in excess of the volume of groundwater MCWD currently
draws. (See Petition 11 140, 141, infra.) Nevertheless, without satisfying

the requirements of CEQA, without allowing the additional level of

evidentiary scrutiny of environmental impacts required in a CPCN

proceeding by Public Utilities Code section 1002, subd. (a)(4) and Public

19

Utilities Code section 1710, without protecting the existing groundwater

supply of a neighboring public agency in the public interest as mandated by

Public Utilities Code section 1001, and without giving due consideration to

California's constitutional mandate for reasonable and beneficial use of

groundwater and the avoidance of waste, let alone the state policy mandating
the sustainable use of groundwater in a critically overdrafted sub-basin, the

Commission has approved the utility's grossly oversized and entirely

unnecessary preferred project, allowing Cal-Am to dramatically increase the

rate base upon which it charges its customers for water service and hence

also to increase dramatically its return-on-equity and profit. Notably, Cal-

Am's Monterey District customers already pay the highest residential water
rates in the nation. (See MCWD's Comments on Proposed Decision, p. 25,

fn. 149, citing Ex. PWN-1, pp. 5-6, Att. B; PWN-3.)

This is not a petition for discretionary review of a court of appeal

decision under Rule of Court 8.500. It is an original proceeding constituting
the sole means of obtaining judicial review of a Commission decision both

under CEQA and in a water utility case. (Pub. Resources Code § 21168.6;

Pub. Util. Code § 1756, subd. (f); see Rule of Court 8.496.) Among other
things, the approved desalination project will engender grave, unmitigated

risk of significant harm to the groundwater aquifers that MCWD relies upon

to supply water to residents of the City of Marina and the adjacent Fort Ord

community in violation of the Public Utilities Code, CEQA, the Water Code,

20

and the California Constitution. The approved desalination project is not
needed, but it will seriously endanger MCWD's water supply, and it will
destroy over seven acres of rare coastal dune habitat in violation of the City

of Marina's Local Coastal Land Use Plan ("LCLUP") and the Coastal Act's

protections for Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas ("ESHA"). In

addition to the grave public importance of the issues presented, review must

be granted for two additional reasons.

First, it is well settled that where a writ of review is the sole means of

obtaining judicial review of a Commission decision, the grant of the writ is
not discretionary. (City of Huntington Beach v. Public Utilities Com. (2013)
214 Cal.App.4th 566, 584.) The writ must be granted whenever the petition
is "apparently meritorious." (Powers v. City of Richmond (1995) 10 Cal.4th
85, 114.) As the court of appeal has noted in granting review of Commission
decisions that were subject to its statutory writ of review jurisdiction,
"[b]ecause review by extraordinary writ is the only means of judicial review,

a court ordinarily has no discretion to deny a timely-filed petition for writ of

review if it appears that the petition may be meritorious." (City of Huntington
Beach, supra, 214 Cal.App.4th at 583, quoting Southern California Edison
Co. V. Public Utilities Com. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1096, and citing
PG&E Corp. V. Public Utilities Com. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1193,
and Pacific Bell v. Public Utilities Com. (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 269, 276-

280.) Here, because the issues raised in this petition are apparently

21

meritorious, the writ must be granted.
Second, the writ must be granted and the Commission directed
promptly to file a return containing the complete, certified administrative
record because the Commission has taken the position that it need not prepare

the administrative record until after the Court grants the writ. (Pub. Util.

Code § 1756, subd. (a); see Pub. Resources Code § 21167.6, subd. (e); see

Case No. S251935, Oct. 26, 2018 CPUC Motion to Dismiss, p. 15.3) Without

the Commission's complete administrative record, the parties are unable to

fully brief, and the Court is unable to determine, the extent to which the

Commission's decision was based on the complete evidentiary record. The

full record is required for the Court's determination of whether the

Commission's findings are supported by "the weight of the evidence" or

"substantial evidence in light of the whole record," and whether the

Commission "abused its discretion" or failed to "regularly pursue its

authority." (Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code § 21168; Pub.

Util. Code §§ 1757.1, subd. (b), 1760.) Denial of this petition without first

requiring the filing of the complete administrative record and merits briefing

3 While Pub. Resources Code § 21167.6 states that in proceedings involving the Commission not all of the section's provisions apply, the Legislature apparently intended at a minimum for the enumeration of content of the record, as set forth in subdivision (e), to apply to such proceedings; otherwise, all decisions of the Commission under CEQA and its CEQA
decision-making processes would effectively and unlawfully be insulated
from judicial scrutiny.
22

upon that record would render the Commission's decision wholly

unreviewable, contrary to the clear intention of the Legislature. (Pub. Util.

Code § 1756, subd. (f); Pub. Resources Code § 21168.6.)4

Procedural Posture of the Case

On October 12, 2018, within thirty days of the Commission's issuance

of D.18-09-017 and the filing of its Notice of Determination ("NOD") under

CEQA, MCWD timely filed a petition for writ of review/mandate in Case

No. S251935, which raised all of MCWD's claims of error under CEQA

arising from D.18-09-017. On October 19, 2018, MCWD timely filed an

application for rehearing before the Commission, raising all claims of error

addressed in MCWD's October 12 petition and in this petition. (Pub. Util.

Code §§ 1731, subd. (b)(1), 1732, 1733, subd. (b), 1756, subd. (a).) On

December 12, 2018, the Court issued its order denying MCWD's October

12, 2018 petition, without prejudice to MCWD's filing a new petition for

writ of review upon completion of the rehearing process under Public

Utilities Code § 1731, subd. (b). (See Docket, Case No. S251935.) As noted

in MCWD's earlier petition, which addressed only errors under CEQA,

Over the past several years, MCWD has submitted multiple Public Records
Act requests to the Commission to obtain documents that should be part of the administrative record here. On November 30, 2018, the Commission
began producing records in response to MCWD's request submitted
September 13, 2017. (See 41 APP583, 584, 585, pp. A27544-27552; see also
82APP603-82APP615, pp. A44816-44892.)
23

litigants wishing to challenge a Commission decision under CEQA face two

different jurisdictional deadlines. Under the applicable CEQA statute of

limitations, any judicial challenge must be made no later than thirty days

following the public agency's filing of a NOD with the State Clearinghouse.
(Pub. Resources Code § 21167.) Here, because the Commission's NOD was
filed on September 14, 2018, MCWD timely filed its petition in Case No.

S251395 on October 12, 2018. However, under the provisions of the Public

Utilities Code, litigants may not seek judicial review of a Commission

decision without having applied to the Commission for rehearing of the legal

errors alleged. (Pub. Util. Code §§ 1731, subd. (b)(1); 1733.) Such

application for rehearing must be filed within thirty days of the

Commission's issuance of its decision. (Pub. Util. Code § 1731, subd.

(b)(1).) Here, because the Commission's decision was issued on September
20, 2018, MCWD timely filed its application for rehearing on October 19,

2018.

Consistent with this Court's order of December 12, 2018 in Case No.

S251935, a litigant seeking judicial review after filing a timely application

for rehearing with the a Commission may file a petition for a writ of review

with the reviewing court within 30 days after the Commission issues its

decision on the application for rehearing. (Pub. Util. Code § 1731, subd. (b).)

Alternatively, if no decision on the application for rehearing has issued and

at least sixty days have elapsed following the filing of the application for

24

rehearing, the litigant may deem the application for rehearing denied and file

its petition for writ of review with the reviewing court. (Pub. Util. Code

§ 1733, subd. (b).) Below, MCWD raised all its claims of legal error in its

application for rehearing of D.18-09-017. (MCWD Appl. for Rehearing,

82APP592, pp. A44172-233.) On December 12, 2018, the Court issued its

order denying without prejudice MCWD's October 12, 2018 petition on

CEQA issues, subject to the completion of the rehearing process. (See

Docket, Case No. S251935.) MCWD hereby deems its application for

rehearing denied. With the filing of this petition more than sixty days after
the filing of MCWD's application for rehearing below, and MCWD today

deeming its application for rehearing denied, the rehearing process is now

complete, and the issues raised herein are ripe for the Court's review. (Pub.
Util. Code § 1731, subd. (b); Pub. Util. Code § 1733, subd. (b).)5
Before filing this petition, MCWD afforded the Commission ample
opportunity to render a decision on its application for rehearing, which the
Commission represented it would do at its December 13, 2018 or its January
10, 2019 voting meeting (Case No. S251935, Reply to Answer to Motion to
Dismiss, pp. 19-20 and fn. 15), but the Commission failed to do so at either

5 The Commission acknowledges that upon the passage of sixty days from filing an application for rehearing if the Commission has taken no action a party may properly take the application to be denied and seek judicial review, thereby vesting jurisdiction of the matter with the Court. (CPUC Motion to Dismiss, Case No. S251935, pp, 9-10.)

25

meeting.6 MCWD's deeming the application denied under section 1733,

subd. (b), completes the application for rehearing process by vesting

appellate jurisdiction in this Court. MCWD having deemed its application

for rehearing denied, there is no pending application for rehearing for the

Commission to address in another decision, and the petition for writ of

review/mandate in any event "serves in effect the office of an appeal."
(Consumers Lobby Against Monopolies v. Public Utilities Com. (1979) 25
Cal.3d 891 ("CLAM"'), 901, 903.) Moreover, only a decision expressly

vacating D.18-09-017's certification of the FEIR, its approval of the project

and its grant of a CPCN would render the all of the claims of legal error in

this petition moot. Indeed, under the Public Utilities Code, even a grant of

rehearing does not vacate the original decision. (Pub. Util. Code §§ 1734,

1735.)

6 The CPUC's interpretation of the "deemed denied" language in Public
Utilities Code section 1733, subd. (b), which would cut off the aggrieved
litigant's ability to deem an application for rehearing denied and petition a court of review after 90 days has elapsed [from the date of filing the application for rehearing], makes little sense since the Legislature's obvious due process purpose of section 1733, subd. (b), is to enable aggrieved parties to escape being held hostage and being denied meaningful appellate review
by the Commission's taking months or years to rule on an application for rehearing. Indeed, this Court rejected a similar argument raised by the Attorney General in Sokol v. Public Utilities Com. (1966) 65 Cal.2d 247, 251-252. This petition is timely even under the Commission's strained
interpretation.

26

Moreover, any subsequent decision that the Commission purports to
render on the application for rehearing would be nothing more than an
impermissible post hoc rationalization or litigation position. (Southern
California Edison Company v. Public Utilities Com. (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th
1086, 1111-1112, citing Securities Com. v. Chenery Corp. (1943) 318 U.S.
80, 94.) Such a decision on the application for rehearing - normally prepared

by the very litigation counsel who will be defending the Commission's
original decision in court - may seek to excuse or explain away discrete legal
errors but does not alter or revise the basis upon which the Commission

balanced multiple public interest factors in rendering its original public

convenience and necessity determination. Such a decision on an application

for rehearing, particularly after the aggrieved litigant has deemed the

application denied under section 1733, subd. (b) to conclude the application
for rehearing process, is entitled to no weight.

27

Issues Presented

The overarching issue presented by this petition is whether the

Commission abused its discretion or failed to regularly pursue its authority
by issuing D.18-09-017 and therein granting Cal-Am's request for a CPCN
to build and operate the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project
("MPWSP"), certifying the FEIR, issuing a statement of overriding

considerations and approving a mitigation and monitoring plan. (Pub. Util.
§ Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).)

As MCWD explained in its application for rehearing, the Commission

abused its discretion and failed to regularly pursue its authority on a number

of grounds, any or all of which provide an appropriate basis for the Court to
grant MCWD's petition and issue a writ of review/mandate as to D.18-09-

017. The Commission abused its discretion and failed to regularly pursue its

authority in five broad respects when it issued D.18-09-017:

1. Water Law. Whether the Commission violated the

requirement of the California Constitution, and the statutory and decisional

law predicated on that requirement, for the reasonable and beneficial use and
avoidance of waste of the waters of the State, where it approved a project that

requires new pumping from a groundwater sub-basin that is designated by

the Department of Water Resources as critically overdrafted and

unreasonably risks adverse impacts to the quality and quantity of local

groundwater resources (Cal. Const., art. X, 2; see, e.g., City of Barstow v.

28

Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224), where the Commission
erroneously concluded that Cal-Am could likely perfect a lawful
appropriative right to the volume of groundwater required for the project
(ibid. at 23 Cal.4th 1241-1243 [no appropriative rights available in an

overdrafted basin]), where the Commission ignored the SWRCB definition

of water quality, which provides that groundwater having less than or equal
to 3,000 mg/L Total Dissolved Solids ("TDS") is suitable or potentially

suitable for drinking water beneficial use and must be protected from

degradation, as adopted in the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control

Board's ("RWQCB's") Basin Plan, where Cal-Am has not shown and cannot

show that it can acquire water rights to support the project, where operation

of the project would frustrate and defeat MCWD's and other local agencies'

efforts to implement their groundwater sustainability plans ("GSPs")

beginning in 2020 and 2021 under the 2015 Sustainable Groundwater

Management Act ("SGMA"), where operation of the project would violate a

recently-enacted county measure to reduce or prohibit groundwater pumping
in the project area, and where operation of the project could impair or destroy
MCWD's groundwater supply, thereby effectuating an unconstitutional

taking without just compensation of MCWD's existing groundwater rights.

2. Public Utilities Code. Whether the Commission violated the

Public Utilities Code by approving the project and issuing a CPCN where

substantial record evidence demonstrates a lack of present and future need

29

for the project, where the Commission refused to consider less expensive and
less environmentally-impactful public agency alternatives to the proposed
project (Pub. Util. Code §§ 451, 1001, 1002; see, e.g., Ventura County

Waterworks v. Public Util. Com. (1964) 61 Cal.2d 462), where the

Commission failed through its conditioning authority or otherwise to protect
an existing public agency water system from harmful interference by the
project (Pub. Util. Code § 1001), where the project entails violation of

Monterey County's public ownership requirements for desalination facilities,

and where the costs of the MPWSP are not just and reasonable in light of the

availability of far less costly public agency supply alternatives.

3. CEQA. Whether the Commission violated CEQA when it

certified an FEIR and rendered a decision that failed to consider a reasonable

range of feasible project alternatives, as well as a reasonable range of
alternative subsurface water intake technologies; was based on a
groundwater analysis that excluded disclosure of current groundwater
volumes, included inaccurate groundwater baseline and modeling that

incorrectly assumed, based on outdated and disproven evidence, that baseline

groundwater conditions consisted of complete seawater intrusion while
incontrovertible evidence demonstrated that the aquifers actually contain

substantial freshwater which currently provides a beneficial use and

beneficial protections against seawater intrusion; lacked an accurate project

description and relied on the project applicant's estimates of future water

30

demand and supply sources based on speculation - contrary to California

water management law and policy - and not based on a preponderance of the

evidence; lacked adequate consultation with sister agencies and ignored or

failed to adequately respond to the comments of sister agencies and their

requests for revision and recirculation of the FEIR in light of both significant
errors and substantial new information; lacked a "substantively meaningful"

analysis of cumulative impacts, relying instead on inaccurate assumptions

and flawed groundwater modeling that, admittedly, by design did not

evaluate water quality impacts or cumulative groundwater impacts, and
where substantial evidence submitted by geophysicists, hydrogeologists, and
groundwater modeling experts demonstrates that other modeling was capable
of evaluating these impacts; lacked adequate mitigation for adverse
groundwater and ESHA impacts; improperly delegated the duty to

investigate alternatives to the project applicant to perform after project

approval and without public review or comment; adopted a threshold of

significance that ignored the SWRCB and RWQCB Basin Plan requirements
that groundwater having 3,000 mg/L TDS be protected from degradation and

instead accepted the applicant's proposal that any groundwater that exceeds

500 mg/L TDS has no beneficial use and may be degraded without

mitigation; and/or violated CEQA's impacts analysis and mitigation

requirements by (1) allowing the project applicant to determine after the fact

whether the project causes significant impacts to other groundwater users and

31

to existing good localized groundwater conditions without any performance

standards, public review, or appeal procedures, and (2) concluding that

impacts to SVGB aquifers and groundwater users such as MCWD in the

project area south of the Salinas River, where all of the significant impacts

will occur, would be less than significant after implementation of a

mitigation measure that provides for the compensatory return of desalinated

water only to SVGB groundwater users located north of the Salinas River
that are unlikely to be impacted by the project.

4. Due Process of Law and Independent Judgment. Whether the

Commission violated MCWD's and the public's rights to due process of law

under the United States and/or California Constitutions (U.S. Const., 4th and

14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7) when the Commission, after ruling

that the CPCN application required an evidentiary hearing on all relevant

factors, denied MCWD's repeated requests for an evidentiary hearing on
environmental impacts and "influence on the environment" (see Pub. Util.
Code § 1002, subd. (a)(4); Pub. Util. Code § 1710; Northern California
Power Agency v. Public Utilities Com. (1971) 5 Cal.3d 370, 378-379), when

it failed to refer groundwater impacts and water rights issues to a tribunal
with jurisdiction to hear and determine them' and failed to require Cal-Am

The Commission does not have lawful jurisdiction to make groundwater
rights determinations. (Camp Meeker Water System, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com. (1990) 51 Cal.3d 845, 849-850, overruled on other grounds by Pub. Util. Code § 311 as it pertains to energy, transportation, and communication
32

to demonstrate that it could obtain legal right to withdraw source water for

the project by meeting the burden of demonstrating that such withdrawal

would not harm the SVGB or basin users (see Ex. MCD-17, pp 35, 38-39

[15APP234, pp. A11171, 11174-75]), when it failed to afford the parties an

evidentiary hearing on feasible supply source alternatives, including various

proposed expansion scenarios for the already-under-construction Pure Water

Monterey ("PWM") project and MCWD's proposed water sales to Cal-Am,

when it denied MCWD's request for a hearing on conflicts of interest related
to the MPWSP and the Commission's environmental review (Morongo Band

of Mission Indians v. Calif. SWRCB (2009) 45 Cal.4th 731, 737, 740-742),

when it relied on unsworn evidence and analysis provided by persons known
to the Commission to have a conflict of interest, did not require expert peer

review, denied the request of the parties to examine the scope and nature of

such conflicts in an evidentiary hearing, and then delegated authority to those

conflicted persons to determine, after the fact, whether the project causes

significant impacts to groundwater.

5. Unconstitutional Impairment of the Obligation of Contract.
Whether the Commission, in issuing D.18-09-017 and approving the project,
prejudicially and contrary to the public interest, impaired existing public

industries; Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b); see FEIR/EIS § 2.6, p. 2-32
[43APP588, p. A28087].)

33

agency contracts in violation of protections guaranteed by the United States

and California Constitutions. (U.S. Const., art. I, § 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art.

I, § 9.)

RELIEF REQUESTED

MCWD seeks this Court's issuance of a writ of review/mandate

according plenary review to the Commission's September 20, 2018
"Decision Approving A Modified Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project,
Adopting Settlement Agreement, Issuing Certificate of Public Convenience
and Necessity and Certifying Combined Environmental Report." (1APP1-2,

A101-1875.) MCWD, a party to Commission Application ("A.") 12-04-019,

seeks review of D.18-09-017 on the ground that the Commission's

determinations therein were made in violation of multiple laws and thus

constituted an abuse of discretion and a failure of the Commission to

"regularly pursue" its authority. (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).)
Without the Court's grant of the requested writ, the Commission's
prejudicial violation of MCWD's and the public's rights under constitutional,
statutory and decisional principles could never be redressed. (Pub.

Resources Code § 21168.6; Pub. Util. Code § 1756, subd. (f); CLAM, supra,

25 Cal.3d at 901.) Provided the Court finds MCWD's petition to be
"apparently meritorious," the petition must be granted. (Powers v. City of

Richmond, supra, 10 Cal.4th 85, 114.)

34

REQUEST FOR EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION

MCWD respectfully requests, and will also request by separate
motion to be filed promptly after the filing of this petition, that this petition

be accorded expedited consideration. Petitions seeking review of

Commission decisions "shall be preferred over, and shall be heard and

determined in preference to, all other civil business except election causes,

irrespective of position on the calendar." (Pub. Util. Code § 1767.) Actions

seeking redress for failure to comply with CEQA shall be given "preference

over all other civil actions so that the action or proceeding shall be
quickly heard and determined." (Pub. Resources Code § 21167.1, subd. (a).)
Besides qualifying for expedited treatment and statutory preference,

this petition challenging D.18-09-017 also directly implicates the public
health and safety of MCWD customers in the City of Marina and the Fort

Ord community, due to the danger the decision presents to MCWD's sole

current source of water supply. The matter therefore "presents a question of

great public importance which must be resolved promptly," further militating
in favor of the Court's grant of the petition and its expedited consideration.
(Clean Air Constituency v. Cal. State Air Resources Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d
801, 808.) The need for expedition is particularly important here because 22
responsible agencies are processing permit applications for the project and
are therefore compelled by the Permit Streamlining Act, under strict time

limits, to rely on the FEIR that MCWD challenges herein.

35

PETITION FOR WRIT OF REVIEW /MANDATE

Numbered allegations 1 through 165 below are identical to the
numbered allegations of MCWD's October 12, 2018 petition.8

Jurisdiction

1. Public Resources Code, section 21168.6, states that in a CEQA

action against the California Public Utilities Commission the "writ of

mandate shall lie only from the Supreme Court."

2. This Court also has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to

sections 1068, 1094.5 and 187 of the California Code of Civil Procedure,

Basis for Relief Requested

37. This petition challenges Commission Decision 18-09-017, by
which the Commission certified its FEIR for the MPWSP, adopted a
statement of overriding considerations and a mitigation and monitoring plan,
and granted a CPCN to Cal-Am to construct and operate a desalination

project known as the MPWSP.

38. The Commission failed to proceed in the manner required by
law and reached a decision unsupported by substantial evidence, which

resulted in the Commission approving a project contrary to the reasonable

43

and beneficial use requirements of the California Constitution, as applied to

groundwater in the project-area aquifers, and the public convenience and

necessity and just and reasonable cost requirements of the Public Utilities

Code, as well as violating CEQA's fundamental mandate not to approve a

project when there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would

lessen the project's significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources

§ Code § 21080, subd. (c).) For all these reasons, in issuing D.18-09-017 the
Commission failed to "regularly pursue its authority." (Pub. Util. Code

ccn 1757.1, subd. (b).)

39. Furthermore, D.18-09-017 permits Cal-Am to unreasonably

pump groundwater from the coastal aquifers in close proximity to MCWD's

municipal supply wells, based on the FEIR's incorrect conclusion that, with

mitigation, the project's groundwater impacts will be less than significant,

relying upon flatly inaccurate baseline assumptions of groundwater
conditions and admittedly inadequate modeling of the project's direct and
cumulative groundwater impacts. (Pub. Util. Code §g 1001; 1757.1, subd.

(b).)

40. The Commission's determination that Cal-Am could likely

perfect an appropriative right to pump groundwater from the 180/400 Foot

Aquifer sub-basin that has been designated as being critically overdrafted by
the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") is inconsistent with the

reasonable and beneficial use requirements of California water law, and did

44

not constitute a valid groundwater rights determination since the

Commission does not have lawful jurisdiction to make groundwater rights
determinations. (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2; City of Barstow v. Mojave Water
Agency, supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241; Camp Meeker Water System, Inc. v.

Public Utilities Com. (1990) 51 Cal.3d 845, 849-850°; Pub. Util. Code

§ 1757.1, subd. (b); see FEIR/EIS § 2.6, p. 2-32.)

41. Moreover, the Commission's implicit determination in D.18-

09-017 that operation of the MPWSP would not interfere with the

groundwater rights of MCWD and other lawful users in the SVGB was not
supported by substantial evidence, which also constitutes a failure to
regularly pursue its authority. (Pub. Util. Code §§ 1757.1, subd. (a)(3);
1757.1, subd. (b); see FEIR/EIS § 2.6.2, p. 2-36, 2-37.)

42. In addition, D.18-09-017 violated MCWD's due process rights
under the United States and/or California Constitutions because, although the
Commission determined a hearing was required on Cal-Am's application, it
repeatedly denied MCWD's request for a hearing on any environmental
impacts (and "influence on the enyironment," see Pub. Util. Code § 1002,

subd. (a)(4)) including groundwater issues, the Commission's environmental
review was not the result of the Commission's independent judgment, the
Commission's environmental review was contaminated by an impermissible

9 Overruled on a different point by Pub. Util. Code § 311 as the case pertains
to energy, transportation, and communication industries.
45

conflict of interest on the part of a Commission and applicant consultant, and

MCWD's request for an evidentiary hearing on such conflict of interest was
denied. (U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7; Pub.
Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b); see Northern California Power Agency v.
Public Utilities Com., supra, 5 Cal.3d at 379; Morongo Band of Mission
Indians v. Calif. SWRCB, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 737, 740-742.)

43. Moreover, the Commission's approval of a project that that has

the potential to significantly harm MCWD's water supply without a hearing
and enforceable mitigation that would protect MCWD's beneficial uses of
groundwater constitutes a further violation of constitutional due process

guarantees. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.; Cal. Const., art. I, 19; Pub. Util.

§ Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).)

44. By reference, MCWD incorporates into its verified petition the

facts and allegations stated throughout this entire pleading.

Procedural Background and History

45. Since the 1940s, hydrogeologic studies of the SVGB have

shown a regional decline in the groundwater table, which has resulted in

seawater intrusion in some coastal aquifers, including in the aquifers of the

180/400 Foot Aquifer sub-basin. (D.18-09-017, p. 4 and fn. 4 [1APP1, p.

A108].)

46. To address this issue and prevent further harm to the SVGB,

the Legislature enacted the Monterey County Water Resources Agency Act.

46

(Stats. 1990, ch. 1159 ("Agency Act"), see Water Code App., ch. 52.) A

primary purpose of the Agency Act is to "prevent the waste or diminution of
the water supply . .. and to prohibit groundwater exportations from the

[SVGB]." (Water Code App., ch. 52, § 52-8, italics added.)

47. MCWD relies exclusively on coastal aquifers of the SVGB for

its municipal water supply, with its wells penetrating the area of the

Monterey sub-basin that is immediately adjacent to and south of the 180/400

Foot Aquifer sub-basin. (Ex. MCD-64 [26APP422, p. A18957]; Ex. MCD-

16, p. 4 [15APP233, p. A11122].)

48. The Salinas Valley agricultural industry relies heavily on the
180/400 Foot Aquifer sub-basin of the SVGB, which is recharged by
precipitation and by the Salinas River, as a vital water resource. The SVGB
does not receive surface water from any state or federal water projects.

49. MCWD has purchased land in the Armstrong Ranch area,

overlying the coastal aquifers of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer sub-basin of the

SVGB that it plans to utilize for groundwater recharge and recovery
purposes, by utilizing excess winter surface flow from the Salinas River.

(Ex. MCD-43, pp. 4-5 and attachment [24APP399, p. A17785-86].)

50. Since the 1990's, MCWD has contracted with MCWRA,

Marina and others, including the predecessors-in-interest to the owner of the

CEMEX property in Marina, to memorialize and to preserve and protect
MCWD's and the U.S. Army's groundwater rights in the SVGB for use by

47

MCWD to serve potable water within its Central Marina and Ord Community

service areas. (See, e.g., Exs. MCD-5, MCD-6 [6APP62, 63, pp. A4173-

4314].)

51. MCWD's contractual agreements include a 500 AFY limit on

groundwater withdrawals at the CEMEX property (Ex. MCD-5, p. 17, § 7.2

[6APP6, p. A4238), where the MPWSP slant wells will be installed and

operated by Cal-Am.

52. Based on Cal-Am testimony that desalinated product water
will equal 42% of the volume of source water, Cal-Am would have to pump

more than 15 MGD (or over 16,000 AFY) in order to produce 6.4 MGD, or

approximately 7,160 AFY, of desalinated water.

53. Over many decades, various agricultural water users in the

SVGB have cooperated with MCWRA and other local agencies on programs

to conserve groundwater and address seawater intrusion in the SVGB,

including the Salinas Valley Water Project and the Castroville Seawater

Intrusion Project ("CSIP").

54. In 1993, MCWRA adopted Ordinance 3709, prohibiting

groundwater extraction within the shallower aquifers of the SVGB near the

project site, which went into effect in 1995.

55. MCWRA also monitors seawater intrusion in the SVGB and

publishes maps based on historical studies and monitoring data showing
where they believe seawater intrusion has occurred, which include some of

48

the project area aquifers. These maps do not cover all the SVGB aquifers in
the project area due to a lack of data. The historic MCWRA seawater

intrusion maps relied upon by the FEIR have massive data gaps within the

project area aquifers (Reporter's Transcript ("RT"), Vol. 15 [15APP226], pp.
2424:26-2425:6; 2427:23-2433:17 (Mr. Leffler for Cal-Am); Ex. MCD-33
(HWG acknowledgment of "shocking" lack of well data to support seawater
intrusion assumptions) [15APP230, pp. A10899-9061), in conflict with

significant recent monitoring data collected for the MPWSP.

56. MCWRA's efforts, as well as the efforts of other SVGB users

(including MCWD) to restore the basin and prevent seawater intrusion, have

resulted in improved water levels and water quality within the SVGB,

particularly in the areas near the project site, as demonstrated by the MPWSP

recent monitoring.

57. In fact, recent groundwater monitoring data shows that the

shallower coastal aquifers of the SVGB are no longer, in fact, fully seawater
intruded as shown on the MCWRA seawater intrusion maps. (See, e.g., Ex.
MCD-20 [15APP237, p. A11205 et seq.], Rev. Ex. MCD-27 [15APP244, p.
A11261], MCWD Apr. 19, 2018 letter [42APP587, pp. A27737, 27796] at

Att. A, Att. D.J

58. The Carmel River basin and its underlying aquifers are not a

part of the SVGB. Historically, Cal-Am and its predecessors relied heavily
on the underflow of the Carmel River to serve the water supply needs of the

49

Monterey Peninsula. (SWRCB Order WR 95-10, pp. 20-25.)

59. In 1995, in a water rights proceeding initiated against Cal-Am,

the SWRCB determined in its Order WR 95-10 that Cal-Am was

withdrawing water in excess of its legal right from the Carmel River.

(SWRCB Order WR 95-10, pp. 28-29.)

60. At the time Order WR 95-10 issued, Cal-Am's annual water

demand for its Monterey District was approximately 10,730 acre-feet-per

year ("AFY"), but Cal-Am had a legal right to only 3,376 AFY of Carmel

River water. (Id. at p. 25.)

61. Because Cal-Am's legal Carmel River supply together with its
other supply sources would be inadequate to meet its full demand at that time,
and after an unsuccessful dam proposal, Cal-Am proposed to resolve its
water supply shortage with a desalination project.

62. A Monterey County ordinance requires desalination facilities
in the County to be owned by public agencies, and not by private companies.
(Monterey County Code of Ordinances, tit. 10, § 10.72.030, subd. (b).)

63. In 2007, Cal-Am's annual water demand for its Monterey

District1o was 14,596 AFY. (Ex. CA-51, p. 9 [23APP392, p. A16844].)

10 Issues related to Cal-Am's Monterey District have recently been before the
Court in Monterey Peninsula Water Management District v. Public Utilities
Com. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 693 (reversing Commission's determinations that
WMD could not collect its user fees through Cal-Am's customer billing), and
Marina Coast Water District v. Public Utilities Com., Cause No. S230728, writ granted March 23, 2016; remanded to the Commission for
50

64. On information and belief, Cal-Am's non-revenue uses of

water (i.e., system leaks) peaked at approximately 1,800 AFY in 2008.

65. In 2009, by Order WR 2009-0060, the SWRCB began to
require mandatory annual reductions in Cal-Am's Carmel River

withdrawals, as well as conservation measures and reduction of non-revenue

consumption. (SWRCB Order WR 2009-0060, pp. 57-64.)

66. Through an aquifer storage and recovery (*ASR") program in
cooperation with WMD, Cal-Am gained access to an average 1,300 AFY of

excess winter flow from the Carmel River.

67. Cal-Am also relies upon the Seaside Groundwater Basin to

serve a portion of the water supply needs of the Monterey Peninsula. (D.18-

09-017, p. 4 at fn. 4.)

68. However, in 2010 a court of appeal decision upheld a

groundwater basin adjudication that limited Cal-Am's withdrawals from the

Seaside Groundwater Basin. (California-American Water Company V. City

of Seaside (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 471, 483.)

69. After years of debate before the Commission and in the
community, it was determined by 2010 that a three-way partnership would
be undertaken among Cal-Am, MCWD and MCWRA to carry out a public-

reconsideration May 10, 2017 (challenge to sealing public records of MCWRA relied upon for rate recovery by Cal-Am in settling disputes over stranded costs of a project that was not carried out; remand proceedings are
currently underway before the Commission).
51

private regional project, with MCWD owning and operating the desalination

plant. (See D.10-12-016.)

70. Under the regional proposal, approved by the Commission in

D.10-12-016, potential concerns regarding water rights were addressed by

MCWD forbearing from a portion of its own lawful pumping of groundwater

from the SVGB in order to offset the quantity of groundwater deemed
contained in the source water withdrawn from the basin. (Ibid.; see D.18-

09-017, p. 10.)

71. In addition, MCWD's ownership of the desalination plant

enabled the public-private partnership to comply with the public ownership
requirement of the county desalination ordinance.

72. However, the regional project was not carried out, and in 2012

the Commission permitted Cal-Am to withdraw from it, after Cal-Am had

already filed A.12-04-019, seeking a CPCN to build and operate the MPWSP

as an entirely privately-owned Cal-Am project. (D.12-10-030; see D.18-09-

017, pp. 10-11.)

73. Legal challenges to Cal-Am's new desalination project

proposal were raised by MCWD and others. (See Docket, A.12-04-019

[2APP2, pp. A1879-80, briefs there referenced].)

74. In considering certain of these challenges, the Commission

issued its advisory opinion on the legal issue of preemption of the public

ownership requirement of the county desalination ordinance in D.12-10-030,

52

as modified by D.13-07-048, but, as MCWD has pointed out, the preemption

issue was not ripe for adjudication because there was no conflict between the

ordinance and any CPCN or Commission authorization, and because the

advisory decision failed to consider the impact of the later-enacted SGMA.

(MCWD Apr. 19, 2018 Opening Brief on Environmental Issues, pp. 41-43

[37APP497, pp. A22604-06].)

75. The Commission received briefing on the legal issue of water

rights for the MPWSP in 2012, but it made no determination on the matter.

76. The Commission solicited the view of the SWRCB as to

whether Cal-Am's claim that it could utilize coastal slant wells to draw

seawater rather than brackish groundwater, without impact to the SVGB, and

thus claim a legal right to the source water for the MPWSP was credible.

(Ex. MCD-17 [15APP234, A11131-11187], the "SWRCB Review".)

77. The SWRCB provided its final staff review of the question

posed by the Commission in July of 2013 based on assumptions the SWRCB

noted would need to be investigated, (Ibid), including:

The SWRCB Review assumed that the MPWSP slant wells

would extend offshore; however, that assumption was not

correct.

The SWRCB Review assumed that the shallow coastal aquifers

of the SVGB were fully seawater intruded, as indicated on the

historical MCWRA maps; however, that assumption was not

53

correct.

78. The SWRCB Review indicated that testing, monitoring and

extensive modeling would be required to verify its assumptions and to

determine whether the MPWSP would not engender harm to lawful users of

the SVGB, or to the SVGB itself; however, much of the required testing and

modeling still has not been performed.

79. With the grant of a Coastal Development Permit from the
California Coastal Commission ("CCC"), which Cal-Am sought on appeal

after the City of Marina declined to act on Cal-Am's application under

Marina's Local Coastal Program without provision of a full EIR - which Cal-

Am declined to provide, Cal-Am implemented a test slant well ("TSW") at

the CEMEX site in Marina, which began pumping in 2015.

80. Although MCWD opposed the TSW because MCWD believed

Coastal Commission's environmental review was insufficient and did not

comply with CEQA, MCWD has closely followed Cal-Am's data gathering
and well monitoring in connection with the TSW, including information

posted on Cal-Am's MPWSP project website at the Commission's direction.

81. MCWD and its experts have utilized all available groundwater

information, including but not limited to information gathered through the

TSW program to inform their review of Cal-Am's proposal for construction

and operation of the MPWSP.

82. Meanwhile, the Commission released its initial Draft EIR for

54

the MPWSP in 2015.

83. The 2015 DEIR described the proposed project as 9.6-million-

gallon-per-day (MGD") rated capacity plant, but also proposed a variation of

the project ("MPWSP Variant") of combining a reduced-capacity

desalination plant (6.4-MGD rated capacity plant) with a water purchase

agreement for 3,500 AFY of product water from the groundwater
replenishment project proposed by PCA (now M1W).

84. Comment on the 2015 DEIR brought to the attention of the
Commission the fact that one of the Commission's groundwater experts,
Dennis Williams, and his firm, Geoscience, Inc., had a conflict of interest

because he and his firm were also consulting for Cal-Am on the MPWSP and

the patent for the slant well design Cal-Am was using for the TSW and

proposed to use for the MPWSP is held by Mr. Williams and/or his company.

(Rulings of July 9, 14 and 15, 2015 [1APP172-175, pp. A8839-85].)

85. In addition, MCWD raised multiple other procedural

irregularities associated with circulation of the Commission's 2015 Draft

EIR. (MCWD Letter of July 29, 2015 [12APP182, pp. A9322, et seq.].)

86. The Commission determined that it would be necessary to
withdraw its 2015 Draft EIR and reissue it as a joint EIR/Environmental
Impact Statement ("EIR/EIS") with the Monterey Bay National Marine

Sanctuary ("MBNMS"), a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration ("NOAA"), the lead federal agency for the project.

55

87. By 2015, with its ratepayers' implementation of conservation

measures, including those required by the state during a period of drought,

and Cal-Am's work to reduce by at least 1,000 AFY its non-revenue demand
(or leaks in its system), the annual water demand for Cal-Am's Monterey

District had steadily declined to an average level of 9,500 AFY, and demand

has remained at that level through the present. (Ex. MCD-59 [25APP417, p.

A18809]; see also Cal-Am's project website page tracking annual and
monthly demand at https://www.watersupplyproject.org/system-delivery.'1

88. In 2015, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

became effective, requiring local agencies to work toward sustainable

groundwater conditions.

89. Cal-Am amended its application in 2016 to reflect changes in

the project proposal since 2012, including moving the proposed slant well

configuration further inland. (Amended Application, App. H, p. 2

[14APP216, p. A10019].)

90. In 2016 and 2017, the Commission held evidentiary hearings

on several CPCN issues.

91. Mr. Williams and Geoscience continued to consult for Cal-Am

and continued to contribute to the Commission's environmental review.

92. In addition, the Commission's environmental review team and

11 Last visited October 10, 2018.

56

representatives of Mr. Williams' firm, Geoscience, assisted another Cal-Am
expert, Peter Leffler, in preparing for and responding to cross-examination

on groundwater issues related to Cal-Am's proposal to return some volume

of desalinated water to the SVGB to satisfy the anti-export provision of the

Agency Act and purportedly to mitigate any groundwater impacts of the slant

wells proposed for the project. (Ex. MCD-63 [25APP421, p. A18853].)

93. The Commission denied MCWD's requests to hold hearings
on the continuing conflict of interest of Mr. Williams and Geoscience.

94. The Commission also denied MCWD's requests to hold
hearings on the potential impacts of the project on SVGB groundwater and
lawful SVGB users. (See D.18-09-017, p. 113, fn. 306.)

95. In 2016, the DWR updated its Bulletin 118, renaming and

realigning several sub-basins, including designating the adjudicated Seaside

Groundwater Basin as the Seaside sub-basin of the SVGB. DWR also

designated the 180/400 Foot Aquifer sub-basin of the SVGB - the sub-basin

wherein the CEMEX property, the site for the MPWSP slant wells, is located

as a Critically Overdrafted Sub-basin. (Ex. SV-7, Att. 212.) Notably, the

FEIR did not use DWR's updated basin boundaries in discussing the

12 Map available at https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web- Pages/Programs/Groundwater-Management/Bulletin-118/Files/Statewide- Reports/Bulletin 118 Interim Update_2016.pdf, p. 25. (Last visited Oct.
10, 2018.)

57

groundwater environment, thereby confusing the reader. (FEIR, § 4.4.1, p.

4.4-4 [see 43APP588, A27582 et seq.].)

96. MCWD has its eight municipal wells in the sub-basin now

named the Monterey sub-basin, which is immediately south of and adjacent

to the CEMEX property where the MPWSP slant wells will be located. (Ex.

MCD-64 [26APP422, p. A18957].)

97. The Commission also held hearings in 2016 on an advanced-

treated recycled water project, then known as the Groundwater

Replenishment (GWR") project proposed by MIW and WMD, which

eventually came to be called Pure Water Monterey ("PWM"), and which

could provide at least 3,500 AFY of advanced-treated recycled water for

injection into the Seaside sub-basin and recovery for direct potable use in
Cal-Am's Monterey District. (See D.16-09-021, pp. 2, 54 [19APP315, p.

A14152.)

98. In September 2016, the Commission approved Cal-Am's entry

into a purchase agreement for 3,500 AFY of PWM water in D.16-09-021.

(Ibid.)

99. Cal-Am's 3,500 AFY of PWM water is scheduled to be

available for injection in 2019 with recovery for direct potable use beginning

in 2020. (Id., App. C, p. 15.)

100. In 2016, the SWRCB issued a revised cease-and-desist order

regarding Cal-Am's Carmel River withdrawals, Order WR 2016-0016.

58

101. In January 2017, the Commission released a new Draft EIR for
the MPWSP. (D.18-09-017, pp. 73-74.)
102. Despite the Commission's approval of the Cal-Am/PWM

water purchase agreement, the Commission improperly identified a 9.6-

MGD rated capacity plant - without the already-approved Cal-Am/PWM

water purchase agreement - as the proposed project. (See FEIR, § 3.2, p. 3-8

[see 43APP588, pp. A27582 et seq.].)
103. MCWD provided comments on the revised Draft EIR,

including comments from expert hydrogeologists, groundwater modeling

and intake technology experts, in advance of the deadline for written

comments that would receive a response under CEQA. (FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp.
8.5-129 - 8.5-522 [see 43APP588, pp. A27582 et seq.].)

104. Comments from MCWD and its experts explained that the

Commission had failed to establish an adequate baseline for groundwater
conditions and that DEIR presented a misleading picture of groundwater
conditions the project area coastal aquifers that conflicted with publicly
available monitoring well data. (FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-251 -8.5-344.)

105. Comments from MCWD and its experts explained that the

groundwater modeling for the MPWSP was seriously deficient and incapable
of assessing the project's impacts on water quality and cumulative impacts.
(FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-345 - 8.5-385.)

59

106. Comments from MCWD and its experts explained that there
were feasible intake alternatives to Cal-Am's proposed slant wells, drawing
from the 180/400 Foot Aquifer sub-basin of the SVGB at the CEMEX site,
that would substantially lessen or eliminate the project's significant and
unavoidable impacts on ESHA and groundwater. (FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-418

8.5-438.)

107. While difficult to discern from the EIR and not disclosed in the

DEIR's project description, the MPWSP slant wells will be located in the
Coastal Zone within rare coastal dune habitat that supports endangered
species and has been designated as primary habitat under the City of
Marina's Local Coastal Program and ESHA under the Coastal Act.

108. MCWD further commented that the Draft EIR's assumptions

regarding supply and demand were outdated and not based on the most recent
data or a realistic assessment of Cal-Am's now-varied supply portfolio,
which would consist of supplies from the Carmel River, Seaside
Groundwater Basin, ASR water available to Cal-Am from Carmel River
excess winter flow, GWR or PWM advanced treated recycled water, and the
existing Sand City desalination plant. (FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-141 - 8.5-160.)

109. MCWD's comments also explained how available facts

demonstrated that Cal-Am's actual current demand for approximately 9,500

AFY in its Monterey District could be met by its existing lawful supply,
including the 3,500 AFY of PWM water, with potential future

60

supplementation by a variety of non-desalination alternatives. (Ibid.)
110. MCWD submitted testimony from its General Manager
demonstrating the reasonableness of MCWD's estimation of Cal-Am's
permanent reduction in demand level for its Monterey District, based on
MCWD's own similar experience in light of permanent conservation
measures. (Ex. 36A, pp. 6-10 [25APP405, pp. A18454-58].)

111. Other water management professionals, including David

Stoldt, the General Manager of WMD and Jonas Minton of PCL, also

testified as to their position that much of the reduction in water demand in

the Monterey District would be permanent. (Surfrider Reply Brief, Jan. 9,
2018, pp. 1-21 [35APP458, pp. A21330-50]; see also Ex. MNA-2, pp. 6-12

(Dr. House for Marina), [23APP398, pp. A17655-61].)

112. Due to serious concerns that the FEIR, like the draft, would

continue to incorrectly evaluate groundwater baseline and impacts, MCWD
retained Dr. Rosemary Knight of Stanford University to investigate the state
of the aquifers, using airborne electromagnetic (or "AEM") technology. Dr.

Knight is leading expert in this area.

113. The preliminary results of the work done by Dr. Knight's team
and provided to the Commission confirmed MCWD's prior comments to the
Commission that substantial fresh groundwater exists in the shallower
coastal aquifers of the SVGB, contrary to the Draft EIR's assumptions.

(FEIR, § 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-491 - 8.5511.)

61

114. The Commission held further evidentiary hearings in October
and November of 2017. (D.18-09-017, App. A at p. 15.) MCWD provided

written testimony from its Gener Manager, Keith Van Der Maaten, and by
several experts: Dr. Knight, Curtis Hopkins and Vera Nelson.

115. In response to Cal-Am's protest, much of MCWD's proffered
written testimony from its groundwater experts, including Dr. Knight, was

stricken from the record of the evidentiary hearings.

116. In addition to striking Dr. Knight's testimony, MCWD's
hydrogeology expert who had testified in 2016 concerning groundwater
conditions related to Cal-Am's proposal to return desalinated water to the
SVGB, Mr. Hopkins, was barred from updating his testimony on the same

subject in 2017.

117. In addition, another MCWD expert, Ms. Nelson, was barred

from testifying concerning her findings regarding TDS levels in the shallow

coastal aquifers, the suitability of MCWD's Armstrong Ranch property for

groundwater recharge and recovery purposes and the danger the MPWSP's

slant wells would pose to groundwater quality conditions in the Armstrong

Ranch/CEMEX area.

118. The stricken MCWD written testimony was subsequently

provided to the Commission, for the most part through the process of
submitting MCWD's comments a on a report by the Hydrogeologic Working
Group (the "HWG Report"), led by Mr. Williams and participated in by the

62

paid consultants of other project proponents, that was submitted to the
Commission by Cal-Am late in 2017. (Dec. 8, 2017 MCWD Comments on
HWG Report and attachments; Jan. 17, 2017 MCWD Motion re Ex. MCD-

57 (Sept. 2017 Hopkins Report) and Ex. MCD-57.)

119. The parties briefed non-environmental issues in late 2017 and

early 2018. (D.18-09-017, App. A, pp. 15, 19.)

120. PCL, joined by eleven other parties, moved the Commission to
hold further evidentiary hearings on supply alternatives, including a 2,250
AFY expansion of PWM in addition to the 3,500 AFY PWM supply already
under construction, and proposed sales of groundwater from MCWD to Cal-
Am. (Jan. 9, 2018 Motion of PCL, et al. [35APP452, p. A21108].) The

motion was not granted.

121. The HWG Report was incorporated in the Commission's Final

EIR, without any apparent changes, including the HWG's conclusion
concerning the likely groundwater impacts of the MPWSP. (FEIR, App.

E-3.)

122. There is no evidence the Commission subjected the HWG
report to independent peer review before including it in the FEIR.

123. The Commission issued its FEIR in March 2018.

124. Many of MCWD's comments on the DEIR, and those of its

experts, were not addressed at all, or not meaningfully addressed in the FEIR.
(See, e.g., MCWD's April 19, 2018 letter [42APP587, p. A27657.)

63

125. As result of this failure and others, the FEIR, like the DEIR,

failed to include an adequate analysis of project alternatives.

126. Indeed, D.18-09-017 delegated responsibility for investigating
expansion of the PWM project to the Applicant.

127. Even under Cal-Am's (and the FEIR's) inflated demand

estimate of 14,000 AFY, M1W's proposal to expand the PWM project in

combination with Cal-Am's existing supply portfolio and a small volume of
sales by MCWD could serve the present and future needs of Cal-Am's

Monterey District.

128. The FEIR's supply and demand analysis was significantly

skewed by speculation and inaccuracy.

129. Cal-Am's (and the FEIR's) claims of steeply-increased

demand are inconsistent with the Sustainable Groundwater Management

Act, as well as recently enacted Water Management legislation and

Executive Orders of the Governor. (June 5, 2018 MCWD Request for

Official Notice of Governor's Executive Orders and Recent Legislative

Enactments [39APP531, p. A25371].)

130. The FEIR failed to include an adequate analysis of source
water intake alternatives, assuming a desalination project would be required.

131. The FEIR noted the presence of ESHA in the CEMEX project

area, but deferred analysis and mitigation for ESHA-related impacts.

132. The FEIR ignored and rejected MCWD's substantial evidence

64

from its experts regarding both baseline groundwater conditions and the

insufficiency of the FEIR's groundwater modeling for the MPWSP.

133. The FEIR assumed that any groundwater that exceeds 500
mg/L TDS has no beneficial use, contrary to the SWRCB's 3,000 mg/L TDS
potential beneficial use standard, as adopted in the RWQCB's Basin Plan for

the Central Coast.

134. The FEIR failed to analyze and disclose the volume of

groundwater in the aquifers that would be affected by the project, particularly

groundwater in the CEMEX area that meets the SWRCB and RWQCB Basin

Plan standard for beneficial use.

135. The FEIR failed to improve upon the Draft EIR's inadequate
cumulative impacts analysis, which relied upon inaccurate assumptions and

flawed groundwater modeling.

136. The groundwater model for the MPWSP, admittedly and by

design, evaluated only the isolated impact of pumping on static water levels

in the immediate project vicinity, but did not evaluate water quality impacts

or cumulative groundwater impacts, or any impacts outside the immediate
project vicinity.

137. Substantial evidence submitted by MCWD demonstrates that

other modeling was capable of evaluating these additional impacts. (See,

e.g., MCWD's April 19, 2018 letter, pp. 3-5 and Att. B [42APP587, pp.

A27659-61, 27768].)

65

138. The FEIR and D.18-09-017 violate CEQA's mitigation

requirements by improperly deferring, without any performance standards,

and delegating in part to Cal-Am the determination of the existence of

significant impacts to groundwater and the need for and implementation of

mitigation, after the fact.
139. The FEIR and D.18-09-017 concluded that impacts to SVGB
aquifers and SVGB groundwater users such as MCWD in the project area

south of the Salinas River would be mitigated to less than significant levels

after implementation of a measure that requires Cal-Am to provide

desalinated water only to SVGB groundwater users located north of the

Salinas River, in Castroville, yet provides no explanation of how the

desalinated water will benefit the aquifers in the project area in and near
Marina, south of the Salinas River.

140. MCWD's annual pumping from its municipal wells near the

CEMEX property, and its system demand, is approximately 2,700 AFY.

(Exs. MCD-36A, pp. 7-8 [25APP405, pp. A18455-56], MCD-40

[25APP408, p. A18483].)

141. To supply the MPWSP with brackish groundwater for

desalination, Cal-Am plans to install seven slant wells, collectively pumping

over 17,000 AFY.

142. The FEIR concluded that Cal-Am likely could perfect a lawful
appropriative right to the brackish and fresh groundwater required for the

66

project, due to its conclusions that - based on inaccurate baseline conditions

and inadequate modeling - the project would have no significant impacts to

groundwater after mitigation.

143. MCWD suggested multiple times, including by filing a joint
motion with other parties to the CPUC proceeding, that the Commission refer

the question of water rights to the SWRCB or the courts, due to the

Commission's lack of jurisdiction to make such a determination. (Apr. 13,
2018 Motion.) The Commission denied their request.
144. MCWD also submitted comments on the FEIR, including new
analysis by its experts of the still-significant flaws in the FEIR's groundwater
and alternatives analyses. (E.g., Apr. 19, 2018 letter and attachments.)

145. MCWD's FEIR comments included a response from Dr.
Knight to the HWG Report's misrepresentation and mischaracterization of
the preliminary results of her team's AEM research on groundwater quality

in the Marina area of the coastal aquifers of the SVGB.

146. MCWD provided the final results of the AEM groundwater
research to the Commission as well, confirming and refining the conclusions

of the preliminary AEM results. (Id. at Att. A, App. A.)
147. Based on available information it appears the Commission

obtained responses from the HWG to Dr. Knight's study, and the
Commission did not subject Dr. Knight's study or the HWG's critique of her
study to any independent peer review or analysis, including by any qualified

67

geophysicist. (Aug. 15, 2018 HWG comments on MCWD and Marina FEIR

comments [40APP554, p. A25506].)

148. The parties briefed environmental issues in April and May of

2018.

149. M1W, joined by eleven other parties, moved the Commission

a to consider in a further hearing updated information concerning the potential

for expansion of the PWM project, providing a report with progress on

expansion plans. (May 11, 2018 Motion with Progress Report [39APP524,

p. A25092].) The motion was denied.

150. The Commission issued a proposed decision ("PD") on August

13, 2018 that would grant the CPCN application for the MPWSP.

151. MCWD timely submitted comments on the PD, arguing that

the PD, in certifying the FEIR, approving the project and granting a CPCN,

would commit multiple legal errors.

152. The Commission held oral argument on August 22, 2018, upon
the request of MCWD and others, including Marina.

153. The Commission considered the PD, with certain revisions that

were largely directed at ratemaking issues, at its public meeting on

September 13, 2018.

154. The Commission heard public comment on the MPWSP at its
September 13, 2018 meeting, including from Cal-Am customers who argued
both for and against project approval, as well as from Marina citizens and

68

MCWD customers who uniformly argued against project approval.
155. D.18-09-017, dated September 13, 2018, was formally issued

on September 20, 2018.

156. On September 14, 2018, the Commission filed its Notice of

Determination for the MPWSP with the State Clearinghouse. (Sept. 14, 2018

Notice [41APP582, p. A26425].)

157. MCWD has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition.
As described above, MCWD is beneficially interest in this matter. (Cal. Code

Civ. Proc., § 1086.) MCWD has a direct interest in ensuring that the
Respondent fulfills its duties to comply with CEQA. MCWD has an interest

in preserving and protecting, for the general public, the natural environment

and groundwater within the project area and the broader SVGB.
Furthermore, MCWD actively participated in the administrative process
leading up to Respondent's decision to adopt and certify the EIR and approve

the MPWSP.

158. MCWD has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course

of ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of review/mandate

to require Respondent to set aside its certification of the Final EIR for, and

approval of, the MPWSP. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's
approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law and MCWD, and

residents and property owners in the City of Marina and Ord Communities
will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could

69

adequately compensate MCWD and the residents and property owners in the
City of Marina and Ord Communities for that harm.
159. MCWD brings this action on the basis, among others, of

Government Code section 800, and other applicable laws, which awards

petitioners attorneys' fees in actions to overturn decisions that are arbitrary

and capricious, such as the decisions in questions here.

160. MCWD brings this action as a private attorney general

pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable
legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.
161. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a

significant benefit on the general public by requiring the Respondent to carry

out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before approving the

project.

162. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the

enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling

the Respondent to engage a in a fair, objective, and legally adequate analysis

of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to

review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

163. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as

to make an award of attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Absent

enforcement by MCWD, Real Party in Interest Cal-Am will proceed with a

project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that

70

might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate

environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

164. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Petitioner

will serve a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's office to give
notice that Petitioner brought this lawsuit as private attorney general under

Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

165. On October 10, 2018, MCWD notified the Commission of its

intent to file suit pursuant to CEQA. (Oct. 10, 2018 Notice of Intent to File

Suit [41APP586, p. A26441].)

166. On October 12, 2018, MCWD filed with this a Court a petition

challenging the lawfulness of the Commission's determinations under CEQA

in D.18-09-017 and seeking the Court's review on the merits of MCWD's

contentions that the Commission abused its discretion and failed to regularly

pursue its authority in violating CEQA, including by approving the MPWSP

in reliance on an insufficient FEIR, failing to adopt sufficient mitigation

measures, and improperly issuing a statement of overriding considerations.

(MCWD's petition, Case No. S251935, see pp. 78-138 thereof.)

167. The challenged desalination project would not provide any

water to MCWD or its service territory; and it would not draw water directly
from the ocean for desalination. It would extract groundwater from the
shallow coastal aquifers using an unproven and experimental slant well

technology.

71

168. The allegations of the foregoing numbered paragraphs

through 165 are identical to the allegations of numbered paragraphs
through 165 as set forth in MCWD's October 12, 2018 petition under CEQA.

169. The City of Marina also filed a petition challenging the

Commission's CEQA determinations in D.18-09-017 on October 12, 2018.

170. The Commission moved the Court to dismiss the October 12,

2018 petitions of MCWD and the City of Marina on the grounds the petitions

were premature, alleging that CEQA's statute of limitations would be tolled

by the petitioners' participation in the Commission's application for

rehearing process.

171. WMD moved the Court to correct the petition captions to add
WMD as a real party in interest or, alternatively, for leave to intervene;

thereafter WMD filed an application for leave to file its answer to the

petitions.

172. The Court granted WMD permission to file its answer to the

petitions on November 26, 2018.
173. Therefore, MCWD is naming WMD as an additional real party
in interest in the instant petition.

174. WMD's answer responded to each of the numbered allegations

of MCWD's October 12, 2018 petition.

175. Neither the Commission nor Cal-Am timely filed answers to

MCWD's petition of October 12, 2018.

72

176. On October 19, 2018, MCWD timely filed an application for

rehearing of D.18-09-017 with the Commission. (82APP592, pp. A44172-

233.)

177. On that same date, the City of Marina also filed an application
for rehearing of D.18-09-017 with the Commission. (82APP593, pp.

A44248-384.)

178. MCWD's application for rehearing raised all issues presented
in this petition. (pp. A44171-233.)
179. Responses in support of one or both applications for rehearing

were filed with the Commission by PWN (82APP594, pp. A44395-01), Just

Water (82APP595, pp. A44413-21), WaterPlus (82APP596, pp. A44432-

36), CURE (82APP597, pp. A44448-52) and PTA (82APP598, pp. A44465-

68).

180. On November 5, 2019, Cal-Am filed a response with the
Commission opposing the applications for rehearing. (82APP599, pp.

A44480-99.)

181. The County and MCWRA filed a brief joint response in
opposition to the applications for rehearing before the Commission that
addressed only issues related to application of the Agency Act to the
MPWSP. (82APP600, pp. A44711-22.)
182. The Court, on December 12, 2018, denied the petitions of
MCWD and the City of Marina without prejudice, subject to completion of

73

the rehearing process under Public Utilities Code § 1731, subd. (b).

183. The Commission has acknowledged that petitioners have the

right, upon the passage of sixty days after filing their applications for

rehearing, to take the Commission's failure to act on the applications as the

Commission's denial of rehearing. (Case No. S251935, Commission's Oct.

23, 2018 motion, pp. 9-10, citing Pub. Util. Code §§ 1731, subd. (b); 1733,

subd. (b).)

184. The Commission acknowledged to the Court that, upon

petitioners' deeming their applications denied and petitioning the Court,

jurisdiction over matters raised in such petitions would lie with the Court.

(Case No. S251935, CPUC Oct. 23, 2018 Motion to Dismiss, pp. 9-10.)

185. The Commission indicated it was working diligently to

complete and issue a decision on the rehearing applications at its December

13, 2018 meeting or, perhaps at the latest, at its January 10, 2019 meeting.

(Case No. S251935, Nov. 19, 2018 CPUC Reply in Support of Motion to

Dismiss, pp. 19-20, fn. 15.)

186. The Commission took no action on the applications for
rehearing of D.18-09-017 prior to or at its December 13, 2018 meeting.

(82APP601, p. A44800, item 57; 82APP602, p. A44815.)

187. The Commission took no action on the applications for

rehearing of D.18-09-017 at its January 10, 2019 meeting. (82APP617, p.

A44940, item 39; 82APP618, p. A44957.)

74

188. As of the date of filing of this petition, the Commission has still

taken no action on the applications for rehearing of D.18-09-017.

189. As of the date of filing this petition, MCWD takes its

application for rehearing to be denied, because the Commission has not acted

on the application.

190. MCWD is filing, concurrently with this petition, a motion for
the Court to take judicial notice of MCWD's Appendix, Volumes 1-81; filed
in Case No. S251935; the Court's clerks have indicated to MCWD's counsel

that the Court retains hard and electronic copies of MCWD's 81-volume

appendix, such that it is available to the Court with reference to this petition,
and that refiling volumes through 81 concurrently with this petition would

be both unnecessary and burdensome to the Court.

191. MCWD is filing and serving, concurrently with this petition,
one additional volume of its Appendix, Volume 82; an electronic copy of
Volumes 1-81 of MCWD's October 12, 2018 Appendix was served upon the
Commission and all real parties in interest named in this petition.

192. Upon the Court's assignment of a case number to this petition

MCWD intends to file a motion for expedited treatment and calendar

preference, due to the urgency and great public importance of the issues
presented, as well as according to applicable statutory provisions for

expedited treatment and calendar preference as set forth above.

75

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

For all the foregoing reasons and the reasons stated in the following
Memorandum of Points and Authorities, MCWD prays that the Court:

1. Grant the petition and issue a writ of review/mandate

identifying the issue(s) the Court finds to be apparently meritorious,

suspending the Commission's decision pending judicial review, according

this case expedited treatment and calendar preference, and directing the

Commission promptly to prepare, certify and file with the Court the complete

administrative record;

2. Upon the filing of the complete administrative record, set a

schedule for the briefing of the merits of the arguments set forth in this

petition;

3. Upon the filing of briefs on the merits, inquire into the
lawfulness of the Commission's determinations to grant a CPCN to Cal-Am

to construct and operate the MPWSP, to certify the FEIR, to adopt the
statement of overriding considerations, and to adopt the mitigation and

monitoring plan attached to and adopted in D.18-09-017;

4. Upon consideration and review of the matter, render a decision

on the merits vacating D.18-09-017 and remanding A.12-04-019 to the

Commission for further proceedings in compliance with the law, and with

instructions, as appropriate;

76

5. Award MCWD its costs incurred in this proceeding, including

its attorney fees as permitted pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, section
1021.5 and other applicable provisions of law, as against respondent and/or
real party in interest Cal-Am as justice requires; and

6. Grant MCWD such other and further relief as may be just and

proper.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I.
REVIEW OF D.18-09-017 IS PROPERLY BEFORE THE COURT

A. MCWD Exhausted its Remedies.

MCWD participated throughout the Commission's administrative

proceeding, including presenting and cross-examining witnesses at the

administrative hearing, briefing factual and legal issues, and commenting on
the Commission's environmental review pursuant to CEQA. MCWD's
grounds for alleging the Commission's legal errors were presented to the

Commission prior to the close of the public hearing on the project on

September 13, 2018 and before the issuance of the NOD on September 14,
2018. (Pub. Util. Code § 1731, subd. (b)(1); Pub. Resources Code § 21177.)
MCWD timely filed a Notice of Intent to File CEQA Petition (Pub.

Resources Code § 21167.5.) MCWD timely filed an application for

rehearing before the Commission. (Pub. Util. Code § 1731, subd. (b); see §

82APP592, pp. A44170-44233.)

MCWD initially presented its CEQA claims to the Court in a petition
for writ of review/mandate filed within 30 days of the date the Commission
filed its NOD. That petition was denied by the Court, without prejudice to

MCWD presenting the claims again following conclusion of the rehearing
process before the Commission. (Order of Dec. 12, 2018, Case No.
S251935.) Accordingly, MCWD has waited more than sixty days from the

79

filing of its application for rehearing before filing this petition. (Pub. Util.

Code 1733, subd. (b).) Given the Commission's representation to the Court

and the parties that it might resolve the applications for rehearing of MCWD

and the City at the next voting meeting on December 13, 2018 or, at the latest,

at the following meeting on January 10, 2019, MCWD waited for the results

of those two meetings before filing this petition. However, the Commission

has taken no action on the applications for rehearing. (82APP601, p.

A44800, item 57; 82APP602, p. A44815; 82APP617, p. A44940, item 39;

82APP618, p. A44957.)

With the passage of sixty days from the date MCWD filed its

application for rehearing with the Commission, the Public Utilities Code

permits MCWD on or after December 18, 2018 to deem its application
denied at any time and seek relief from the Court, absent action on the
application by the Commission. (Pub. Util. Code § 1733, subd. (b).) The act

of taking the application as denied and filing an original petition with the

Court is an alternative procedure for bringing the rehearing process to a close.

(Sokol v. Public Utilities Com. (1966) 65 Cal.2d 247, 251-252 (construing an
earlier version of the statute, holding prospective petitioners are not required
to deem their application denied and thereupon file a petition within only the

statutory time that applies when the Commission has issued a decision on

rehearing).) The Commission has acknowledged the propriety of the

80

alternative procedure provided under section 1733, subdivision (b). (Case

No. S251935, CPUC Oct. 23, 2018 Motion to Dismiss, pp 9-10.)

As of the date of filing this petition, MCWD hereby takes its

application for rehearing to be denied, thereby concluding the rehearing

process and transferring jurisdiction over matters raised in this petition to this

Court. (Pub. Util. Code § 1733, subd. (b).) Thus, all issues raised in
MCWD's petition and its application for rehearing are now properly before
the Court. (Pub. Util. Code § 1731, subd. (b).)

B. A Timely Petition for Writ of Review/Mandate to this Court is the
Sole Avenue for Review of the Commission's Violations of Law.

A petition for writ of review constitutes the only means for an

aggrieved party to obtain direct appellate review of Commission decisions.
(Pub. Util. Code §§ 1756; 1759, subd. (a); Voices of the Wetlands v. State

Water Resources Control Board (2011) 52 Cal.4th 499, 517, fn. 9; CLAM,

supra, 25 Cal.3d at 901.) In cases concerning water utilities, judicial review
lies only with this Court. (Pub. Util. Code § 1756, subd. (f).) In cases arising

under CEQA, review also lies only with this Court. (Pub. Resources Code

§ 21168.6.) Such a petition must be filed within thirty days of the filing of

the NOD required by CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code § 21167.6.5) Because

the NOD was filed on September 14, 2018, MCWD's October 12, 2018

petition was timely. The Court's denial of that petition was without prejudice

to re-filing upon completion of the rehearing process before the Commission.

81

(Dec. 12, 2018 order of the Court, 82APP616, p. A44894.)

Here, MCWD challenges Commission decision that failed to comply
with constitutional mandates for the protection of the State's groundwater
and for preservation of MCWD's rights to due process and to be free from
impairment of contract. (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2; U.S. Const., 4th and 14th
Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7; Morongo Band of Mission Indians v.
California SWRCB, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 737; U.S. Const., art. I, § 10, cl. 1;
Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.) The decision also failed to comply with CEQA and

the Public Utilities Code. The petition implicates questions of great public

importance, due to the severe public health and safety implications for the
citizens of Marina and the other communities that are served by MCWD,

because of the threat to their groundwater supply.

The Commission's decision is reviewable solely by petition for writ

of review/mandate to this Court. in its role as the sole tribunal authorized to

review a Commission decision in a water utility case, as well as one made

under CEQA. (Pub. Util. Code § 1756, subd. (f); Pub. Resources Code

§ 21168.6.) Therefore, the writ should issue forthwith, and the Court should
inquire into the merits of MCWD's petition. (CLAM, supra, 25 Cal.3d at

901; see also Powers v. City of Richmond, supra, 10 Cal.4th at 112-114;

Clean Air Constituency v. Cal. State Air Resources Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 801,

808.) Because writ relief from the Court is the only avenue available to
MCWD for review of the Commission's failure to comply with the law in

82

issuing D.18-09-017, provided the Court finds any ground raised by MCWD
to be "apparently meritorious," the petition must be granted. (Powers v. City
of Richmond, supra, 10 Cal.4th at 114; see also Pacific Bell Wireless, LLC
V. Pub. Util. Com. (2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 718, 728-729.)

II.
STANDARD OF REVIEW

The applicable standard of review under the Public Utilities Code

requires the Court to determine whether the Commission "has regularly
pursued its authority." (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).) As to MCWD's
allegations of constitutional error, the Court "shall exercise independent

judgment on the law and the facts, and the findings or conclusions of the

commission material to the determination of the constitutional question[s]
shall not be final." (Pub. Util. Code § 1760, emphasis added; Pac. Tel. &

Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Com. (1965) 62 Cal.2d 634, 646-648 [while section

1760 does not require the Court to usurp the Commission's ratemaking role,

the statute ensures the Commission's alleged constitutional errors are subject

to close judicial scrutiny], citing legislative history.) Therefore, the section

of the Public Utilities Code that ordinarily would insulate the Commission's

findings of fact from de novo judicial review does not apply to such findings
as are material to determination of the constitutional issues of water law, due

process and impairment of contract that are raised by MCWD's petition.
(Ibid.; cf. Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (c).)

83

As to questions raised in this petition that do not implicate

constitutional violations, the findings and conclusions of the Commission

that are "drawn from undisputed evidence and from which conflicting

inferences may not reasonably be drawn, present questions of law." (Pacific

Tel. & Tel. Co. v. Public Util. Com. (1965) 62 Cal.2d 634, 647; Southern

Pac. Co. v. Public Utilities Com. (1953) 41 Cal.2d 354, 362.) Only where

the Commission's findings and conclusions as to non-constitutional

questions are "arrived at from the consideration of conflicting evidence and

undisputed evidence from which conflicting inferences may reasonably be

drawn" are those findings subject to a more deferential standard of review by

the Court. (Camp Meeker Water System, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com., supra,

51 Cal.3d at 864, citing Southern Pac. Co. v. Public Utilities Com., supra,

41 Cal.2d at 362.) As with any case before the Court, the constitutional

questions are subject to de novo review. (Ghirardo V. Antonioli (1994) 8

Cal.4th 791, 799-801.) Judicial review of legal error under CEQA is likewise

de novo. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of

Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 427.)
The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public
with detailed information about the effects that a proposed project is likely

to have on the environment and evaluate ways of avoiding or minimizing

those effects. (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (Cal., Dec. 24, 2018, No.

S219783) 2018 Cal. LEXIS 9831 at *11; Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002.1,

84

subd. (a), 21061; see CEQA Guidelines13 § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1).) As this

Court has explained, an EIR also acts as an "environmental alarm bell" and

demonstrates to the public "that the agency has, in fact, analyzed and
considered the ecological implications of its action" and taken "all action
necessary to protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of

the state." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University

of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376 ("Laurel Heights I'), 392.)

Under CEQA, an EIR must reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure

(see Guidelines, § 15151), including "detail sufficient to enable those who

did not participate in its preparation to understand and to consider
meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project." (Laurel Heights,
supra, 47 Cal.3d at 405.) To accomplish CEQA's informational purpose, an

"EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the agency's bare conclusions."

(Citizens for Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553

("Goleta"), 568.)

The Court must determine whether the Commission prejudicially
abused its discretion in certifying the Final EIR by either: (1) failing to
proceed in the manner required by law, or (2) reaching a decision
unsupported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5;

13 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, Div. 6, ch. 3, §§ 15000-15387 and appendices, referenced as "Guidelines" hereinafter.

85

Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho

Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412 (*Vineyard"), 427-28.) As the Court

explained in Vineyard, when evaluating an EIR for CEQA compliance, "a

reviewing court must adjust its scrutiny to the nature of the alleged defect,

depending on whether the claim is predominantly one of improper procedure

or a dispute over the facts." (Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 435.) A court

must "determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct

procedures, scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA

requirements." (Ibid.) In a factual dispute, the agency's factual conclusions
are accorded greater deference and reviewed for substantial evidence. (Ibid.)

Ultimately, whether an EIR "sufficiently performs the function of

facilitating 'informed agency decisionmaking and informed public

participation™ is a legal, not factual, question. (Sierra Club v. County of

Fresno (Cal., Dec. 24, 2018, No. S219783) 2018 Cal. LEXIS 9831, at *13-

14; Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 435.) Similarly, whether "an EIR has

omitted essential information is a procedural question subject to de novo

review." (Banning Ranch Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2

Cal.5th 918 ("Banning Ranch") at 935-936; Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at

p. 435; Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215 ("Sierra
Club"), 1236.) As this Court recently reiterated, "when an agency fails to
proceed [as CEQA requires], harmless error analysis is inapplicable. The
failure to comply with the law subverts the purposes of CEQA if it omits

86

material necessary to informed decisionmaking and informed public

participation. Case law is clear that, in such cases, the error is prejudicial."

(Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (Cal., Dec. 24, 2018, No. S219783) 2018

Cal. LEXIS 3891, at *18, quoting County of Amador v. El Dorado County
Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 945-946.)

Similarly, the applicable standard of review under the Public Utilities

Code requires the Court to determine whether the Commission "has regularly

pursued its authority," in making its CEQA determinations, including as to
those matters MCWD alleges resulted in a violation of its constitutional
rights. (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, § subd. (b).) As noted above, as to specific
constitutional questions implicated by the CEQA errors that are raised in this
petition, the Court "shall exercise independent judgment on the law and the
facts, and the findings or conclusions of the commission material to the
determination of the constitutional question[s] shall not be final." (Pub. Util.

§ Code § 1760, emphasis added.)

III.
LEGAL ARGUMENT

A decision by the Commission that "affects the rights of a party, but

has no factual support, would not be one made in the regular pursuit of

commission authority and could deny due process." (Camp Meeker Water
System, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com., supra, 51 Cal.3d at 864.) As will be

explained below, several important aspects of D.18-09-017 that affect

87

MCWD's rights were made without the support of any evidence that was
admitted through the testimony of a witness sworn under penalty of perjury.

(Pub. Util. Code § 1710.) Consequently, those decisions were without

factual support, in derogation of constitutional due process guarantees, and
in making them the Commission failed to regularly pursue its authority.

(Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).)

Moreover, the Commission fails to regularly pursue its authority when

its decisions violate the law, including when its decisions violate a

petitioner's rights under the Constitution of the United States or the
Constitution of the State of California. (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b);

see PegaStaff v. Public Utilities Com. (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 374, 389-390

is and fn. 14 [there is an exception for constitutional challenges to the typically

narrow scope of judicial review of Commission decisions], citing Pub. Util.

Code §§ 1757, 1757.1 and 1760.) Here, the Commission failed to regularly

pursue its authority because D.18-09-017 violated MCWD's constitutional

rights and statutory provisions of law in five ways, as explained in detail

below. Each of the five broad legal errors MCWD asserts would, upon

correction, necessarily result in a finding that the MPWSP as approved by

the Commission is either not legally feasible, or is not required for the present
or future public convenience and necessity, or both. (Pub. Util. Code
con 1001.) Therefore, the Commission has failed to regularly pursue its

authority in issuing D.18-09-017 and approving the MPWSP in violation of

88

MCWD's rights under the United States and California Constitutions, as well

as in violation of CEQA and the Public Utilities Code. (Pub. Util. Code

c0n 1757.1, subd. (b).)

Accordingly, D.18-09-017 must be set aside or vacated, and the

Commission's errors must be addressed. In particular, D.18-09-017

impermissibly condones and requires action contrary to California's
constitutional requirement mandating that the use of the State's waters be

only beneficial and reasonable, and it unreasonably fails to protect the public
agency water system of MCWD as directed in Public Utilities Code section
1001, all on the basis of an insufficient record. The decision purports to

certificate a water supply project that will violate the longstanding

requirements of California water law and the constitutional prohibition on

waste of the State's waters, unreasonably impairing or taking the resources
of a neighboring public water agency in order to serve the desire of a
privately-owned water utility to maximize its profits.14

In addition, because the record makes plain that the MPWSP is not

required for the current or future public convenience and necessity - even

14 The Commission, granting Cal-Am's request to increase its long-term debt issuance, observed in D.18-07-013 that Cal-Am needed to issue new debt
securities (D.18-07-013, p. 15 at 1 3), where Cal-Am's application (A.17-08- 018) appeared to indicate it could only come into compliance with its required debt-to-equity ratio upon completion of the MPWSP, which it
would then incorporate in its rate base.

89

assuming arguendo that Cal-Am might require 14,000 acre-feet per year

("AFY") of supply for its Monterey District at some point within the 30-year

life of the project instead of the less than it 9,500 AFY it presently requires
the Commission erred in granting Cal-Am's application. (Pub. Util. Code
con 1001.) The Court should grant review, issue the writ and upon inquiry
vacate or set aside D.18-09-017. The Court should then return the matter to
the Commission so that the Commission may correct any errors found by the
Court and examine feasible alternatives to the desalination project that may

satisfy any additional future need, including purchase of public agency

supplies, and that - in the event the Commission determines it will

nonetheless continue consideration of the CPCN requested by Cal-Am for

the MPWSP the Commission may revise and recirculate its EIR in

compliance with CEQA.

A. D.18-09-017 Violates the Reasonable and Beneficial Use and
Avoidance of Waste Requirements of Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution and their Progeny.
In issuing D.18-09-017, the Commission committed legal error and

failed to regularly pursue its authority (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b)),

because the decision certificated a project for which the source water intake

system will necessarily violate California's constitutional requirement for

reasonable, beneficial use and avoidance of waste of the State's waters. (Cal.

Const. art. X, § 2.) The constitutional requirement for reasonable, beneficial

use and avoidance of waste, including its progeny in decisional law and

90

statute, precludes groundwater pumping by a new appropriator from a
critically overdrafted sub-basin. (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency,
supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241-1243; see also Katz v. Walkinshaw (1903) 141 Cal.
116, 150.) The objective of this constitutional requirement is carried out

through its expression in a number of statutes, including California's new

Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. (Senate Bill 1168 (Pavley),
Assembly Bill 1739 (Dickinson), Senate Bill 1319 (Pavley), stats. 2014, ch.
346, 347, 348.) Yet the MPWSP's groundwater intake system would
admittedly further diminish and degrade local groundwater resources,
contrary to basic precepts of California water law and the California

Constitution, and in direct opposition to the legislative mandate and clearly-
articulated state policy of achieving sustainable use of groundwater over the

coming decades.

1. The California Constitution Mandates Reasonable and
Beneficial Use of Groundwater.
The constitutional requirement that the State's waters be put to

reasonable and beneficial use and not be unreasonably wasted is
the foundation of the state's water rights system and applies to
all water rights. It confers authority on all branches and levels
of government to ensure that water is used reasonably (and reasonably efficiently) to maximize the general welfare of

Policy," p. 102, ch. 4, in Allison Lassiter (ed.), Sustainable Water:

Challenges and Solutions from California, Univ. of Calif. Press (2015).)

As a matter of law there is no surplus available to Cal-Am to pump

from the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin, because in the 2016 update of its

Bulletin 118 DWR designated the sub-basin as being in a state of critical
overdraft (Ex. SV-11, Att. 215). (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency,
supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241-1243; Pasadena V. Alhambra (1949) 33 Cal.2d
908, 925-26; Corona Foothill Lemon Co. v. Lillibridge (1937) 8 Cal.2d 522,
531-32.) It is well established that where the resources of a groundwater

basin are fully allocated, there is no surplus available to a new appropriator
such as Cal-Am here. (Pasadena v. Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at 925-26;

see also Monolith Portland Cement Co. v. Mojave Public Utilities District

(1957) 154 Cal.App.2d 487, 493-94 (utility violated others' rights by

exporting when there was no surplus).) This fundamental principle of

California water law is rooted in the reasonable and beneficial use

requirements of article X, section 2 of the California Constitution. (City of

Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency, supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1242.)

D.18-09-017 violates the California Constitution's reasonable and

beneficial use requirements by certificating a project that would require new

15 Although the Commission's FEIR was released in 2017, in discussing the
groundwater environment it inexplicably chose not to employ sub-basin names,
numbers or overdraft designations from DWR's 2016 update of the SVGB sub- basin boundaries, further contributing to the inadequacy of its groundwater analysis. (FEIR, § 4.4.1, p. 4.4-4.)

pumping in a critically overdrafted sub-basin, unreasonably degrading
MCWD's and Marina's groundwater for the benefit of the generally less-

diverse, more affluent Monterey Peninsula community. At the same time,

potentially feasible, less impactful and less expensive alternatives are

available, but these alternatives were not fully explored by the Commission.
As MCWD discussed in its comments on the Commission's Proposed

Decision ("PD") and at oral argument, those public agency alternatives are

sufficient to meet even the applicant's inflated demand claims. (RT, Vol. 29,

pp. 5110-5111 [40APP555, pp. A26702-03]; MCWD PD Comments, p. 24

and fn. 146 [82APP591, p. A44169], citing FEIR/EIS, p. 5.4-12.) Yet the

Commission dismissed the public agencies' proposed alternatives (and the

request of multiple parties that an evidentiary hearing be held on those

alternatives) without any meaningful analysis. (Compare Ashbacker Radio
Corp. V. FCC (1945) 326 U.S. 327 (where several project alternatives are
mutually exclusive, a comparative evidentiary hearing should be held to
determine which alternative best serves the public interest).)

In the course of determining the proposed project's legal feasibility,

the Commission speculated that there was "every reason to believe" Cal-Am

would likely perfect a lawful appropriative right to the groundwater required
for the project. (D.18-09-017, pp. 80, 82, 173 at Finding of Fact ("FOF") 57

[1APP1, pp. A184, 186, 277].) However, the Commission has

acknowledged that it does not have the legal jurisdiction to make a

93

groundwater rights determination. (FEIR, § 2.6, pp. 2-31 - 2-40 [43APP588,

pp. A28086-95].) The Commission did not conduct any hearing on

groundwater rights or harm to groundwater, nor did it heed any of MCWD's

and other parties' multiple requests to refer such matters to the SWRCB or

the courts. (MCWD April 8, 2016 Protest of Amended Application, p. 6

[14APP222, p. A10169]; MCWD July 13, 2016 Amended Consolidated

[37APP489, pp. A22468-224821.) Consequently, compounding the

infirmity of the Commission's decision to certificate the project under
constitutional water law precepts, the decision also violated MCWD's
constitutional right to due process. (U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amends.; Cal.

Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7; see section III.D., infra.)

The Commission formed its belief that Cal-Am could acquire a water
right and evaluated the project's likely impacts to the groundwater basin

solely through information developed in its CEQA review. (D.18-09-017,

94

pp. 80, 82, 173 [1APP1, pp. A184, 186, 277].) This truncated process is

inadequate under the Public Utilities Code, because evidence on these critical

issues was not admitted through the testimony of a witness sworn under

penalty of perjury and subject to cross-examination. (Pub. Util. Code

1710.) Hence, contrary to the requirement of Public Utilities Code section
1002, subd. (a)(4), the Commission's demotion of evidence on the project's

"influence on the environment" to unsworn and un-cross-examined

comments in the CEQA process rendered such evidence inadmissible in its
CPCN process. Much of the evidence that MCWD offered to present on
groundwater issues through its witnesses' sworn testimony under penalty of
perjury was stricken or otherwise excluded from the evidentiary record at
Cal-Am's request. (Oct. 27 and Nov. 13, 2017 ALJ Rulings on Motion to
Strike of Cal-Am re Exs. MCD-49, MCD-52, MCD-55 [23APP394, p.

A17110-17111, 17117-17118; 26APP424, p. A18978-18979, 18985-

18986].) MCWD presented much of its groundwater evidence in unsworn

comments on the Commission's draft and final EIR, as well as the 2017
HWG Report. However, the Commission chose to ignore MCWD's experts
and based its decision regarding groundwater impact issues solely on the

poorly-supported, misleading and biased opinion of Cal-Am's and other

project proponents' HWG, whose members lacked the geophysics expertise
to peer review the AEM investigation. (Compare, e.g., FEIR, Master
Response 8.9, pp. 8.2-59 through 8.2-61 [46APP588, pp. A30392-30394],

95

misinterpreting Dr. Knight's AEM investigation of local baseline

groundwater conditions, with MCWD's May 27, 2018 FEIR comments,

attaching Dr. Knight's response to the HWG opinion [39APP509, pp.

A24231-24232 ("The revision makes it appear that we were measuring the

resistivity of the pore water, which we most definitely were not; the label

became "Resistivity of Groundwater", as shown in the Final EIR/EIS

Appendix E3 Figure 3-10. I personally find this quite stunning; that one of
our figures was changed in such a substantial way."]; see 27APP430, p.

A19274 figure and color key caption "Resistivity of saturated and

unsaturated sediment types" vS. 22APP374, p. A15744 altered figure and

color key caption "LogResistivity (ohm-m) of Groundwater".)

Because the Commission declined to refer the groundwater rights

question to the SWRCB or the courts, it now falls to this Court to decide
whether the Commission has correctly concluded that Cal-Am may newly
appropriate groundwater from the critically-overdrafted 180/400 Foot

Aquifer Sub-basin of the SVGB to operate the MPWSP. (See DWR

designation, Ex. SV-11, Att. 216.) MCWD submits that, as a matter of law,
Cal-Am cannot acquire any new right to pump the source water for the

16 DWR Bulletin 118, 2016 update, pp. 12-13, 15, also available at https://water.ca.gov/-/media/DWR-Website/Web-

Reports/Bulletin_118_ Interim_Update_2016.pdf, at pp. 22, 23, 25 of pdf.

project, due to the DWR's critical overdraft designation. (City of Barstow v.
Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1241-1243 [no new

appropriation permitted in an overdrafted basin].)

Moreover, the Commission's speculation concerning Cal-Am's

ability to acquire a groundwater right rested upon theories set forth in a

SWRCB report that was released in 2013, prior to the DWR designation of
critical overdraft. (Ex. MCD-17, SWRCB Final Report, [15APP234, pp.
A11131-11187].) The Commission's speculation further proceeded on the
basis of the HWG's deeply flawed analysis of baseline groundwater
conditions and likely impacts. (See MCWD comments, FEIR, § 8.5.2, § pp.
8.5-129-8.5-522 [47-49APP588, pp. A30792-31385].) Notably, following
receipt of comments on the PD by the SWRCB, the final decision was

modified so that D.18-09-017 stated "Cal-Am would need to be able to

demonstrate that its extraction and beneficial use of the water source would

not injure or harm other legal users of water" and to ensure that the project

"can be lawfully operated pursuant to adopted mitigation measures." (D.18-

09-017, pp. 81, 113 at fn. 306, 174 at FOF 62 [1APP1, pp. A185, A217,

A278].) But there has been no determination, even by the Commission, that

such conditions exist, and MCWD maintains the question is now moot in

light of DWR's designation of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin as

critically overdrafted, because the proposed groundwater extraction is now

97

strictly prohibited a as a matter of law.17 Notably, by agreeing to return some

water to the SVGB to compensate for its withdrawals, Cal-Am effectively

admits - even using its incorrect beneficial use standard - that its project will

be withdrawing some groundwater from the basin. However, such

withdrawals are prohibited under California water law.
Had the Commission conducted an adequate analysis of baseline

groundwater conditions and likely groundwater impacts, it would have been

evident to the Commission, the parties and the public that the MPWSP will,

in fact, further degrade the coastal aquifers in the project area, adversely

impacting the freshwater resource that is present in the Dune Sand Aquifer

of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin south of the Salinas River. The sub-

basin underlies MCWD's Armstrong Ranch property, and the freshwater

presently protects the area and the immediately adjacent Monterey Sub-basin

against further seawater intrusion, as MCWD and its experts have explained.

(See, e.g., 42APP587, pp. A27785-68, 27830; 39APP509, pp. A24155,

24187, 24189, 24231-32].) These adverse groundwater impacts also

17 Similarly, speculation early during the proceeding as to whether Cal-Am's proposal to pump groundwater from the SVGB would trigger an adjudication
of the basin or certain sub-basins was rendered moot, at least as to the MPWSP, in 2016 when DWR made its designation of critical overdraft. Adjudication is no longer necessary to determine any right of Cal-Am, since Cal-Am cannot acquire a sufficient right to pump from a sub-basin that is in a state of critical overdraft, as a matter of law. (City of Barstow v. Mojave supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241, 1243.) Water Agency,

98

significantly threaten MCWD's municipal drinking water supply in the

aquifers of the immediately adjacent Monterey Sub-basin, where MCWD has

its municipal supply wells. (Ex. MCD-64 [26APP422, p. A18957].) Such

an outcome would consist of a waste, rather than a beneficial use, of

groundwater. (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2; City of Barstow v. Mojave Water

Agency, supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241-1243; see Katz v. Walkinshaw, supra, 141
Cal. at 150.) Cal-Am and its experts were aware of this constitutional
provision of law, and the related beneficial use standards under the Basin

Plan, as well as the presence of water that meets beneficial use standards in

the project area as revealed by Cal-Am's test well results, and the

Commission was made aware of them during evidentiary hearings. (RT, Vol.
15, Mr. Leffler for Cal-Am, pp. 2436:15-2440:6 [15APP226, pp. A10564-

68].) Yet D.18-09-017 ignored the evidence and the law.

Degradation of the aquifers in the project area through operation of

the MPWSP would be particularly unreasonable and therefore flatly contrary

to the California Constitution in light of the feasible alternatives that are

available to meet any future water supply shortage for Cal-Am's Monterey

District. This is especially so when implementation of such alternatives

would lessen or avoid entirely the significant adverse environmental impacts

of the MPWSP. Implementation of such feasible alternatives would also
have obviated the necessity of a judicial or otherwise lawful determination

of groundwater rights or harm, in addition to avoiding most, if not all, of the

99

many other adverse impacts of the project.18 No evidence has been presented

to the Commission, nor does MCWD believe any such evidence exists, that

under the circumstances presented here desalinating brackish and fresh

groundwater at great cost, including significant power requirements, and at

great danger of harm to MCWD's water supply - would be a more reasonable
use than less expensive, less controversial, less environmentally impactful
and sooner-available alternatives, such as, for example, expanded PWM,

MCWD's sale of a portion of its PWM supply, or utilization of additional

available ASR supplies. Moreover, a water rights dispute cannot lawfully be
resolved by the Commission. (See FEIR, § 2.6, p. 2-32 [43APP588, 28087].)

The Commission, in certificating a project, the operation of which will
be contrary to the reasonable and beneficial use requirements of the
California Constitution, has violated the law, prejudicially abused its
discretion and failed to regularly pursue its authority. (Pub. Util. Code

c0n 1757.1, subd. (b).) In doing so the Commission violated the constitutional

18 While the Commission could not be the arbiter of whether Cal-Am possesses or can possess sufficient valid groundwater rights for the proposed project, the
outcome of the question nonetheless should determine the feasibility of the
project, as the Commission acknowledged. (Sept. 26, 2012 letter of Commission Exec. Dir. to SWRCB Exec. Dir., p. 2 (Commission must
determine whether Cal-Am's claim to water rights "is credible enough to support a finding of legal feasibility" for the MPWSP); see Ex. MCD-17, p. [15APP234, p. A11134].) For this reason, MCWD repeatedly suggested the Commission refer the matter to the SWRCB or the courts for resolution.
Eventually, MCWD and seven other parties moved for referral to the SWRCB (Mar. 21, 2018 Motion [37APP489, A22470]), but the motion was not granted.

100

rights of MCWD and others. Therefore, the Commission's findings and
conclusions material to determination of questions concerning the project's
unreasonable use of groundwater, including harm, impacts and cumulative

impacts, are not final upon the Court's review. (Pub. Util. Code § 1760.)
The Commission's errors are subject to the independent judgment of the

Court on the law and the facts. (Ibid..)

The Commission's approval of the MPWSP's slant well intakes,

drawing from the project area aquifers of the critically overdrafted 180/400

Foot Aquifer Sub-basin of the SVGB, turns groundwater law on its head.
The Commission solicited the SWRCB's guidance on the question of

groundwater rights (Ex. MCD-17 [15APP234, A11134]), but the

Commission failed to take that guidance through to its conclusion. The

SWRCB's report, issued prior the DWR's 2016 critical overdraft designation
of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin of the SVGB, framed the question as
whether Cal-Am could meet the burden of demonstrating that its proposed
project would do no harm to the groundwater basin and its current lawful

users. (Ex. MCD-17, July 31, 2013 SWRCB Final Review of Cal-Am's

MPWSP, p. 35, citing Allen V. Calif. Water and Tel. Co. (1946) 29 Cal.2d
466, 481; see also MCD-17, pp. 38-39.) Perhaps assuming arguendo that

Cal-Am's inaccurate claims concerning the severity and irreversible state of

seawater intrusion could be accurate, the SWRCB posited in 2013 that if Cal-

Am could prove the MPWSP would do no harm to the groundwater basin and

101

current lawful users, only then might it gain an appropriative right. (Id. at

pp. 35, 38.)

Cal-Am's claim, as stated in its response to MCWD's application for

rehearing, that it may pump the brackish groundwater from a critically
overdrafted sub-basin without restriction, because that water is not currently

being put to beneficial use makes no logical sense either. (See 82APP599,

pp. A44667-668.) If the water of potential beneficial use in a sub-basin is

fully allocated, as it must be when a condition of imbalance, or overdraft

exists, to commence any new pumping from that sub-basin would exacerbate

the existing imbalance and thus violate the requirement to refrain from

wasting the waters of the State. (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency,
supra, 23 Cal.4th at 1241-1243; Pasadena v. Alhambra, supra, 33 Cal.2d at
925-26; Corona Foothill Lemon Co. v. Lillibridge, supra, 8 Cal.2d at 531-

32; Monolith Portland Cement Co. v. Mojave Public Utilities District, supra,

154 Cal.App.2d at 493-94.)

In the alternative, Cal-Am might perhaps acquire a small right based

only on the existing 500 AFY withdrawal limit that applies to the CEMEX

property where the intake wells would be located. (Ex. MCD-6, 1996

Annexation Agreement, § 7.2, p.17 [6APP63, p. A4240].) This 500 AFY

limitation is insufficient to supply the approximately 17,000 AFY of source

water needed annually to operate the project. (6.4 mgd of output at 42% of

102

source water intake equals a requirement to pump 15.2 mgd, or

approximately 17,000 AFY.)
In Allen, supra, this Court sustained the trial court's finding that there
was no safe or dependable surplus in the basin available for exportation out

of the basin by the defendant water company during normal conditions, but
reserved jurisdiction to the trial court to determine, subject to proof, whether
any surplus water exists during wet cycles that the defendant may then be
able to pump and export without harming others. (Allen v. Calif. Water and
Tel. Co., supra, 29 Cal.2d at 485-487, 491-492.) In other words, the
defendant water company could only export water in those water years where
it could prove that surplus water existed in the basin - not every year. (Ibid.;
see also Erickson v. Queen Valley Ranch Co. (1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 578, 586
[reversed and remanded to trial court for further proceedings due to lack of
required findings on material issues related to the constitutional policy
requiring reasonable and beneficial use of the state's waters].)
As the SWRCB correctly stated here, and assuming that a water right
might be available if the sub-basin were not designated as being in a state of
critical overdraft, the burden of making a showing of no harm is on Cal-Am.
(Ex. MCD-17, p. ii [15APP234, p. A11135].) The record demonstrates,
however, that Cal-Am has not met and cannot meet that burden. In any event,

Cal-Am could not lawfully obtain any prescriptive right that impairs the

103

rights of MCWD, a public agency. (Civil Code § 1007; Wright v. Goleta

Water District (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 74, 90-91.)

Rather than regularly pursing its authority (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1,

subd. (b)) when the Commission learned of the adverse development of

critical overdraft for the sub-basin where Cal-Am intends to install its source

wells, for example by denying the application or investigating alternative

intake methods or locations or alternative projects, the Commission dug in

its heels and proceeded to ignore the facts and the law. MCWD again

explained to the Commission that Cal-Am could not lawfully operate its

proposed source wells, including in MCWD's oral argument and its

application for rehearing. (MCWD's Application for Rehearing of D. 18-09-

017 [82APPP592, pp. A44211].) Because the Commission failed to correct

its prejudicial legal error and failed to acknowledge that the law does not

permit what D.18-09-017 purports to authorize, the Court must grant review
that it may consider the merits of the matter and, upon consideration, vacate

or set aside the decision.

2. The RWQCB Basin Plan Prohibits Deliberate Contamination.
The Central Coast RWQCB Basin Plan, following the requirements

of SWRCB Resolution 88-63, mandates that water containing 3,000 mg/L

TDS or less is to be considered potentially suitable for beneficial uses. (Ex.

MCD-60 (Basin Plan excerpts), p. 7 at § 2.2.1 (attaching and referencing Res.

88-63) [25APP419, p. A18827]; see also RT, Vol. 15, Mr. Leffler testifying

104

for Cal-Am, pp. 2436:15-2440:6 [15APP226, pp. A10564-68].) As

explained by MCWD's experts, all data now available indicate that such

water exists in the project area aquifers. (Ex. MCD-20, pp. 8-12 [15APP237,

p. A11212-16]; Ex. MCD-55B, pp. 4-5, 6-8 [25APP415, pp. A25788, 25793-

25794, 25795-25797]; MCWD's Apr. 19, 2018 FEIR comment letter, pp. 2-
and attachments thereto [42APP587, pp. A27658-61]; see also MCWD's
Apr. 27, 2018 FEIR comments at, e.g., pp. 33-34 and attachment thereto

[39APP509, pp. A24293-94].) The law and the Basin Plan require this water
capable of beneficial uses to be protected, not degraded, as the MPWSP
would do. (See FEIR, § 8.2.3.4, p. 8.2-8; § 4.4.5.2, pp. 4.4-64 - 4.4-96;

Appendix E-2.) To the extent that the MPWSP cannot be operated without

unlawfully degrading these beneficial use resources in violation of the Basin

Plan, the Commission committed prejudicial legal error in approving the
project. Plainly the MPWSP cannot be so operated, due to the project
objective of exacerbating seawater intrusion. (Ibid.; see also RT, Vol. 14, p.

2369:5-7 [14APP224, p. A10356], Mr. Leffler testifying for Cal-Am (the

objective of the MPWSP is to "establish a direct connection between the

aquifer and the seawater").) Therefore, the Commission's decision must be

vacated or set aside.

Upon being apprised that the project would deliberately exacerbate
seawater intrusion in the project area aquifers, the Commission simply
adopted Cal-Am's assumption - as advanced by the project proponents'

105

HWG - that the affected aquifers were already so thoroughly seawater

intruded that the project's impacts on water quality and quantity would be
less than significant and therefore not inconsistent with the law, the
SWRCB's review, or the RWQCB's Basin Plan. However, Cal-Am's and

the FEIR's criteria for determining waters of potential beneficial use rested

upon an artificially stringent and legally unsupported TDS standard of 500

mg/L that applies to untreated drinking water and conflicts with the Basin

Plan's express adoption of the 3,000 mg/L standard set forth in SWRCB

Resolution 88-63. Rather than turning to the body with jurisdiction and

expertise to evaluate basin waters, the Commission failed to regularly pursue

its authority by determining that it would adopt Cal-Am's, and the FEIR's,
standard which conflicts with the Basin Plan. This legal error compounded

the other groundwater-related legal errors of the FEIR and D.18-09-017,

which led to the Commission's violations of the law and the California

Constitution as noted above, as well as its failure to carry out the obligation

to ensure that the MPWSP does not interfere with MCWD's operation of its

public water system. (Pub. Util. Code § 1001; see section III. B.2, infra.)19

As MCWD has pointed out previously (Dec. 15, 2017 Amended

19 As far as MCWD is aware, the Commission has not informed the SWRCB, as it is required to do by Water Code § 13146, of its reasons for failing to require the MPWSP to comply with SWRCB and RWQCB requirements to protect waters of up to 3,000 mg/L TDS, as suitable for potential beneficial
use.

106

Opening Brief, p. 25 [35APP447, p. A20526]), Water Code, section 106.3

made California the first state in the nation to codify the human right to water.
California law recognizes that "every human being has the right to safe,
clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption,

cooking, and sanitary purposes." (Water Code § 106.3.) The human right to

water extends to all Californians, including residents of Marina as well as the

residents of the more affluent Monterey Peninsula. Contrary to the statute,

its policy, and its spirit, approval of the MPWSP has unnecessarily put at risk

MCWD's public system and groundwater supply. Imposing this risk on
MCWD and the Marina and Ord communities it serves is a particularly

egregious and prejudicial legal error when viable and sufficient alternatives

to the proposed project exist, but were rejected without due consideration by

Cal-Am and the Commission.

3. The Commission's Decision is Contrary to SGMA's
Objectives.
Since the time this application was filed with the Commission,
significant applicable law has changed with the passage of California's
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, or SGMA. In addition to the

new sub-basin designation of critical overdraft, leaving no surplus available

for Cal-Am as a matter of law, SGMA raises an additional bar to the project.

SGMA prevents the use of new extraction from a high-priority basin or sub-
basin, such as the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin, after Jan. 1, 2015, as

107

evidence of any claim of prescriptive water rights. (Water Code

§ 10720.5(a).)

SGMA, with additions to California's Water Code, requires

sustainable, local management of groundwater resources. (Water Code

113.) Harm to the aquifers in the project area and potentially to the nearby

municipal supply wells of MCWD would impermissibly conflict with the

state's new legal framework for achieving sustainability in groundwater

management through local authority under SGMA. (Water Code § 10721.)
SGMA vests the preservation and protection of groundwater resources in

local authorities, by requiring basin and sub-basin management plans to be

implemented by local "groundwater sustainability agencies" or GSAs. (Ibid.

see Ex. MCD-36A, pp. 19-21 (Mr. Van Der Maaten for MCWD, testifying

as to MCWD's GSA role) [25APP405, pp. A18467-69].) GSAs are

obligated to formulate their "groundwater sustainability plan" or GSP as
soon as January of 2020, setting forth a 20-year path to achieving

sustainability in groundwater use. (Water Code §§ 10721, 10727, 10727.2

see Water Code §§ 10720-10737.8.) All state agencies are to consider the

policies of SGMA in issuing their orders or determinations. (Water Code §

10720.9.)

By approving the MPWSP, the Commission has ignored and

contravened SGMA, setting Cal-Am on a collision course with the GSAs that

are responsible for preserving and protecting the project area sub-basins.

108

That is because the project will deliberately exacerbate seawater intrusion

(FEIR, § 8.2.3.4, p. 8.2-8; 4.4.5.2, pp. 4.4-64 - 4.4-96; Appendix E-2),

thereby further degrading the sub-basins in the project area rather than

working toward sustainability and balance. (See MCWD's April 19, 2018
Letter, Att. C., p. 2, 5-6 and Att. D, pp. 28-30 [42APP587, pp. A27782,
27785-86, 27824-26].) The Commission's decision in this regard was a

prejudicial legal error and a failure to regularly pursue its authority. Review
should be granted and, upon review, the decision should be vacated or set

aside.

4. The Project Will Violate Monterey County's Recent
Moratorium on Certain New Wells.
Neither D.18-09-017 nor the FEIR addresses Monterey County's
recent enactment of a moratorium on drilling new wells within the project

area to "address seawater intrusion" in the coastal areas of the SVGB, which

includes the project area aquifers, specifically the 180 Foot/180 FTE aquifer
in the coastal areas of the 180/400 Foot Aquifer Sub-basin and the Monterey
Sub-basin. (Monterey County Ordinance No. 5302, § 1.C.7 and Exs. A, B20

project area).) MCWD brought the moratorium to the Commission's

attention in its May 3, 2018 Reply Brief (at pp. 28-29 and fn. 8). (39APP516,

pp. A24638-39.)
Any claim that Cal-Am's slant wells could be excepted from the

moratorium is contradicted by the plain language of the County ordinance

that enacted the moratorium, which exempts a well only if it "supplies
potable water for the domestic needs" of a public supply system. (Monterey

County Ordinance No. 5302, § 3.G, emphasis added.) The MPWSP slant

wells, on the other hand, are intended to provide source water for

industrial/commercial use in desalination. (See Amended Application, App.

H (project description), at unnumbered p. 2 [14APP216, p. A10038]; see also
FEIR § 2.5.1, p. 2-23 [43APP588, pp. A28078].) The desalination plant, not
the wells, would later supply "potable water" for "domestic needs" or
injection. (Ibid.) The ordinance also begs the question of why an exception

would be required for "potable water" wells in the 180 Foot/180FTE aquifer

in and around the MPWSP project area if the aquifer were indeed fully

intruded with seawater as Cal-Am and the FEIR claim, and as D.18-09-017

assumed without question or peer review of the conflicting expert opinions

presented to the Commission, or the conduct of an evidentiary hearing on the
matter in any forum.

110

5. The Project, to the Extent it May Operate Lawfully But Will
Still Diminish or Degrade MCWD's Groundwater Supply
Sources, Will Work an Unconstitutional Taking of MCWD's
Water Rights Without Just Compensation.
The Commission's approval of a project that could ultimately harm or

destroy MCWD's water supply without just compensation also prejudicially

violates constitutional due process guarantees. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.;
Cal. Const., art. I, § 19.) While it is true that there is no property right in the
unreasonable use of water in California (Joslin v. Marin Municipal Water

District (1967) 67 Cal.2d 132, 140), it is also the case that the federal courts

have found takings of property and required just compensation when
withdrawal restrictions are placed on lawful users in California. (See Tulare
Lake Water Storage District v. United States (2001) 49 Fed. Cl. 313, 319
[environmental restrictions causing restricted surface withdrawals required
compensation]; Casitas Municipal Water District v. United States (Fed. Cir.
2008) 543 F.3d 1276, 1297 [same].) MCWD, as a public water agency
providing municipal supply for some 30,000 customers is currently making
reasonable and beneficial use of its existing right to pump from the aquifers

of the SVGB in order to provide a public water supply. (Cal. Const., art. X,

§ 2.) Impairment of such use would constitute a taking, as well as a waste,

and it would therefore entitle MCWD to just compensation. MCWD's

general manager has testified, without contradiction, that such compensation
could amount to $54 million per year in the case of total loss of MCWD's

111

SVGB groundwater supply. (Ex. MCD-36A, pp. 15-16 [25APP405, pp.

A18463-64].) Yet in issuing D18-09-017, the Commission utterly failed to
address and adequately provide for such circumstances. Cal-Am's witness

Mr. Cook testified upon cross-examination that no such cost estimates had

been provided to the Commission. (RT, Vol. 22, pp. 3836:24-3837:4

[23APP393, pp. A17081-82].)

B. D.18-09-017 Violates the Public Utilities Code.

Regulated utilities may only construct facilities that the Commission

found to be required by "the present or future public convenience and

necessity." (Pub. Util. Code § 1001.) Where a public agency complains that
a proposed public utility facility will interfere with its already-operating
system, after hearing the Commission may and should impose "just and

reasonable" conditions on the proposed facility. (Ibid.) Moreover, where a

public agency is capable of providing a needed water supply, the
Commission must give fair consideration to the public agency's proposal.
(Ventura County Waterworks v. Public Util. Com. (1964) 61 Cal.2d 462,

464-466, citing Pub. Util. Code § 1005.) Rates imposed to recover the cost

of any approved public utility facility must comply with the statutory

requirement that all utility rates be just and reasonable. (Pub. Util. Code §

451.) Yet D.18-09-017 approved a desalination facility that is not needed,

failed to condition the approval to avoid interference with MCWD's public

water system, failed to give fair consideration to public agency alternatives

112

that are apparently feasible and equally capable of providing even the grossly

inflated supply Cal-Am claims to need for its Monterey District, and the rates

that would result from construction and operation of the MPWSP would be

excessive instead of just and reasonable. Therefore, the decision must be

vacated or set aside, so that the Commission may comply with sections 451,
1001 and 1005 of the Public Utilities Code in considering the present and

future needs of Cal-Am's Monterey District customers.

1. The MPWSP is Not Required by the Present or Future Public
Convenience and Necessity.
It is axiomatic that an infeasible project cannot be "required" for any

legitimate purpose. Because the Commission failed to require proof of the
legal feasibility of the MPWSP's groundwater pumping proposal prior to
issuing a CPCN, the Commission failed to regularly pursue its authority and
violated the public convenience and necessity provisions of Public Utilities
Code section 1001. (Pub. Util. Code §§ 1001, 1757.1, subd. (b).) While it
is true, as discussed above, and as acknowledged by the Commission (FEIR,
§ 2.6, p. 2-32), that the Commission does not have lawful jurisdiction to make

groundwater rights determinations, the Commission does indeed have the

primary responsibility under law to ensure that ratepayers are not repeatedly
burdened with the unjust and unreasonable stranded costs of projects that are

abandoned or ultimately determined to be infeasible. (Pub. Util. Code

§ 451.) The Commission must ensure that the utilities it regulates are

113

permitted to carry out only lawful, feasible infrastructure projects that are
required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. (Pub.

Util. Code § 1001.) The Commission failed to do so here, in the first instance

by failing to follow the provisions of the California Constitution and other

laws regarding reasonable and beneficial use of groundwater, and then by
failing to ensure that Cal-Am would be able to lawfully carry out its proposed

project by seeking guidance from bodies that have the jurisdiction to

determine questions of groundwater harm, Basin Plan compliance and/or

water rights.
Moreover, as a practical matter, the MPWSP is simply not required
for the present or the future public convenience and necessity of Cal-Am's
Monterey District customers. (Pub. Util. Code § 1001.) As MCWD has

explained at length in briefing and in its comments on the Proposed Decision,

the 14,000 AFY demand assumptions of Cal-Am, largely adopted by the
Commission in D.18-09-017, are grossly inflated. What is more, new
legislation and Executive Orders have made water conservation a way of life
in California, rendering such a steep increase in demand highly unlikely.
(39APP531, pp. A25504, 25509.) For all of these reasons, the FEIR's supply

and demand analysis was deeply flawed, requiring revision and recirculation,

as discussed below in section III.C.

Undisputed record facts demonstrate that Cal-Am's supply

requirement has been steadily dropping (see numbered Petition allegations

114

63, 64, 87), and over the past four years it stabilized at 9,500 AFY. (Ex.
MCD-59 [15APP417, p. A18809]21.) Cal-Am's portfolio of lawful supply

sources will total 9,180 AFY prior to the current CDO deadline of December

31, 2021, nearly sufficient to meet its current demand without desalination.

With addition of a modest increment of additional supply from MCWD and

PWM, instead of the 7,167 AFY the MPWSP would produce, there would

still be a 26% surplus over the current demand level:

Available Supply Sources -2019/2020 Volume in AFY

Pure Water Monterey base 3,500

Carmel River legal limit 3,376

Seaside Basin adjudicated supply 1,474

Seaside 25-yr payback -700

ASR average 1,300

Sand City average 230

SUBTOTAL W/O MPWSP 9,180

PWM Expansion "Scenario B" 2,250

MCWD sale of portion of its PWM supply 550

POTENTIAL GRAND TOTAL 11,980

Excess of 9,500 AFY current demand 26%

21 See also https://www.watersupplyproject.org/system-delivery, last visited
Jan. 14, 2019 From 2015-2018, demand averaged 9,403 AFY. Ibid.

115

(RT, Vol. 29, pp. 5110-5111; see FEIR/EIS, p. 5.4-12 [9,880 AFY of
available supply, comprised of 3,500 AFY PWM, 3,376 AFY Carmel River,

1,474 AFY Seaside (before payback), 1,300 AFY average Carmel River

seasonally-stored ASR, 230 AFY Sand City desalination plant). In other

words, the Commission certificated a 7,167 AFY solution to what is, at most,

a 320 AFY problem.

The record shows that Cal Am's 30-year requirement is no more than

11,500 AFY, and with an operational surplus of approximately 10%, this

would come to no more than 12,650 AFY by 2048. But even assuming for

argument's sake that Cal-Am actually needed to secure a future supply of up

to 14,000 AFY within the 30-year lifetime of the project, as D.18-09-017

found, Cal-Am's available non-MPWSP supply sources can meet that
inflated level of demand. Assuming 14,000 AFY were actually required,
after the 25-year Seaside Basin payback period, the water supply portfolio

for Cal-Am's Monterey District could be comprised of the following sources:

Available Supply Sources - 2048 Volume in AFY

Pure Water Monterey base 3,500

PWM expansion scenario "C" 3,570

Carmel River legal limit 3,376

Seaside Basin adjudicated supply 1,474

ASR average 1,300

116

Sand City average 230

MCWD sale of portion of its PWM supply 550

GRAND TOTAL 14,000

Excess of 9,500 AFY current demand 47%

As the uncontested evidence clearly demonstrates, with available

public supply options, there is no supply shortage even if future demand rises
as high as 14,000 AFY in thirty years, which MCWD contends is unlikely to
be the case as there is no evidence to support a higher demand figure. (See

Ex, MCD-36A, pp. 6-9 [25APP405, pp. A18454-57J). As shown above, if
there is a future shortfall, it can readily be met by feasible public agency
alternatives. (Ventura County Waterworks v. Public Util. Com., supra, 61

Cal.2d at 464-466.)

Therefore, the MPWSP is not required by the present or future public
convenience and necessity. (Pub. Util. Code § 1001.) Accordingly, the

Commission committed prejudicial legal error and failed to regularly pursue

its authority in finding in D.18-09-017 that the MPWSP is required. (Ibid.)

The decision should be vacated or set aside.

2. The Commission Failed to Condition its Approval to Address
MCWD's Complaint of Interference.

The Commission failed to regularly pursue its authority in failing to
protect MCWD's public water system from the danger of harm or destruction
without imposing sufficient conditions to protect MCWD's groundwater.

117

(Pub. Util. Code § 1001.) All California citizens, including MCWD's
customers, have the right to safe, clean and affordable water. (Water Code
§ 106.3.) Here, the Commission erred in preferring and protecting the

interests of Cal-Am in corporate profits over the right of its own and

MCWD's customers to safe, clean and affordable water. (Ibid.; Pub. Util.

Code § 451.) The Commission's errors were premised on its insufficient

evaluation of groundwater baseline and impacts, as well as its

misapprehension of basic constitutional and legal precepts concerning water
rights and the requirement for reasonable and beneficial use of the waters of
the State, as set forth above. However, the MPWSP threatens grave harm to

groundwater in the project area, which is MCWD's sole source of drinking

water for its 30,000 customers in the Marina and Ord communities.

Accordingly, review must be granted, that the Court may address the

Commission's failure to modify the project or condition the CPCN it granted
so as to avoid interference with MCWD's system and groundwater supply.

The failure to do So in the first instance was prejudicial error. (Pub. Util.

Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).)

In addition, the Commission erred in approving the project without
addressing the infeasibility of Cal-Am utilizing MCWD's pipeline to wheel

desalinated water, due to insufficient firm capacity as against designated

priority uses. When Cal-Am's application for the MPWSP was modified in

2015, it eliminated plans for a new conveyance pipeline along a coastal route

118

and designated an existing pipeline which belongs to MCWD - as the

means of conveying desalinated water from the proposed plant location in

Marina to Cal-Am's service territory. (Amended Appl., Amended App. B
(see pipeline gap on new facilities map) [14APP216, p. A10031].) The

routing of the pipeline rests on Cal-Am's assumption that firm,

uninterruptible capacity for MPWSP product water is available in MCWD's

pipeline. However, MCWD's general manager has testified that there is

likely insufficient firm capacity available in the existing MCWD-owned

pipeline to permit Cal-Am to use that pipeline to pump MPWSP product
water along General Jim Moore Boulevard between Coe and Hilby Avenue
in Seaside, as it apparently intends to do. (See MCWD Apr. 9, 2018 Opening

Brief, p. 43 [37APP497, p. A22722]; Ex. MCD-36A, Mr. Van Der Maaten

for MCWD, pp. 16-17 [25APP405, pp. A18464-65].)
The pipeline is represented in the gap on the facilities map of the
Amended Project Facilities appendix to the Amended Application.• It is

described as "existing pipeline" in the Amended Project Description.
(Amended Appl., Amended App. H, at unnumbered p. 6 [14APP216, p.
A10031].) Cal-Am's decision to re-route the desalinated product water

pipeline in its Amended Application to utilize MCWD's pipeline renders the

project as approved infeasible because the capacity of the existing pipeline
does not appear to be sufficient to serve all of the existing higher-priority

uses while simultaneously providing firm, uninterruptable capacity for

119

MPWSP product water, and there is not likely sufficient room in the right-

of-way to install a parallel pipeline dedicated to desalinated product water.
(See Ex. MCD-36A, pp. 16:24-17:11 [25APP405, p. A18464-65].) MCWD
identified this problem as a potential cost and environmental issue in its
testimony prior to and during the evidentiary hearings. (Ibid.) No party
elected to cross-examine Mr. Van Der Maaten on the issue, and therefore

MCWD's evidence of interference on this issue is uncontroverted.22 Yet the

Commission approved the project without change or condition regarding the

pipeline. Here, "conflicting inferences may not reasonably be drawn" from

Mr. Van Der Maaten's undisputed sworn testimony, and the matter therefore

presents a "question[] of law" for the Court's resolution. (Pacific Tel. & Tel.
Co. v. Public Util. Com., supra, 62 Cal.2d at 647.)
While the FEIR does provide a response to MCWD's CEQA

comment regarding the pipeline capacity issue (FEIR § 8.5.2, p. 8.5-662,

response MCWD comment no. 26), the comment response does not resolve
the capacity issue, and neither the FEIR nor D.18-09-017 discloses the
ongoing dispute over necessary transport of supplies of higher-priority than

22 Cal-Am's witness, Mr. Cook, acknowledged that Cal-Am was still working with MCWD on the question of whether sufficient capacity would be available in this pipeline to serve the MPWSP, in his written testimony and upon cross-examination, and he indicated no knowledge of whether the Commission had been informed of the issue. (See RT, Vol. 22, pp 3821:13- 3822:17 [23APP393, pp. A A17066-67].)

120

desalinated MPWSP water. Under CEQA, an agency's failure to respond
"with specificity" to comments and objections renders an environmental
document "fatally defective." (People v. County of Kern (1976) 39
Cal.App.3d 761, 842.) The FEIR response fell far short of this requirement,

and D.18-09-017 appears to completely ignore the issue. (See D.18-09-017,

p. 185 at FOF 143 (finding, contrary to the amended application and actual

circumstances, that facilities to be constructed pursuant to the CPCN granted
in D.18-09-017 by Cal-Am "will provide the infrastructure to serve its

customers with the desalinated water.").)
There remains serious doubt as to whether MCWD's pipeline can
provide sufficient firm wheeling capacity to deliver up to 6.4 MGD of
desalinated water to the Monterey Peninsula, as Cal-Am would require for
operation of the MPWSP. Indeed, subsequent efforts at reaching a better

understanding between the parties and potentially resolving the dispute have

revealed additional technical issues. For example, MCWD informed the
Commission it believes Cal-Am would likely need to install significant

booster pump facilities to match the pipeline's existing hydraulic gradient.

(MCWD's application for rehearing, p. 40 [82APP592, p. A44220].) In
addition, water quality issues could well arise from mixing the different

sources of water entering the pipe, which would also require resolution and

could have significant cost impacts. (Ibid.)

Taking into account information provided by Cal-Am in 2017 as

121

referenced in the FEIR comment response, MCWD's engineers have

nonetheless concluded - consistent with Mr. Van Der Maaten's earlier

testimony - that the existing pipeline right of way is not suitable for

construction of an additional or parallel pipeline. (Ibid.) This circumstance

would appear to necessitate Cal-Am installing a new segment of pipeline

along a new route, necessitating the conduct of appropriate additional
environmental review and an updated cost analysis. Accordingly, such
additional environmental review and updated cost analysis would impact the

Commission's weighing of the public convenience and necessity and further

bear upon project feasibility, particularly depending upon the unknown

availability of an alternate pipeline route. The pipeline capacity issue

remains a serious, potentially fatal, impediment to the feasibility of the

project as proposed and approved. Thus, the Commission committed

prejudicial legal error in approving the MPWSP as described in the Amended

Application without addressing or requiring Cal-Am to resolve this project

feasibility issue, which would also interfere with MCWD's existing public
system. (Pub. Util. Code 1001.)

3. The Commission Failed to Give Fair Consideration to Public
Agency Alternatives.

The Commission's failure to fully evaluate alternatives violates the

Public Utilities Code as well as CEQA, in an egregious and prejudicially

erroneous deviation from the regular pursuit of its authority. (Pub. Util. Code

122

§ 1757.1, subd. (b).) In particular, where a public agency - a such as M1W

and WMD or MCWD here proposes an alternative project that is capable
of providing commensurate or superior service to ratepayers, the public

alternative must be afforded a fair hearing. (Ventura County Waterworks v.

Public Util. Com., supra, 61 Cal.2d at 464-66 [Commission decision
annulled for failure to provide fair hearing on public agency's proposal].) As
with Ventura County Waterworks, a fair hearing was not afforded here.
Indeed, the motions of multiple parties for an evidentiary hearing on such
alternatives was denied by the Commission. (35APP465, pp. A21223-

21242; 35APP524, pp. A25206-71.)
In the Ventura County Waterworks case, the Court granted a public
water agency's petition for a writ of review. (Id. at 463-464.) The public

agency contended that the Commission was wrong to exclude the agency's
evidence and overrule its protest to a regulated utility's application for a

CPCN to extend its service area to as-yet undeveloped property not served

by any water supplier. (Id. at 463.) The public district was not afforded an

opportunity to prove that it could serve the same as-yet-unserved area with
better and more economical service. (Ibid.) In resolving the writ of review,
the Court noted that when the Commission has not regularly pursued its
authority, "its order will be annulled." (Id. at 464.) When exclusion of
evidence results in an unfair hearing, the result is a failure of the Commission

to regularly pursue its authority. (Ibid.)

123

Here, although the parti‹ requested further evidentiary hearings on

public alternatives (Jan. 9, 2018 motion; May 11, 2018 motion [35APP465,

pp. A21223-42; 35APP524, pp. A25206-71]), including M1W's specific
offer of a comprehensive update on its progress toward the development of
PWM expansion, utilizing the nine criteria employed by the Commission in
approving Cal-Am's initial increment of PWM purchase in D.16-09-021, the

Commission unreasonably cut off discussion of the expansion proposal.

Instead, it unreasonably and unnecessarily rushed the CPCN proceeding

toward an outcome that would provide Cal-Am with more profit, by

authorizing unnecessary MPWSP infrastructure to include in rate base, over

consideration of public options that would be less costly for Cal-Am's
ratepayers and still provide more than enough supply for present and future
customers. The public options - PWM expansion and/or long-term MCWD

sales - would also be available sooner and with far fewer environmental

impacts. (See MCWD Opening and Reply Briefs, 34APP438, p. A20503;

36APP461, p. A21679; 37APP497, p. A22682; 39APP516, p. A24614.)

By failing to carry out its obligation to give public agency alternatives

a fair hearing, particularly over the protest of multiple parties, the

Commission committed prejudicial legal error and failed to regularly pursue

its authority and comply with the law. (Pub. Util. Code §§ 1001, 1005,

1757.1, subd. (b); Ventura County Waterworks v. Public Util. Com., supra,

61 Cal.2d at 464-66 [fair hearing was required on public agency's proposal

124

to supply water].) Accordingly, rehearing must be granted, D.18-09-017

must be set aside or vacated and the Commission must give fair consideration
to the alternative proposals of the public agencies, as required by law.
The Legislature has indicated that where feasible in the coastal zone,
adequately treated recycled water should "be made available to supplement
existing surface and underground supplies." (Water Code § 13142.5, subd.
(e)(1).) This is precisely the policy behind the public benefit that the PWM
project will soon provide, pursuant to Commission approval in D.16-09-021,

by supplying 3,500 AFY of advanced-treated recycled water for Cal-Am's
use to serve its Monterey District. (D.16-09-021, pp. 2, 54 [19APP315, pp.
A14155, 14207.) Here, were Cal-Am and the Commission to heed the
Legislature's directive concerning use of recycled water in the coastal zone,
a first priority would be to fully explore the possibility of purchasing
additional recycled PWM water, either from an expanded project as proposed
by M1W and WMD or by utilizing MCWD's offer for a long-term sale of its

unneeded portion of PWM supply or both.

In addition, the MPWSP does not comply with Monterey County's

requirement for public ownership of desalination facilities. In D.12-10-030,

as modified by D.13-07-048, the Commission determined, albeit in an

advisory opinion rendered before any actual conflict or ripe controversy had

arisen, that it could lawfully preempt a Monterey County ordinance that
requires desalination facilities to be publicly-owned. (See Monterey County

125

Code of Ordinances, Title 10, Chapter 10.72 § 10.72.030(b).) D.18-09-017
notes and adopts the Commission's prior preemption decision at Conclusion

of Law 62. However, particularly with SGMA's mandate for local control

of groundwater regulation and sustainability efforts, the Court should find

the Commission's admittedly advisory opinion to be moot or invalid as

applied to current circumstances.23 The Commission cannot properly
preempt the ordinance's public ownership mandate without disrupting the
efforts of MCWD and others to carry out SGMA's directives. (Water Code

§ 10720.9; see Orange County Air Pollution Control Dist. V. Public Util.

Com. (1971) 4 Cal.3d 945, 954 [no Commission preemption where both

Commission and local air pollution control district, through statewide

program, had jurisdiction; grant of CPCN annulled for failure to comply with
local air pollution regulations].) Due to the change in the legal framework,

the Commission prejudicially erred in failing to re-evaluate and, upon

reconsideration, reject its previous advisory conclusion that it could lawfully
preempt the subject ordinance.

4. The Costs of the MPWSP are not Just and Reasonable.
As MCWD has briefed in detail, projected costs for the MPWSP

23 MCWD also maintains that the advisory opinion could never be of any
force or effect unless there were an actual controversy with a properly- certificated and necessary privately-owned desalination project proposed by an investor owned, regulated utility.

126

cannot be considered just and reasonable, particularly in light of evidence

that i) Monterey District ratepayers already pay the highest rates in the nation

for residential water supply (See MCWD's Comments on Proposed Decision,

p. 25 [82APP591, p. A44170], citing Ex. PWN-1; MCWD's Application for
Rehearing, pp. 46-47 [82APP592, pp. A44226-27], citing Exs. PWN-2,

PWN-4 [Food & Water Watch analyses]) and ii) Cal-Am's costs could

skyrocket if it turns out that its groundwater baseline assumptions are

cop inaccurate (see § I.C of MCWD's application for rehearing, 82APP592, pp

A44194-99), increasing its assumed return water obligations. (See also
MCWD Dec. 15, 2017 Opening Brief, p. 18 [35APP447, p. A21054, and
record references therein].) According to MCWD's calculations, based on

the testimony of Cal-Am witnesses, the all-in cost per acre-foot of MPWSP

water delivered to the Monterey Peninsula could be an unprecedented

$13,000 per acre-foot, or higher if there are further errors in Cal-Am's return

water assumptions. (Ibid.) Indeed, depending on the amount of return water

ultimately shown to be required, virtually all of the product water produced
by the project could be required to be returned to the SVGB, with little or no

product water available to serve customers on the Monterey Peninsula. (Ibid.

and record references there cited.)

Cal-Am's own witnesses, including its Director of Rates in 2017, Mr.

Linam, testified that the cost per acre-foot of MPWSP desalinated water to

its ratepayers will be between $4,300 and $4,500. (25APP403, p., A18108;

127

see also id. at, e.g., p. A18065.) In contrast, M1W's PWM project will
deliver potable water to Cal-Am beginning at a cost of $1,720 per acre-foot.

(19APP315, p. A14234.) MCWD has offered evidence that it could sell

potable water at a significantly lower price than the cost of MPWSP
desalinated water. MCWD has offered evidence that it could sell a portion
of its unneeded PWM allocation for use in Cal-Am's service territory at a
price of $2,200 per acre-foot. (24APP399, p. A17784.) MCWD has offered
evidence that it could sell a portion of its conserved groundwater for uses as

permitted under the Agency Act at a price of $2,872, commensurate with the

Seaside Groundwater Basin Watermaster's effective Over Production

Replenishment Assessment Rate. (25APP400, p. A17961.)

Documents apparently submitted to the Commission by Cal-Am and

recently obtained by MCWD through the Commission's ongoing response to

MCWD's Public Records Act24 request 17-369 reveal Cal-Am's own
conservative projections for an unjust and unreasonable projected doubling
of rates for residential ratepayers in the lowest-use tiers. After

implementation of initial costs for the MPWSP and based on only 37 gallons

of water consumed per person per day, instead of their already-steep

September 2017 bill of $77.39 these lowest tier ratepayers would pay

between $135 and $145 per month by 2022. (82APP615, pp. A44879-85.)

24 Gov. Code §§ 6250 6276.48.

128

Even more troubling, based on Cal-Am's representation that its average

single-family household customers typically require 44,000 gallons per year,

or 121 gallons per day, monthly bills for customers with such higher, but still

modest levels of consumption could easily rise from a present level of $256

(assuming the same usage tier as the 37-gallon-per-day customer, though the

price could be higher) to double that amount by 2022, resulting in a water

bill of more than $500 per month. (37 = 30% of 121; $77 / .30 = $256; $256

x 2 = $512.)

Doubling costs to water users in order to build an unnecessary project
cannot be found just and reasonable. (Pub. Util. Code § 451.) The Court
must grant review. MCWD submits that carrying out the MPWSP and

requiring Cal-Am's ratepayers to bear the potential costs of just

compensation for damage or destruction of MCWD's water supply would
run afoul of the requirement that utility rates be just and reasonable. (Pub.

Util. Code § 451.) While D.18-09-017 provided a modest increment of

ratepayer protections, in comparison to the Commission's Proposed
Decision, the final decision did not go far enough, because it approved the
project and left Cal-Am's ratepayers unreasonably exposed to the
unnecessary, wasted or stranded costs of a project that is not required and

unnecessarily endangers a neighboring public agency's municipal water

supply. (See WMD Sept. 4, 2018 PD Comments, pp. 6-8 [40APP559, pp.

A26854-56.)

129

C. The Commission's Decision Violates CEQA.

1. The Commission unlawfully approved the project based on an
improper project description and without considering a reasonable
range of potentially feasible alternatives, ignoring feasible
alternatives proposed by sister and responsible agencies and public
interest groups that would avoid or substantially reduce the
MPWSP's environmental impacts.
Under CEQA's "substantive mandate," agencies are prohibited from

approving projects if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures

available that would lessen the project's significant environmental impacts.

(§ 2100225: Guidelines, § 15092; Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and

Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) To enable agencies to

achieve this mandate, CEQA requires an EIR to "describe a range of

reasonable alternatives to the project .. . which would feasibly attain most of
the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any

of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits

of the alternatives." (Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (a).) Notably, an EIR may

not exclude a potentially feasible alternative from detailed consideration

merely because it "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project

objectives." (Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (b).) Similarly, the "applicant's

feeling about an alternative cannot substitute for the required facts and

independent reasoning" regarding the feasibility of alternatives.

25 Subsequent statutory references herein are to the Public Resources Code, unless otherwise specified.

130

(Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th
1336, 1356.) A contrary result would allow an applicant's desires, as
occurred here, to provide the basis for rejecting feasible alternatives.
Here, the Commission's consideration of alternatives was tainted by
numerous errors, starting with the improper identification of the "proposed
project" from which the "alternatives" were later derived. The problem only
got worse from there. As discussed below, the EIR's alternatives analysis
violated CEQA. Unless review is granted, the massively oversized MPWSP
will move forward in violation of CEQA's most fundamental requirement,

despite the fact there are feasible alternatives that would avoid or lessen the

project's significant and unavoidable environmental impacts.

a. The FEIR misidentified the "proposed project, which
precluded the Commission from identifying and analyzing alternatives that would reduce or avoid impacts.
The "proposed project" identified and analyzed in the EIR was not the

actual project that the Commission was considering for approval. Cal-Am's
initial project application included a variant (the "MPWSP Variant")

consisting of a 6.4 MGD rated capacity plant a combined with a water purchase

agreement for 3,500 AFY of potable, advanced-treated recycled water from

M1W from its PWM, project. (April 2015 Draft EIR ("DEIR"), p. 3-4.) This

proposal was developed to meet all of Cal-Am's purported water demand as

well as all of Cal-Am's other project objectives. While the Commission was

preparing the revised EIR, the PWM project was approved - and the

131

Commission approved Cal-Am's proposed water purchase agreement with
MIW on September 22, 2016. (D.16-09-021, p. 19 [19APP315, A14172].)

As a result, the 6.4 MGD rated capacity plant, with the approved water

purchase agreement, should have been identified as the proposed project in

the EIR. When the Commission circulated its revised draft EIR in 2017

("RDEIR"), however, it removed the MPWSP Variant from the project

description entirely and improperly identified the 9.6 MGD capacity plant -

without the PWM project as the "proposed project." (See Final

Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement ("FEIR"),

§ 3, p. 3-9.)

MCWD, and others, commented on the incorrect project description.

(See e.g., FEIR, § 8.5, § pp. 8.5-230, 8.5-545 [see 43APP588, p. A27582 et
seq.].) The CPUC responded that despite Cal-Am having proposed a 6.4

MGD facility and despite the fact that the 9.6 MGD facility was unnecessary,

both options were proposed by Cal-Am in an "either/or" fashion. (FEIR,
§ 8.5, p. 8.5-650 [see 43APP588, p. A27582 et seq.].) The CPUC further

stated that "the larger [9.6 MGD] desalination plant was selected to be
analyzed as the 'Proposed Project' in [the EIR] since it is larger and thus was

expected to have greater impacts than the smaller capacity option." (Ibid.)

This was legal error as the "either/or" question was answered when the

CPUC approved the water purchase agreement prior to the release of the

RDEIR.

132

Given that the PWM project and water purchase agreement were

approved prior to the circulation of the RDEIR, CEQA required the EIR to

assume the PWM project would be built as approved. (See Berkeley Hillside

Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1119-1121 [EIR's

analysis must be based on "the proposed project as actually approved"].) In

failing to adhere to this requirement, the EIR gave conflicting signals about

the nature and scope of the project rendering the EIR "fundamentally

inadequate and misleading." (Washoe Meadows Community v. Department
of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277, 287.) The EIR left the
public and sister agencies guessing about what version of the project to
comment on and whether the already approved PWM project was somehow
no longer part of the project. This error was prejudicial, because "[o]nly

through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public

decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental
cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the

proposal (i.e., the 'no project' alternative) and weigh other alternatives in the
balance." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,

192-193.)

133

b. The FEIR failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives
by utilizing a strawman 9.6 MGD facility as the "proposed project" rather than the 6.4 MGD facility included in the Cal- Am's revised application, despite the fact that Commission
approval of the PWM Project rendered the initially proposed 9.6 MGD facility infeasible and unnecessary.
A "major function" of an EIR "is to ensure that all reasonable

alternatives to proposed projects are thoroughly assessed by the responsible

official.3 (Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 400, italics in original.) As
this Court has emphasized, the discussion of alternatives (and mitigation
measures) is the "core of an EIR," which itself is the "heart of CEQA."

(Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 937; In re Bay-Delta Programmatic

Environmental Impact Report Programmatic Proceedings (2008) 43 Cal.4th-__-

1143 ("In re Bay-Delta"), 1162.) Indeed, this Court has gone so far as to
declare that the consideration of alternatives is perhaps the "most important"

substantive policy in CEQA. I, (Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 400.)

Here, the identification and analysis of alternatives in the EIR was

predicated on the false premise that the 9.6 MGD desalination plant was the
"proposed project" (D.18-09-017, p. 78-80 [111APP1, pp. A182-841),

despite the fact that it was rendered infeasible and unnecessary after the

CPUC's approval of Cal-Am's purchase of water from the PWM project. As

a result, the only purported "reduced capacity" alternatives analyzed in the

EIR (Alternative 5a and 5b) are both 6.4 MGD facilities - the size of the

actual proposed project. Thus, contrary to CEQA's most important

134

substantive policy, the EIR did not analyze a reasonable range of alternatives

that would avoid or reduce impacts compared to Cal-Am's proposed 6.4
MGD facility. In other words, by only considering alternatives to the 9.6

MGD desalination plant, a the EIR set up a strawman alternatives analysis in
violation of CEQA. (See, e.g., North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura
(2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 669 [EIR violated CEQA by failing to

reconsider alternatives when original proposal was no longer feasible].)

Review, which only this Court can provide, is necessary to correct this
fundamental error and ensure a reasonable range of alternatives to Cal-Am's
proposed 6.4 MGD facility are considered before the CPUC approves the

MPWSP.26

C. The FEIR failed to evaluate potentially feasible reduced- capacity alternatives, based largely on an erroneous and unsupported supply and demand analysis.
Compounding this error, the EIR's identification of alternatives was

also improperly constrained due to its defective water supply and demand

26 This error also resulted in a misleading analysis of the no project alternative. (See, e.g., 8.5-156 - 8.5-160 [MCWD comments on DEIR].) As public agencies and numerous interested entities pointed out to the CPUC,
there are potentially feasible alternatives that could achieve all the project objectives, based on a reasonable supply and demand analysis, without the construction of a desalination facility. (See, e.g., Ibid.; MCWD Comments on FEIR/EIS, pp. 60-68 [39APP509, A24213-24221]; Opening Brief of City of Marina on FEIR/EIS, pp. 92-93, 17-23 [37APP498, A22898-22899, 22823-22829]; Surfrider Reply Brief, Jan. 9, 2018, pp. 1-21 [35APP458,
A21330-21350].)

135

analysis that is not supported by substantial evidence, which was used to

define the objectives and purpose and need for the project. As this Court has

explained, because the project objectives are crucial to the formulation and
evaluation of project alternatives, a lead agency may not give the project

objectives an artificially narrow definition such that the range of alternatives

to the proposed action is unduly constrained. (See In re Bay-Delta, supra,
43 Cal.4th at p. 1166.) But that is exactly what occurred here.
In describing the purpose of the demand and supply information, the

EIR acknowledged that "supply and demand are fundamentally tied to the

ability of the project to satisfy the project need and objectives" and "are

therefore important to fashioning the requisite range of feasible and

reasonable project alternatives." (FEIR, p. 8.2-100.) The supply and demand

analysis in the EIR, however, ignores the most recent (and most accurate)

data, which resulted in the EIR grossly overestimating future demand and

discounting available supply.

Specifically, the EIR improperly identified the water supply shortfall

or "need" for the project (in addition to Cal-Am's other legal supplies) as

10,750 AFY, which by itself exceeds Cal-Am's total water deliveries in

every year since 2013. (Ex. MCD-59 [25APP417, p. A18809]; see FEIR,

pp. 8.5-5.) With the project, Cal-Am would have a future water supply of

over 16,000 AFY, of which only about 9,500 AFY is required for its full

present demand. The remaining 6,500 AFY is for unspecified future uses,

136

which could potentially include sale of water at a profit. (Ibid.)
In reality, Cal-Am's "need" for new water is actually much less and
could be supplied entirely by other projects. As acknowledged in the EIR,
Cal-Am's annual service area demand declined consistently over a ten-year a
period from 14,176 AFY in 2006 to 9,545 AFY in 2015. (FEIR, pp. 8.5-11.)
This steady decline is the result of many factors including reduction of leaks

and adoption of permanent water conservation measures, and there is no

evidence that these annual declines will not continue in the future. (Ibid.) In
other words, the evidence shows that Cal-Am does not "need" anywhere near
10,750 AFY from the project or a total of over 16,000 AFY of water supply

when its total service area demand appears to have stabilized at 9,500 AFY.
(FEIR, pp. 8.5-12.) 27 Since by its own calculations, Cal-Am will receive at
least 7,800 and as much as 9,000 AFY of water from other sources by 2020,

its apparent true demand and need from the project - or other, alternative
water sources - to serve future demand is at most in the range of 3,000

AFY.28 (Ibid.) This error alone is sufficient to warrant review here.

27 As evidenced by the extensive comments and evidence submitted to the CPUC on this issue, numerous interested agencies and environmental groups all concur that there is no basis, much less a need, for even a 6.4 MGD
facility. (Opening Brief of Planning and Conservation League Foundation Addressing Final EIR/EIS [39APP524, A25208-25213]; Opening Brief of City of Marina on Final EIR/EIS [37APP498, A22807]; Surfrider
Foundation's Opening FEIR/FEIS Brief [38APP500, A23321]; comments on
PD [40APP556, A25784; 40APP557, A25808].)
28 This number assumes Cal-Am needs additional supplies to meet maximum
137

(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at 447 ['the FEIR's use of inconsistent supply
and demand figures, and its failure to explain how those figures match up,

results in a lack of substantial evidence*].)29

Nonetheless, the CPUC refused to analyze any alternatives that did
not meet all of Cal-Am's stated project objectives of fully supplying Cal-
Am's unsupportable 14,000 AFY demand estimates, rendering the EIR

legally inadequate. (Guidelines, § 15126.6, subds. (a), [EIRs must consider

alternatives that meet "most of the basic objectives of the project and avoid

or substantially lessen any of the significant effects"], (b).)

Because the EIR improperly relied on Cal-Am's bloated future

demand estimates, and failed to consider all available supplies, the EIR
rejected potentially feasible alternatives that would satisfy most- if not all -
of the project's objectives. In fact, as explained below, there is at least one

potentially feasible, and most likely actually feasible, alternative that the
CPUC ordered the applicant to evaluate after its project approval - and

daily demand, which Cal-Am has admitted is not necessary. (RT, Vol. 13, at 2093:1-2094:6 (Cal-Am, Mr. Svindland) [8APP117, A7346-7347]; see also Surfrider Foundation and LandWatch Monterey County's Comments on Proposed Decision, p. 12-14 [explaining same] [41APP568, A26279-
26281]].
29 The FEIR's sole concession to parties' comments regarding inflated demand, Appendix L, erroneously and misleadingly omitted entirely the
already-approved 3,500 AFY PWM purchase from its supply analysis,
resulting in an artificially low total of available non-MPWSP supply sources.
(FEIR, App. L, pp. L-3, L-4 and Tables X-6 through X-16.)

138

outside the public review process further violating CEQA's requirements.
d. The Commission violated CEQA by ordering the project applicant to evaluate a potentially feasible alternalive that would significantly lessen - if not avoid entirely the
MPWSP's significant and unavoidable impacts, after project approval and outside of the CEQA process.
In investigating alternatives, the CPUC requested that M1 W provide
information regarding the potential expansion of the approved PWM project.
In response, M1W submitted three potential alternatives to expand the PWM
project and produce substantially more than 3,500 acre feet of purified

recycled water annually for Cal-Am's Monterey District service area. (FEIR,

p. 8.2-108; Ex. PCL-7 [16APP268, p. A11979].) The FEIR, however,
refused to evaluate the alternatives, labelling them "speculative" because
MIW did not have plans to expand without a request from Cal-Am. (Ibid.)

The EIR's failure to evaluate these potential alternatives violated CEQA.

The PWM project has already committed to deliver 3,500 AFY of

water to Cal-Am and can deliver an additional 2,250 AFY, or more, through

a relatively simple expansion, which would provide sufficient water to meet

the Monterey District's future demand. Because expansion of the PWM

project is at least potentially feasible and would reduce, at minimum, the

projects' impact on groundwater, ESHA, energy, and GHGs, the CPUC was
required to analyze the alternative before approving the MPWSP. (See
Guidelines, § 15088.5.) In light of the EIR's failure to fully investigate this

alternative, the CPUC determined the evidence in the record "is not sufficient

139

to convince us that PWM expansion is a viable alternative at this point."

(D.18-09-017, p. 42, italics added [11APP1, p. A146].) Remarkably,

however, the CPUC not only declined the multiple requests of interested

parties and responsible agencies for further investigation of the alternative,30

it ordered Cal-Am to evaluate the alternative in the future, after the CPUC

already approved the project. (Ibid., p. 43 [11APP1, p. A147].) The

Commission's directive is the antithesis of what CEQA requires.

CEQA does not permit an agency to delegate the investigation of

potentially feasible alternatives to project proponents; rather, the agency

"must independently participate, review, analyze and discuss the alternative

in good faith." (Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of Inyo (2007) 157

Cal.App.4th 1437, 1460.) Nor does the EIR's labelling of the alternatives as

"speculative" relieve the CPUC of its obligations to investigate the

alternative in light of the substantial evidence provided by MIW that

expansion was feasible. (Exhibit PCA-7 [15APP225, p. A10474, et seq.];

Phase 3 Motion, Attachment A ("Progress Report on Pure Water Monterey

Expansion" prepared by Monterey One Water (May 10, 2018) [39APP524,

30 See, e.g., Motion of Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency, California Unions for Reliable Energy, Citizens for Just Water, City of Marina, Landwatch Monterey County, Marina Coast Water District, Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, Planning and Conservation League, Public Trust Alliance, Public Water Now, Sierra Club, and Surfrider Foundation asking the Commission to Open a Phase 3 to examine feasible
alternative in this proceeding, May 11, 2018. [39APP524, A25208].)

140

p. A25222]; M1W testimony [15APP225, p. A10474].) "The EIR 'is

required to make an in-depth discussion of those alternatives identified as at

least potentially feasible.™" (Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose,

supra, 141 Cal.App.4th at 1354, italics added.)

In failing to evaluate the PWM expansion in the FEIR, the CPUC

failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA. (Banning Ranch, supra,

2 Cal.5th at pp. 935-936, citing Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at 435; Laurel

Heights 1, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 403 [failure provide "meaningful

information regarding alternatives" was a failure to proceed as required by

CEQA].) This is especially true here, where the City of Marina called for

such evaluation because PWM expansion would substantially lessen, if not

completely avoid, impacts on ESHA. (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at

936-937.)

e. The FEIR failed to analyze potentially feasible alternative
intake technologies, including Horizontal Directional Drilling that would avoid or reduce ESHA and groundwater impacts.
Even if a desalination component were necessary to meet any of Cal-
Am's actual demand, which the record does not support, there are several
alternative subsurface intake technologies that are at least potentially feasible

and would avoid or reduce the MPWSP's significant impacts that were

improperly dismissed from consideration. (See FEIR, pp. 8 8.5-418-8.5-

438.)

141

Most notably, the RDEIR dismissed the use of Horizontal Directional
Drilling (HDD) without citation to a single reference material. (See FEIR,

Appendix I1, p. I1-5.) In response to comments, the FEIR stated that HDD
Wells are infeasible as an intake technology and would not avoid or minimize

any of the impacts associated with the MPWSP. (FEIR 8.5-418 - 8.5-438.)

The response, however, is not supported by any evidence, much less
substantial evidence. First, there is ample substantial evidence proving that
HDD technology is at least potentially feasible. (See FEIR, pp. 8.5-418-8.5-

438; 8.5-231-8.5-235; MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. E.)3' Second, it

is undeniable that HDD wells would avoid or substantially lessen

environmental impacts compared to the project. (See FEIR, pp. 8 8.5-431-

8.5-432; 8.5-231-8.5-235; MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. E., p. 7
a [42APP587, p. A27851].) As a result, HDD wells could completely avoid
impacts to ESHA, which are deemed significant and unavoidable in the EIR.
(Ibid.) There is also abundant evidence that HDD wells would lessen or

avoid impacts to groundwater. (See FEIR, pp. 8.5-431-8.5-432; 8.5-231-8.5-

235; MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. E., p. 7 [42APP587, p. A27851].)

31 In fact, unlike the project' proposed experimental slant wells, there are
multiple HDD wells currently in use. (Ibid.) Instead of independently investigating this option, the bulk of the FEIR's response simply repeated, almost verbatim, from an outdated study for a different project. Notably, that
study concluded that the same slant wells that will be used for the MPWSP
were infeasible and unproven technology. (See MCWD's April 19, 2018
Letter, Att. E., p. 4 [42APP587, A27848].)

142

In short, the Commission's failure to meaningfully evaluate HDD as

an alternative or provide meaningful responses to expert comments regarding
HDD violated CEQA. (See Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 941 ["Rather
than sweep disagreements under the rug, the [agency] must fairly present

them in its EIR."].)

f. The FEIR's conclusion that Alternative 5a was the
environmentally superior alternative is not supported by substantial evidence.

In light of the multitude of significant errors in the EIR's alternatives
analysis, the EIR's conclusion that that Alternative 5a is the environmentally
superior alternative is unsupportable. CEQA does not permit a lead agency
to omit "alternatives that feasibly might reduce the environmental impact of
project on the unanalyzed theory that such an alternative might not prove
to be environmentally superior to the project. The purpose of an EIR is to

provide the facts and analysis that would support such a conclusion so that

the decision maker can evaluate whether it is correct." (Habitat & Watershed

Caretakers (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1305.) Unless review is granted
here, the MPWSP will move forward despite the fact there are

environmentally superior alternatives that the Commission failed to consider,

in violation of CEQA's most fundamental requirement. (Ibid.; Laurel

Heights I, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 400.)

143

2. The Commission failed to integrate its review of impacts to ESHA
with other procedures required by responsible agencies, which
renders the FEIR's analysis of alternatives unusable for
responsible agencies' future decisions.

As this Court recently held in Banning Ranch, supra, "CEQA sets out

a fundamental policy requiring local agencies to 'integrate the requirements

of this division with planning and environmental review procedures

otherwise required by law or by local practice So that all those procedures, to
the maximum feasible extent, run concurrently, rather than consecutively."

(2 Cal.5th at p. 936, quoting Pub. Resources Code § 21003, subd. (a).) That

did not happen here.

ESHA.- or "primary habitat" under the City's LCP - are "rare or

especially valuable" habitat areas that "must be 'protected against any

significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those

resources shall be allowed within those areas.'» (Banning Ranch, supra, 2

Cal.5th at 936, citing § 30240, subd. (a), italics added.) As this Court declared

in Banning Ranch, given this strict prohibition, "the regulatory limitations

imposed by the Coastal Act's ESHA provisions should [be] central to [an]

EIR's analysis of feasible alternatives." (Id. at 937.) Despite acknowledging

the existence of ESHA on the project site, the CPUC failed to follow this

Court's direction.

The EIR acknowledges, as it must, that the MPWSP's slant wells are

sited directly in ESHA and that the project is not a resource dependent use.

144

(FEIR, pp. 4.6-197, 4.6-235.) But the EIR failed entirely to address the
MPWSP's feasibility in light of the Coastal Act's ESHA protections and
failed to consider alternatives that would avoid impacts to ESHA (such as
expansion of the PWM project or HDD). In an attempt to justify this fatal
error, the CPUC stated its belief that the conflicts are not a feasibility issue a
because the Coastal Commission had previously determined that a test slant
well on the project site did not violate the Coastal Act's policy pertaining to

ESHA. (FEIR, Appendix C, p. C-67.) This response is not accurate and

misled the public and decision-makers. What the Coastal Commission
actually determined was that it could exercise its discretion to approve the

test well despite its inconsistencies with the City's LCP. (California Coastal

Commission ("CCC") Final Findings, November 12, 2014, p. 58.) In fact,
the Coastal Commission informed the CPUC that the types of development

allowed in ESHA are "extremely limited" and recommended that the CPUC

"thoroughly evaluate and consider" alternatives that comply with the Coastal
Act's ESHA restrictions, which never occurred. (Compare FEIR, pp. 8.4-3 -
8.4-4 [CCC Comments on DEIR] with FEIR, pp. 8.4-25 [CPUC Response].)
Critically, this error also resulted in the CPUC failing to fulfill its

obligation to integrate its environmental review with the City of Marina. (See

Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 936.) As the responsible agency for

issuance of the Coastal Development Permit (CDP") for the portions of the

Project within the City's Coastal Zone, the City--not the CPUC-will have

145

the authority to interpret its LCP. (See City of Marina Opening Brief, p. 1

[34APP440, p. A20598]; City of Marina Opening Comments on PD, pp. 13-
15 [40APP565, p. A26036-38].) As such, CEQA required the CPUC to

coordinate its environmental review with the City during the environmental

review process to ensure the City's concerns regarding ESHA impacts would

be adequately analyzed in the EIR. It did not. 32

The EIR's discussion regarding plan inconsistency and land use

impacts, particularly those related to ESHA, does not satisfy CEQA for

additional reasons. (See FEIR, pp., 8.5-217- 8.5-218.) Foremost, the EIR's

conclusion that impacts to ESHA would be less than significant with the

implementation of mitigation measures is not supported by substantial

evidence, and in fact is entirely unsupportable. (See FEIR, pp. 8.5-398-8.5-

699; see also Bolsa Chica Land Trust V. Superior Court (1999) 71

Cal.App.4th 493, 506-507 [the only permissible mitigation of Project
impacts to ESHA, even if degraded, is preservation and complete avoidance],

overruled in part on other grounds in Dhillon V. John Muir Health (2017) 2

Cal.5th 1109, 1116.) Instead, ignoring this Court's direction in Banning

32 The FEIR suggest this is not the case pointing to the City's involvement in the public comments process and the City's status as a party. (See Responses to Comments Received After Publication of MPWSP FEIR/EIS, p. 1-2.) The response, however, fails to identify any efforts the CPUC made to integrate the City's environmental review requirements or any efforts the CPUC made
to address the City's concerns. (Ibid.)

146

Ranch, the CPUC adopted a mitigation measure requiring Cal-Am

coordinate with the City after Cal-Am applies for permits. (See FEIR, p. 4.6-
207.) This was error.
As explained in Banning Ranch, the purpose of CEQA's "integrated
review" requirement is to ensure that the lead agency's CEQA process and
processes required by responsible agencies "run concurrently, rather than

consecutively.™ (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 936, citing Pub.

Resources Code § 21003, subd. (a).) In light of this requirement, this Court

expressly recognized that CEQA prohibits the exact type of deferral that
occurred here. (Id. at pp. 939-940 ["Such a delay is inconsistent with
CEQA's policy of integrated review."], citing Pub. Resources Code § 21003,

subd. (a).)

Further, there has not been any demonstration that the proposed
mitigation is feasible and would actually reduce ESHA impacts to a less than

significant level. As the City stated in its comments, the EIR failed to identify

appropriate mitigation to reduce habitat impacts to ESHA, which may not be

possible. (FEIR, p. 4.6-219.) The CPUC's assertion that the CEMEX site
could be restored at a future time because the CEMEX mining activities there

will stop does not solve this problem. (CCC, July 13, 2017, Consent

Settlement Agreement and Cease and Desist Order CCC-17-CD-02)33 This

33 See https://documents.coastal.ca.gov/reports/2017/7/th22/th22-7-2017-
147

approach would be invalid because full restoration of the CEMEX parcel is

already required by the settlement agreements entered into by Marina and

other agencies with CEMEX. (See City of Marina's First FEIR/EIS
Comments, Attachment to Appendix 3 [38APP508, p. A23829]; FEIR, p.
4.1-21.) Therefore, the EIR cannot "piggy-back" on the already-required

mitigation/restoration under the CEMEX settlement agreement. Importantly,

while the EIR acknowledges the closure and reclamation of CEMEX site in

its list of cumulative projects (FEIR, p. 4.1-21), the EIR fails to address

reclamation of the CEMEX site in its discussion of the Project's cumulative

impacts to ESHA. (FEIR, pp. 4.6-267 - 4.6-275.).

Finally, the CPUC violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EIR

after it added significant new information related to ESHA. The FEIR

acknowledges that the extent of ESHA was underrepresented in the RDEIR.

(FEIR, p. 8.5-698.) In response to comments, the FEIR states that the EIR

was revised to assume that all undeveloped areas within the Coastal Zone are

primary habitat (within the City of Marina's LCLUP jurisdiction) and ESHA
in all other jurisdictions. Remarkably, however, the FEIR suggests that this
revision does not warrant recirculation because the impact conclusions did
not change. (Ibid.) That is not the standard. Under CEQA, an EIR must be

recirculated for public review when "significant new information" is added

appendix.pdf (last visited Jan. 14, 2019).

148

after the draft has been circulated for public review. (§ 21092.1; Guidelines,

§ 15088.5, subd. (a)(2).) Here, the FEIR identifies additional ESHA that was

not disclosed in the RDEIR, but would be affected by the Project. With even
more ESHA identified in the FEIR, the MPWSP's impacts to ESHA are
substantially more severe than previously disclosed. As this Court recently

explained:

An EIR's designation of a particular adverse environmental
effect as 'significant' does not excuse the EIR's failure to
reasonably describe the nature and magnitude of the adverse effect. [Citations.] An adequate description of adverse environmental effects is necessary to inform the critical discussion of mitigation measures and project alternatives at the core of the EIR.

(Sierra Club v. County of Fresno, supra, 2018 Cal. LEXIS 9831, at *16-17,
quoting Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San Diego Assn. of
Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514-515, 2.) Under the plain language
of the Guidelines, recirculation was required to allow the public and other

agencies a meaningful opportunity to comment on the expanded ESHA

impacts and potential mitigation. (Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a)(2).)
In sum, the CPUC's decision to certify the FEIR fails to comply with

CEQA because it does not provide the necessary information to determine

whether the City's LCP findings which are more demanding than those

required under CEQA - can be made, particularly since the CPUC failed to
integrate its environmental review with the City of Marina's review process
and failed to consider feasible alternatives that would avoid impacts to

149

ESHA. Unless review is granted here, responsible agencies will be unable to

rely on the FEIR in making their decisions whether to approve the permits

necessary for the project.

3. The FEIR Failed to Disclose and Mitigate the MPWSP's
Significant Groundwater Impacts in Violation of CEQA.
In light of the fact that project area groundwater aquifers provide the

sole source of water that MCWD uses to serve the Marina/Ord community,

MCWD commented extensively throughout the environmental review

process - including technical reports from experts in the fields of

hydrogeology, geophysics, groundwater modeling, and subsurface intake

systems -- focusing on the MP.WSP's groundwater impacts. (See, e.g., FEIR,
§ 8.5.2, pp. 8.5-129-8.5-522.) MCWD and others explained that the

RDEIR's inaccurate description of baseline groundwater conditions - which

conflicted with the applicant's own monitoring data and its deeply flawed

analysis of groundwater impacts misled the public and Commissioners to

believe that the Project could not possibly harm, and would potentially

improve, groundwater that would be impacted by MPWSP pumping. (Ibid.)

The FEIR failed to correct these errors, and misled Commissioners
into concluding the MPWSP will improve groundwater conditions. (D. 18-
09-017, Appendix C, p. 74 [11APP1, p. A420.) The CPUC's decision itself

contains no discussion of groundwater impacts, but it asserts the MPWSP's
potentially significant groundwater impacts are less than significant with

150

mitigation as reflected in the FEIR. (D. 18-09-017, p. 75 [11APP1, p.

A179].) Thus, the CPUC's decision regarding the MPWSP's potential

groundwater impacts and mitigation is contingent on whether the EIR's

groundwater analysis complied with CEQA's information disclosure

requirement and whether the EIR's factual conclusions are supported by

substantial evidence. (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (Cal., Dec. 24, 2018,

No. S219783) 2018 Cal. LEXIS 9831, at *11-21; Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th

at 435; Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 942.) The FEIR fails on both

counts.

Most notably, the FEIR's assumption that the capture zone within

project area aquifers does not contain useable groundwater34, which provided
the basis for the EIR's significance conclusions, is not supported by
substantial evidence. This is not a routine dispute among experts. Cal-Am's

own monitoring data, as well as information submitted by MCWD and

others, including a geophysical imaging study, conclusively shows there is

indeed substantial groundwater in the project area that meets the applicable
Basin Plan standards for beneficial uses. (See, e.g. Ex. MCD-20, pp. 8-12

34 Pursuant to SWRCB Res. 88-63, water containing 3,000 mg/L total dissolved solids, or TDS, or less is to be considered potentially suitable for beneficial uses, thus the 500 mg/L TDS standard used in the FEIR is misleading and inapplicable. (See FEIR, pp. 8.5-306-308; Ex. MCD-60, p. 7 at § 2.2.1 (SWRCB Res. 88-63) [25APP418, A18827].) Such water in the
project area aquifers must be protected, not degraded further, as the MPWSP
would do.

151

[15APP237, pp. A11212-16]; Ex. MCD-55B, pp. 4-5, 6-8 [25APP415, p.

A18788]; MCWD's Apr. 19, 2018 Letter, pp. 2-5 and attachments thereto

[42APP587, pp. A27658-61]; see also MCWD's Apr. 27, 2018 FEIR

comments at, e.g., pp. 33-34 and attachment thereto.) Moreover, even if the

CPUC disagreed with the numerous experts who commented on this issue, it

could not ignore this contrary evidence. (See Banning Ranch, supra, 2

Cal.5th at 941 ["Rather than sweep disagreements under the rug, the [agency]

must fairly present them in its EIR.".)

The EIR's failure to utilize, or at minimum disclose, the best available

information regarding baseline groundwater conditions does not serve

CEQA's informational purpose, which mandates the "CEQA analysis
employ a realistic baseline that will give the public and decision makers the
most accurate picture practically possible of the project's likely impacts."

(Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority

(2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 447.) As this Court has explained, "[d]ecision makers

must, under the law, be presented with sufficient facts to "evaluate the pros

and cons of supplying the amount of water that the [project] will need.""

(Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 430-431, quoting Santiago County Water

Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 829.) Here, the FEIR

only presented the decision-makers with the "pros" of supplying water at the
project site, and, largely ignored comments from sister agencies and their
experts regarding the MPWSP's "cons" on groundwater resources.

152

In addition, the FEIR's conclusion that the MPWSP would improve

groundwater conditions, and thus have less than significant groundwater

impacts, is based not only on inaccurate assumptions regarding groundwater

conditions within the project area but also on inadequate modeling that is (1)
not calibrated to the available groundwater data, and (2) incapable of
evaluating cumulative groundwater impacts. (See, e.g., FEIR, MCWD's

comments at pp. 8.5-189-8.5-191, 8.5-253-8.5-258, 8.5-345-8.5-385, 8.5-

398-8.5-399.)

Finally, neither the proposed return water settlement nor the

project's groundwater mitigation will protect or replace a single molecule

of groundwater to the aquifers south of the Salinas River that would be

directly impacted by the project, aquifers that provide the recharge source
for MCWD's groundwater supplies. (See FEIR, MCWD comments at p.

8.5-440-511.)

a. The FEIR failed to analyze and disclose the volume of
groundwater in the Project area aquifers that would be
affected by the Project, including groundwater that meets the
Basin Plan standards for beneficial uses.
CEQA requires an EIR to "delineate environmental conditions

prevailing absent the project, defining a 'baseline' against which predicted

effects can be described and quantified." (Neighbors for Smart Rail v.

Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority, supra, 57 Cal.4th at 447;

Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (c), 15126.2, subd. (a).) Without an adequate

153

description of the baseline, "analysis of impacts, mitigation measures and

project alternatives becomes impossible." (County of Amador v. El Dorado
County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 953.) The FEIR fails to

meet this fundamental requirement for several reasons.

First, the FEIR presents a misleading picture of baseline groundwater

conditions, implying that all groundwater in the project area aquifers is fully

seawater-intruded and has no beneficial uses, relying on dated MCWRA

maps with well-known extensive data gaps. (See, e.g., FEIR, p. 8.5-185;, RT,
Vol. 15, pp. 2424:26-2425:6 (Mr. Leffler for Cal-Am) [15APP226, pp.

A10552-53]; RT, Vol. 15, pp. 2427:23-2433:17 [Mr. Leffler for Cal-Am]

[15APP226, pp. A10555-71]; Ex. MCD-33 [15APP230, p. A10899].)

However, the best available evidence, unlike the maps, shows the project

area aquifers contain groundwater that meets Basin Plan standards less than

a mile from the project site. (See, e.g., FEIR, pp. 8.5-263-8.5-266, 8.5-284-

8.5-286, 8.5-307, 8.5-3368.5-338, 8.5-391, and 8.5-409-8.5-410; MCWD

April 27, 2018 FEIR Comments, pp. 33-34 [39APP509, pp. A24181-82].)

Notably, the maps used to support the EIR are inconsistent with monitoring
data, such that numerous wells within the area shown to be seawater intruded

are not, in fact, so intruded. (See, e.g., FEIR, pp. 8.5-320-321, 8.5-336-340,

8.5-394-396, and 8.5-407-408.) While the project proponents'

Hydrogeologic Working Group, or HWG, acknowledged the lack of data to
support the maps' inferences, the FEIR does not make that acknowledgment.

154

(See, Ex. MCD-33 [HWG member noting the "shocking" lack of well data

to support Monterey County seawater intrusion assumptions] [15APP230, p.

A10899].)

Second, as the record demonstrates, the aquifers in the project area

play an important role in recharging the underlying aquifers and preventing

seawater intrusion. (FEIR, pp. 8.5-184 - 8.5-185 and referenced attachments

to MCWD comments.) The FEIR does not acknowledge this existing

beneficial use either.

Third, the FEIR fails to provide an accurate and complete description
of groundwater flows and flow direction in the project area. Instead, it
incorrectly suggests that groundwater monitoring from north of the Salinas
River shows flows and flow direction in the project area, south of the river.
(FEIR, pp. 4.4-16-4.4-19, citing Figures 4.4-5 and 4.4-6.) The cited figures,

however, do not cover the project area. (Ibid.)35

Due to serious concerns that the FEIR, like the RDEIR, would

continue to incorrectly evaluate groundwater baseline and impacts, MCWD
retained Dr. Rosemary Knight of Stanford University to investigate the state

35 The response to comments on the FEIR state it would be "total speculation" that the groundwater gradient in the Dune Sand Aquifer would reverse during the 60-year life of the project. (See Responses to Comments Received After Publication of MPWSP FEIR/EIS, D. 18-09-017, App. J, p. 17 [1APP1, A741].) The response, however, fails address the many experts' comments that the conclusion is not currently supported by the available data. (FEIR, p. 4.1-21.)

155

of the aquifers, using airborne electromagnetic (or "AEM") technology.
Prior to release of her team's final report, the HWG, which does not include
any geophysicists, released a technical report purporting to critique the
preliminary Stanford AEM study and attempting to modify the figures in that

study to argue that they supported the FEIR's inaccurate characterization of

baseline conditions.

The FEIR adopted the HWG's critique (Appendix E-3) without

subjecting either the Stanford preliminary report or the HWG's report to peer
review by qualified experts. (82APP607, p. A44826.) This is a serious

violation of CEQA, which prohibits the Commission from adopting the FEIR

when the FEIR does not reflect its independent judgment. (Eureka Citizens

for Responsible Government v. City of Eureka (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 357,

369.)

Importantly, as explained by Dr. Knight and other experts, the HWG
made substantial errors when it modified the Stanford study's figures. These

errors render the HWG's opinion grossly inaccurate and far below the
standard for "substantial evidence." (See, Ex. A to MCWD's Apr. 27, 2018

FEIR Comments [39APP509, pp. A24231-32]; see also Att. A to MCWD's

April 19, 2018 Letter [42APP587, pp. A27737, 27667].) Even more

importantly, the final Stanford AEM study - which contains over 300 control
points - demonstrates unequivocally that the FEIR's description of baseline
groundwater conditions in the project area is inaccurate. (Ibid.; see also

156

MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. C, pp. 2, 4 and Att. D, pp. 1-14

[42APP587, A27782, A27784, A27797-27810].) Thus, the FEIR unlawfully
misleads the Commission and the public into believing that there is no
substantial evidence that the project area aquifers contain groundwater
having beneficial use. (Cadiz Land Co. v. Rail Cycle (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th

74 ("Cadiz"), 87 ['If the description of the environmental setting of the

project site and surrounding area is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the

EIR does not comply with CEQA."].)36

These serious errors are compounded by the FEIR's responses to
comments, which stated that the FEIR was updated to reflect current

information on groundwater quality, when in fact it failed to correct any

assumptions that were based on the misleading MCWRA seawater intrusion

maps. (FEIR, p. 8.5-682.) Instead, the FEIR attempted to excuse its errors
by suggesting the maps were considered the best available information at the
time the RDEIR was prepared. (FEIR, p. 8.5-682.) These errors are

36 Immediately before approving the project, the Commission provided responses to some comments on the FEIR. Based on available information it appears the responses were obtained from the HWG and the Commission did not subject Dr. Knight's study or the HWG's critique of her study to any independent peer review or analysis. ([40APP554, p. A25620].) Notably, much of Dr. Knight's academic career has been devoted to this AEM technology. None of the HWG member are experts in the field of AEM technology. Remarkably, the Commission appear to accept the opinions of the project proponent's HWG over the leading expert in the field of AEM without retaining any qualified expert to review the AEM report or the HWG's critique of the report.

157

prejudicial and cannot be cured by the future monitoring and analysis

suggested in the FEIR. (Guidelines, 15144.)

The FEIR's omissions and misleading statements regarding water

levels and water quality in the project area aquifers obscure potentially

significant impacts to groundwater, and they misled the public and
Commissioners into believing that the project couldn't possibly harm the

coastal aquifers in the Project area. As explained in Cadiz:

In order to weigh and evaluate the risk of groundwater contamination, the volume of water subject to contamination is required.... In turn, an informed decision cannot be made as to
whether it is worth taking the risk of subjecting a valuable
water source to contamination.

(Cadiz, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at 92-93.)

That is true here as well. The Commissioners could not make "an

informed decision" as to whether it is worth taking the risk of subjecting the

project area aquifers to contamination. This error violated CEQA's

procedural requirements. (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 935-937;
Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at 435; Sierra Club v. County of Fresno, supra,

2018 Cal. LEXIS 9831, at *11-21.)

b. The FEIR violated CEQA by establishing baseline groundwater conditions and adopting its threshold of
significance for the MPWSP without using the applicable
water quality standards adopted in the RWQCB's Basin Plan
or considering SGMA.
The main purpose of an EIR is to allow agencies and the public to
consider whether a project will result in any significant environmental

158

impacts and to evaluate alternatives and mitigation measures that could

reduce or avoid those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002; 21002.1,

subd. (a).) To serve this important function, an EIR must establish and
explain the "threshold of significance" used to measure the severity of each
potential impact. Although lead agencies have some discretion in designating
thresholds, "the exercise of that discretion must be 'based to the extent

possible on scientific and factual data.'* (Cleveland, supra, 3 Cal.5th at pp.

514-515, citing Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (b).)

Here, the EIR's significance thresholds state that the project would
result in a significant impact if it would "[v]iolate any ground water quality
standards or otherwise degrade groundwater quality." (FEIR, p. 4.4-41,
italics added.) The FEIR, however, determined that the applicable ground

water quality standards - the Basin Plan - only "applied to the treated water

to be injected into the proposed ASR injection/extraction wells because it
could affect the quality and beneficial uses of the Basin's groundwater." (Id.
at 4.4-35, italics added.) In describing the baseline and evaluating potential
groundwater impacts from the MPWSP source wells, the EIR did not fully

consider impacts to existing beneficial uses, nor did it use the Basin Plan's

3,000 mg/L TDS standard for potential beneficial use groundwater, but
instead used the 500 mg/L TDS standard for untreated drinking water.

(FEIR, p. 8.5-672.) This was legal error.

Here the MPWSP's source well impairment of water quality violates

159

the Basin Plan, which incorporates SWRCB Resolution 88-63. (Ex. MCD-

60, p. 7 at §§ 2.1, 2.2,2.2.1 and App. A-9 thereto (SWRCB Resolution 88-
63) [25APP418, pp. A18827, 18831].) Resolution 88-63 requires protection

of usable (i.e., "beneficial use") groundwater, meaning groundwater having

a TDS level of 3,000 mg/L or less. Results from Cal-Am's own test well
program revealed TDS levels at or below 3,000 mg/L in the project area

aquifers. (Ex. MCD-20, pp. 9-11, plates 1 and 2 thereto [15APP237, pp.

A11222-23]; Ex. MCD-27, pp. 4-5 and Figure 1 attached thereto [15APP244,

pp. A11265-66, 11268].) That data, however, was completely ignored by the

CPUC, which found that groundwater in the project area serves no beneficial

use.

Moreover, because the MPWSP will exacerbate seawater intrusion in

the project area, it also contravenes SGMA's objectives of preventing
groundwater deterioration and achieving sustainable use. (Water Code §§
113, 10721.) The MPWSP would frustrate the mandatory efforts of local

agencies, including MCWD, to carry out SGMA's requirement to develop

and implement groundwater management plans. (Water Code § 10720.7.)

CEQA requires that an "EIR must demonstrate that the significant

environmental impacts of the proposed project were adequately investigated
and discussed and it must permit the significant effects of the project to be

considered in the full environmental context." (Guidelines, § 15125, subd.

(c).) CEQA also requires that EIRs discuss any inconsistencies between the

160

proposed project and applicable "water quality control plans." (Guidelines,
§ 15125, subd. (d).) Given these requirements, the EIR's failure to disclose
the amount of groundwater meeting the Basin Plan requirements and its
failure to evaluate the MPWSP's potential pumping impacts on that
groundwater violated CEQA.

Unless review is granted, rather than protecting a community water
resource already capable of beneficial use as required by the Basin Plan, the

CPUC's decision will permit the MPWSP to harm these waters for the next

60 years.

C. The FEIR violated CEQA by failing to include a "substantively meaningful" analysis of cumulative impacts, relying instead on inaccurate assumptions and flawed groundwater modeling that, admittedly, by design did not evaluate water quality
impacts or cumulative groundwater impacts.
The CPUC's decision is further flawed because its conclusion that the

MPWSP would improve groundwater conditions is based on unreliable

modeling that fails to address cumulative groundwater impacts. (D.18-09-

017, Appendix C, p. C-74 [1APP1, p. A420].) The level of degree of
uncertainty in the EIR's modeling is intolerable given its poor calibration and
the failure to utilize the best available information. (See, e.g., FEIR,
MCWD's comments at pp. 8.5-189-8.5-191, 8.5-253-8.5-258, 8.5-345-8.5-

385, 8.5-398-8.5-399.) The decision to abandon prior modeling efforts and

instead use a superposition model rendered the groundwater analysis fatally

defective. (Ibid.)

161

The superposition approach does not cure the modeling problems.
(See, e.g., FEIR, MCWD's comments at pp. 8.5-253-8.5-254, 8.5-257, 8.5-
355.) Rather, it constitutes an improper attempt to mask the problems. (Ibid.)

More importantly, superposition modeling is also inappropriate here because

it precludes prediction of measurable groundwater elevations associated with

the proposed slant well pumping. (See, e.g., FEIR, MCWD's comments at

p. 8.5-355.) Although the FEIR acknowledged these concerns, the FEIR did

not update the project's modeling. (FEIR, pp. 8.5-79-8.2-97.) Instead, it

downplayed the importance of the modeling. (FEIR, p. 8.2-80, emphasis

added.) The FEIR then incorrectly stated that the project's potential impacts

on groundwater quality would be limited to the capture zone, which the FEIR

continues to inaccurately characterize as entirely degraded by seawater

intrusion. (FEIR, p. 8.5-52.) The FEIR's analysis does not meet the

requirements of CEQA.

While a lead agency enjoys some discretion in its choice of

methodology, "when the agency chooses to rely completely on a single

quantitative method to justify a no-significance finding, CEQA demands the
agency research and document the quantitative parameters essential to that
method.3 (Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife
(2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 228, as modified on denial of reh'g (Feb. 17, 2016).)

As this Court explained, "[o]therwise, decision makers and the public are left

with only an unsubstantiated assertion that the impacts--here, the cumulative

162

impact of the project on [groundwater]-will not be significant." (Ibid.) An

EIR must analyze cumulative impacts because "the full environmental

impact of a proposed project cannot be gauged in a vacuum." (Communities

for a Better Environment v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th
98, 114, disapproved on another point, Berkeley Hillside Pres. V. City of

Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1109, fn. 3.) Here, the FEIR's analysis of

cumulative impacts to groundwater violates these requirements.

First, the FEIR's cursory analysis of cumulative impacts fails to
account for how groundwater conditions have changed over time and how
they are likely to change in the future without the project; in fact, the FEIR
acknowledges its modeling "only solves for the groundwater changes due
solely to the proposed project." (FEIR, p. 4.4-55, italics added.) Second, the

FEIR limits its discussion of cumulative impacts to those projects that would

overlap with the project's inaccurately presumed drawdown footprint. (See

FEIR, p. 4.4-106.) Third, the cumulative impacts analysis fails to consider

reasonably foreseeable projects that will in fact be necessary under the

SGMA. (Senate Bill 1168 (Pavley), AB1739 (Dickinson), SB1319 (Pavley),
stats. 2014, ch. 346, 347, 348.)37 Finally, neither D.18-09-017 nor the FEIR

37 The FEIR fails to assess groundwater quality impacts from the cumulative effects of slant well extraction, while saltwater intrusion must be remediated
under SGMA over the next 20 years. .(MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. C., p. 2, 5-6 and Att. D, pp. 28-30 [42APP587, A27782, A27785-27786, A27824-27826]; see Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 872 [no compliance with CEQA
163

addresses MCWRA's recent enactment of a moratorium on new wells within

the project area to "address seawater intrusion" in the coastal areas of the

SVGB.38

An EIR may not conclude that a project will not contribute to

cumulative impacts simply because it concludes the project itself has a less

than significant impact. (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford
(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720-21.) Moreover, given that the

NMGWM2016 model is not capable of predicting cumulative impacts-

because the underlying technology was not designed for those purposes as

the FEIR acknowledges (see, e.g., FEIR, pp. 8.5-80)-the FEIR's decision

not to address available project alternatives and intake technologies is

scientifically unsupportable (MCWD's April 19, 2018 Letter, Att. B., p. 4

[42APP587, p. A27772]) and violates CEQA. (Cleveland, supra, 3 Cal.5th

at p. 445 ["By choosing a methodology with known data gaps, [the agency]

produced unreliable estimates Accordingly, [the agency] failed to

comply with its statutory obligation as well as CEQA's information

because cumulative impacts analysis did not consider potential curtailment of water supplies that could issue from regulatory proceedings, which resulted in "an underestimation of the Agency's ability to meet customer demands without negative environmental consequences."].)

disclosure requirements."].) Review is necessary to correct these errors.
d. The Commission violated CEQA by adopting mitigation that (1) allows the project applicant to determine, after the fact, whether the project causes significant impacts; and (2) requires the applicant to provide desalinated water only to groundwater users located north of the Salinas River rather than south of the Salinas River where all of the significant
groundwater impacts will occur.
The FEIR mischaracterizes baseline groundwater conditions in the
SVGB aquifers that will be impacted by the project's pumping, and as a result

fails to consider alternatives or enforceable mitigation to address the
project's adverse- impacts on groundwater resources in the project area.

D.18-09-017 follows suit, stating that "Cal-Am's extraction from the

[SVGB] will not harm the quality of the [SVGB] water, and over the years

by returning supply water to the [SVGB] the MPWSP will ultimately benefit

the [SVGB] groundwater users." (D.18-09-017; Finding of Fact No. 70, p.

175 [1APP1, p. A279]; see id. at p. 110, citing FEIR at Sections 2.5.1, 2.6,
Chapter 3, and Section 4.4 [1APP1, p. A214].) The record does not support
the Commission's findings.

Cal-Am's proposed Return Water Settlement Agreement will not in

any way mitigate the adverse groundwater impacts caused by MPWSP
pumping. (See FEIR, MCWD comments at p. 8.5-440-511.) Providing
desalinated water north of the Salinas River may beneficially affect
groundwater in those aquifers, but it will not mitigate the project's primary

adverse impacts to the aquifers south of the Salinas River and local water

165

users. (Ibid.) Neither D.18-09-017 nor the FEIR contest this undisputed fact,

yet they illogically contend nonetheless that the Return Water settlement will

mitigate groundwater impacts of the project.

Nor does Cal-Am's proposed voluntary mitigation (Applicant

Proposed Measure 4.4-3) address potential groundwater impacts to project

area aquifers or ensure impacts to existing users are avoided. (FEIR, p. 4.4-

88 - 4.4-89.) The proposed mitigation measure improperly delegates to Cal-
Am the discretion to determine whether wells have been affected by

MPWSP pumping. (FEIR, p. 4.4-88 - 4.4-89 (provides that "effects are
verified by CalAm").) In addition, the mitigation measure lacks any

specified performance standards or specific criteria for success and fails to

commit the CPUC to any specific future mitigation measures in violation of

CEQA. (California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014)

225 Cal.App.4th 173, 195-196.) The proposed mitigation does not

sufficiently address water levels or water quality. CEQA requires more.

(Communities for a Better Environment v. City of Richmond (2010) 184

Cal.App.4th 70, 92; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202

Cal.App.3d 296, 307.) ["Fundamentally, the development of mitigation

measures .. is not meant to be a bilateral negotiation between a project

proponent and the lead agency after project approval; but rather, an open

process that also involves other interested agencies and the public."

(Communities for a Better Environment, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at 92.)."].)

166

"Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions,
agreements, or other legally-binding instruments." (Center for Biological
Diversity v. California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, supra, 62 Cal.4th at 237,
citing Guidelines § 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).) In addition, the mitigation
measure lacks any specified performance standards or specific criteria for
success and fails to commit the CPUC to any specific future mitigation
measures in violation of CEQA. (California Clean Energy Committee v.
City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 195-196.)

Review is necessary here to ensure enforceable mitigation is

provided that will avoid interference with MCWD's provision of its

municipal water to the residents of Marina and the Ord Community.

e. The Commission violated CEQA's requirement that decision- makers exercise their own independent judgment when it relied on evidence and analysis provided by persons known to the Commission to have a conflict of interest, did not require expert peer review, denied the request of the parties to examine the scope and nature of such conflicts in an evidentiary hearing, and then delegated authority to those conflicted
persons to determine, after the fact, whether the project causes
significant impacts to groundwater.
D.18-09-017 relies heavily on the groundwater impact conclusions of

the project proponents' HWG. The HWG is led by Dennis Williams,

originally a Commission sub-consultant on the project and later a Cal-Am
consultant. Mr. Williams holds the patent for the slant well design Cal-Am

proposes to use for the project. When Mr. Williams' interest and his

company's affiliation with Cal-Am was discovered, the Commission

167

promptly recognized the conflict of interest and stated that work by Mr.
Williams and his company, Geoscience then sub-consultants for the

Commission - would thereafter be considered the work of the applicant, Cal-

Am. (July 14, 2015 Ruling requesting data on patents, pp. 1-2 and July 15,

2015 errata to Ruling [11APP175, A8883-8884]; Aug. 19, 2015 Second

Amended Scoping Memo, p. 2 [12APP185, A9356]; Energy Division letter

of July 9, 2015 [11APP172, A8841].)
However, Mr. Williams and Geoscience continued to contribute to the

Commission's environmental review, and the groundwater modeling for the

MPWSP was ultimately guided by the recommendations of Mr. Williams

and the HWG. Moreover, the HWG's deeply flawed analysis of the model's
prediction of groundwater impacts was incorporated in the FEIR wholesale
as Appendix E-3, without opportunity for public comment and written
response as required by CEQA. (Guidelines, § 15088.) Moreover, there is
no evidence the Commission had the document peer reviewed prior to
including it in the FEIR. (82APP607, p. A44826.) If it was not, this would
amount to further CEQA violation. (Eureka Citizens for Responsible

Government v. City of Eureka, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 369.) There is no

evidence that occurred here.

Even worse, the Commission's environmental consultants, ESA and
Mr. Zigas, along with Geoscience, actively assisted Cal-Am's expert, Mr.
Leffler, in responding to cross-examination adverse to the project during

168

evidentiary hearings. (Ex. MCD-63 [25APP421, pp. A18853-54|; see

Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. California SWRCB, supra, 45 Cal.4th

at 740-742.) MCWD sought, but was denied a hearing on the continuing
conflicts of interest. (June 30, 2017 Joint Statement of Issues, Ex. A, p. 15
at issue 51 [20APP354, p. A14963]; Aug. 28, 2017 Ruling, pp. 3-4
[21APP373, pp. A15540-41].) MCWD cannot anticipate all the conflict of
interest issues that may be revealed until it has the opportunity to review the
Commission's record in this proceeding.39

4. The Commission violated CEQA by failing to provide good faith,
reasoned analysis in response to comments by sister agencies and
the public on the RDEIR's analysis of water rights, likely
significant impacts to groundwater and ESHA, demand analysis
and the need for the project, and project alternatives.
Public Resources Code, section 21091 sets forth a lead agency's

obligation to respond to comments from the public and reviewing agencies.

In pertinent part, subdivision (d) requires that lead agencies "shall evaluate

comments on environmental issues that are received from persons who have
reviewed the draft [EIR] and shall prepare a written response pursuant to

subparagraph (B)." Subparagraph (B) provides that "[t]he written response

39 MCWD submitted a Public Records Act request for this information in 2017, but it received no response until it renewed its request and also asked for the Commission's administrative record, on September 19, 2018. MCWD still has not received the Commission's administrative record,
although the Commission is now producing its documents responsive to MCWD's 2017 request. MCWD may update this Petition after it receives the
Commission's full administrative record in this matter.

169

shall describe the disposition of each significant environmental issue that is

raised by commenters. The responses shall be prepared consistent with

Section 15088 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations." As this
Court recently explained, "Rather than sweep disagreements under the rug,

the [lead agency] must fairly present them in its EIR. It is then free to explain

why it declined to accept [responsible experts or sister agencies] staff
suggestions." (Banning Ranch, supra, 2 Cal.5th at 940-941.)
As discussed above, the FEIR's responses to comments on (1) feasible

alternatives, including the PWM expansion and HDD; (2) the applicant's

unsupported demand estimates and the lack of need for the project; (3)

impacts and mitigation for ESHA; (4) impacts to groundwater, including

expert comments regarding baseline conditions, the EIR's failure to utilize

the Basin Plan to evaluate MPWSP pumping impacts, and failure to require

enforceable mitigation for the project's groundwater impacts, all fall far

short of this standard. Unless the writ is granted, MWCD, other agencies,

and the public will never know why the Commission disregarded these

comments.

170

5. The Commission violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the
RDEIR in light of significant new information demonstrating that
(1) the MPWSP's impacts to ESHA and groundwater are
substantially more severe than the RDEIR disclosed; (2) there are
feasible project alternatives and mitigation measures that Cal-Am
has not adopted that would avoid or substantially lessen the
proposed project's significant and unavoidable environmental
impacts; and (3) the RDEIR's use of the initially-proposed 9.6
MGD facility, and its discussion of ESHA and groundwater
impacts, was so fundamentally and basically inadequate that
meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
CEQA requires recirculation of an EIR prior to certification when

significant new information is added to the EIR after public notice is given

of the availability of the draft EIR for public review but before certification.

(§ 21092.1; Guidelines, § 15088.5.) "Significant new information" triggering

recirculation includes, for example, a disclosure showing (1) a new or

substantially more severe environmental impact; (2) a new feasible project

alternative or mitigation measure that is not adopted; or (3) when the draft

EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature

that meaningful public review and comment were precluded. (Guidelines,

§ 15088.5.)
As discussed above, MCWD and others provided extensive expert

evidence demonstrating the EIR's (a) supply and demand analysis was not

supported by substantial evidence; (b) description of baseline ESHA and

groundwater conditions was misleading and inaccurate; (c) modeling was

based on assumptions that are demonstrably false; (d) modeling by design

did not evaluate groundwater quality or cumulative groundwater impacts;

171

(e) proposed mitigation measures would not avoid impacts to ESHA or

groundwater users as assumed. These experts explained that the errors

rendered the RDEIR so fundamentally and basically inadequate that

meaningful public review and comment were precluded. Moreover, the

record demonstrates there are feasible project alternatives and mitigation
measures that Cal-Am has not adopted that would substantially lessen - and
likely eliminate entirely the project's significant and unavoidable

environmental impacts. Therefore, CEQA required the CPUC to recirculate

its RDEIR before approving the Project. (See Pub. Resources Code
§ 21092.1, Guidelines, $ 15088.5; see also Vineyard, supra, 40 Cal.4th at

448-49 (FEIR's revelation that project might result in reduced flows during

dry periods showed potentially significant impact requiring recirculation).
Unless review is granted, the public will not be fully apprised of the project's
significant impacts or be provided the opportunity to comment on feasible

alternatives and mitigation.

D. The Commission's Decision Prejudicially Violates Due Process.
In Jara v. Municipal Court for San Antonio Judicial Dist. (1978) 21

Cal. 3d 181, 188-189, the Court quoted its prior due process determinations

in the context of a challenge to a Commission decision:

We said in Sokol v. Public Utilities Commission (1966) 65
Cal.2d 247, 254, "What is due process depends on the
circumstances. It varies with the subject matter and the
necessities of the situation. [Citation.] Its content is a function
of many variables, including the nature of the right affected,

172

the degree of danger caused by the proscribed condition or
activity, and the availability of prompt remedial measures.'
Thus, in analyzing the requirements of due process in the instant case, we must draw our guidance from those "fundamental principles of liberty and justice that lie at the
base of all our civil and political institutions." (Palko V.
Connecticut (1937) 302 U.S. 319, 328.)
The Court went on to explain that restrictions on liberty or property could

only be imposed consistent with constitutional due process requirements
"after a fair hearing, one that is neither a pretense nor a sham ([Citation]) and

one that is appropriate to the nature of the case." (Jara v. Municipal Court
for San Antonio Judicial Dist., supra, 21 Cal. 3d at 188-189. citing Mullane

V. Central Hanover Bank & Tr. Co. (1950) 339 U.S. 306, 313.) As the U.S.

Supreme Court has stated concerning basic due process precepts, absent "a

countervailing state interest of overriding significance, persons forced to

settle their claims of right and duty through the judicial process must be given
a meaningful opportunity to be heard." (Boddie v. Connecticut (1971) 401
U.S. 371, 377; see also Randone v. Appellate Dep't of Superior Court (1971)
5 Cal. 3d 536, 550-551; id. at fn. 11 [Court's decisions confirm that the "right

to notice and a meaningful hearing" also applies in instances where "a

significant deprivation is threatened by a private entity, as well as by a

governmental body"].) This means, consistent with the requirement of

Northern California Power Agency v. Public Utilities Com., supra, 5 Cal.3d
at 378-379, for an evidentiary hearing on all relevant CPCN factors, MCWD
and the parties here were constitutionally entitled to a hearing on issues that

173

could affect their rights. (U.S. Const., 4th and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const.,

art. I, §§ 3, 7.) The Commission did not accord them such a hearing.

1. The Parties Were Denied a Hearing on Influence on the
Environment, a CPCN Factor under Section 1002(a).

The Commission must base its CPCN decisions on the consideration,

on a sufficient record, of all relevant factors. (Pub. Util. Code § 1002, subd.

(a); Northern California Power Agency V. Public Utilities Com., supra, 5
Cal.3d at 379.) Factors the Commission must consider include, but are not

limited to, those enumerated under section 1002, subdivision (a) of the Public

Utilities Code. (Ibid.) The mandatory factors, all of which must be explored

in evidentiary hearings, include a proposed utility project's "influenee-on the

environment.3 (Pub. Util. Code § 1002, subd. (a)(4); Northern California
Power Agency V. Public Utilities Com., supra, 5 Cal.3d at 378-379, citing
and agreeing with the Commission's answer in that case.)
MCWD's repeated requests for an evidentiary hearing on the project's
anticipated "influence on environment," including but not limited to

groundwater impacts, under Public Utilities Code section 1002, subdivision

(a)(4), were denied (see MCWD's May 3, 2018 Reply Brief on

Environmental Issues, pp. 131-133 and authorities cited (39APP516, pp.

A24741-43]), despite the existence of disputed significant material ultimate

facts regarding groundwater baseline and impacts. Having determined that

hearing is necessary on the CPCN application (Pub. Util. Code § 1005), the

174

Commission may not demote influence on the environment, under section
1002, subdivision (a)(4), solely to the CEQA record and review, thereby
denying parties the right to present evidence and cross-examine on contested

issues in an evidentiary hearing. (Northern California Power Agency v.
Public Utilities Com., supra, 5 Cal.3d at 378-379 (hearing required on "all
relevant factors" under Pub. Util. Code § 1002).) The statutory factor of
"influence on the environment" is entitled to the same level of evidentiary
scrutiny as other relevant factors that must be weighed in determining the

public convenience and necessity. (Ibid.) Because environmental review of

groundwater issues is directly related to the potential for the MPWSP to
catastrophically impact MCWD's water rights and its ability to use its own
groundwater to serve its customers in the project vicinity, the Commission
should have provide MCWD with a constitutionally-sufficient process to be

heard on the matter. (Boddie v. Connecticut, supra, 401 U.S. at 377; Mullane

V. Central Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., supra, 339 U.S. at 313; Jara v.

Municipal Court for San Antonio Judicial Dist., supra, 21 Cal. 3d at 188-

189; Randone v. Appellate Dep't of Superior Court, supra, 5 Cal. 3d at 550-

551.)

Section 1002, subdivision (a)(4) of the Public Utilities Code was
enacted after CEQA (see Stats. 1981, Ch. 573, Sec. 3; Stats. 1970, Ch. 1433),

and thus its requirements are additional to the requirements of CEQA, and

they cannot be dismissed as mere surplusage. (People v. Scott (2012) 203

175

Cal.App.4th 1303, 1313 [courts attempt to give effect to every word and

avoid constructions that render statutory terms superfluous or meaningless];

In re Joseph T. (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 787, 795-796 ["Because the

Legislature is presumed to be aware of existing judicial interpretations when

it amends a statute [citation], if the Legislature intended to overrule the

existing judicial interpretation of [a statute] it would have done so

explicitly."].)

As noted above, for purposes of the Commission's decisions as to

public convenience and necessity factors, only evidence presented through

sworn testimony can properly support the Commission's decision. (Pub.
Util. Code § 1710.) Here, the Commission made its determinations

regarding influence on the environment solely through its CEQA review
process. (D.18-09-017, p. 160 [1APP1, p. A264.) Therefore, MCWD and

the other parties were prejudicially deprived of their constitutionally-

guaranteed rights of due process.

2. The Commission Failed to Refer Groundwater Rights and
Groundwater Harm Questions to the SWRCB or the Courts.

Before certificating the MPWSP, providing that the project is

necessary and that no feasible alternative exists to the proposed slant well
intake at the CEMEX property, the Commission was obligated to refer

questions of groundwater rights and harm to groundwater to a tribunal with a

jurisdiction, i.e., the courts or the SWRCB, to resolve the matter. (City of

176

Santa Maria v. Adam (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 266, 286-288; see California
American Water v. City of Seaside, supra, 183 Cal.App.4th at 480; see also
Ex. MCD-17, pp. 46-47, fn. 65 [15APP234, pp. A11182-83]; see also Code
Civ. Proc., §g 830-852; see also Water Code §§ 2000-2900; see Mar. 21,

2018 Motion [37APP489, p. A22471.) Multiple parties ultimately joined

MCWD in requesting such a referral. (Ibid.) The referral would have

eliminated the risk of the Commission approving a project that was not
legally or practically feasible, which is precisely what it has done here.

To the detriment of MCWD, other parties, the community and Cal-
Am's ratepayers, the Commission committed prejudicial legal error in failing
to require any prior determination of groundwater rights and impacts by a
tribunal with lawful subject matter jurisdiction before determining that

construction of the MPWSP is "required" by the present or future public

convenience and necessity. (Pub. Util. Code § 1001.) At Cal-Am's request,

significant factual testimony concerning the state of the groundwater basin

and the likely impacts of the MPWSP on that baseline state was stricken from

the record. (Oct. 27 and Nov. 13, 2017 ALJ Rulings on Motion to Strike of

Cal-Am re Exs. MCD-49, MCD-52, MCD-55 [23APP394, p. A17110-

17111, 17117-17118; 26APP424, p. A18978-18979, 18985-18986].) This

was prejudicial error and a failure of the Commission to regularly pursue its
authority. (Ventura County Waterworks v. Public Util. Com., supra, 61
Cal.2d at 463-464.)

177

Disputed material facts going to the legal feasibility of the project and

impacts on MCWD's groundwater and its water rights cannot lawfully be

resolved in a "CEQA-track" vacuum under a lesser "substantial record

evidence" standard with no right to test evidence by presenting sworn

testimony and cross-examining witnesses. (U.S. Const., 4th and 14th

Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7; Morongo Band of Mission Indians v.

California SWRCB, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 737; see also Pub. Util. Code
§ 1710.) Due process, for MCWD and other holders of groundwater rights

in the project area, requires hearing. (See Mar. 21, 2018 Joint Motion for

Prompt Referral of Question to SWRCB [37APP489, p. A22475].) While

such a hearing should properly proceed only before the SWRCB or the

courts, as explained previously, no such hearing ever occurred before the
Commission either. This constitutes prejudicial legal error on the part of the
Commission, and a failure of the Commission to regularly pursue its
authority. (Pub. Util. Code § 1757.1, subd. (b).) The Court must grant

review to rectify the error.

3. The Commission Failed to Afford the Parties a Hearing on the
Public Agencies' Further Progress with Feasible Alternatives,
Including the Proposed PWM Expansion.
The general manager of M1W indicated at oral argument that M1W
and WMD have continued to pursue PWM expansion plans in 2018, making

significant strides toward satisfaction of the "nine criteria" used by the

Commission to evaluate the initial approval of Cal-Am's water purchase

178

from PWM. (RT, Vol. 29, pp. 5145-5146 (Mr. Sciuto for M1W) [40APP555,

pp. A26738-39-].) As indicated in its Comments on the PD, MCWD has

refined its own proposal for sale of water to ensure that its sales could be

sufficiently long-term and to address concerns raised under non-export

provisions of the Agency Act. (82APP591, p. A44224.) The Commission

erred in failing to grant the May 11, 2018 Motion of M1W and eleven other

parties for the Commission to Open a Phase 3 and failing to hold further

evidentiary hearings on the feasible alternative of PWM expansion, as well

as MCWD water sales.

Such hearings would permit the Commission to receive exactly the

sort of alternatives evidence that it must consider before certificating a

project under section 1001 of the Public Utilities Code and the federal

Ashbacker doctrine, as well as CEQA and the Coastal Act. (Ventura County
Waterworks v. Public Util. Com., supra, 61 Cal.2d at 464-66 [annulling

Commission decision granting CPCN, where "public convenience and

necessity, however, may be better met by a public rather than a private
system," for failure to provide fair hearing to public agency proposal]. See
also Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. F.C.C., supra, 326 U.S. 327 [requiring agency

to consider all feasible, mutually-exclusive alternatives in a comparative

evidentiary hearing].) The legal error was prejudicial and the Court should

therefore grant review.

179

4. The Commission Denied MCWD's Request for a Hearing on
Conflicts of Interest.

An ongoing financial conflict of interest has contaminated the

Commission's environmental review process, such that the FEIR and the

Commission's project approval based thereon are not the product of the

Commission's independent judgment. (Eureka Citizens for Responsible

Government v. City of Eureka, supra, 147 Cal.App.4th at 369.) Dennis

Williams, who served as a key Commission hydrogeology sub-consultant

and thereafter as a member of the HWG upon which the Commission heavily

relied held patents on the largel experimental slant wells to be utilized in

the project. Because MCWD was deeply concerned about the ongoing
conflict of interest and the potential that it would impair the Commission's
fair decisionmaking process, MCWD requested the Commission hold an
evidentiary hearing on the admitted conflict of interest on the part of former

Commission consultant and current Cal-Am consultant Dennis Williams and

his firm, Geoscience, Inc. (Parties' June 30, 2017 Joint Statement of Issues,

Ex. A at p. 15, 151 [20APP354, p. A14963].) The Commission refused to

hear evidence or hold a hearing on the conflict. Nonetheless, testimony and

authenticated documents introduced into evidence demonstrate that

MCWD's fears were well-founded. (Exs. MCD-62, MCD-63, RT, Vol. 15,
pp. 2424:26-2425:6, 2427:23-2433:17 (Mr. Leffler for Cal-Am)

[25APP420, pp. A18844-50; 25APP421, pp. A18852-54; 15APP226, pp.

180

A10552-53; 10555-61], see also Geoscience work product retained in the

FEIR, e.g., FEIR, pp. ES-49; 3-19, 20, 69; 4.2-4, 8, 9, 48, 51, 52, 80; 4.4-4,

7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 24, 25, 27, 49, 53, 54, 58, 62, 75, 82, 83, 108; 4.7-4, 5, 7,

45; 5.3-6, 9, 54, 55; Appendix E-2; Appendix E-3.)
The willingness of Commission decisionmakers to be guided by its
environmental review team rather than exercise its independent judgment

was confirmed in documents recently provided by the Commission in

response to MCWD's Public Records Act request number 17-369.
(82APP603, p. A44817; 82APP604, p. A44819; 82APP608, p. A44829.)
The eagerness of the Commission's environmental review team to support

the applicant had already been documented and brought to the Commission's

attention, but MCWD's concerns in this regard were ignored. Plainly, the

Commission committed prejudicial legal error when it failed to afford

MCWD and the parties their constitutional due process rights to inquire into

the matter, as well as when it improperly relied upon the advice of conflicted

persons and its biased environmental review team. (U.S. Const., 4th and 14th
Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 3, 7; Morongo Band of Mission Indians v.

California SWRCB, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 737, 740-742.) Review should be

granted and upon review the decision should be vacated, set aside or

annulled.

E. The Commission's Decision Violates MCWD's Right to be Free

181

from Impairment of its Contracts.
In addition to groundwater protections provided by law as discussed

above, MCWD for decades has relied on important contractual arrangements

with other local agencies and landholders to protect its groundwater

resources. Participation of MCWRA in such contractual arrangements is

consonant with MCWRA's responsibility under the Agency Act to protect

the basin's groundwater. (Water Code App. ch. 52, §§ 52-8, 52-9 at subd.

(h)(7).) Because the Commission's project approval, and Cal-Am's

construction and operation of the MPWSP would impair the contractual

benefits MCWD bargained for and has enjoyed for more than twenty years,

D.18-09-017 commits prejudicial legal error in violating the U.S. and

California Constitutions through impairment of MCWD's right of contract.
(U.S. Const., art. I, § 10, cl. 1; Cal. Const., art. I, § 9.)

1. MCWD Contracted for Protection of its Groundwater.

Two such contracts entered by MCWD are a 1993 Annexation

Agreement among MCWD, MCWRA and the U.S. Army regarding
annexation of land that was then under Army ownership and control as Fort

Ord into certain MCWRA zones of benefit (Ex. MCD-5 [6APP62, pp.

A4173-10]), and a 1996 Annexation Agreement and Groundwater Mitigation

Framework for Marina Area Lands ("1996 Annexation Agreement") among

MCWD, MCWRA, the Armstrong Family, Lonestar (predecessor in interest

to CEMEX) and the City of Marina (Ex. MCD-6 [6APP63, pp. A4211-14]).

182

The 1996 Annexation Agreement states its purpose, in full, as:

to help reduce seawater intrusion and protect the groundwater resource and preserve the environment of the Salinas River Groundwater Basin through voluntary commitments by the Parties to limit, conserve and manage the use of groundwater
from the Salinas River groundwater basin, and to provide the terms and conditions for the annexation of certain territory in the Marina area to the Monterey County Water Resources Agency's benefit assessment Zones 2 and 2A as a financing mechanism providing additional revenues to the Monterey
County Water Resources Agency to manage and protect the groundwater resources in the Salinas River Groundwater Basin
and to reduce seawater intrusion.

(Ex. MCD-6, p. at 1.1 [6APP63, p. A4222].) Inexplicably and without

support, the FEIR interpreted the agreement as "not intended to limit

brackish water pumping from the shallow aquifers," in direct contradiction

of the plain language of the document's provisions. (Ibid.) The FEIR went

on to posit, without support, that the Return Water Settlement would in any

event "keep the Basin whole." (FEIR FEIR/EIS, § 2.6.4, p. 2-43 [43APP490,

p. A28098].)

Based on this misrepresentation of the contracting parties' agreement

in the FEIR, D.18-09-017 concluded that a contract of multiple local entities

for management and protection of groundwater does not appear to "preclude

the project." (D.18-09-017, Conclusions of Law 30 [1APP1, p. A301].)
Consequently, the benefits MCWD and others contracted for, by limiting
groundwater withdrawals for all aquifer levels, in their 1996 Annexation
Agreement will unquestionably be impaired, because the MPWSP's

183

withdrawal from the Dune Sand and 180 Foot/180FTE aquifers of some 15

MGD or 17,000 AFY of source water at the CEMEX property will indeed

adversely impact groundwater conditions, as described in detail above. In
addition, the groundwater that may be withdrawn on the CEMEX property
must be used within the SVGB (Ex. MCD-6, p. 17 at § 7.1 [6APP63, p.
A42391), thus it may not be exported to the Monterey Peninsula after
desalination. Contrary to the conclusions of the FEIR and D.18-09-017,

operation of the MPWSP would indeed impair MCWD's contracted-for
rights to continued conservation of groundwater in the CEMEX area. This

prejudicial error of law therefore violates MCWD's constitutional rights and

it must be corrected.

Cal-Am claimed, in responding to MCWD's application for

rehearing, that the law does not strictly require administrative agencies

unlike the courts and the legislative branches - to refrain from impairment of

contract. (82APP599, pp. A44680-81.) Cal-Am is mistaken. For example,

the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Federal Power Commission (as it

was called at the time) could only abrogate an existing contractual
arrangement (there for power prices) unless the contract itself adversely
affected the public interest. (Permian Basin Area Rate Cases (1968) 390

U.S. 747, 820-821, citing FPC v. Sierra Pacific Power Co. (1956) 350 U.S.

348, 355.) Likewise, this Court has held that the Railroad Commission, the

Commission's predecessor agency, had no power to interfere in customers'

184

pre-existing contracts with an unregulated company. (Allen v. Railroad Com.

of California (1918) 179 Cal. 68, 73-4.) It should follow that the

Commission may not lawfully interfere with MCWD's existing contracts,
which do do not even involve Cal-Am or its customers, and which were

entered into in the public interest.

2. MCWD Contracted for a 500 AFY Limitation on Groundwater
Pumping at the CEMEX Property.
Furthermore, the 1996 Annexation Agreement limits extraction of

groundwater on the CEMEX property, where the MPSWP wells would be

located, to no more than 500 AFY. (Ex. MCD-6, pp. 6-7 and 17 at §§ 5.1.1.3,
7.2 [6APP63, pp. A4227-28, 4239]; Ex. MCD-1A, Revised Direct

Testimony of Lloyd W. Lowrey, Jr. for MCWD, pp. 14-15 [6APP58, pp.
A4132-33]; see also Ex. MCD-6, §§ 4.1, 4.4 [6APP63, p. A4226-27].) This
record fact is unchallenged. (RT, Vol. 10, pp. 1824-1827 [7APP81, p.
A6193-96].) Yet the MPWSP will pump some 30-plus times as much

groundwater as the agreement permits, far in excess of the 500 AFY

limitation.

Illogically, in its sole mention of the 1996 Annexation Agreement at
Conclusions of Law 30, D.18-09-017 concludes that "[b]ased upon the
FEIR/EIS and the record as a whole, it appears that the Annexation

Agreement does not preclude the project." (1APP1, p. A301.) Yet the FEIR

indeed stated "it appears that the 500 afy groundwater withdrawal limitation

185

may currently apply. ..." (FEIR § 2.6.4, p. 2-43 43APP490, p. A28098].)
Contrary to the conclusions of D.18-09-017, operation of the MPWSP would
impair MCWD's contracted-for right to limitation of groundwater
withdrawals on the CEMEX property to 500 AFY. This error of law is

prejudicial to MCWD and violates its constitutional right to be free from

impairment of contract.

CONCLUSION

In summary, the Commission's approval of the MPWSP is contrary

to law, including the U.S. and California Constitutions. It poses an

unreasonable risk of harm to MCWD's water supply and it would destroy

over seven acres of rare coastal dune habitat in the City of Marina. There are

feasible alternative supply sources that would be significantly less costly to

Cal-Am's ratepayers, and which would avoid these adverse impacts, but the

Commission has not meaningfully investigated these alternatives. For these

reasons and all the reasons stated herein, the Court should:

1. Issue a writ of review/mandate directing the Commission
promptly to prepare, certify and file with the Court the complete

administrative record, and thereafter inquire into the lawfulness of the

Commission's CEQA determinations in D.18-09-017;

2. Upon consideration and review, render a decision on the merits
vacating D.18-09-017 and remanding A.12-04-019 for further proceedings,
directing the Commission to comply with the law, to determine whether the

186

project is needed, to make full and fair determination of the legal, scientific
and economic feasibility of the project, and to give full and fair consideration

to public agency alternatives, and to take no further action to approve the
MPWSP prior to revising and recirculating the FEIR in compliance with

CEQA, including with a legally sufficient analysis of all potentially feasible

project alternatives;

3. Award MCWD its costs incurred in this proceeding, including
attorney fees pursuant to statute under Code of Civil Procedure, section

1021.5 and other applicable provisions of law, as against Respondent and/or

Real Party in Interest Cal-Am as permitted by law and as justice requires;

and

4. Grant MCWD such other and further relief as may be just and

proper.

TO THE HONORABLE TANI CANTIL-SAKAUYE, CHIEF JUSTICE,
AND TO THE HONORABLE ASSOCIATE JUSTICES OF THE
SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:
Concurrently with the filing of the instant petition for writ of
review/mandate challenging California Public Utilities Commission
("Commission") Decision ("D.") 18-09-017, petitioner Marina Coast Water
District ("MCWD") respectfully moves the Court, pursuant to Evidence
Code sections 452, subd. (d), 453 and 459, and Rules of Court 8.252(a) and
8.520, to take judicial notice of MCWD's appendix, Volumes through 81,
filed in Case No. S251935, so that MCWD may rely on its appendix from
Case No. S251935 in support of its petition in this case.
MCWD requests judicial notice due to the extreme expense and
burden that would fall upon it, if it were required to needlessly reproduce in
this case its 81-volume appendix previously filed in this Court in Case No.
S251935. The Court's consideration of MCWD's instant petition will be
facilitated by the Court's reference to the materials contained in the 81-
volume appendix that MCWD filed in support of its earlier petition in Case
No. S251935.

This motion for judicial notice is based upon this motion, the
accompanying memorandum of points and authorities, and the attached
declaration of Mark Fogelman.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
Background
Contemporaneously with the filing of this motion, MCWD has filed
a petition for writ of review/mandate challenging the Commission's
September 20, 2018 "Decision Approving A Modified Monterey Peninsula
Water Supply Project, Adopting Settlement Agreement, Issuing Certificate
of Public Convenience and Necessity and Certifying Combined
Environmental Report," approving the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply
Project ("MPWSP") proposed by California American Water Company.
(D.18-09-017.) On October 12, 2018, MCWD timely filed a petition for
writ of review/mandate in Case No. S251935 that raised only MCWD's
claims of error under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
with regard to D.18-09-017. The October 12, 2018 petition relied on a
concurrently-filed 81-volume appendix of exhibits.
On October 19, 2018, pursuant to Public Utilities Code sections
1731, subd. (b)(1), 1733, and 1756, subd. (a), MCWD filed an application
for rehearing before the Commission raising all its CEQA and non-CEQA
claims challenging D.18-09-017. On December 12, 2018, the Court denied
MCWD's petition in Case No. S251935 without prejudice to MCWD's
filing a new petition challenging D.18-09-017 after the conclusion of the
application for rehearing process before the Commission. With today's
petition, MCWD deems its application for rehearing denied (Pub. Util.
Code § 1733, subd. (b)), thereby concluding the Commission's application
for rehearing process. MCWD's new petition for writ of review/mandate
raises all of MCWD's claims of legal error in D.18-09-017, including the
CEQA claims that were first presented in MCWD's petition in Case No.
S251935.

3

Argument
Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452, subd. (d), the courts may
take judicial notice of "[r]ecords of (1) any court of this state." Pursuant to
Rule of Court 8.520(g), judicial notice may be requested under Evidence
a Code section 459 through a party's compliance with Rule 8.252(a). All the
documents contained in the appendix filed in Case No. S251935 are records
of this Court. Copies of the foregoing materials are not included with this
motion due to their voluminous nature and their ready availability to the
Court and the parties. (Rule 8.252(a)(3).) MCWD wishes to rely on its 81-
volume appendix filed in support of its October 12, 2018 petition in support
of its concurrently-filed petition, and therefore the materials sought to be
judicially noticed are necessary to the Court's consideration of MCWD's
new petition.
The Court's file in Case No. S251935 is relevant, because MCWD's
petition in that case challenged the same Commission decision that is at
issue in this case, D.18-09-017. (Rule 8.252(a)(2)(A).) MCWD believes
that all the items contained in the appendix in Case No. S251935 were part
of the record before Commission. (Rule 8.252(a)(2)(B).) Moreover, all of
the materials of which MCWD seeks judicial notice consist of the
records of this Court, which are subject to judicial notice under sections
452, 453 and 459 of the Evidence Code. (Rule 8.252(a)(2)(C).) (See, e.g.,
Vargas v. City of Salinas (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1, 22 at fn. 10.)
MCWD's petition filed in Case No. S251935 relied on the 81-
volume appendix, but on December 12, 2018, the Court entered an order
denying MCWD's petition in Case No. S251935 without prejudice to its
filing a new petition after the application for rehearing process before the
Commission was concluded. The instant petition, filed pursuant to the

4

Court's December 12 order, raises many of the same issues raised in Case
No. S251935
The appendix is voluminous, consisting of more than 43,000 pages.
(Declaration of Mark Fogelman ("Fogelman Dec."), f 6.) The appendix is
in the Court's possession and has been served on the parties to Case No.
S251935, who will also be parties to this proceeding. It would be unduly
costly, burdensome and wasteful to MCWD, as well as inconvenient for the
Court and the parties, if MCWD were required to file a new and duplicative
81-volume appendix in support of its new petition when the Court and the
parties already have in their possession the appendix in Case No. S251935.
(Fogelman Dec., 17.) MCWD is filing, concurrently with today's petition,
one additional volume of supporting exhibits, appendix Volume 82.
(Fogelman Dec., 18.)
Pursuant to Evidence Code section 452 and 459, notice shall be
taken of such records upon a party's request, where the requesting party
provides sufficient notice to adverse parties and sufficient information to
the Court. (Evid. Code §§ 452, 459.) Here, MCWD provides notice
concurrently with the filing of today's petition, and it provides information
sufficient to identify the matters as to which judicial notice is requested,
i.e., MCWD's 81-volume appendix in Case No. S251935.
MCWD respectfully requests the Court to take judicial notice of
MCWD's appendix, volumes 1-81, in Case No. S251935.

petition herein, one additional appendix volume of supporting exhibits,
Appendix Volume 82, in support of its new petition.

9. MCWD respectfully requests that the Court take judicial
notice in the instant case of the entire appendix filed in Case No. S251935
and allow MCWD to rely on the 81-volume appendix in Case No. S251935
as if it were filed in the instant case.
