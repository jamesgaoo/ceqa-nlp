VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

The United States of America, through its undersigned attorneys, by the authority of the

2 Attorney General, and at the request of the United States Department of the Interior, through its
3 Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation"), petitions this Court for a writ of mandate under sections
4 1094.5 and 1085 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168, 21168.5, and
5 21080.5 of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.,

6 directing Respondent California State Water Resources Control Board to vacate and set aside its
7 December 12, 2018 decision to adopt Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving and adopting
8 amendments to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
9 Joaquin Delta Estuary and the related Substitute Environmental Document.

10 INTRODUCTION

11 1. On December 12, 2018, the California State Water Resources Control Board
12 ("Board") approved and adopted amendments to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San
13 Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (*Amended Plan"l) and the related
14 Substitute Environmental Document ("Final SED").
15 2. The Amended Plan adopts new flow objectives for the Lower San Joaquin River and
16 its tributaries.

17 3. In approving the Amended Plan and Final SED, the Board failed to comply with the
18 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), CAL. PUB. RES. CODE §§
19 21000-21189.57 (West 2019), in the following ways:
20 The Board failed to provide an accurate, stable, and finite project description,
21 because the Board analyzed a project materially different from the project
22 described in the project description;
23 The Board improperly masked potential environmental impacts of the Amended
24

25
The Amended Plan is found at Appendix K to the Final SED. The Board's website for the 26 Amended Plan is located at: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/
27 programs/bay_delta (last visited March 28, 2019). The revisions to the Amended Plan are found at: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/ 28 bay_delta_plan/water_quality_control_planning/2018_sed/docs/appx_k.pdf (last visited March 28, 2019) and also include Change Sheets #1, 2, and 3.

The United States holds water rights that are managed by Reclamation for the federal
New Melones Dam and Reservoir project (*New Melones Project"), located on the Stanislaus River,
10 that is subject to the Amended Plan. The New Melones Project is owned by the United States and
11 operated by Reclamation under federal Reclamation laws2 and is a component of the federal Central
12 Valley Project ("CVP").

13 5. The United States will be directly, substantially, and adversely impacted by the
14 Board's actions, which include, but are not limited to, substantial operational constraints on the New
15 Melones Project, loss of available surface water supplies for New Melones Project purposes,
16 including CVP water service contracts, and involuntary dedication of federal reservoir
17 Board purposes.

The New Melones Project is located on the Stanislaus River, approximately sixty
19 miles upstream from the river's confluence with the San Joaquin River. The dam was authorized
20 by Congress under the Flood Control Act of 1944, ch. 665, 58 Stat. 887, and re-authorized by the
21 Flood Control Act of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-874, 76 Stat. 1173. While originally authorized as a
22 flood control project, in reauthorizing the dam, Congress mandated that it become an integral part
23 of the CVP, operated and maintained by the Department of the Interior under the federal
24 Reclamation laws. The Flood Control Act of 1962 also included preservation and propagation of

26 25 fish and wildlife in the New Mclones Project, and regulation of streamflow for the purpose of

downstream water quality control as authorized purposes. Id. at 1191. The dam was completed in

2 1979.

7. The CVP, operated by Reclamation, is "the nation's largest federal water
4 management project." San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. United States, 672 F.3d 676, 681-
82 (9th Cir. 2012). The CVP was re-authorized by section 2 of the Act of August 26, 1937, 50 Stat.
850.

8. The New Melones Project has a storage capacity of approximately 2.4 million acre

8 feet (*af"). Reclamation has entered into contracts, pursuant to the federal Reclamation laws, with

9 water districts for the delivery of water from the New Melones Project for irrigation and municipal
10 and industrial purposes.

11 9. The new flow objectives in the Amended Plan would significantly reduce the amount
12 of water available in New Melones reservoir for meeting congressionally authorized purposes of the
13 New Melones Project, including irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes, power generation,
14 and recreational opportunities at New Melones. The reduced water available for New Melones
15 Project purposes would also impair Reclamation's delivery of water under contracts it presently
16 holds with irrigation and water districts.

17 10. The Court should therefore grant this Petition for a writ of mandate directing the
18 Board to set aside its approval of the Amended Plan and the Final SED.
19 PARTIES

20 11. Petitioner is the United States of America. The U.S. Department of the Interior is a
21 Cabinet-level agency and a the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is a federal agency within the Department
22 of the Interior. Reclamation operates the New Melones Project as part of the CVP.
23 12. Respondent is the State Water Resources Control Board.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this Petition for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to
26 California Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections

1094.5 and 1085.3

2 14. Venue is proper in the County of Sacramento, California, under Code of Civil
3 Procedure sections 393, 395 and 401, because the Board is an agency of the State of California with

4 offices located in Sacramento.

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

6 15. The United States has fully exhausted all administrative remedies. The United States
7 submitted comments to the Board on the Amended Plan. Each of the legal deficiencies asserted in
8 this Petition were raised before the Board by the United States, or by others, prior to the Board's

9 adoption of the Final SED and approval of Amended Plan.
10 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

11 16. On December 12, 2018, the Board approved and adopted the Amended Plan and
12 Final SED. Pursuant to the California Administrative Procedure Act, Government Code section
13 11353, the Board then submitted the Amended Plan, together with the administrative record of the
14 action, to the Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") for approval. On February 25, 2019, OAL
15 approved the Amended Plan and the Board's action to approve the Amended Plan became final
16 upon transmission to the Secretary of State for filing.
17 17. On February 26, 2019, the Board filed a Notice of Decision with the Secretary of the
18 California Natural Resources Agency, which filing commenced the applicable thirty-day statute of
19 limitations under section 21080.5(g) of the Public Resources Code.
20 18. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with California Public Resources Code
21 section 21080.5(g).
22 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT
23 19. Petitioner has complied with California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
24 providing written notice of commencement of this action to the Board prior to filing this Petition.
25

26

27 Although the United States believes that only section 1085 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and section 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code would apply to its petition 28 for writ of mandate under California law, the government also includes citations to sections 1094.5 and 21168 out of an abundance of caution.

2 ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

3 20. Petitioner elects to prepare the CEQA administrative record in this proceeding
4 pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2). A true and correct copy of

5 such notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

6 CONCURRENT FEDERAL COURT ACTION

7 21. Petitioner has concurrently filed a substantially similar action in the United States

8 District Court for the Eastern District of California.

0 22. That action in federal district court preserves Petitioner's preferred choice of a
10 federal forum to resolve its claimsa choice of forum that Congress established by specifying that
11  "civil actions, suits, and proceedings" can be brought in federal court when the United States acts
12 as a plaintiff. 28 U.S.C. § 1345.

13 23. This Petition is brought in this Court only out of an abundance of caution in the event
14 that, for any reason, Petitioner's federal suit is not adjudicated on the merits in federal court and to
15 ensure that the state statute of limitations was scrupulously complied with.

16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 24. In 1978 the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
18 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary ("Bay-Delta Plan") pursuant to its water quality
19 authority under California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act (*Porter-Cologne Act"), CAL.
20 WATER CODE §§ 13000-16104 (West 2019). The Board subsequently amended the Bay-Delta Plan
21 three times: in 1991, 1995, and 2006.

22 25. In 2009, the Board again initiated proceedings to amend the Bay-Delta Plan. On
23 December 31, 2012, the Board released a Draft SED for public a review and comment. On September
24 15, 2016, the Board recirculated a revised draft SED. On July 6, 2018, the Board released its
25  proposed Final SED.

26 26. On December 12, 2018, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving the
27 Amended Plan. The Amended Plan, among other things, modified the Bay-Delta Plan flow
28 objectives for the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries ("LSJR flow objectives").

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

27. The Amended Plan's LSJR flow objectives include both narrative objectives and
2 numeric flow criteria. The LSJR numeric flow objectives require maintenance of 40% of

3 unimpaired flow ("UIF"), measured on a seven-day running average, for each of the Stanislaus,

4 Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers from February through June, Final SED, App. K, at 25. The

5 narrative objectives require that the Board "[m]aintain inflow conditions [in the relevant reaches]

6 sufficient to support and maintain the natural production of viable native San Joaquin River water

7 shed fish populations migrating through the Delta." Id. at 15.

8 28. The Amended Plan includes "adaptive implementation" measures such as flow

9 shaping and flow shifting. Specifically, the Amended Plan provides that:
10 The percent of unimpaired flow may be adjusted to any value within an adaptive
11 range of 30 to 50% UIF on either a short or long-term basis;
12 The percent of unimpaired flow for February-June may be managed as a total
13 volume of water and released on an adaptive schedule during that period;
14 As long as at least 30% UIF is provided during the February-June time frame,
15 flows may be shifted from the February- June time frame to other times of year
16 to prevent adverse temperature effects; and
17 The February-June Vernalis base flow requirement may be adjusted on an annual
18 or long-term basis to any value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.
19 Id. at 26-27.

20 29. In Chapter 3 of the Final SED, the Board describes "LSJR Alternative 3" as follows:

21 LSJR Alternative 3 implements the 30-50 percent numeric flow water
22 quality objective range by initially requiring maintenance of 40 percent of unimpaired flows at the confluences of each of the
23 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers with the LSJR from February-June based on a 7-day minimum running average. As
24 described above in Section 3.3.3, Adaptive Implementation, the flow

25 requirements could be adaptively adjusted in the same manner for LSJR Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The following discussion describes
26 aspects of adaptive implementation as specifically applied to LSJR Alternative 3.
27 1. Adjust the minimum unimpaired flow objective within a range of
28 30 percent to 50 percent.

ur p.W 2. Implementing this method would allow an increase or decrease of
up to 10 percent in the February-June 40 percent minimum unimpaired flow requirement (with a minimum of 30 percent and maximum of 50 percent).

•
N 3. Manage the February-June percent of unimpaired flow as a total volume of water and release the water on an adaptive schedule

8 during that period where scientific information indicates a flow
pattern different from that which would occur by tracking the

o unimpaired flow percentage, would better protect fish and wildlife

10 beneficial uses. Applying this method, the total volume of water released would be the same as LSJR Alternative 3 without

11 adaptive implementation; however the rate could vary from the actual (7-day running average) unimpaired flow rate and the volume for each month could vary.

12

13 4. Allow a portion of the total February-June unimpaired flow volume to be held and released after June in order to prevent

14 adverse effects to fisheries, including temperature, that would

15 otherwise result from implementation of the February-June flow requirements. If the requirement is greater than 30 percent but less

16 than 40 percent, the amount of flow that may be released after June is limited to the portion of the unimpaired flow requirement

17 over 30 percent. If the requirement is 40 percent or greater, then
released after June. 25 percent of the total volume of the flow requirement may be

18

19 5. The minimum required LSJR base flow objective for February-

20 June of 1,000 cfs, based on a minimum 7-day running average, at Vernalis may be adjusted to a value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.
Final SED at 3-15 to 3-16.

23 describe, or LSJR Alternative 3 is the alternative that the Board adopted as the Amended Plan.

24 The Board's description of LSJR Alternative 3 in Chapter 3 does not mention,

25 otherwise discuss carryover storage targets, or other reservoir controls, that would

26 directly impact the New Melones Project. Nor does its discussion of the potential impacts on

controls.

27 Agricultural Resources (Chapter 11) or Service Providers (Chapter 13) mention such targets or

32.

28 In contrast, the Board's hydrologic modeling used for its impacts analysis assumes
the imposition of a precise 700,000 af end-of-September carryover storage target, maximum storage
withdrawals, and that certain drought-refill criteria are met by the New Melones Project.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

33. Elsewhere in the Final SED, the Board explains that "adaptive implementation" of
2 the LSJR flow objectives and carryover storage targets are necessary to prevent adverse
environmental impacts of the daily unimpaired flow percentage based on a running average of no
4 more than seven days:
Through adaptive implementation, however, a portion of the February-June flows could be shifted to other months to avoid adverse temperature impacts on fish and wildlife. Without this flow shifting there could otherwise be insufficient water available to
achieve temperature criteria in the summer and fall. In addition, when
8 implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board will
9 include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to help ensure that implementation of the flow
10 objectives will not have adverse temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, other beneficial uses, and does not impact
11 supplies of water for minimum health and safety needs, particularly during drought periods.
12 Final SED, Executive Summary, at ES-14.
13
34. In Appendix K to the Final SED, the Board states that
14 When implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board 15 will include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other
16 requirements to help ensure that providing flows to meet the flow objectives will not have significant adverse temperature or other
17 impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, on other beneficial uses.
18 Final SED, App. K, at 28 (emphasis added).

19 35. The Board prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
20 required by law in its review and approval of the Amended Plan and Final SED. The Board's
21 adoption of the Amended Plan and Final SED was arbitrary, lacking in evidentiary support, and
22 contrary to law, for the reasons alleged herein.

23 36. The United States has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course
24 of law. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the Board to set aside its
25 adoption of the Amended Plan and Final SED, the Board's decisions will remain in effect in

26 violation of state law.

27 37. The Board's water quality control planning program is certified regulatory program
28 under section 21080.5 of CEQA. The Board is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1085) (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Provide Accurate, Stable and Finite Project Description)
38.
5 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each

6 and every allegation in paragraphs through 37 of this Petition.

39.
7 In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its

8 discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.
40.
9 The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law, because the Final SED fails

10 to provide "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description." Rio Vista Farm Bureau Ctr. v. Cty.

11 7 of Solano, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 307, 314 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (internal citation omitted).
41.
12 The "project description" for purposes of CEQA constitutes the Board's description

13 of LSJR Alternative 3 in the Final SED.

42.
14 The Board violated CEQA because its project description is inconsistent with its

15 analysis of the project. In brief, the Board modeled and analyzed the environmental effects of a

16 project that is materially different from that described in the project description.
43.
17 The project description lacks any discussion of reservoir controls, yet, when the

18 Board analyzed the impacts of the Amended Plan the Board imposed reservoir controls on the New

19 Melones Project, specifically: (i) a minimum end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000

20 af; (ii) maximum allowable draw from storage over the irrigation season in order to achieve the

21 700,000 af end-of-September carryover storage target; and (iii) end-of-drought storage refill criteria.

22 Final SED, App. F.1, at F.1-31 to 1-32; F.1-36; Final SED, Master Response 3.2: Surface Water

23 Analyses and Modeling, at 49-50.

44.
24 The Board does not, except in the modeling done for its impacts analysis, identify a

25 precise 700,000 af carryover storage target that would apply to the New Melones Project. Final

26 SED, App. F.1, at F.1-36.

27 45. In other places in the Final SED, the Board states it will "include minimum reservoir

28 carryover storage targets or other requirements . . . Final SED, App. K, at 28. The Board also

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

states that a different target, or other measures, may be adopted following a site-specific analysis.
2 Final SED, Master Response 2.1, at 35; Final SED, Master Response 3.2, at 49, 55.

46. The Board also violated CEQA, because it failed to disclose in the project description

4 that the carryover storage targets and reservoir controls it modeled as part of its impacts analysis
were mitigation measures and not part of the project itself.

6 47. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby

7 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

8 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion
9 is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law and/or
10 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore should
11 issue a writ of mandate directing the Board to set aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption
12 of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from implementing them unless and until the Board
13 complies with CEQA.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandate Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1085)
16 (Violation of CEQA-Improper Compression of Impacts and Mitigation)
48. 17 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each

18 and every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 47 of this Petition.
49.
19 In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its

20 discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.
50.
21 The Final SED violates CEQA by unlawfully compressing the analysis of impacts

22 and mitigation measures, specifically with regard to carryover storage targets, in violation of the

23 principle set forth in Lotus V. Department of Transportation, 167 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382, 388, 391 (Cal.

24 Dist. Ct. App. 2014). In other words, CEQA requires impacts of a project to be disclosed without

25 mitigation and the Board failed to do so here.

51.
26 The carryover storage targets are mitigation measures, and the Board consistently

27 describes the carryover storage targets as mitigation or otherwise indicates that the targets constitute

28 mitigation measures.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

52. The Board included carryover storage targets and other reservoir controls in its

2 impacts analysis in order to mask the true potential environmental impacts of the flow objectives.
3 53. The Board's conclusions that the project would not adversely impact water
4 temperature and related water quality conditions were based on an analysis that improperly included
5 mitigation measures, specifically the carryover storage targets, maximum allowable draw from
6 storage, and drought-refill criteria.

7 54. Because mitigation measures are improperly included in the impacts analysis it is
8 impossible for Reclamation or the public to determine the true impact of the Amended Plan,
9 including on river temperatures and related water quality conditions, water supply reliability, flood
10  control and power operations, as well as on recreation at New Melones.
11 55. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
12 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

13 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion
14 is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law and/or
15 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore should
16 issue a writ of mandate directing the Board to set aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption
17 of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from implementing them unless and until the Board
18 complies with CEQA.

19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1085)
21 (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Adequately Evaluate Impacts)
56.
22 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each

23 and every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 55 of this Petition.

57.
24 The Final SED fails to sufficiently evaluate the Amended Plan's significant or

25 potentially significant impacts on the New Melones Project, in particular, the Amended Plan's

26 impacts on temperature and related water quality conditions.
58. 27 According to the Board's technical analysis, the Amended Plan does not result in

28 detrimental impacts on water temperatures in the tributaries and on the mainstem of the San Joaquin

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

r River. But that analysis is fundamentally flawed, because the Board incorporated carryover storage

2 and other reservoir controls, i.e., mitigation measures, into its modeling. Doing so reserved
3 hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water in reservoir storage at New Melones that may otherwise
4 have been used for New Melones Project purposes, and serves to mask the true impacts of the

5 Amended Plan on stream temperatures and related water quality conditions.

6 59. In violation of CEQA, the Board fails to disclose and analyze the impacts the

7 Amended Plan would have on water temperatures and related water quality conditions absent the
8 imposition of an end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000 af. In violation of CEQA,
9 the Board fails to disclose and analyze the impacts the Amended Plan would have on water
10 temperatures and related water quality conditions without the imposition of maximum allowable

11 draw and drought-refill requirements on the New Melones Project.

12 60. The Board also fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the Amended Plan without

13 carryover storage or other reservoir controls on Reclamation's CVP water service contractors. The

14 impacts of the Amended Plan on Reclamation's CVP contractors will exceed the Board's estimated

15 impacts.

16 61. Imposing reservoir controls on top of the water supply impacts of the 40%
17 unimpaired flow objective will mean that even less water is available from the New Melones Project
18 for congressionally authorized purposes. The Board's impacts analysis assumes that water will be
19 distributed out-of-priority such that junior water rights holders do not absorb the entire shortfall.
20 62. The Board fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the reservoir controls it imposes
21 on the New Melones Project by including them as modeling assúmptions in its impacts analysis.
22 63. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
23 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public
24 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion
25 is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law and/or
26 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore should
27 issue a writ of mandate directing the Board to set aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption
28 of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from implementing them unless and until the Board

28

The United States of America, through its undersigned attorneys, by the authority of the Attorney
2 General, and at the request of the United States Department of the Interior, through its Bureau of
3 Reclamation (*Reclamation"), files this action in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1345 and Federal
4

5 Rule of Civil Procedure 81(b) seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the California

6 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., directing Defendants the California

7 State Water Resources Control Board and its Chair, E. Joaquin Esquivel (in his official capacity) to vacate

8 and set aside its December 12, 2018 decision to adopt Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving and adopting

0 amendments to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin
10 Delta Estuary and the related Substitute Environmental Document.
11
I. INTRODUCTION
12
1.
13 On December 12, 2018, the California State Water Resources Control Board ("Board")

14 approved and adopted amendments to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
15 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (*Amended Plan") and the related Substitute Environmental
16 Document ("Final SED").

17 2. The Amended Plan adopts new flow objectives for the Lower San Joaquin River and its
18 tributaries.
19
3.
20 In approving the Amended Plan and Final SED, the Board failed to comply with the

21 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), CAL. PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000-
22 21189.57 (West 2019), in the following ways:

23 The Board failed to provide an accurate, stable, and finite project description, because
24 the Board analyzed a project materially different from the project described in the
25

26 The Amended Plan is found at Appendix K to the Final SED. The Board's website for the Amended
27 Plan is located at: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta(last visited March 28, 2019). The Plan revisions are found at: https://www.waterboards. ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/bay_delta_plan/water_quality_control_planning/20 28 18_sed/docs/appx_k.pdf(last visited March 28, 2019) and also include Change Sheets #1, 2, and 3.

Complaint 2 United States of America V. State Water Resources Control Board

1 project description;
2 The Board improperly masked potential environmental impacts of the Amended Plan
W † 1o by including mitigation measures in the form of carryover storage targets and other
reservoir controls in its impacts analysis and by not analyzing the impacts of the
Amended Plan on the environment without such mitigation measures; and

N The Board failed to adequately analyze the impacts of the Amended Plan, including

8 with respect to water temperature and related water quality conditions, and water
9 supply.
10 4. The United States holds water rights that are managed by Reclamation for the federal New
11
Melones Dam and Reservoir project ("New Melones Project"), located on the Stanislaus River, that is 12

13 subject to the Amended Plan. The New Melones Project is owned by the United States and operated by

14 Reclamation under federal Reclamation laws2 and is a component of the federal Central Valley Project

15 ("CVP").

16 5. The United States will be directly, substantially, and adversely impacted by the Board's
17 actions, which impacts include, but are not limited to, substantial operational constraints on the New
18 Melones Project, loss of available surface water supplies for New Melones Project purposes, including 19

20 CVP water service contracts, and involuntary dedication of federal reservoir space for Board policies and

21 purposes.

22 6. The New Melones Project is located on the Stanislaus River, approximately sixty miles
23 upstream from the river's confluence with the San Joaquin River. The dam was authorized by Congress
24  under the Flood Control Act of 1944, ch. 665, 58 Stat. 887, and re-authorized by the Flood Control Act of
25 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-874, 76 Stat. 1173. While originally authorized as a flood control project, in
26

27

28 2 Act of June 17, 1902, ch. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.

Complaint
United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board 3

1 reauthorizing the dam, Congress mandated that it become an integral part of the CVP, operated and
2 maintained by the Department of the Interior under the federal Reclamation laws. The Flood Control Act
3 of 1962 also included preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife in the New Melones Project, and
4

5 regulation of streamflow for the purpose of downstream water quality control as authorized purposes. Id.

6 at 1191. The dam was completed in 1979.

7 7. The CVP, operated by Reclamation, is "the nation's largest federal water management
8 project." San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. United States, 672 F.3d 676, 681-82 (9th Cir. 2012).

9 The CVP was re-authorized by section 2 of the Act of August 26, 1937, 50 Stat. 850.
10 8. The New Melones Project has a storage capacity of approximately 2.4 million acre feet
11 (*af'). Reclamation has entered into contracts, pursuant to the federal Reclamation laws, with water 12

13 districts for the delivery of water from the New Melones Project for irrigation and municipal and industrial

14 purposes.

15 9. The new flow objectives in the Amended Plan would significantly reduce the amount of
16 water available in New Melones reservoir for meeting congressionally authorized purposes of the New
17 Melones Project, including irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes, power generation, and
18 recreational opportunities at New Melones. The reduced water available for New Melones Project
19

20 purposes would also impair Reclamation's delivery of water under contracts it presently holds with

21 irrigation and water districts.

22 10. The Court should therefore grant the relief sought in this Complaint directing the Board to

23 set aside its approval of the Amended Plan and the Final SED.

24 Il. PARTIES

25 11. Plaintiff is the United States of America. The U.S. Department of the Interior is Cabinet-
26 level agency and the U.S. Burcau of Reclamation is a federal agency within the Department of the Interior.
27
Reclamation operates the New Melones Project as part of the CVP. 28

Complaint 4
United v. States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board

12. Defendants are the State Water Resources Control Board and Board Chair E. Joaquin
2 Esquivel in his official capacity.

III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4
13. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1345 (United States as plaintiff), 28 5

6 U.S.C. § 2201 (declaratory relief), 28 U.S.C. § 2201 (injunctive relief), and 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (necessary

7 and appropriate writs).

8 14. Venue is proper in the Eastern District of California pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1)-

9 (2), because the Board resides in this judicial district, a substantial part of the events or omissions giving
10 rise to the claims asserted herein occurred in this judicial district, and the New Melones Project is situated
11 in this judicial district.
12

13 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

14 15. The United States has. fully exhausted all administrative remedies. The United States

15 submitted comments to the Board on the Amended Plan. Each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this

16 Complaint were raised before the Board by the United States, or by others, prior to the Board's adoption
17 of the Final SED and approval of Amended Plan.
18 V. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
19
16. On December 12, 2018, the Board approved and adopted the Amended Plan and Final 20

21 SED. Pursuant to the California Administrative Procedure Act, Government Code section 11353, the
22 Board then submitted the Amended Plan, together with the administrative record of the action, to the

23 Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") for approval. On February 25, 2019, OAL approved the Amended
24 Plan and the Board's action to approve the Amended Plan became final upon transmission to the Secretary
25 of State for filing.
26 17. On February 26, 2019, the Board filed a Notice of Decision with the Secretary of the 27

28 California Natural Resources Agency, which filing commenced the applicable thirty-day statute of

Complaint
United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board 5

limitations under section 21080.5(g) of the Public Resources Code.

2 18. This Complaint is timely filed in accordance with California Public Resources Code
3 section 21080.5(g).
4
VI. NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT 5
19.
6 Plaintiffhas complied with California Public Resources Code section 21 167.5 by providing

7 written notice of commencement of this action to the Board prior to filing this Complaint. A true and
8 correct copy of the notice with proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

9 VII. ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD
10 20. Plaintiff elects to prepare the CEQA administrative record in this proceeding pursuant to
11 California Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2). A true and correct copy of such notice is 12
attached hereto as Exhibit B. 13

14 VIII. CONCURRENT STATE COURT ACTION AND RULE 81(b) SUBSTITUTE
FEDERAL ACTION
15 21. Plaintiff has concurrently a filed a substantially similar action in California state court in 16
Sacramento County.
17

18 22. Plaintiff files this action in federal district court to preserve its choice of a federal forum to

19 resolve its claims-a choice of forum that Congress established by specifying that "civil actions, suits or
20 proceedings" can be brought in federal court when the United States acts as a plaintiff. 28 U.S.C. § 1345.3

21 This Complaint is a civil action. See also, e.g., United States v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 721 F.2d
22 832 (1st Cir. 1983) (Breyer, J., on panel) (upholding propriety of Section 1345 suit in federal district court
23 directed against Puerto Rico's unlawful attempt to confine to its Commonwealth courts judicial review of 24

25 its refusal to take agency action to allow certain activities at a federal a facility).

26

27 Plaintiff filed the concurrent action in state court only out of an abundance of caution in the event that, for any reason, this action is not adjudicated on the merits in this Court and to ensure that the state statute 28 of limitations was scrupulously complied with.

Complaint 6 United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board

23. Plaintiff anticipates that it may seek to amend this Complaint to bring federal claims against
2 the Board related to the Board's future adoption, implementation, and/or enforcement of the Amended
3 Plan and Final SED.
4
24. In state court, an action seeking review of CEQA errors by the Defendants would be 5

6 pursued under a "petition for a writ of mandate" or "petition for a writ of administrative mandate" under
California Code of Civil Procedure 8§ 1085 or 1094.5, respectively.4 But such California writs are
8 California-specific names for the older (and more commonly called) writ of mandamus. See CAL. CIV.

9 PROC. CODe § 1084 (West 2019) ("Writ of mandamus denominated writ of mandate. The writ of
10 mandamus may be denominated a writ of mandate."); see also generally CAL. CIV. PROC. CODE, pt. 3 "Of
11 Special Proceedings of a Civil Nature", tit. 1 "Of Writs of Review, Mandate, and Prohibition", ch. 2 "Writ 12
of Mandate."
13

14 25. However, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(b) has abolished writs of mandamus in

15 federal district court. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(b) ("Scire Facias and Mandamus. The writs of scire facias

16 and mandamus are abolished. Relief previously available through them may be obtained by appropriate
17 action or motion under these rules.") (emphasis added).
18 26. Hence, this Section 1345 action by the United States as plaintiff is premised on the
19 substitute cause of action for a writ of mandamus established by Rule 81(b). Moreover, it is a basic 20

21 consequence of the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that all questions of procedure in this

22 case should be governed exclusively by those rules and not by the California Code of Civil Procedure.
23 See, e.g., Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 465 (1965) ("[F]ederal courts are to apply state substantive law
24 and federal procedural law"). California CEQA law acts here as the substantive state law with Rule 81(b)
25 providing that a cause of action in federal court to enforce CEQA against Defendants is the appropriate
26

27
And indeed, the concurrent action filed by Plaintiff in state court proceeds under California Code of Civil 28 Procedure §§ 1085 & 1094.5.

Complaint 7 United States of America V. State Water Resources Control Board

1 procedural device carrying forward the merits of this case.

2 27. This action is also premised in the alternative on the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, as
3 interpreted in Stern V. S. Chester Tube Co., 390 U.S. 606 (1968) (holding district court had jurisdiction
4
under the All Writs Act to issue an order in the nature of mandamus). Stern looks past any mandamus 5

6 labels States might apply to the creation of causes of action to enforce state law. Here, such an approach
a 7 permits a federal court to entertain an action ordering Defendants to comply with CEQA.

8 IX. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 28. In 1978 the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
10 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan") pursuant to its water quality authority
11 under California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act (*Porter-Cologne Act"), CAL. WATER CODe §§ 12

13 13000-16104 (West 2019). The Board subsequently amended the Bay-Delta Plan three times: in 1991,

14 1995, and 2006.

15 29. In 2009, the Board again initiated proceedings to amend the Bay-Delta Plan. On December
16 31, 2012, the Board released a Draft SED for public review and comment. On September 15, 2016, the
17 Board recirculated a revised draft SED. On July 6, 2018, the Board released its proposed Final SED.
18 30. On December 12, 2018, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving the
19
Amended Plan. The Amended Plan, among other things, modified the Bay-Delta Plan flow objectives for 20

21 the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries ("LSJR flow objectives").

22 31. The Amended Plan's LSJR flow objectives include both narrative objectives and numeric

23 flow criteria. The LSJR numeric flow objectives require maintenance of 40% of unimpaired flow ("UIF"),
24 measured on a seven-day running average, for each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers from
25 February through June. Final SED, App. K, at 25. The narrative objectives require that the Board
26 "[m]aintain inflow conditions [in the relevant reaches] sufficient to support and maintain the natural 27

28 production of viable native San Joaquin River water shed fish populations migrating through the Delta."

Complaint 8 United States of America V. State Water Resources Control Board

1 Id. at 15.

2 32. The Amended Plan includes "adaptive implementation" measures such as flow shaping
3 and flow shifting. Specifically, the Amended Plan provides that:
4

5 The percent of unimpaired flow may be adjusted to any value within an adaptive range

6 of 30 to 50% UIF on either a short or long-term basis;

7 The percent of unimpaired flow for February-June may be managed as a total volume

8 of water and released on an adaptive schedule during that period;
As long as at least 30% UIF is provided during the February-June time frame, flows
10 may be shifted from the February- June time frame to other times of year to prevent 11
adverse temperature effects; and 12

13 The February--June Vernalis base flow requirement may be adjusted on an annual or

14 long-term basis to any value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.

15 Id. at 26-27.

16 33. In Chapter 3 of the Final SED, the Board describes "LSJR Alternative 3" as follows:
17 LSJR Alternative 3 implements the 30-50 percent numeric flow water
18 quality objective range by initially requiring maintenance of 40 percent of unimpaired flows at the confluences of each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, 19 and Merced Rivers with the LSJR from February-June based on a 7-day
20 minimum running average. As described above in Section 3.3.3, Adaptive Implementation, the flow requirements could be adaptively adjusted in the
21 same manner for LSJR Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The following discussion describes aspects of adaptive implementation as specifically applied to
22 LSJR Alternative 3.

.23 1. Adjust the minimum unimpaired flow objective within a range of 30
24 percent to 50 percent.

25 2. Implementing this method would allow an increase or decrease of up to 10 percent in the February--June 40 percent minimum unimpaired flow
26 requirement (with a minimum of 30 percent and maximum of 50 percent).
27

28 3. Manage the February-June percent of unimpaired flow as a total volume

W
au p of water and release the water on an adaptive schedule during that period where scientific information indicates a flow pattern different from that which would occur by tracking the unimpaired flow percentage, would better protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses. Applying this method, the total volume of water released would be the same as LSJR

N Alternative 3 without adaptive implementation; however the rate could

00 vary from the actual (7-day running average) unimpaired flow rate and

4. Allow a portion of the total February-June unimpaired flow volume to

10 be held and released after June in order to prevent adverse effects to fisheries, including temperature, that would otherwise result from

11 implementation of the February-June flow requirements. If the requirement is greater than 30 percent but less than 40 percent, the

12 amount of flow that may be released after June is limited to the portion

13 of the unimpaired flow requirement over 30 percent. If the requirement is 40 percent or greater, then 25 percent of the total volume of the flow
requirement may be released after June.

15 5. The minimum réquired LSJR base flow objective for February-June of

16 34. 1,000 cfs., based on a minimum 7-day running average, at Vernalis may

14 Final SED at 3-15 to 3-16. be adjusted to a value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.

17 35.

18 LSJR Alternative 3 is the alternative that the Board adopted as the Amended Plan.

19 The Board's description of LSJR Alternative 3 in Chapter 3 does not mention, describe, or

20 or Service Providers (Chapter 13) mention such targets or controls.

21 otherwise discuss carryover storage targets, or other reservoir controls, that would directly impact the New

22 Melones Project. Nor does its discussion of the potential impacts on Agricultural Resources (Chapter 11)

36.

23

24 In contrast, the Board's hydrologic modeling used for its impacts analysis assumes the

25 imposition of a precise 700,000 af end-of-September carryover storage target, maximum
withdrawals, and that certain drought-refill criteria are met by the New Melones Project.

37.

26 storage

27 LSJR flow objectives and carryover storage targets are necessary to prevent adverse environmental

28 seven days: Elsewhere in the Final SED, the Board explains that "adaptive implementation" of the

impacts of tracking the daily unimpaired flow percentage based on a running average of no more than

Complaint
United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board 10

2 Through adaptive implementation, however, a portion of the February-June flows could be shifted to other months to avoid adverse temperature impacts
Un AW on fish and wildlife. Without this flow shifting there could otherwise be insufficient water available to achieve temperature criteria in the summer and fall. In addition, when implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board will include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to help ensure that implementation of the flow objectives

6 will not have adverse temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, other beneficial uses, and does not impact supplies of water for

7 minimum health and safety needs, particularly during drought periods.

8 Final SED, Executive Summary, at ES-14.

38.
9 In Appendix K to the Final SED, the Board states that

10 When implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board will

11 include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other
requirements to help ensure that providing flows to meet the flow

12 objectives will not have significant adverse temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, on other beneficial uses.
13 Final SED, App. K, at 28 (emphasis added).
14 39.

15 The Board's water quality control planning program is a certified regulatory program under

16 section 21080.5 of CEQA. The Board is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for evaluating the

17 environmental impacts of the project under the SED.

18 INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

19 40. The Board prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required
20 by law in its review and approval of the Amended Plan and Final SED. The Board's adoption of the

21

22 Amended Plan and Final SED was arbitrary, lacking in evidentiary support, and contrary to law, for the

reasons alleged herein.
23 41.
24 Injunctive relief is necessary, because unless this Court restrains the Board from taking

25 further action pursuant to its unlawful approval of the Amended Plan irreparable harm will be done to the

26 United States. The United States has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,
27 and pecuniary compensation alone cannot afford adequate and complete relief. See also Stern, 390 U.S.

of law and equity).
t FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Provide Accurate, Stable and Finite Project Description)

42.

6 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and

7 every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 41 of this Complaint.

43.
8 In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its

9 discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.

10 44. The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law, because the Final SED fails to
11 provide "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description." Rio Vista Farm Bureau Ctr. V. Cty. of
12|| Solano, 7 Cal. Rptr. 2d 307, 314 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (internal citation omitted).
13 45.

14 The "project description" for purposes of CEQA constitutes the Board's description of

LSJR Alternative 3 in the Final SED.
15
46.
16 The Board violated CEQA because its project description is inconsistent with its analysis

17 of the project. In brief, the Board modeled and analyzed the environmental effects of a project that is

18 materially different from that described in the project description.

19 47. The project description lacks any discussion of reservoir controls, yet, when the Board

20 analyzed the impacts of the Amended Plan the Board imposed reservoir controls on the New Melones
21

22 Project, specifically: (i) a minimum end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000 af; (ii)

23 maximum allowable draw from storage over the irrigation season in order to achieve the 700,000 af end-

24 of-September carryover storage target; and (iii) end-of-drought storage refill criteria. Final SED, App.

28 The Board does not, except in the modeling done for its impacts analysis, identify a precise
700,000 af carryover storage target that would apply to the New Melones Project. Final SED, App. F.1,

that a different target, or other measures, may be adopted following a site-specific analysis. Final SED,

6 Master Response 2.1, at 35; Final SED, Master Response 3.2, at 49, 55.

7 50. The Board also violated CEQA, because it failed to disclose in the project description that

8 the carryover storage targets and reservoir controls it modeled as part of its impacts analysis were
mitigation measures and not part of the project itself.
10 51. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Court therefore should declare or order the Board to set
12

13 aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from

14 implementing them unless and until the Board complies with CEQA.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA-Improper Compression of Impacts and Mitigation) 16
52. 17 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and

18 every allegation in paragraphs through 51 of this Complaint.

19 53. In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its
20 |l discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.
21 54. The Final SED violates CEQA by unlawfully compressing the analysis of impacts and
22 mitigation measures, specifically with regard to carryover storage targets, in violation of the principle set
23

24 forth in Lotus v. Department of Transportation, 167 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382, 388, 391 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 2014).

25 In other words, CEQA requires impacts of a project to be disclosed without mitigation and the Board

26 failed to do so here.

27 55. The carryover storage targets are mitigation measures, and the Board consistently describes
28 the carryover storage targets as mitigation or otherwise indicates that the targets constitute mitigation

Complaint 13 United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board

measures.

2 56. The Board included carryover storage targets and other reservoir controls in its impacts
3 analysis in order to mask the true potential environmental impacts of the flow objectives.
4
57.
5 The Board's conclusions that the project would not adversely impact water temperature

6 and related water quality conditions were based on an analysis that improperly included mitigation

7 measures, specifically the carryover storage targets, maximum allowable draw from storage, and drought-

8 refill criteria.

9 58. Because mitigation measures are improperly included in the impacts analysis it is
10 impossible for Reclamation or the public to determine the true impact of the Amended Plan, including on
11 river temperatures and related water quality conditions, water supply reliability, flood control and power 12

13 operations, as well as on recreation at New Melones.

14 59. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
15 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Court therefore should declare or order the Board to set
16 aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from
17 implementing them unless and until the Board complies with CEQA.
18
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
19 (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Adequately Evaluate Impacts)

20 60. The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set. forth herein, each and
21 every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 59 of this Complaint.
22 61. The Final SED fails to sufficiently evaluate the Amended Plan's significant or potentially 23

24 significant impacts on the New Melones Project, in particular, the Amended Plan's impacts on temperature

25 and related water quality conditions.

26 62. According to the Board's technical analysis, the Amended Plan does not result in
27 detrimental impacts on water temperatures in the tributaries and on the mainstem of the San Joaquin River.
28 But that analysis is fundamentally flawed, because the Board incorporated carryover storage and other

Complaint 14 United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board

1 reservoir controls, i.e., mitigation measures, into its modeling. Doing so reserved hundreds of thousands

2 of acre feet of water in reservoir storage at New Melones that may otherwise have been used for New
3 Melones Project purposes, and serves to mask the true impacts of the Amended Plan on stream
4
temperatures and related water quality conditions. 5
63.
6 In violation of CEQA, the Board fails to disclose and analyze the impacts the Amended

7 Plan would have on water temperatures and related water quality conditions absent the imposition of an
8 end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000 af. In violation of CEQA, the Board fails to disclose

9 and analyze the impacts the Amended Plan would have on water temperatures and related water quality
10 conditions without the imposition of maximum allowable draw and drought-refill requirements on the
11
New Melones Project.
12
64.
13 The Board also fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the Amended Plan without

14 carryover storage or other reservoir controls on Reclamation's CVP water service contractors. The
15 impacts of the Amended Plan on Reclamation's CVP contractors will exceed the Board's estimated

16 impacts.

17 65. Imposing reservoir controls on top of the water supply impacts of the 40% unimpaired flow
18 objective will mean that even less water is available from the New Melones Project for congressionally
19

20 authorized purposes. The Board's impacts analysis assumes that water will be distributed out-of-priority

21 such that junior water rights holders do not absorb the entire shortfall.

22 66. The Board fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the reservoir controls it imposes on
23 the New Melones Project by including them as modeling assumptions in its impacts analysis.

24 67. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
25 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The Court therefore should declare or order the Board to set
26 aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from
27

28 implementing them unless and until the Board complies with CEQA.

Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and California Evidence Code § 1152 Settlement Privileged

Re: United States of America v. State Water Resources Control Board, United States
District Court for the Eastern District of California & Sacramento County Superior
Court

To the Governor and Attorney General of the State of California:

Pursuant to section 388 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and Public Resources Code .o
21167.7, this letter constitutes timely notice of similar federal and state court lawsuits to be filed today, March 28, 2019, on behalf of the United States of America against the California State Water Resources Control Board (the "Board"), alleging violations of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").'

The lawsuits challenge the Board's approval and adoption of amendments to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento San Joaquin Delta Estuary and related Final
Substitute Environmental Document on CEQA grounds and seeks a declaration and injunction in federal court and a writ of mandate in state court directing the Board to: (a) vacate and set aside its Final SED and any adoption and approvals thereof; (b) suspend all activity under its approval of the Amended Plan and Final SED, including action to commence an implementation phase of

1 By including notice of the federal lawsuit in this letter, the United States of America is showing the State comity but, to be clear, the United States reserves all of its rights to insist on application
of federal law exclusively to all matters of procedure in the federal court suit.

the Amended Plan until the Board has taken action to bring the Final SED into compliance with CEQA; and (c) prepare, circulate, and consider a revised and legally adequate SED and otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the Amended Plan.

Due to the unavoidably short statute of limitations period for CEQA claims that is imminently set to expire, the Department of Justice was unable to provide notice of this action before today. See Justice Manual 1-10.100; ENRD Directive No. 2016-01. The Department looks forward to the opportunity to discuss the possibility of settlement with the Board after these lawsuits have been filed. If the State of California would like to discuss settlement, please reach out to Romney Philpott at 303-844-1810 or Romney.Philpott@usdoj.gov.

Very truly yours,
