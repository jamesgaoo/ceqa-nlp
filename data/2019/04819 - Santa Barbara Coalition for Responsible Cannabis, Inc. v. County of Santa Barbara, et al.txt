VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 1

1 INTRODUCTION

2
1. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. ("Coalition") challenges
3 the County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara's
4 (collectively "the County" or "Respondents") approval of the Hoop Structure Ordinance
5 Amendment (Project), and certification of the Final Program Environmental Impact Report
6 (EIR) for the Project. The Project involves an amendment to the County of Santa Barbara's
7 Land Use and Development Code (LUDC) to exempt most agricultural hoop structures from
8
County permit requirements.
9
2. The Project will significantly and adversely impact the environment in various respects.
10 The EIR identifies eleven significant impacts associated with the new permissive rules for the
11 plastic-coated agricultural structures four Class 1 unavoidable adverse impacts to the visual
12 environment, one Class 1 unavoidable adverse impact from plastic waste generation, five Class
13 II significant but mitigable to biological resources, and one Class II significant but mitigable
14 impact regarding water resources and flooding. These significant impacts include both direct
15 and cumulative impacts.
16
3. County decisionmakers including the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors
17 directed repeated changes both to the Project Description and to mitigation measures the EIR
18 identified as necessary to reduce significant impacts and comply with the California
19 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Staff analysis was then prepared as post-hoc justification
20 for the changes without the level of analysis or public review process that CEQA requires.
21
4. The County acted contrary to CEQA in, inter alia: certifying the EIR without requiring
22 recirculation for public and agency review of substantial Project changes, significant new
23 information, and feasible mitigation measures the County declined to implement; approving a
24 Project with significant unmitigated impacts without requiring feasible mitigation measures; and
25 making findings that lack substantial evidence to support them. Additional and more specific
26 allegations of CEQA non-compliance are detailed in the first cause of action, below.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 2

1 5. Petitioner brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus on its own behalf, and on behalf of

2 its members, and on behalf of the general public under California Code of Civil Procedure

3 §1094.5 and alleges as follows:

4

5 PARTIES

6
6. Petitioner hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set forth
7
herein.
8
7. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. is a California Public
9 Benefit Corporation whose purposes include protecting the interests of neighborhoods,
10 communities and others affected by unpermitted hoop structures, upholding the County's
11 General Plan and zoning ordinances and enforcing CEQA when actions adversely affect 12 neighborhoods, communities and others from inadequate environmental and public review
13 processes. The Coalition, through its members and representatives, participated in the
14 proceedings below, including submittal of written and oral comments to Respondent Board of
15 Supervisors. Petitioner is interested in preserving of the integrity of the environment in the
16 County of Santa Barbara including its viewsheds, community character, and compatibility
17 between land uses. Petitioner's interests will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA
18
and the approval of the Project.
19
8. Respondent County of Santa Barbara is organized under the laws and Constitution of the
20 State of California. The County is empowered, among other duties, to provide for the orderly
21 planning and management of land use within its borders, including amendment of County land
22 use ordinances, subject to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal and
23 other laws, including CEQA. The County is the lead agency under CEQA. The County
24
includes the Long Range Planning Division of the Planning and Development Department,
25 which was responsible for developing the proposed ordinance amendment language, preparing
26 the EIR, and processing the ordinance amendment through the County process.
27
9. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara is the highest
28 governing authority of the County of Santa Barbara, exercising legislative authority over

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 3

1 County land use matters and controlling, through the Chair of the Board, the conduct of the

2 Board of Supervisors' hearings generally and specifically the hearing which led to the approval

3 of the Project.

4 10. DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are officers, agents or employees of Respondent Santa

5 Barbara County, or other unknown persons, entities or agencies with an interest in the subject

6 matter of this dispute. The identities and capacities of such DOES are unknown to Petitioner at

7 this time. Petitioner will seek leave to amend this Petition to identify the true name and

8 capacity of each such person when identified.
9

10 STANDING

11 11. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully set forth

12 herein.

13 12. Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR will adversely affect the interests of

14 Petitioner's members. Petitioner's members reside, visit, operate businesses, and own property

15 in and adjacent to agriculturally zoned lands that are affected by the Project, and would be

16 adversely impacted by the Project including by the Project's identified Class I significant and

17 unavoidable impacts to the visual environment. Additionally, Petitioner's members would be

18 adversely impacted by the Project's stripping away of the opportunity to receive notice, review
19 findings, participate, and to appeal proposed hoop structure use that significantly and adversely

20 impacts the environment in communities where Petitioner's members reside, visit, operate

21 businesses, and/or own property. Petitioner's members and representatives and other members

22 of the public have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of CEQA compliance, and

23 have participated at public hearings before the Board of Supervisors and Planning Commission.

24 Accordingly, Petitioner and its members are "aggrieved persons" within the meaning of Public

25 Resources Code Section 21177.

2 STATEMENT OF FACTS

3
21. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully set forth
4
herein.
5
22. The Santa Barbara County Land Use and Development Code (LUDC) defines a hoop
6 structure as "[a] structure consisting of a light-weight, frame with no permanent structural
7 elements (e.g., footings, foundations, plumbing, electrical wiring) and an impermeable,
8 removable covering used to protect plants grown in the soil or in containers upon the soil.
9 Includes structures commonly known as berry hoops and hoop houses" (LUDC Section
10 35.110.020). Hoop structures are not specifically identified as allowable uses on lands zoned
11 for agriculture (LUDC Section 35.21.030, Table 2-1) and thus are subject to discretionary
12 permit. The County regulates hoop structures pursuant to LUDC Section 35.42.140 which
13 requires a Land Use Permit (LUP) for less than 20,000 square feet of hoop structures, and a
14 Development Plan for 20,000 square feet or more of hoop structures, which also requires
15 environmental review and a hearing before the Planning Commission (LUDC Section
16 35.42.140). (EIR, pp. 2-1- 2-2.)
17
23. The County Building Code first exempted from building permit "readily removable
18 plastic covered hoop structures without in ground footings or foundations that are not more than
19 12 feet in height" in 2011. On April 19, 2016, the Board of Supervisors adopted an amendment
20 to the County Building Code that increased the maximum allowable height - from 12 feet to 20
21 feet - without the issuance of a building permit. The Board did not amend the LUDC and hoop
22 structures were still subject to planning permit requirements.
23
24. The Board of Supervisors included the Project in the Long Range Planning Division's
24 2017-2018 Annual Work Program, directing an ordinance amendment to exempt hoop
25 structures from planning permits in the Inland Area consistent with the Building Code
26 exemption from building permits. (EIR p. 2-2.)
27
25. On June 6, 2017 the Board considered options for the hoop structures ordinance
28 amendment project. Of five potential options identified in the Board Letter, County Staff

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 6

1 recommended an option which would have amended the LUDC to allow hoop structures of all

2 sizes, while maintaining the current definition of hoop structure and providing for operational

3 standards to address impacts related to visual impacts and/or storm water runoff and drainage.

4 (6/6/17 Board Letter, pp. 5-6.) Instead of following Staff's recommendation and calls from the

5 public for CEQA review, the Board voted 3-2 to interpret hoop structures as "farm equipment"

6 exempt from land use planning and permits, and thereby avoid both the ordinance amendment
process and CEQA review (id., p. 3) and to direct the Planning and Development Director to
issue such a determination. The Director's determination interpreting hoop structures as exempt
farm equipment was timely appealed on CEQA and procedural grounds, and prior to a hearing
10 on that appeal, the Board of Supervisors voted to change course, withdraw the Director's
11 determination, and instead pursue an ordinance amendment.

12 26. The County prepared a Draft EIR that it released for public comment on January 30,
13 2018. The Draft EIR identified four Class 1 unavoidable adverse impacts to the visual
14 environment, one Class 1 unavoidable adverse impact from plastic waste generation, five Class
15 II significant but mitigable to biological resources, and one Class II significant but mitigable

16 impact regarding water resources and flooding. The draft EIR identified mitigation measures to

17 address these significant impacts.

18 27. The County Planning Commission held six hearings on the proposed ordinance
19 amendment beginning on May 30, 2018. The initial recommendation from County Staff

20 included all seven mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR dated May 2018. After
21 conducting public hearings however the Commission ultimately recommended revisions to the

22 ordinance amendment, and on January 30, 2019, recommended that the Board: (1) reject two
23 aesthetic/visual resources mitigation measures as infeasible (MM-VIS-1 and MM-VIS-2); (2)

24 delete two mitigation measures based on new evidence indicating that the measures would not

25 be necessary or effective (MM-WR-1 and MM-BIO-2); and (3) revise three mitigation measures
26 (MM-VIS-3, MM-BIO-1, and MM-BIO-3). The Commission also recommended adding a new
27 mitigation measure in the form of a 20% slope criterion for the permit exemption as to reduce

28 the Project's visual impacts. The Planning Commission was presented with the first version of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 a FEIR Revision Letter, denoted RV-01 and dated January 30, 2019, that reported the

2 subsequent changes to the project and environmental analysis.

3 28. County staff addressed the changes directed by the Planning Commission in a second

4 EIR Revision Document RV-01 dated March 12, 2019 which concludes that no new significant

5 environmental impacts would result and no substantial increase in the severity of an

6 environmental impact would result. The Commission recommended that the Board certify the

7 Final EIR and Revision Document RV-01 and approve the revised ordinance amendment

8 incorporating these changes.

9 29. The Board of Supervisors considered the Project on March 12, 2019 and April 9, 2019.

10 30. On March 12, 2019 the Board considered a third version of Revision Document RV-01

11 dated March 12, 2019, and after receiving a Staff Report and presentation and extensive public

12 testimony, deliberated and took conceptual action. The Board conceptually approved a revised

13 version of the Project that downgraded the levels of land use permits required, weakening both

14 the substantive content of the permits and the procedural requirements for issuance of permits

15 for non-exempt Hoop Structures and made other significant changes from the ordinance

16 analyzed in the EIR, impacting the effectiveness of mitigation measures and expanding the

17 Project's adverse environmental impacts. Specifically, the Board altered the permit thresholds

18 applicable to hoop structures less than 20 feet in height that fail to meet the exemption criteria,

19 replacing the Development Plan with a LUP for one class of non-exempt, significantly

20 impactful hoop structures in visually sensitive areas and downgrading a discretionary LUP to a

21 ministerial Zoning Clearance for another class of non-exempt, significantly impactful hoop

22 structures in visually sensitive areas. A Zoning Clearance is issued by the Planning and

23 Development Department Director with no public notice, no findings and is non-appealable.

24 The Board's conceptual approval adopted the Planning Commission's recommended new

25 mitigation measure that disallowed exempt hoops on slopes in excess of 20%, but narrowed the

26 mitigation measure so that it only applied to slopes in excess of 30%.

27 31. On April 9, 2019, the Board again considered action based on the fourth version of RV-
28 01 dated April 9, 2019, but after receiving public comment and closing the public hearing, madel

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 8

further changes to the ordinance, including modifying the slope criterion from 30% to 25%,
made further revisions to the April 9, 2019 version of RV-01 and amended the Project's Generall
Plan policy consistency analysis during the hearing. These changes were then adopted by the
Board.

32. Respondents have abused their discretion and have failed to comply with the law in the

6 following ways:
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)
33. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully set forth
10 herein.

11 34. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA
12 by certifying the EIR for the Project without recirculating a legally adequate draft EIR for
13 public and agency review after meaningful public review and comment were precluded by the
14 addition of last minute Project Changes and New Information that substantially increased the
15 Project's significant aesthetic and land use impacts. Specifically, the downshift in permitting
16 levels from Development Plan to LUP and from LUP to Zoning Clearance will have

17 substantially increased physical impacts on the environment, resulting from lesser findings and
18 levels of review and lesser public involvement. The EIR relies on these County processes and
19 the opportunity for public notice and input to support its conclusions regarding the significance
20 of various significant impacts, including Impact LU-2: Land Use Compatibility and Impact
21 VIS-1: Visual Character Changes. The bare conclusions articulated in the EIR revision
22 document (i.e. "The change of permit type is procedural and would not increase the severity of
23 environmental impacts identified in the Final EIR.") does not consider the level of review,
24 findings, process and potential for administrative review necessary for informed
25 decisionmaking and public participation or to achieve the mitigation of mitigable significant
26 Project impacts, and do not include substantial evidence supporting a finding that the changes

27 do not require recirculation of the EIR.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 35. The County's failure to recirculate the EIR after the Planning Commission's

2 identification and recommendation of a new mitigation measure based on slope criteria, in
addition to the serial and circular revisions to the Project Description, mitigation measures and
scope of the Ordinance exemptions deprived the public of the ability to comment on these

5 significant Project changes and revised and new mitigation measures. The serially amended

6 Revision Letters reflected a moving target for the public to understand and respond to, and the
failure to accept and respond to the public's comments on Project Description and mitigation
measure revisions deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on the Project's
substantial adverse environmental effects and to either respond to new, revised, and removed

10 feasible mitigation measures to mitigate or avoid the Project's significant impacts through

11 meaningful alternatives analysis. Collectively, the various changes to the Project Description

12 and mitigation measures constitute significant new information requiring recirculation under

13 CEQA.

14 36. Additionally, the public and other affected industries have identified a number of

15 significant impacts including odor, glare, public safety, neighborhood incompatibility and other

16 impacts that are either unique or especially pronounced with the use of hoop structures for

17 cannabis as opposed to traditional crops like berries. The draft and final EIR provided, in

18 response to public comments on the topic and elsewhere, that Cannabis in hoops would be

19 regulated separately by the proposed Cannabis Land Use Ordinance and Licensing Program,

20 which would require permits and licensing of cannabis cultivation for any method of cultivation

21 (e.g., outdoor, hoop structure, greenhouse). However, new information identified at the Board

22 of Supervisors contradicts the assumptions in the EIR and establishes that that hoops meeting

23 the exemption criteria could be added to already-permitted outdoor cannabis operations without

24 any additional permit process and that cannabis cultivation operations could secure land use

25 permits without including any exempt hoop structure in their permit's Project Description, then

26 add hoop structures to their operations under the Hoop Structures Ordinance exemptions. This

27 reversal of position and direct conflict between the assumptions in the EIR and the County's

28 declarations of applicability of the Hoops exemptions for cannabis cultivation operations

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 10

1 announced during the Ordinance adoption process constitutes significant new information and
requires additional environmental analysis and the opportunity for the public to meaningfully
comment on this highly controversial issue that has the potential to severely impact the
environment.

37. The Board's determination that significant impacts are avoided to the maximum extent
feasible, including findings that certain mitigation measures are infeasible, are not supported by

7 substantial evidence. An agency shall not decide to approve or carry out a project with

8 significant environmental effects unless the agency has "Eliminated or substantially lessened all

9 significant effects on the environment where feasible as shown in findings under Section
10 15091". (CEQA Guidelines § 15092.) Here, there are specific feasible means of reducing the
11 Project's significant impacts that the Board declined to incorporate. For example, reducing the
12 slope requirement from 25% to 10% would substantially reduce the Project's Class visual
13 impact, and was determined by the Planning Commission to be a feasible means of reducing the

14 Project's visual impacts. A Planning Commissioner and berry-growing member of the
15 agricultural community stated that there were recycling programs available for agricultural

16 plastics, including films used for hoop structures, that he used routinely, however the EIR and

17 findings concluded one recycling program had ended and, despite finding the volume of waste

18 plastic was expected to increase, there was no feasible mitigation measures to reduce the

19 Project's Class I Resource Recovery and Solid Waste impacts. Other mitigation measures were
20 deemed infeasible based largely on one commenter's policy objections to the ordinance without
21 any attempt to identify other mitigation measures or alternatives that might also feasibly reduce
22 the significant impacts or allowing the public an opportunity to do so in public comments. RV-

23 01 merely references that MM-VIS & 2 would have "negative consequences for cultivated

24 agriculture" and based thereon be infeasible. The record contains no evidence of the severity or

25 economic magnitude of the "negative consequence." Virtually every mitigation measure
26 identified by any EIR could have some "negative consequence" on a regulated entity or

27 applicant, yet this is not an adequate basis to throw out all mitigation as occurred here.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 11

1 38. RV-01 and the findings fail to address cannabis, which is not cultivated agriculture.

2 Cannabis grows typically entail relatively small grows (compared to berries) on larger parcels

3 and thus for which this alleged evidence of the infeasibility of these buffers is inapplicable. The

4 revised findings do not include substantial evidence supporting the infeasibility of rejected

5 mitigation measures and other alternative means of reducing the Project's significant adverse

6 environmental impacts including increased buffers, reduced slope requirements, vegetation

7 screening and other mitigation measures that could be employed at cannabis cultivation

8 operations.

9 39. Overall, the Board's findings lack reference to evidence supporting them, including the

10 lack of substantial evidence supporting findings that the EIR's mitigation measures are

11 infeasible, or of the unavailability of other mitigation measures or alternatives that could reduce

12 the significance of the Project's impacts.
13 40. The Board's serial, after-the-fact rejection of nearly every mitigation measure identified

14 in the EIR thwarted CEQA's mandatory requirement that mitigation measures be considered

15 that can either avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce or compensate for significant Project impacts.

16 The Board ran roughshod over CEQA and the environmental review process, making

17 significant changes to the Project Description that triggered significant impacts, revising and

18 eliminating mitigation measures that had been identified as competent to reduce the severity of

19 significant Project impacts, and rejecting recirculation of the EIR for public comment, rendering

20 the EIR process ineffective and prejudicing the public and Petitioner.

21 41. The Board's Statement of Overriding Considerations asserting that overriding benefits of

22 the Project outweigh the Project's significant effects on the environment is not supported by

23 substantial evidence either as to cultivated agriculture, for which no evidence of economic

24 impact or the scope of "negative consequences" is included, or pertaining to the use of hoops

25 for cannabis. Specifically, the Statement relies on benefits to agriculture, when pursuant to the

26 County's Right to Farm Ordinance provides " *'Agricultural use' does not include any activity,

27 recreational or medicinal, including the cultivation. .. of cannabis and cannabis products of

28 cannabis in accordance with Chapter 35, Zoning, of the Santa Barbara County Code."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 12

1 42. The EIR fails to include a stable Project Description as required by CEQA. CEQA
2 prohibits agencies from using a shifting or unstable Project Description because it results in a
3 moving target for the environmental analysis and hinders the public's ability comment. After

4 preparation of the Final EIR, the Board altered the Project Description in a fundamental way by

5 lowering the permit thresholds in a manner that will materially reduce the County's discretion

6 and constrain its ability to condition hoop structure development to avoid or reduce
environmental impacts including aesthetic impacts. For example, allowing non-exempt hoop
structures to be approved with a Zoning Clearance, entailing no public notice, no hearing
process, no findings and no opportunity to appeal also hinders the ability of the public including
10 impacted nearby landowners, neighbors and other affected businesses and industries to

11 participate in the County's process and identify concerns regarding a given hoop proposal's
12 environmental impacts and land use compatibility. These ongoing, serial and last-minute
13 changes to the Project Description have precluded meaningful public comment and undermined

14 the adequacy of the environmental analysis.
15 43. Changes to the Project's setting that establish that the Project will have greater and new

16 significant impacts were ignored by the County. The EIR assumed a lesser amount of cannabis

17 in the County in identifying the Project's potentially significant impacts to visual, solid waste,
18 water supply, erosion and community compatibility, while on the ground at the time of EIR

19 certification, the number and size of cannabis cultivation sites has increased substantially,

20 entailing a number of additional impacts not considered in the EIR. Combined with the newly-
21 announced ability of cannabis operations to use the Project's exemptions to avoid permit

22 requirements for hoops over cannabis, the environmental setting has changed dramatically

23 insofar as cannabis cultivation is concerned, necessitating recirculation of the EIR with updated

24 and more accurate and complete information regarding the scale of cannabis' industry's use of

25 hoops and the impacts upon the community from the application of the Project at cannabis
26 cultivation operations.

27 44. The EIR failed to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant

28 impacts to the visual environment. The EIR provides "While it is common for residential and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 13

1 private property owner viewers to be concerned about view impacts to private property, only

2 public views are subject to analysis in this document and private views are not protected by

3 County policy." (EIR p. 4.2-6) The EIR further provides "All views addressed in the County's

4 Environmental Thresholds and Guidelines Manual are public views, not private views" (EIR p.

5 4.2-15), which is reflected in the EIR's analysis (see e.g. p. 4.2-18'). However the law is clear

6 that where there are also impacts to public views, the EIR must evaluate impacts to private

7 views as well. The record contains extensive evidence on the severity of the adverse impacts to

8 views from roadways, public recreational trails and other public viewing places. According the

9 EIR's visual impact analysis is legally inadequate.

10 45. The EIR failed to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant land

11 use impacts, including conflicts with community plan policies. The EIR understates the acreagel

12 of hoops anticipated to be used for cannabis, which are more likely to occur on visually

13 prominent, steeper slope hillsides than hoops for traditional crops such as berries which are

14 sited on flatter lands. The EIR fails to identify potentially significant land use impacts related to

15 the incompatibility of cannabis grown in hoops including odor impacts. Mitigation measures

16 identified in the draft EIR including minimum setbacks from the urban boundary lines of the

17 unincorporated townships including Santa Ynez, Ballard, and Los Olivos, were rejected by

18 County decisionmakers and stripped from the final EIR based on evidence that is patently

19 inapplicable to cannabis cultivation. Alternative ordinances that differentiated the standards for

20 cannabis versus other crops that would have avoided these impacts were summarily rejected by

21 the Board.

22 46. The EIR failed to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant

23 impacts in the area of resource recovery and solid waste. Despite evidence in the form of

24

25 EIR p. 5.2-19 ("EDRNs are predominantly enclaves of private lots (principally ranchette and
26 low density residential) accessed by private roadways. Views of adjacent crop protection

27 structures from EDRNs would predominantly be from private viewing locations (private residences and roadways). While this could represent a change in visual character with regard to

28 private views, the County Comprehensive Plan does not protect private views, and visual resource policies in the Plan do not address the importance of visual impacts experienced from private property such as backyards, front yards, interior living spaces, or private roadways.")
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 14

testimony from a Santa Maria berry grower that there are a number of companies that collect
and recycle agricultural plastic waste from Santa Barbara County farmers at no cost, and the
3 FEIR states that there is "an entire industry (global) dedicated to developing new technologies
for agricultural plastics," "certain plastics are readily recyclable" "incentivized recycling
programs could reduce solid waste impacts" and even reciting "an available local market for
1O recycling agricultural plastics", the County found that the impact of disposing nearly 500 tons
of hoop waste annually in local landfills could not be mitigated.
47. The defects in the EIR's Project Description, impact analysis, mitigation measures and

9 setting preclude an adequate cumulative impact analysis, and the identification of potential

10 mitigation measures to address the Project's cumulative impacts.

11 48. The EIR included legally inadequate responses to comment, including comments

12 regarding visual impacts and land use incompatibilities associated with the use of hoops for

13 cannabis adjacent to urban areas. Public commenters identified a host of significant

14 environmental issues that required a response pursuant to CEQA's authority governing the

15 response to comments on EIRs. (See CEQA Guidelines 15088.) Unfortunately the County's

16 responses to a number of important comments were non-responsive or inadequate, such as the

17 response to comments raised by the City of Goleta regarding visual impacts and land use

18 incompatibilities associated with the use of hoops for cannabis adjacent to urban areas. (See

19 Responses to Comment 2, EIR pp. 9-7-9-8.) Notably, the City of Goleta identified significant

20 environmental issues with respect to the need for minimum notice and process safeguard

21 associated both with the proposed exemption and potential Zoning Clearance, that were not

22 responded to in the RTC which stated incorrectly that "The comment pertains to the merits of

23 the project, rather than the adequacy of the EIR, and will be forwarded to County decision-

2. makers for their consideration." (Comment Response 2-4, EIR p. 9-7.) The failure to respond

25 to these and other important comments raising significant environmental issues undermines the

26 adequacy of the EIR, as failure to comply with required response-to-comment procedures are

27 grounds for finding the EIR inadequate and reversing the Lead Agency's project approval.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 15

1 49. Individually and collectively, new information added to the Project's EIR is significant as

2 defined by CEQA, necessitating recirculation. Recirculation is necessary for the public and

3 other agencies opportunity to evaluate the new data and validity of conclusions drawn from it.

4 The new information shows new significant Project environmental impacts from the permit

5 downshifting and other changed elements of the Project. The new information shows a

6 substantial increase in the severity of the Project's adverse environmental impacts from the

7 elimination of many mitigation measures. The new information includes a new mitigation

8 measure found feasible by the Board (slope criterion less than 25%) that would reduce the

9 Project's impacts as to cultivated agriculture and separately to cannabis that was rejected by the

10 Board. In sum, the DEIR was fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature

11 that it was essentially meaningless, with significant changes being adopted in the Final EIR and

12 a series of RV-01s that precluded meaningful public comment. These changes and new
13 information were major, not minor, resulted in failure to evaluate critical issues, and did not

14 constitute a simple clarification but wholesale and substantial changes. The failure to circulate

15 an adequate EIR with a stable Project Description and robust impact analysis also precluded an

16 adequate alternatives analysis, and the ability of the public to comment upon this analysis and

17 offer additional alternatives.

18 50. As a direct consequence of these serial defects and improper actions, the public was

19 materially prejudiced by their inability to review, comment and participate in a matter of

20 County-wide significance. Further, because the Board's findings that all significant
21 environmental impacts have been eliminated or found to be unavoidable are not based on

22 substantial evidence in the record and relied on a flawed environmental document, the Board

23 proceeded in violation of CEQA and prejudiced the interests of the public in approving the

24 Project.

25

26 51. For all the above reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to

27 proceed in accordance with law.
