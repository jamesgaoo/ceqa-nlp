1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Coalition to Save San Marin ("Petitioner") challenges Respondent Novato

3 Unified School District's ("District") October 10, 2019 approval and certification of Stadium

4 Lights Project ("Project') and Revised Environmental Impact Report ("REIR") as contrary to the

5 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.

6 2. The District prepared and certified the REIR in response to the Writ of Mandate issued by

7 this Court in this action on January 30, 2019 (*Writ of Mandate"). The Writ of Mandate set aside

8 the District's original May 30, 2017 approval of the Project as contrary to CEQA on a number of

9 grounds relating to the failure of the Project's original Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") to

10 adequately assess the impacts to the surrounding environment of a lighted facility operating in the

11 fall and winter evenings until times ranging from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

12 3. Petitioner challenges the REIR because the District has not met its burden under CEQA to

13 provide an adequate assessment of the impacts of the Project on aesthetics due to light pollution,

14 particularly with respect to glare and light spill impacts on neighboring communities and the

15 surrounding environment. Following certification of the REIR, the District filed a return on the

16 writ on October 11, 2019. Petitioner's challenge to this return by way of a Supplemental Petition

17 for Writ of Mandate in the same court as issued the writ is permissible under City of

18 Carmel-by-the-Sea v. Board of Supervisors (1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 964, 971.

19 II. PARTIES

20 3. Petitioner Coalition to Save San Marin is a mutual association of concerned local citizens

21 living in and around the community of Novato, California, in Marin County. Petitioner was formed

22 in response to the District's proposal to approve a lighted stadium for games and events at San Marin

23 High School. Petitioner and its members provided oral and written comments to the District on the

24 Project. Petitioner's members are volunteers promoting well-planned growth and development in a

25 manner that protects the local environment, communities and the health and safety of its citizens.

26 4. Respondent Novato Unified School District is and was at all times relevant to this action the

27 governmental entity responsible for reviewing and approving the REIR challenged in this action.

28 5. The true names and capacities of Respondent Does 1-10 are not presently known to Petitioner.

Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Casc No. Civ. 1702295.

1 Petitioner may amend this Petition to add said Does at such time as they are discovered.

2 III. JURISDICTION AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

3 6. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 & Public

4 Resources Code § 21168.

5 7. Petitioner Coalition to Save San Marin was formed by concerned local citizens prior to the

6 District's approval of the Project. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this

7 instant action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required

8 by law. Petitioner and its members provided written and oral comments to the District during the

9 administrative phase of the REIR related to each of the claims raised in this Supplemental Petition.

10 8. On October 15, 2019, Petitioner's attorney emailed and mailed a Notice of Commencement

11 of Action letter pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.5 informing the District of its intent to

- 12 file legal action challenging the District's approval of the REIR. (See Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)

13 9. On October 16, 2019 Petitioner's attorney mailed a copy of its Supplemental Verified Petition

14 to the Attorney General to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private

15 attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)

16 10. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy in the course of law unless this Court grants the

17 requested supplemental writ of mandate. Petitioner's challenge to the REIR by way of a supplemental

18 petition is permissible under City of Carmel-by-the-Sea v. Board of Supervisors (1982) 137

19 Cal.App.3d 964, 971. In the absence of such remedy, the District's REIR approval will remain in

20 effect in violation of law.

21 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

22 A. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

23 11. The Project is located at San Marin High School ("SMHS"), in Novato, California.

24 12. The immediate area around the Project area is composed of a combination of residential

25 neighborhoods and unlighted natural open space preserves, including Mt. Burdell, Little Mountain,

26 and Verissimo Hills. San Marin Drive borders the school to the east and Novato Boulevard borders

27 the school to the south. The City's approximately 98-acre O'Hair Park, which includes equestrian

28 facilities at Morning Star Farm, the Dogbone Meadow dog park, and trails through open space areas,

2
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 is located across Novato Boulevard south of the school. The Dwarf Oak Trail to Mt. Burdell and

2 single-family residences on Sandy Creek Way abut- the school site to the west. Single-family

3 residences on San Ramon Way are located north of the school, while multi-family residences on
Aspen Drive are to the northeast. The nearest residences are located approximately 120 feet north and

5 northeast of the stadium track. Novato Creek runs through O'Hair Park approximately one-quarter

6 mile south of the stadium.

7 13. The environment around the Project site is relatively dark in the evening, with artificial light

8 sources mainly limited to street lights against a very dark backdrop formed by undeveloped hillsides

9 and ridges. The developed land is suburban but the visual quality of the area has a rural feel owing

10 to the hillsides, street design and landscaping, and land uses such as the riding stables. The segment

11 of Novato Boulevard adjoining SMHS is very dark as are the riding stables. The neighborhood is a

12 considerable distance west of commercial areas such as Grant Avenue or the old Downtown District.

13 Overall, the ambient light setting of the SMHS neighborhood is low brightness, with spaced street

14 lights but without lighted signs or business district lights, while the adjacent open space preserves and

15 riding stables are unlighted and dark in the evening hours.

16 14. The existing field is located on the northeast portion of the school property, and is elevated

17 approximately 15 to 20 feet above the surrounding parking lots. The northeastern end of the stadium

18 is sunken below the level of multi-family residences to the north by an approximately 25-foot-high

19 grassy berm.

20 15. The athletic field has a bleacher capacity of 2,400 persons with standing room around the field

21 for an additional 1,600 persons. For the past 50 years, no permanent or portable athletic field lighting

22 has ever been is used at the San Marin High School stadium. Instead games and events have been

23 conducted during daylight hours. An existing public address system is used throughout the school

24 year for high school athletic contests and community sports events.

25 B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

26 16. The San Marin Stadium Lights Project proposes to install 80 foot tall flood lights for the

27 purposes of allowing for evening and nighttime sports activities at San Marin High School in Novato

28 California. The field has been used by San Marin High School for almost 50 years as a day facility,

3
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

g

1 with sporting events such as varsity football, soccer and track. The Project proposes to extend the

2 time for events on the Field to 9:30 p.m., with additional lights, crowd dispersion and cleanup

3 activities till 10:00 p.m. The Project also proposes to use permanent lighting to extend daily use in

4 the fall and winter months to 8 p.m

5 17. The Project includes the construction and use of two sets of poles for lighting the

6 stadium. The first set of eight poles would support lighting fixtures for illuminating the field during

7 sports competitions, practices, and other events. These eight poles would be 80 feet tall and arranged

8 evenly along each long side of the athletic field. The 80 foot tall poles would be equipped with up

9 to three sets of light fixtures, mounted at 80 feet and 70 feet on each pole, with lower output,

10 upward-facing luminaires mounted at 20 feet in order to illuminate airborne objects such as footballs

11 during punts and kickoffs. The second set of 18 poles would support lighting fixtures for illuminating

12 the field during post-event egress, clean-up, and during sports team practices. These poles would be

13 approximately 30 feet tall and would occur throughout the athletic field site.

14 18. In addition, the Project proposes a new sound system consisting of speakers mounted on an

15 additional 18 thirty foot tall poles located around either side of the athletic field.

16 19. The new stadium lighting and sound system would allow for the expansion of previous games,

17 practices and events occurring during daylight hours into the evening and nighttime with lights being

18 turned off at 10 p.m. at the latest.

19 20. The District would assign staff to handle security, crowd concerns, and litter removal at home

20 athletic events. In addition, the District may hire, on an as-needed basis, security and outside cleaning

21 companies for large events such as playoff games, rival games, and graduation ceremonies.

22 C. INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF PROJECT LIGHT IMPACTS.

23 21. The draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Project was issued on December 20,

24 2016. The DEIR evaluated the Project's environmental impacts on specific resource groups,

25 including aesthetics and biological resources. The DEIR found impacts to these resources to be

26 insignificant.

27 22. The DEIR addressed aesthetic impacts due to light pollution but did not provide the location

28 and orientation of the eight 80 foot tall light poles, along with the eighteen 30 foot light poles that will

4
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 also carry lighting fixtures. The DEIR presented computer drawings of the poles in isolation without

2 reference to the surrounding area. The DEIR did not disclose how the lights will be oriented in order

3 to avoid significant light impacts, except to observe that this would be analyzed in the future through

4 a deferred 'photometric study.'

5 23. For light 'illumination' impacts, the DEIR assumed that light trespass would be significant

6 if illuminance produced by the Project would exceed two foot-candles, as measured on the vertical

7 and horizontal planes at the property lines nearest to residences. For glare impacts, the DEIR adopted

8 a standard comporting to a highly lighted area, which identifies additional glare beyond 10,000

9 candelas as a threshold of significance. However, the DEIR did not undertake the required

10 photometric analysis to identify the light levels that may be feasibly accomplished based on a fully

11 described Project, including light system.

12 24. The EIR did not assess Project impacts to biological resources. Instead, biological resources

13 were addressed only in the Initial Study for the Project, which found that neither construction or

14 operation of the Project would have potentially significant impacts on candidate, sensitive, or

15 special-status species or their habitat, or on biologically sensitive resources such as riparian areas or

16 migratory bird corridors. Neither the EIR or the Initial Study presented any information regarding

17 surveying of local wildlife species known to occur in the Project area nor any information on the

18 impacts of lights and noise on these sensitive biological resources.

19 25. The DEIR considered three alternatives: 1) No Project; 2) Stadium Lighting at Novato High

20 School; and 3) Portable Lighting Systems. Alternative 2 involved the installation of new lighting at

21 the Novato High School stadium instead of San Marin High School, which might host nighttime

22 events for both Novato and San Marin high schools. Alternative 3 involved stadium lighting for night

23 games at SMHS provided by portable lighting systems powered by diesel generators. The DEIR did

24 not consider lower level lighting at the Project site that would minimize light and glare on the

25 surrounding environment.

26 26. The DEIR stated that "[n]one of the alternatives would eliminate the unavoidably significant

27 noise impact associated with nighttime football games' and that each of the development alternatives

28 "would introduce additional or more severe impacts compared to the proposed project for certain

5
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 resource areas." The DEIR stated that "Alternative 2 would result in increased impacts to

2 transportation and traffic" and that "Alternative 3 would result in increased impacts to air quality and

3 greenhouse gas emissions." Among the considered alternatives, the DEIR characterized the Novato

4 High School Stadium Lighting alternative (Alternative 2) as the environmentally superior alternative,

5 although it concedes that the No Project Alternative would be environmentally superior.

6 27. The Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Project provided new information regarding impacts to

7 biological resources, partly in response to comments submitted showing the potential for significant

8 impacts on wildlife and habitat due to light and noise intrusion.

9 28. The FEIR also presented further evaluation of light and glare impacts, including a draft

10 photometric analysis which purports to show how light impacts will be within the range appropriate

11 to an E3 but not E2 zone. The FEIR added information on sky-glow impacts, clarifying that the

12 "lower-output luminaires" that "would be mounted facing upward at 20 feet on each light pole"

13 "would incrementally increase sky glow" and be used "approximately 152 nights of the year," ending

14 at either 8:30 PM or 9:45 PM in the evening defending on the lighted event.

15 D. DISTRICT'S APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT AND POST APPROVAL ACTIONS.

16 29. On August 25, 2016, the District sent out a Notice of Preparation (NOP) and Initial Study for

17 the Project. On December 20, 2016, the District released the DEIR and the start of the public

18 comment period.

19 30. On May 10, 2017, the District posted the Final EIR and Appendices. On May 16, 2017, the

20 District Board of Trustees voted to certify and approve the Final EIR.

21 31. On May 30, 2017, the District approved the Project, along with a Statement of Overriding

22 Considerations and a Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.

23 32. On June 1, 2017, the District posted a Notice of Determination ("NOD"). The NOD states

24 that the Novato Unified School District as lead agency approved the San Marin Stadium Lights

25 Project, which will have a significant impact on the environment.

26 33. During the public comment period and the administrative phase of the Project, Petitioner and

27 its members, as well as dozens of other concerned citizens, submitted written and oral comments

28 highlighting the deficiencies of the District's CEQA process and the EIR for the Project.

6
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

D. LITIGATION AND COURT'S RULING.

2 34. Respondent filed its Petition for Writ of Mandate on June 23, 2017 challenging the

3 District's approval of the Project as contrary to CEQA.

4 35. Following hearing on the merits, on January 30, 2019 this Court issued its Writ of

5 Mandate, which ruled that the District had not adequately assessed the adverse impacts of the

6 lighted stadium Project under CEQA.

7 36. This Court ruled that the District's preliminary photometric studies added to the FEIR

8 contained no discussion or explanation of how its values were obtained, and thus failed to

9 provide the necessary information to the decisionmakers and the public to support the

10 District's conclusion that the lighting system could be designed not to exceed the light trespass

11 and glare discomfort thresholds. See Writ of Mandate, p. 22:22-25 ("[T]he court finds that

12 these isolated illustrations, presented without a description of the District' s assumptions,

13 methodology or data, fail to provide enough details or explanation for the public 'to discern

14 from the [EIR] the analytic route the ... agency traveled from evidence to action.'")

15 37. This Court also held that the District had unlawfully deferred its primary mitigation

16 measure - the completion of an actual photometric study showing that light impacts would

17 be insignificant. See Writ of Mandate, p. 26:3-9 (*As reflected by the District's own comments

18 in the record, preparation of a photometric study is essential to determine whether the

19 light/glare impacts from the Project could be mitigated to less than significant levels. Also,

20 the record shows it was not only necessary, but feasible, to prepare and circulate a photometric

21 study with the DEIR, as illustrated by the reliance of the District and the Project's principals

22 on the two photometric studies prepared by Musco in October and November, 2015, one year

23 before the preparation of the DEIR. (AR 4 1389 4178.)") The Court also observed that the

24 District had in fact completed photometric studies prior to the release of the DEIR, but had

25 failed to disclose them as part of the EIR public review process. See Writ of Mandate, p.

26 27:23-25 (*The record demonstrates that there was no reason to wait until after project

27 approval to conduct such studies and, in fact, two photometric studies had been prepared by

28 the District' s lighting consultant.")

7
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 38. This Court also held that the district's failure to disclose the completed photometric

2 studies until after Project-approval violated CEQA's informational requirements and thus
constituted a failure to proceed according to law and an abuse of discretion. See Writ of
Mandate, p. 28:1-6 ("[DJecision not to prepare the relevant photometric studies until after

5 approval of the project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it 'precludes

6 informed decision[-]making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory

7 goals of the EIR process.')

8 39. This Court also held that the District erred in describing and analyzing light impacts

9 according a to a proper project baseline. See Writ of Mandate, p. 30:21-25 ("The District' s

10 elassification of the environmental setting as falling in the E-3 rating zone, supra, virtually

11 ignores the extensive open spaces and unlit hillsides that form a substantial boundary along

12 the south, west and northwest edges of the project site. The District makes no effort to

13 distinguish the unique physical features of this environmental setting from the typical,

14 suburban neighborhood that falls within the E-3 rating.") See also id., p. 32:4-8 ("Without a

15 proper baseline, an accurate assessment of impacts, mitigation measures and project

16 alternatives becomes impossible... For this reason the court finds the FEIR fails to comply

17 with CEQA.")

18 40. This Court also held with regard to sky glow impacts that the EIR informationally

19 inadequate, noting that the EIR had not addressed "the effects that the nighttime use of lights

20 will have in obscuring the views of the hills and ridgelines." Id. at p. 32:21-24. The Court

21 rejected as "faulty" the District's argument that sky glow would be 'minimal' as it "would

22 occur in a location with existing nighttime lighting...in the greater San Francisco Bay Area"

23 where nighttime skies are "subject to substantial existing light pollution" and therefore

24 "would not substantially contribute to sky glow during sensitive nighttime hours." Id. at 33.

25 The Court found "the FEIR omits material necessary to informed decision[-]making and

26 informed public participation' and this omission is prejudicial." Id., p. 34:1-3.

27 41. This Court also held the EIR deficient by including new biological resources

28 information after close of public comment, which necessitated the recirculation of the EIR.

8
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

Id. at 46. The court considered the information significant due to the potential for stadium

2 lighting to alter the roosting and foraging behavior of nocturnal species by driving them to

3 other areas, which matters were not discussed in the DEIR. Id., p. 66.

4 42. This Court also held "an adequate range of alternatives" should have included a

5 "discussion of the reduced lighting system alternative, and its absence did not foster informed

6 decision making." Id. at 59.

7 43. This Court also held the EIR defective in not addressing the cumulative aesthetics

8 impacts from the Project and from the new lighted soccer and lacrosse field already approved

9 by the District. Id. at p. 64.

•10- 44.- Judgment was-entered and a writ of mandate issued on February 21, 2019. The writ of

11 mandate orders the District to 1) set aside its approval of the Project and certification of its FEIR and

12 findings of overriding consideration of the significant and unavoidable environmental impacts of the

13 Project; 2) not conduct further construction and/or operation of the project, including the issuance of

14 any permits or approvals, until the District has fully complied with those CEQA requirements

15 identified as having been violated by the Court's Writ of Mandate ruling; and 3) file with the Court

16 a return on the Writ showing that the District has complied with these requirements.

17 E. DISTRICT'S APPROVAL OF THE REIR AND COMMENCEMENT OF FACILITY
OPERATION.
18
45. Following issuance of the writ of mandate, the District set aside its Project approval to
19 conduct further CEQA review as required by the Writ. The District issued a draft REIR ("DREIR")
20
on July 24, 2019, which was made available for public comment until August 24, 2019.
21
46. The DREIR determined that the Project would not have significant environmental impacts
22
based on an abbreviated photometric light study that examined the 'lux' or foot candle (fc) levels at
23
sites located around the field at the edge of the property line. The DREIR found that property line 24 illumination levels would not exceed standards set forth in the new applicable International
25
Commission on Illumination (CIE), 2017 standards for threshold limits on various light technical
26 parameters for outdoor lighting installations ("CIE150: 2017.") The DREIR relied on its lux readings
27
to serve as a 'proxy' for the REIR's required analysis for glare, assumes that a 500 fc level of
28
illumination will not cause any undue glare, and thus that this aesthetic impact is insignificant. The

9
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 DREIR also referred to an overall level of 10,000 candelas as not being exceeded, which is cited as

•2 another ground for glare impacts to be insignificant.

3 47. Petitioner's members and other interested public citizens submitted comments on the DREIR

4 on these and other issues, commenting that the DREIR was still inadequate with respect to its analysis

5 of light impacts to the community, the surrounding environment and local biological resources.
Commenters noted that lux or foot candle measurements are an inappropriate substitute for actual
measurements of glare effects and that, in contrast to a flawed illumination 'proxy,' the proper

8 industry standard for measuring were glare thresholds ranging between 600-900 candelas, not the
10,000 candela level cited in the DREIR. Commenters also noted that the DREIR did not consider
glare effects on different, more sensitive receptor points set at angles from the stadium that are likely

11 significantly greater than the applicable E2 zone thresholds. Commenters also noted that the DREIR

12 failed to assess the glare and sky glow impacts of the upward lights, which are proposed for dozens

13 of games and events all fall and winter season, including their potential to create adverse effect to

14 receptor points located above the stadium, including the many residences and open space areas

15 surrounding the Project site. Commentators also noted that the DREIR was improperly relying on

16 a general 'Bortle Scale' threshold for measuring impacts due to increased sky low, even though in

17 doing so the DREIR treats the entire County as significantly impacted by sky glow and therefore not

18 affected by additional sky glow impacts that will be cumulatively considerable under CEQA.

19 Commenters also noted specific glare impacts occurring as a result of a test run of the lights prior to

20 DREIR circulation.

21 48. Commenters also noted that the DREIR had again failed to analyze a lower light alternative,

22 despite being required by the Court's Writ of Mandate decision, and had failed to adequately analyze

23 the light impacts to wildlife species in the Project vicinity.

24 49. On August 6, 2019, during the comment period for the DREIR, the District rescinded its

25 administrative regulations intended to minimize the impacts on the lighted stadium facility and

26 operation on the local surrounding communities, including but not limited to impacts relating to

27 lights, scope and times of operational use, PA system noise and public safety plans and oversight.

28 The District did not conduct any CEQA review to assess the impacts of this decision to eliminate

10
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

existing mitigation measures proposed to protect surrounding communities from Project impacts.

2 50. On or about October 4, 2019, the District issued its final REIR ("FREIR"), which did not

3 change the DREIR's findings that the Project would not have significant impacts to surrounding

4 communities, open space lands and biological resources due to light and glare. In response to the
5 FREIR, Petitioner's members and other interested public citizens submitted additional comments that

6 the FREIR was still inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts.

7 51. On October 10, 2019, the District's Board of Trustees held hearing, took public comment

8 and then approved and certified the FREIR. The following day, October 11, 2019, the District

9 submitted a pleading to the Court asserting that it had complied with the Writ of Mandate. That same
10day, the District commenced operation of the lights. and PA system at the stadium. The next day,

11 October 12, 2019, the District held a lighted event at the stadium, in which lights were on until 9:30

12 p.m. In addition, at least four light fixtures on the 80 foot poles as well as the new egress lighting

13 were operated until past 11:00 p.m. In addition, operation of the new lighted facility has revealed the

14 existence of additional motion sensor lights that operate randomly in response to movement and

15 without any time limitations.

16 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code § 21168)
17
52. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
18
53. The District's approval and certification of the REIR violates CEQA. The REIR prepared and 19
certified for the Project still does not provide an adequate assessment of the significant impacts that
20 will occur due to the District's decision to locate a new lighted sports facility intended for evening 21
operation amidst residential neighborhoods in a low-lighted area adjoining open space lands in
22
Novato California. The EIR's failure to assess these impacts allows the District to avoid its CEQA
23
obligation to adopt feasible mitigation measures that may avoid or substantially lessen these
24
significant impacts that should have been identified.
25
54. The EIR fails to provide an adequate analysis of the light impacts of the Project. The EIR fails 26
to disclose ambient light levels in the areas surrounding the Project or about the light effects of the
27

28 Project on surrounding open space lands that are presently dark at dusk. Instead, the EIR still
improperly characterizes the area as having an ambient light level corresponding to an E3 Zone

11
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 (moderate light intensity) even though the vast majority of the area is dimly lit to completely dark.

2 As a result, the EIR's thresholds of concern for light impacts do-not adequately measure the light

3 impacts the Project will have on different receptors.

4 55. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it inappropriately relies

5 on lux or foot candle measurements as a substitute for actual measurements of glare effects. The

6 REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it fails to utilize proper industry

7 standard for measuring were glare thresholds ranging between 600-900 candelas, as opposed to the

8 10,000 candela level in the REIR.

9 56. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it measures such
10-- impacts only-at the field level and does not consider glare effects on more sensitive higher or lower

11 receptor points set at angles from the stadium that are likely significantly greater than the applicable

12 E2 zone thresholds and than that measured by the REIR study.

13 57. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it fails to assess the

14 glare and sky glow impacts of the upward lights, which are proposed for dozens of games and events

15 all fall and winter season, including their potential to create adverse effect to receptor points located

16 above the stadium, including the many residences and open space areas surrounding the Project site.

17 58. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it improperly relies on

18 a general 'Bortle Scale' threshold for measuring impacts due to increased sky low, even though in

19 doing so the REIR treats the entire County as significantly impacted by sky glow and therefore

20 incorrectly unaffected by additional sky glow impacts that are cumulatively considerable. The REIR

21 does not evaluate the impacts of the Project caused by sky glow and glare to nighttime skies or

22 eliminating specific nighttime views of the adjacent open space areas from surrounding vantage

23 points. The REIR contains no discussion of the potential for significant aesthetic impacts to

24 viewsheds caused by night sky glare that will change the aesthetic character of the local area from low

25 ambient light with darkened open space to one that is brightly lit.

26 59. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts to wildlife species in the

27 Project vicinity.

28 60. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it does not consider or

12
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 disclose the existence of additional motion sensor lights that are part of the new lighted facility and

2 which have no time limits for operation. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light

3 impacts as it does not disclose that some of the lights on the 80 foot poles, as well as egress lights

4 may continue to operate after 10:00 p.m. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light

5 impacts as it does not disclose that the lights may be utilized by the District on Saturday evenings as

6 well as other evenings during the week. The REIR does not consider the cumulative impacts of all
light fixtures on the existing low light setting of the open space and residential neighborhoods.

61. The EIR fails to consider the cumulative impacts of the Project in conjunction with other
foreseeable future projects that will contribute to light, noise and parking impacts, including but not
10 I-limited-to-the-construction and possible lighting of a second artificial turf field and additional lights
.-e •

11 and poles for the overall SMHS campus and facilities.

12 62. The REIR is inadequate with respect to its analysis of light impacts as it fails to analyze a

13 lower light alternative, despite being required by the Court's Writ of Mandate decision. The EIR fails

14 to consider the feasible option of a lower light facility with smaller structures and more restricted

15 timing of lighted events that would substantially reduce or avoid significant light impacts.

16 63. The FREIR fails to adequately respond to comments on each of the issues discussed above.

17 The FREIR's response to comments is conclusory and non-responsive to the significant issues raised.

18 VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code § 21168)
19
64. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
20
65. The District's rescission of its administrative regulations containing mitigation for the 21
Project's impacts on the surrounding local community is a CEQA project with the potential for
22
significant environmental impacts. However, the District did not conduct any environmental review
23
in conjunction with its rescission of these regulations, nor consider the effects of such rescission as
24
part of the REIR process, in violation of CEQA.
25
VII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
26 (Violation of the Writ of Mandate)

27 66. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.

28 67. The District's operation of the lighted stadium facility immediately following its approval and

13
Petitioner's Supplemental Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No. Civ. 1702295.

1 certification of the REIR on October 10, 2019 violates this Court's Writ of Mandate, as this Court has

2 not yet discharged the writ by making a determination that the District has complied with CEQA. See Pub. Res. Code § 21168.9(b) ("The trial court shall retain jurisdiction over the public agency's

4 proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ until the court has determined that the public

5 agency has complied with this division.") (emphasis added.)

6 68. At the time of the District's operation of the lighted Project facility beginning on October 11,

7 2019, this Court had not made a determination that the District has fulfilled its CEQA obligations

8 pursuant to the direction provided in the Court's Writ of Mandate decision. Thus the District's
actions are contrary to law and the Writ of Mandate issued by this Court.
VIII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

12 1. For a Writ of Mandate ordering the District to (a) set aside its decision approving and

13 certifying the Project and REIR; (b) comply with CEQA with respect to any further action taken with

14 respect to the Project; (c) set aside its rescission of its administrative regulations until it has complied

15 with CEQA; (d) comply with the prior Writ of Mandate enioining operation of the lighted stadium

16 Project until such time as it has adequately complied with CEOA: (e) take whatever additional action

17 is necessary in conformance with the Court's decision; and (f) file a return with the Court showing

18 compliance with the writ of mandate. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.

19 2. For injunctive relief precluding development of the Project.

20 3. For reasonable attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 .

21 4. For costs of suit.

22 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.
