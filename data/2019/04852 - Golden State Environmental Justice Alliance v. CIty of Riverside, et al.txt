2 INTRODUCTION

1.
3 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") challenges

4 the Exchange Project ("Project"), located in the County of Riverside. The proposed Project

5 analyzed in the EIR consists of 35.4 acres of vacant land with mixed-use project that includes

6 the following components: 1) A multi-family residential complex consisting of 482 multi-family

7 residential dwelling units on approximately 18.4 acres on the northern area of the site; 2) multi-

8 tenant commercial buildings, a vehicle fueling station with a convenience store and drive-thru

9 carwash, and a stand-alone drive-thru restaurant, totaling 49,000 square feet, on approximately

10 7.6 acres on the southwest area of the site; 3) two hotels, containing 229 rooms, and 23 parking

11 spaces for overnight parking of recreational vehicles, on approximately 7.4 acres near the

12 southeast area of the site; and 4) outdoor entertainment and activities (e.g., farmers market, live

13 entertainment, and car shows).

14 2. City of Riverside and City of Riverside City Council (*Respondents") certified

15 the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project.

16 3. In approving the Project, the Respondents violated provisions of CEQA requiring

17 that the EIR adequately analyze significant adverse environmental impacts. The Respondents

18 further violated the requirement that it analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and that it

19 adopt an environmentally superior alternative. Respondents failed to adopt all feasible

20 mitigation for project impacts, and the analysis of impacts and the planned mitigation measures

21 is uncertain and is unreasonably deferred. The level of review adopted by Respondents was

22 insufficient and therefore did not allow decision makers to intelligently consider the

23 environmental consequences of the Project.

4.
24 Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations were

25 not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Statement of Overriding Considerations

26 was improperly adopted when feasible mitigation measures and alternatives existed to lessen

27 significant project impacts.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2°
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
3
1094.5 and for declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has 4
jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 5
21168.9.
6
6. Venue is proper in this Court because the Respondents and Project are located in 7
Riverside County and the actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in 8 Riverside County. See Code of Civil Procedure § § 393 and 394. 9
7. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of 10
Determination under CEQA. 11
8. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the 12

13 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project in compliance with Public
Resources Code section 21177(b). 14
9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA by filing and serving with this Petition for 15

16 Writ of Mandate a Notice to the MJPA of Intent to File pursuant to Pub. Resources Code section
21167.5, a Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action pursuant to Pub. Resources 17
Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, and a Notice of Commencement 18
of Action to Responsible Agencies pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5. 19

20
PARTIES
21
10. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner") is a 22

23 California not for profit corporation devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the
promotion of safe and healthy communities. It is a corporation formed and operating under the 24
laws of the State of California. Members of Petitioner are taxpayers who reside near the Project 25

26 and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts and have an interest in
ensuring open, accountable, and responsive government and in protecting the region's 27
environment. Petitioner and its members submitted comments on the Project, bring this action 28

'PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

1

2 on behalf of the public, and are acting as private attorneys general conferring a significant benefit
on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
3
11.
4 Respondents City of Riverside, a municipal corporation, and City of Riverside

5 City Council, a public entity ("Respondents") are located in Riverside County and are the lead

6 agencies for the Project under CEQA. Respondents are the agencies charged with regulating and

7 administering land use and development within their territory in compliance with the provisions

8 of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable provisions of state law including

9 CEQA. As the lead agencies for the Project, Respondents have the duty to ensure compliance

10 with these applicable laws. Respondents are authorized and required by law to hold public

11 hearings, to determine whether CEQA applies to development within their jurisdiction, to

12 determine the adequacy of and certify environmental documents prepared pursuant to CEQA,

13 and to determine whether a project is compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses,

14 and programs specified in the General Plan.

12.
15 Real Party In Interest, AFG Development, LLC, is the applicant for the Project

16 and is therefore served as Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section

17 21167.6.5(a). AFG Development, LLC, is a California limited liability company that is located

18 and does business in the County of Riverside.

13.
19 The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as

20 DOES 1 through 100, and of the Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 200 are

21 unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to

22 allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and

23 believes and on that basis, alleges that the fictitiously named Respondents and Defendants

24 through 100 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project that is the subject

25 of this proceeding; and that each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through

26 200 either claims an ownership interest in the Project or has some cognizable interest in the

Project.

'PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

2° STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS

14. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by

4 Respondents. In particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the
Project on the grounds that Respondents have violated CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law,
and other laws.
6
15.
7 Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources

8 Code Section 21168 or 21168.5 as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq.
and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
9
16.
10 Petitioner has satisfied all exhaustion-of-remedies requirements to maintain this

11 proceeding. By way of example and without limitation, Petitioner submitted written opposition

12 to the Project during the administrative proceedings for the Project.

17.
13 Alternatively, and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-

14 (b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
18.
15 Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA

16 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, they failed to

17 proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.
19.
18 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

19 law, since its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of

20 Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondents' approval of the Project also

21 rests on the failure to satisfy clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those

22 laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in

23 approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to
exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
24

25 Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project within

26 the time limits of and in a manner consistent a with those laws, but Respondents have failed and

27 refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is
not consistent with those laws.
28

4
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
5
Failure to Prepare Adequate Environmental Impact Report
6
(Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
7
21.
8 Paragraphs 1 through 20 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

22.
9 CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the

10 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to

11 both short term and long term impacts, providing decision makers with enough information to

12 enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of

13 their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to participate

14 meaningfully in the project approval and environmental review process. CEQA also requires

15 that every environmental impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to

16 a proposed project. CEQA further requires that every environmental impact report identify and

17 analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project 's significant adverse

18 environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses contained in an

19 environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be

20 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

23.
21 The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the

22 significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts

23 in the Project's EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by
substantial evidence in the administrative record.
24
24.
25 The EIR is inadequate in ways that include, but are not limited to, those described

below.
26

27 Project Description

25.
28 As we understand it, the project proposes the development of the existing 35.4

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

1

2 acre vacant project site with a mixed-use development consisting of 482 multi-family residential

3 apartment dwelling units including 10 live-work units, 49,000 square feet of commercial lease

4 space including a drive-thru restaurant and a gas station with an internal restaurant, convenience
store, and car wash; two hotels with 229 guest rooms and related amenities; short-term
Recreational Vehicle (RV) overnight parking for 23 RVs plus 1 passenger car for each RV and
6

7 12 additional visitor parking stalls; incidental outdoor entertainment and activities (e.g. farmers
market, car shows), and freeway oriented signs.
8
26. Discretionary actions required to implement the proposed Project include:
9
(1)
10 General Plan Amendment (GPA) to amend approximately 34.34 acres of

11 the proposed project area from MDR (Medium Density Residential) and O

12 (Office) to MU-U (Mixed Use Urban) and amend approximately 1.06 acres of the

13 area for the proposed vehicle fueling station from O (Office) to C (Commercial).
(2)
14 Zoning Code Amendment (RZ) to rezone approximately 34.34 acres of the

15 proposed project area from R-1-7000 Single Family Residential, R-3-1500 -

16 Multi-Family Residential, and R-1-7000-WC - Single Family Residential -
Watercourse Overlay Zones to MU-U - Mixed Use Urban and amend 1.06 acres
17

18 of the area proposed for the vehicle fueling station from R-1-7000 - Single
Family Residential to CR - Commercial Retail.
19
(3)
20 Site Plan Review (PPE) for the proposed site design and building

21 elevations, with the exception of the vehicle fueling station.

22 (4) Tentative Parcel Map (PM) to subdivide the project site into 15 parcels,

23 ranging in size from 0.49 acres to 7.67 acres, including a private street.

24 (5) Conditional Use Permits (CUP) to permit each of the following uses:

25 Hotels and RV parking, vehicle fueling station, drive-thru restaurant, live

26 entertainment and special events, and a farmers market.

(6)
27 Design Review (DR) for the proposed vehicle fueling station site design

28 and building elevations.

limits. Grading Exception (GE) to allow retaining walls over permissible height

3

4 (8) Minor Conditional Use Permit (MCUP) for two freestanding, freeway-

5 oriented monument signs.

6 (9) Environmental Impact Report (EIR) to analyze the potential

7 environmental impacts of project implementation.

27.
8 The EIR states that there are 10 proposed live/work units. However, the attached

9 architectural plans indicate there will be 12 live/work units. The EIR is not reliable as an

10 informational document and must be revised and recirculated for public review.

28.
11 Further, the Conceptual Grading Plans depict storage units on the northeast side

12 of the project site along Strong Street, between two existing single family residences. There is

13 no information given about the storage units in the EIR. There is no discussion of the storage

14 units throughout the EIR and their potentially significant impacts on the existing single family

15 residences. The EIR must be updated to include analysis and discussion of the storage units in

16 order to comply with CEQA's requirements for meaningful disclosure (CEQA § 21003(b)).

17 Environmental Setting

29.
18 Pursuant to CEQA § 15125, the Environmental Setting section of an EIR shall

19 discuss "any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable general plans, specific

20 plans, and regional plans." The project requires a General Plan Amendment and Zoning Code

21 Amendment in order to be implemented. The EIR does not include this discussion and must be

22 revised to disclose this information.

23 Air Quality

30.
24 The EIR failed to adequately discuss relevant specifics regarding the connection

25 between the general health effects associated with a particular pollutant and the estimated

26 amount of that pollutant the project will likely produce. Sierra Club v. Cty. of Fresno (2018) 6

27 Cal.5th 502.

31.
28 The EIR lists relevant Policies from the Air Quality Element of the Riverside

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

2° General Plan. However, this list does not include Policies AQ-1.1 and AQ-1.2 related to

Environmental Justice:
3
Policy AQ-1.1: Ensure that all land use decisions, including enforcement actions,
4

5 are made in an equitable fashion to protect residents, regardless of age, culture,
ethnicity, gender, race, socioeconomic status or geographic location, from the
6
health effects of air pollution.
7
Policy AQ-1.2: Consider potential environmental justice issues in reviewing
8
impacts (including cumulative impacts for each project proposed).
9
32. The EIR must be revised to include analysis of environmental justice issues in
10
reviewing potential impacts, including cumulative impacts from the proposed project. This is 11
especially significant as the surrounding community is highly burdened by pollution. According
12

13 to CalEnviroScreen 3.0, CalEPA's screening tool that ranks each census tract in the state for

14 pollution and socioeconomic vulnerability, the proposed project's census tract (6065030104)

15 ranks worse than 95 percent of the rest of the state overall. The project's census tract is in the
98th percentile for pollution burden, meaning it is more polluted than nearly all other census
16

17 tracts in the state of California. The surrounding community bears the impact of multiple

18 sources of pollution and is more polluted than average on every pollution indicator measured by
CalEnviroScreen. For example, the project census tract has a higher burden of ozone, PM 2.5,
19
and diesel than 90 percent of the state and greater hazardous waste and traffic issues than 80
20
percent of the state.
21
33.
22 Further, the project's census tract, a diverse community including 62 percent
Hispanic residents, 9 percent African-American residents, and 9 percent Asian residents, is
23

24 especially vulnerable to the impacts of pollution. The community has very high unemployment

25 rates (67 percent compared to the rest of the state), which is an indication that they may lack

26 health insurance or access to medical care. Additionally, the surrounding community has a

27 higher proportion of babies born with low birth weights than 68 percent of the State, which

28 makes those children more vulnerable to asthma and other health issues. This is supported by

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

-

2' the census tract ranking in the 98th percentile for asthma and containing 17% children under the

3 age of 10 compared to 13% average children under the age of 10 in California. The Project's

4 census tract is also identified as

34. Disadvantaged Community under SB 535.

5 The EIR states that "under the current land use designations, the project site could

6 yield approximately 827 new residents at full development." Footnote 4 states "Current land use

7 designation density would allow for up to 260 residential units. 260 units x 3.18 residents per
unit = 827 residents." The area of the Project site that has current General Plan designation of

9 MDR is not disclosed in the EIR to verify the allowable residential density of this portion of the

10 site and thus the population generated under this density.

11 35. Further, the attached General Plan and Zoning Diagrams misrepresent the Project

12 site and are misleading to the public and decision makers. The diagrams do not delineate or label

13 the boundaries of the Project site while also depicting the properties to the north, resulting in an

14 exhibit which does not accurately or adequately portray the Project site. The Current General

15 Plan Land Use diagram is the most misleading because it depicts the MDR Land Use designation

16 across the properties to the north also and the reader is unable to determine how much of the

17 MDR designation is allocated on the proposed Project site. The EIR must be revised to include

18 accurate, clear diagrams of the existing and proposed General Plan and Zoning designations on

19 the subject property. The EIR must also include the acreage of each current General Plan and

20 Zoning destinations across the project site in order to be an adequate informational document and

21 for the public and decision makers to verify unsubstantiated claims regarding population and

22 employment.

23 36. Appendix B of the Air Quality Analysis (AQA) indicates that the CalEEMod

24 modeling sheets do not accurately reflect the components of the proposed Project. The EIR

25 states there will be 49,000 square feet of commercial land uses but the CalEEMod Output Sheets

26 only analyze 46,758 square feet total of commercial land uses. Further, the EIR references the

27 site plan which "indicates that 15,000 sf of the proposed commercial component would be leased

28 by retail tenants, while 34,000 sf would be leased by restaurant tenants." However, the AQA

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

F
only analyzes 26,000 sf of restaurant uses. The EIR and AQA are inconsistent and must be 2®
revised.
3
37. Further, the Parking Lot land use in CalEEMOd only models 1,567 parking stalls
4
while 1,587 parking stalls are proposed. Additionally, the 1,587 parking stalls proposed does not
capture all parking from the proposed short-term RV parking land use. The 23 short-term RV
6
parking spaces includes space for a standard vehicle also, doubling the amount of parking spaces 7
to 46. The EIR must be revised to include this information. This must be reflected in the project
description, Air Quality modeling, and throughout the EIR.
9
38. Additionally, footnote 5 on page 37 of Appendix B states "As per The Exchange 10
Focused Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Memorandum, analysis of a 12-vehicle fueling station 11
and RV parking component, results in fewer emissions than 16-vehicle fueling stations. As such, 12
and as a conservative measure, the Project has been analyzed for the use of a 16-vehicle fueling 13

14 station." The referenced The Exchange Focused Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Memorandum
is listed as a reference but not included for public review. CEQA § 15150 (f) states that 15

16 incorporation by reference is most appropriate for including long, descriptive, or technical
materials that provide general background but do not contribute directly to the analysis of the 17

18 problem at hand. The Exchange Focused Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Memorandum
utilized here contributes directly to the analysis of the problem at hand. Not including the 19
Memorandum as an attachment for public review is in violation of CEQA § 15150 (f). § 20
39. The CalEEMod output sheets also do not include the non-residential square 21 footage from the proposed 12 live-work units. It must also be clarified whether the High 22 Turnover Restaurant land use includes square footage from the quick-serve restaurant co-located 23
with the proposed fueling station. Additionally, the Storage Units depicted on the Conceptual 24
Grading Plans on the northeast side of the project site are not included in the CalEEMod 25
analysis.
26
40. The EIR and Appendix B must be revised and recirculated to properly categorize 27

28 each use within the proposed project to adequately and accurately estimate the potentially

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

F
significant air quality impacts.
2
41.
UJ Section 7.35.010(B)(5) of the Riverside Municipal Code (RMC) prohibits

4 construction activity between the hours of 7:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. Monday through Friday, and

5 between 5:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M. on Saturday. All such activities are also prohibited on
Sundays. Thus, the legal hours of construction in the City of Riverside are 7:00 A.M. - 7:00
6

7 P.M., Monday - Friday and 8:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M. on Saturday. The EIR does not provide a

8 "worst-case scenario" analysis of construction equipment emitting pollutants for the legal 12
hours per weekday plus 9 hours on Saturday. It is legal for construction to occur for much

10 longer hours and an additional day (6 days per week including Saturday) than modeled in the Air

11 Quality Analysis. The Air Quality modeling must be revised to account for these legally

12 possible longer construction days and increased number of construction days. If shorter hours of

13 construction are proposed by the project, this must be reflected in the EIR analysis and included

14 as an enforceable mitigation measure with field verification by an enforcement entity of the lead

15 agency (CEQA § 21081.6 (b)).

42.
16 The EIR claims that the cut and fill grading of the site will balance and 0 haul

17 truck trips were included for analysis during all phases of construction. However, the EIR does
not include any reasoning or evidence to support the claim that the entire site will balance cut
18

19 and fill. At minimum, the Project must excavate for flatwork such as sidewalks, patios, etc.;

20 asphalt concrete roadways and parking lots including the asphalt thickness and aggregate base

21 thickness; and building slabs for 8 commercial buildings, 2 hotel buildings, and 21 residential

22 buildings. Also, utility trenching will require excavation, especially since project site drainage is

23 proposed to be routed through newly constructed underground storm drain system to connect to

24 8 the 8 ft. Thornton storm drain on-site. The Air Quality Analysis must be revised to provide

25 supporting evidence that the 34 acre site will balance cut and fill in order to provide reasoning to

26 exclude any and all haul trips throughout project construction.

27 Land Use and Planning

43.
28 Threshold 1 - The EIR refers to the Initial Study (IS) conclusion that development

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

of the Project would not divide established community. However, the project plans propose an
2°

3 to physically divide the existing residential community on Strong Street by placing storage units
between two existing residential homes.
4
44.
5 Neither the EIR or the IS discusses the location of the proposed storage units and

6 their potentially significant impacts to the residences on Strong Street. Siting the storage units in

7 this location will negatively impact the residential character of Strong Street and alter the low-

8 density charm of the Northside Community pursuant to Riverside General Plan Land Use

9 Element Objective LU-74. The storage units are not compatible with the existing character of

10 the neighborhood on Strong Street as there will be strikingly different storage unit buildings

11 along the residential street instead of low-density compatible development. There is also no

12 driveway access to this parcel which is out of character with the rest of Strong Street. The

13 project architectural plans also do not include a rendering of the proposed storage units for visual

14 comparison of the buildings with the surrounding neighborhood. The EIR must be revised and

15 recirculated to include this information and evaluate the potentially significant impacts of

16 physically dividing the established residential community on Strong Street with the proposed
storage units.
17
45.
18 Threshold 2 - The EIR concludes that "upon approval of the project, the proposed

19 development would comply with all new applicable land use and zoning regulations." However,

20 there is no discussion or analysis regarding the proposed Project's compliance or incompatibility

21 with the existing land use designations. Avoiding discussion of the Project's incompatibility

22 with the existing General Plan Land Use and Zoning Designations is misleading to the public

23 and decision makers. The EIR must be revised and recirculated with this analysis in order to

24 comply with CEQA's requirements for meaningful disclosure (CEQA § 21003(b)).

46.
25 The EIR states that "The RMC allows for modification to various development

26 standards in conjunction with certain permit issuance when sufficient reasoning is provided for

27 the change. The project includes modifications to the provision that drive-thru restaurants and

28 fueling stations be allowed on arterial roadways only, and to the requirement that a 6-foot tall

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

2 block wall be constructed between a fueling station and a mixed-use development. The Project

3 also requests a grading exception to allow for certain retaining walls to be up to 12 feet in

4 height." However, the EIR does not include text of the existing applicable RMC Sections and

5 the proposed changes to the RMC Sections in order to accommodate the project. The EIR also

6 does not contemplate the potentially significant cumulative impacts of revising the RMC to

7 allow drive-thru restaurants and fueling stations on streets other than arterial roadways. The

8 potentially significant cumulative impacts of altering the RMC requirement that a 6-foot tall

9 block wall be constructed between a fueling station and a mixed-use development is not

10 analyzed, either. Further, Section 5.2.3 - Removal of Obstacles to Growth must be updated to

11 include this information as well since the project proposes citywide changes in the RMC.
47.
12 Cumulative Impacts - The EIR that concludes there will be no significant

13 cumulative impacts because "land use regulations and policy consistency impacts associated

14 with other cumulative projects would be addressed on a case-by-case basis in order to determine

15 their consistency with applicable plans and policies." However, this claim is not supported by

16 evidence from the cumulative projects and the EIR must be revised to include this information.

17 This is especially true given a lead agency's ability to approve a project notwithstanding

18 significant environmental impacts. The EIR must be revised to include relevant information to

19 support the claim that cumulative impacts will be less than significant.

Noise
20
48.
21 The EIR states that pursuant to Riverside Municipal Code Section 7.35.020(G)

22 that construction noise is exempt from noise requirements and thus Appendix D does not include

any
23 construction noise analysis. However, the EIR does not discuss the Riverside General Plan

24 Noise Element guidance which states "the Municipal Code limits noise levels from construction

25 activities to the maximum permitted exterior noise level for the affected land use." Further,

26 Policy N-1.3 states "Enforce the City of Riverside Noise Control Code to ensure that stationary

27 noise and noise emanating from construction activities, private developments/residences and

28 special events are minimized." The EIR must be revised to include a technical noise analysis a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

2° from construction of the project and compare it to the maximum permitted exterior noise level
for the nearby sensitive receptors.
3
49. Although the technical Noise Analysis in Appendix D does not include a
construction noise analysis, the EIR includes its own construction noise analysis. The EIR's
construction noise analysis employs the "reference noise levels reported in the FTA's 2006
6

7 Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment (FTA TNVIA)" to "estimate noise levels at

8 nearby sensitive receptors based on a standard noise attenuation rate of 6 dBA per doubling of

9 distance." The EIR uses the FTA TNVIA as a threshold of significance to determine if project-

10 related construction noise would generate a significant impact to sensitive receptors. The FTA

11 specifically states that the purpose of the document is to provide "technical guidance for

12 conducting noise and vibration analyses for transit projects."

50.
13 Utilizing the FTA threshold for federally-funded transit projects is not appropriate

14 to the proposed project as there is no transit element included with the project. The EIR gives no

15 supporting evidence or reasoning regarding the applicability of the FTA document. The EIR is

16 misleading to the public and decision makers by utilizing the FTA document for analysis and

17 must be revised to utilize an appropriate threshold of significance for construction noise analysis.

18 The applicable threshold of significance is outlined in the Riverside General Plan Noise Element

19 as the maximum permitted exterior noise level for the affected land use in the RMC.

51.
20 The EIR is inconsistent with the Noise Analysis included in Appendix D. Table
4.10-1:24-Hour Ambient Noise Level Measurements is included in the EIR to list the Ambient
21

22 Noise Level Measurements at nearby locations. In Appendix D, this information is in Table 5-1:
24-Hour Ambient Noise Level Measurements. The two tables should list the same information
23

24 but they do not match. Specifically, the distances from the receptor location to the project site are

25 different in the EIR table than in the Appendix D table. For example, Measurement Location L7

26 is listed as 90 feet away from the project site in the EIR table but in the Appendix D table L7 is

27 listed as 860 feet away from the project site. The EIR does not discuss this discrepancy and is an

28 inadequate informational document which is misleading to the public and decision makers.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

-
52.
2 The EIR states regarding cumulative noise impacts that "construction activities at

3 the related projects and developments in the area would generate similar noise levels as the

4 proposed project." The EIR does not provide construction noise levels for any cumulative

5 projects" because construction schedules are not known for all projects" yet still concludes that

6 "the project would not contribute considerably to temporary cumulative construction noise and

7 vibration impacts." The EIR's claims regarding cumulative noise impacts are not supported by

8 evidence and the EIR must be revised to include this information. This is especially true given a

9 lead agency's ability to approve a project notwithstanding significant environmental impacts.

10 The EIR must be revised to include information to support the claim that cumulative construction

11 noise impacts will be less than significant. This is also true for both these statements regarding

12 cumulative vibration impacts.

13 Transportation and Traffic

53.
14 The EIR employs uncertain language by stating that construction traffic "is not

15 expected to result in traffic deficiencies related to trips from construction employees, export of

16 materials, and import of construction materials, etc." There is no discussion or analysis of

17 potentially significant impacts due to construction traffic in the technical traffic appendix either.

18 The claim and conclusion that construction of the proposed Project will not result in significant

19 impacts must be quantifiably verified in order for the EIR to be a reliable informational

document.
20
54.
21 Table 4.12-5 Project Trip Generation lists footnote 5 associated with pass-by

22 reduction of 25% for the fast food restaurant and gas station with market and car wash land uses.

23 However, text for footnote 5 is not included in the table in order to a give a source for this

24 increased trip reduction. The EIR is inadequate as an informational document and must be

25 revised to include this information.

26 55. The following Mitigation Measures are included which require the Project to pay

27 its fair share of fees towards improvements:

28 T-4: Intersection #14 (Caltrans) - West La Cadena Drive and Interchange Street/I-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

2° 215 Southbound Ramps. Prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant
shall contribute their fair-share amount for the recommended improvements,
which consist of signalization, a northbound left turn lane, and a southbound left
4
turn lane.
5
T-5: Intersection #16 (Caltrans) - La Cadena Drive and I-215 Northbound Ramps. 6
Prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant shall contribute its fair- 7
share amount for the recommended improvements at this intersection, which
8
consists of signalization, restriping the northbound through lane as a shared
9
through-left lane and construction of : second receiving lane on the on-ramp. 10

11 T-6: Intersection #1 (City of Colton) Riverside Avenue/Main Street and
Placentia Lane. Prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant shall 12
contribute their fair-share amount for the recommended improvements, which 13 consist of installation of traffic signal. 14
Mitigation Measures for Cumulative Impacts 15

16 T-9: Intersection #1 (City of Colton) - Riverside Avenue/Main Street and
Placentia Lane. Prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant shall 17
contribute their fair-share amount for the recommended improvements, which 18
consist of construction of a southbound approach to provide a second left turn 19
lane.
20
T-10: Intersection #5 (Caltrans) - Main Street and SR 60 EB Ramps. Prior to the 21
issuance of building permits, the applicant shall contribute their fair-share amount
22
for the recommended improvements, which consist of construction of a second 23
southbound left turn lane.
24
T-11: Intersection #14 (Caltrans) - West La Cadena Drive and Interchange St/I- 25
215 Southbound Ramps. Prior to the issuance of building permits, the applicant 26 shall contribute their fair-share amount for the recommended improvements, 27
which consist of construction of second southbound left turn lane and the
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

2 westbound approach to provide a left turn lane.

56. The EIR states that "the City of Riverside recognizes fair share contributions to be

4 considered appropriate mitigation in order to reduce project-specific impacts to less than
significant levels. These programs are recognized as City policy decisions and assumed to be
implemented as soon as fully-funded." However, there is no source for this claim or
6

7 documentation provided for the City of Riverside's recognition of this statement. Additionally,

8 Table 1-3 of the Traffic Impact Assessment (Appendix L) indicates that the improvements

9 required for Intersection #1 and Intersection #5 are not included a DIF/TUMF program. An

10 assessment of fees is appropriate when linked to a specific mitigation program. Payment of fees

11 is not sufficient where there is no evidence mitigation will actually result. The assessment of

12 fees here is not adequate as there is no evidence mitigation will actually result. Mitigation

13 Measures T-4, T-5, T-6, T-9, T-10, and T-11 represent uncertain mitigation and are improperly
deferred in violation of CEQA.
14
57.
15 Also, Intersections #1 (City of Colton), #5 (Caltrans), #14 (Caltrans), and #16

16 (Caltrans) are all outside of the City of Riverside's jurisdiction. Payment of fees is not an
acceptable mitigation measure when the improvements are in a jurisdiction beyond the scope of
17

18 the lead agency. An assessment of fees is appropriate when linked to a specific mitigation

19 program. Payment of fees is not sufficient where there is no evidence mitigation will actually

20 result. The assessment of fees here is not adequate as there is no evidence mitigation will

21 actually result. Mitigation Measures T-4, T-5, T-6, T-9, T-10, and T-11 represent uncertain

22 mitigation and are improperly deferred in violation of CEQA.

58.
23 It must also be noted that fair share payments for improvements required for

24 mitigation at Intersection #12 and Intersection #17 in the City of Riverside are not included in a
DIF/TUMF, either.
25
59.
26 Further, the EIR's logic that "the City of Riverside recognizes fair share

27 contributions to be considered appropriate mitigation in order to reduce project-specific impacts

28 to less than significant levels" does not support implementation of Mitigation Measures T-9, T-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 18

-

2 10, and T-11 to reduce cumulative traffic impacts to less than significant levels. Cumulative

3 impacts include traffic from projects and other factors beyond the proposed project. The EIR's

4 logic that the City of Riverside approves of fair share payments as appropriate mitigation for

5 project-specific impacts does not support the conclusion that fair share payments will mitigate

6 significant cumulative traffic impacts.

7 Impacts Found to be Less Than Significant

8 Population and Housing

60.
9 The EIR concludes that the Project has less than significant impacts to population

10 growth because the Project is estimated to increase the population by 1,897 persons, which is

11 approximately 2.8 percent of the total anticipated growth of the City to 2040 according to

12 SCAG's 2016 RTP/SCS projections. However, the EIR does not discuss that the population

13 growth will exceed SCAG's projections because the proposed Project requires a General Plan

14 Amendment to be implemented, increasing the number of units assumed at General Plan Build

15 Out by SCAG. SCAG's 2016 RTP/SCS population projections utilized the existing Riverside

16 General Plan Land Use designations for analysis. The EIR fails to discuss or analyze this fact.

17 The EIR must be revised to include this analysis in order to present the Project's potentially

18 significant impacts and be an adequate informational document.

61.
19 Further, the EIR concludes that the cumulative population growth will be

20 approximately 7,702 people based on 2,422 dwelling units in the cumulative projects list

21 encompassing the City of Colton, City of Jurupa Valley, and the County of Riverside. However,

22 the 7,702 person increase underestimates the actual population increase. The EIR utilizes the

23 City of Riverside's 3.18 persons average household size for analysis (2,422 dwelling units x 3.18

24 persons per unit = 7,702 people). However, this is inappropriate as the other jurisdictions have

25 varying household sizes. For example, the City of Colton average household size is 3.5 persons

26 per household4. The EIR must be revised to properly calculate the population of each

27 cumulative project utilizing the average household size of each jurisdiction. The same is true for

28 the cumulative employees generated by the project. Section 5.2 Growth Inducement of the EIR

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 19

L

2° must also be revised with this information in order for the EIR to be an adequate informational

document.
3

4 Project Alternatives

62. Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate
identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Neither the
analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is

8 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

63.
9 CEQA requires that an EIR consider a "reasonable range of alternatives,"

10 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), and that the document must include a discussion of alternatives even if

11 to some degree they would limit accomplishment of the project's objectives, or would be more

12 costly. Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

13 64. Respondents failed to adequately identify, analyze, and consider alternatives that

14 lessened the Project's impacts. The CEQA Guidelines mandate that "The range of potential

15 alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of the

16 basic objectives of the project and could avoid or substantially lessen one or more of the

17 significant effects." Guidelines 8 15126.6(c).

65.
18 Additionally, and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate

19 identification and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse

20 environmental impacts and fails to eliminate or substantially eliminate all such impacts. Neither

21 the analysis of mitigation measures nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is

22 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

23 66. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will

24 substantially lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those

25 mitigation measures in the EIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines

26 § 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable

27 without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less

28 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.

'PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 20

-
67.
2 CEQA also requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

3 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of

4 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find

5 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project

6 outweigh the significant effects on the environment.» Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). The

7 statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence in the record. Pub.

8 Res. Code § 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).

68.
9 Respondents adopted the statement of overriding considerations when feasible

10 mitigation measures and project alternatives existed, in violation of CEQA. Pub. Res. Code

11 § 21081; Guidelines § 15092. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings

12 regarding the Project's impacts. Respondents also approved the Project based on one or more

13 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse

14 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to

15 support all such findings. Moreover, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more

16 non-written findings that such considerations exist.

17 69. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in

18 that the decision makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about the impacts of

19 mitigation measures for and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval, and the Petitioner

20 and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental

21 impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays

1.
23 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondents to set aside

24 their decision certifying the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168,

25

26 2. 21168.5, 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5);
For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the Respondents to fully

27 comply with the requirements of CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and

28 the applicable Municipal Code prior to any future approval of the Project (Pub.
