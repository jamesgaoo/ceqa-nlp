VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF X HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

1 I. SUMMARY OF PETITION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

2 Summary

3 1. The County of Humboldt has implemented "Zone 1" and "Zone 2" Text

4 Amendments for the Humboldt County October 23, 2017, General Plan' without the County of

5 Humboldt, Humboldt County Board of Supervisors,? and the Humboldt County Planning
6 Director,' complying with the California Environmental Quality Act,* as well as, the California
7 Environmental Quality Act Guidelines.5 Morcover, some of these implementation measures®

8 adopted by the Board are flatly inconsistent with the 2017 General Plan.

9 2. As such, 1) a stay should be imposed pending trial, prohibiting the County of
10 Humboldt from implementing the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments; and 2) a writ of mandate
11 should be issued, ordering the County to:

12 a. Vacate and set aside its certification of the environmental document for the

13 project and decisions approving the Project;
14 b. Suspend all activity under the certification of environmental documents for the

15 Project that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment until Respondent
16 has taken all necessary action to bring the certification of the Project approvals into compliance
17 with CEQA;

18

19 1 The Humboldt County General Plan which was adopted on October 23, 2017 is
20 referred to herein as the "2017 General Plan." The 2019 Zone and Zone . implementation of the General Plan is hereinafter referred to as the "Project" and/or "2019 Zoning Text
21 Amendments."

22 2 The Humboldt County Board of Supervisors is hereinafter referred to as the "Board."

23 3 The County of Humboldt, the Board, and Director, are collectively referred to herein as "Respondent" and/or the "County."
24 4 The California Environmental Quality Act is found at Public Resources Code section
25 21000, et seq., and hereinafter referred to with California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines found at Code of Regulations title 14, section 15000, et seq., as "CEQA."
26 When being discussed independently from the California Environmental Quality Act
27 referred to herein as "CEQA."

28 6 As used herein, the term "implementation measure(s)" means an action, procedure, program, or technique that carries out general plan policy.

- C.

2 Prepare, circulate, and consider an Initial Study identifying all the potential

3 impacts from the Project and identifying where each potential environmental impact was studied
in the 2017 Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), Exhibit C (see below);

4 d.

5 Prepare, circulate, and consider a Supplemental/Subsequent EIR for those

6 potential impacts for which fair argument' exists which were raised by the Public in their

7 comments, so Respondent will be in compliance with CEQA in any subsequent action to approve
the Project; and

0

10 Defendants to cease and refrain from engaging in any and all activities in furtherance of the

11 Project unless and until Respondent and all Defendants takes all necessary steps to bring its
actions into compliance with CEQA.

12 Petitioners / Plaintiffs allege as follows:

13 Basis of Relief Sought

14 4.

15 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, as well as, Public Resources
Code section 21168.5,8 Petitioners and Plaintiffs, HUM CPR Affiliates and HUM CPR
16 ("Petitioners"), on behalf of their members, the general public, and in the public interest, bring

17

18 this action to protect the environment from inappropriate development, to ensure proper

19 implementation of the 2017 General Plan, as well as to ensure application of the rules and laws

20 7

21 "Fair Argument" for purposes of CEQA, and herein, refers to a test, under which, if the record as whole contains substantial evidence that the proposed project may have a significant

22 environmental effect, the lead agency must prepare an EIR even though there may be evidence to the contrary that the project will have no significant effects. Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14

23 15063(b). See also, Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, § 15384, which reads, "(a) 'Substantial evidence' as used in these guidelines means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from

24 this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached. Whether a fair argument can be made that the project may

25 have a significant effect on the environment is to be determined by examining the whole record before the lead agency. Argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence

26 which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate, or evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical impacts on the environment does not constitute

27 substantial evidence. (b) Substantial evidence shall include facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts."

28 8 CEQA determination accompanying a quasi-legislative project approval is reviewed under California Public Resources Code section 21168.5 and not section 21168. Western States Petroleum Ass'n v. Superior Court, 9 Cal. 4th 559, 566 (1995).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

governing zoning and development at the local level.

5. Petitioner respectfully petitions this court for a writ of mandate pursuant to
California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to set aside Respondent's implementation of

4 "Group 1 and "Group 2" of its Zoning Text Amendments to implement its 2017 General Plan.
Petitioners base this CEQA Petition on the County's failure to comply with CEQA as outlined

6 herein. Contrary to what is required under CEQA, Respondent abused its discretion by failing to

7 proceed in a manner required by law when it implemented its 2019 Zoning Text Amendments

8 due to the fact that Respondent failed to conduct any initial study and failed in its compliance

9 with California Public Resources Code section 21094 ("Section 21094 ") regarding a tiered EIR.

10 6. Respondent also failed to comply with Public Resource Code section 21166

11 ("Section 21166 ") by failing to base the asserted findings that there is no new information

12 regarding impacts not previously studied in the 2017 General Plan Final EIR upon substantial

13 evidence in the record. Respondent prepared no initial study, nor presented facts in the

14 Administrative Record' to support that finding. The only substantial evidence in the Record

15 regarding changed circumstances or the existence of "new unstudied information" was

16 uncontradicted comments received from the public (written and oral) regarding potential

17 environmental impacts from the Project which were not studied in Respondent's sole

18 environmental document (the 2017 Final EIR).

19 7. The 2017 Final EIR to the General Plan, which is the environmental document

20 submitted for review by Respondent Board, upon which it based its decisions and findings for the

21 Zone Text Amendments, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit C and incorporated herein by its

22 reference.

23 8. The County approved the Project (the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments) despite

24 that application of the 2017 General Plan Final EIR, as the sole environmental document for the

28 9 "Administrative Record" or "Record" is defined herein as the set of non-deliberative documents that the decision-maker (the Board) considered in making its final decision, which have been prepared and submitted to the Court in this matter.

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

- Project, l0 violated CEQA, including without limitation California Public Resources Code

2 sections 21080 and 21094, and California Code Regulations title 14, sections 15161, 15162, and

3 15168.

4 9. The 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan is inadequate as the environmental

5 document for the Project Text Amendments in regards to compliance with CEQA. Nor does the

6 Final EIR comply with CEQA as an environmental document for discretionary approval for a

7 project which is tiered off the 2017 General Plan."

8 10. The 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan analyzes only policy impacts of

9 the 2017 General Plan. The 2017 Final EIR is devoid of information concerning zoning

10 implementation amendments. The 2017 Final EIR was conducted without the benefit of the

11 mapping of parcels directly effected by the 2017 General Plan, nor were these parcels mapped

12 and placed before the Board in its consideration of the 2019 Zone Text Amendments. The 2017

13 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan fails to, and/or incorrectly, and/or only marginally, analyzes

14 environmental impacts resulting from the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

15 11. The Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan (whether it is called a Project EIR, a

16 Program EIR or Tiered EIR) contains adopted mitigation measures which do not comply with

17 CEQA and/or do not address the new impacts created by the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

18 This is especially true regarding designations in the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments for areas that

19 were not contemplated when the 2017 Final EIR was adopted, and/or which contradict the

20 express terms set forth in the 2017 General Plan.

21 12. Although the Final EIR is the first step in a tiered EIR process, Respondent failed

22 to comply with CEQA by failing to conduct the required initial study pursuant to Section 21094.

23

24 10 The sole environmental document before the Board supporting the 2019 Zoning Text

25 Amendments for the Board hearing dates of June 11, 2019; June 16, 2019; July 8, 2019; August 20, 2019; and August 27, 2019, was the 2017 Final EIR. The County did not place before the

26 Board in its Deliberative Process any other environmental document (including without limitation, the REIR and/or the Draft EIR) upon which it exercised its discretion in approving of

27 the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments. "Deliberative Process" is defined as used herein as, the process used in making informed decisions via the critical examination of issues involving the

28 weighting of reasons for and against a course of action.

11 The County has admitted in its 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan that this Final EIR is intended as the first environmental review in a three-(3)-tiered EIR.

)

1 Section 21094 required Respondent to conduct an Initial Study identifying all potential

2 environmental impacts from the Project Text Amendments, but also to also identify where in the

3 first tiered document (the 2017 Final EIR) all such impacts had been studied and mitigated

4 previously. Any impacts not studied in the first tier (the 2017 Final EIR) are subject to the Fair

5 Argument standard for supplemental/subsequent environmental review. CEQA requires

6 supplemental review if there is any Fair Argument that there remained previously unstudied

7 impacts from the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

8 13. Respondent abused its discretion in approving the 2019 Zoning Text

9 Amendments without full compliance with CEQA. Accordingly, Respondent's implementation

10 of the zoning for "Group 1" and "Group 2" must be set aside, and Respondent must reimplement

11 zoning for Group 1 and Group 2 after full complying with CEQA.

12 II. PARTIES AND PETITIONERS' BENEFICIAL INTEREST

13 Petitioners

14 14. Petitioner/Plaintiff, HUM CPR Affiliates, is an unincorporated group of

15 Humboldt County, California, residents/taxpayers who are affiliated with HUM CPR, a General

16 Stock Corporation created by Humboldt County citizen/taxpayers committed, inter alia, to the

17 sustainable development of the unincorporated areas of Humboldt County, California, through

18 environmental protection, proper implementation of the 2017 General Plan, and the rules and

19 laws governing development in the unincorporated areas of Humboldt County, California. To

20 this end members of HUM CPR Affiliates participated extensively in the public hearings and

21 meetings regarding the development of the 2017 General Plan, and/or testified and submitted

22 written comments on the same, and, as such, Petitioner HUM CPR Affiliates has standing to

23 bring this action and is a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the requested writ, and

24 injunctive relief. Members of HUM CPR Affiliates, by virtue of residing in and/or owning

25 property in the unincorporated areas of Humboldt County, will be directly impacted by the 2019

26 Zoning Text Amendments. HUM CPR Affiliates brings this action on its

27 own behalf and on behalf of its adversely affected members.

28 15. Petitioner/Plaintiff, HUM CPR Inc., is a California incorporated group (General

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

1 Stock Corporation) formed to support sustainable development of the unincorporated areas of

2 Humboldt County, California, through environmental protection, proper implementation of the

3 2017 General Plan, and the rules and laws governing development in the unincorporated areas of

4 Humboldt County, California. To this end members of HUM CPR participated extensively in

5 the public hearings and meetings regarding the development of the 2017 General Plan, and/or

6 testified and submitted written comments on the same, and as such, Petitioner has standing to

7 bring this action and is a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the requested writ and

8 injunctive relief. HUM CPR Inc. brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its

9 adversely affected members and staff.

10 16. General allegations that a petitioner is "within a class of persons beneficially

11 interested" and is a citizen or resident of the area affected by the project are "sufficient to satisfy
12 the liberal standing requirements for private individuals acting in the public interest in
13 proceedings to enforce the provisions of CEQA. Kane v. Redevelopment Agency, 179 Cal. App.

14 3d 899, 904 (1986). Petitioners' geographical proximity to the Project is sufficient to establish

15 standing without a showing that a Petitioners will actually be adversely affected by the Project's

16 environmental impacts. In mandamus proceeding against a municipal entity based on alleged

17 violations of CEQA, a property owner, taxpayer, or elector who establishes a geographical nexus

18 with the site of the challenged project has standing. Citizens Ass'n for Sensible Dev. v. County of

19 Inyo, 172 Cal. App. 3d 151, 158-160 (1985). A petitioner may even be held to have standing,

20 even despite the absence of a beneficial interest, if the question is one of public right, the purpose

21 of the proceeding is enforcement of a public duty, and the public interest would suffer if the

22 agency is not compelled to perform. Environmental Protection Info. Ctr. V. Department of

23 Forestry & Fire Protection, 44 Cal. 4th 459, 479 (2008); Common Cause V. Board of

24 Supervisors, 49 Cal. 3d 432, 439 (1989).

25 17. Associations have standing to sue on behalf of their members to challenge

26 government action if their members would otherwise have standing to sue on their own behalf;

27 the interests the organization seeks to protect in the lawsuit are germane to the organization's

28 purpose; and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires participation of the

5 (1973).

6 18. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

7 sought in this Petition and Complaint. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed herein,

8 Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury without adequate remedy at law.

9 Respondents

10 19. Respondent County of Humboldt is a legal subdivision of the State of California.

11 California Constitution, Article XI, section 1; California Government Code Sections 23002 and

12 23003.

13 20. Respondent Humboldt County Board of Supervisors is the duly constituted
14 governing body for the County. Harris v. Gibbins, 114 Cal. 418 (1896). As such, the Board is

15 ultimately responsible for seeing that the County's mandated legal duties and compliance with

16 applicable law are carried out, including without limitation compliance with the 2017 General

17 Plan; compliance with CEQA, compliance with the CEQA Guidelines, and compliance with

18 California zoning laws, as well as its own County Code. In addition, the Board is the appointing

19 authority for the Planning Director and endows the Planning Director with all legal and other

20 authority possessed by the Planning Director.

21 21. Respondent is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public Resources

22 Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental review for the

23 Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

24 22. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that Respondent

25 Humboldt County Planning Director is the appointing authority for the Staff of the Humboldt

26 County Planning Department, who perform the work coming before the Planning Department.

27 When the Planning Director is the assigned decision-making body on a project within the

28 Planning Department's purview, he is responsible for ensuring that an adequate environmental

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

- process occurs for project. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the

2 Planning Department develops the staff reports for the meetings at which the Board conducts its

3 hearing(s) regarding the 2017 General Plan, and in conjunction with this, is tasked with recording

4 public comment and obtaining comments from other agencies on the expected environmental

5 effects of a project; identifying appropriate measures to reduce the potentially significant effects

6 of a project to non-significant level; preparing, assessing, and processing all environmental

7 documents for Respondent; preparing, distributing, and filing applicable notices, including,

8 without limitation, any Notices of Determination for the implementation measures approved by

9 the Board; coordinating and implementing Respondent's environmental review procedures

10 consistent with policy direction provided by the Board; establishing informal and working

11 thresholds of significance and proposing formal thresholds.

12 23. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that, at all times herein

13 mentioned, each of the Respondents herein was the agent and employee of the County of

14 Humboldt and was at all times acting within the purpose and scope of such agency and

15 employment.

16 24. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that Respondent will

17 continue to fail to act, allowing Real Parties in Interest to continue its unlawful practices unless

18 directed and/or restrained and enjoined by this Court.

19 Real Parties in Interest

20 25. Petitioners are not able to make identification of specific Real Parties in Interest

21 with ties to the unincorporated areas of Humboldt County (other than the general public),

22 because Respondent has elected not to "map" its 2019 Zoning Text Amendments prior to its

23 consideration and passage of these 2019 Zoning Text Amendments. Because of the failure by

24 Respondent to identify with specificity the parcels which will be effected by the passage of

25 Respondent's 2019 Zoning Text Amendments, it is unknown which owners of parcels in the

26 unincorporated area of Humboldt County would qualify as Real Parties in Interest. Said Real

27 Parties in Interest are referred to as ROES 1-500.

28 //

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

1 DOES 1 through 50

2 26. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

3 sued herein as DOES 1 through 50, and therefore sues these Does by such fictitious names.

4 Petitioner will amend this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.

5 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that each of these fictitiously named

6 Does claim to be affected by Respondent's actions regarding the Project.

7 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 27. This court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to either Code of Civil

0 Procedure section 1094.5 (administrative mandate), Code of Civil Procedure section 526

10 (injunctive relief), Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9 and/or Article VI,

11 Section 10 of the California Constitution. The court has jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief

12 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 525, et seq.

13 28. Venue for this action properly lies in the Humboldt County Superior Court

14 because Petitioner, the subject matter of this litigation, and the Project, lie entirely within the

15 unincorporated areas of Humboldt County, California, and the environmental impacts of the

16 Project will be acutely felt in this County. The causes alleged in this Petition arose and are

17 located in this County. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 (actions against public officers), 394

18 (action against a county), and 395 (actions generally). See also Cal. State Parks Foundation v.

19 Superior Court, 150 Cal. App. 4th 826, 824 (2007).

20 29. Petitioners have provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to

21 Respondent in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including this

22 notice and proof of service as Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

23 30. Petitioners have concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record

24 of administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code

25 Section 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and include this notice of election as Exhibit B,

26 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

27 31. Petitioners will provide notice of this action to the California Attorney General by

28 serving a copy of this Petition along with notice of its filing. Publ. Res. Code § 21167.7; Code

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

F Civ. Proc. § 388.

2 32. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action

3 and have exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public

4 Resources Code section 21177. Petitioners and/or other entities and/or individuals raised the

5 legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition orally and in writing during Respondent's decision-

6 making process.

7 33. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial

8 interests of Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this

9 Petition will redress this beneficial interest and the likelihood of further injury and interference

10 with Petitioners' interests, and those of its support members.

11 34. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

12 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its

13 approval of the Project and supporting documents. In the absence of such remedies,

14 Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioners.

15 IV. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

16 California Environmental Quality Act

17 35. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act

18 (NEPA), CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

19 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

20 36. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision

21 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. Cal.

22 Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15002(a)(1). The fundamental goals of environmental review under

23 CEQA are information, participation, mitigation and accountability. Lincoln Place Tenants

24 Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles, 155 Cal. App. 4th 425, 444-445 (2007), cited by Sierra Club v.

25 County of San Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th 1152, 1164 (2019). 'It's purpose is to inform the public

26 and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are

27 made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only environment but also informed self-government.**

28 [Emphasis added.] Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors, 52 Cal. 3d. 553, 564 (1990),

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

1 quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California, 47 Cal.3d 376,

2 392 (1988).

3 37. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

4 when feasible by requiring environmentally superior alternatives and all feasible mitigation

5 measures. Cal. Code of Regs. tit. 14, § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, 52 Cal.

6 3d., at 564-566.

38. CEQA disallows deferring the formulation of mitigation measures to post-

8 approval studies. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B); Sundstrom v. County of

9 Mendocino, 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 308-309 (1988). An agency may only defer the formulation

10 of mitigation measures when it possesses "'meaningful information' reasonably justifying an

11 expectation of compliance." Sundstrom, supra, at 308.

12 39. Deferral of mitigation is also impermissible if it removes the CEQA decision-

13 making body from its decision-making role. Sundstrom, supra, at 207-309. In addition, a lead

14 agency is precluded from making the required CEQA findings unless the record shows that all

15 uncertainties regarding the mitigation of impacts have been resolved; an agency may not rely on

16 mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy or feasibility. Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of

17 Hanford, 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 727 (1990).

18 40. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and

19 procedural steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA

20 process. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d 376, at 392 ("The EIR process protects

21 not only the environment but also informed self government); Concerned Citizens of Costa

22 Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Ag. Assoc., 42 Cal. 3d 929, 936 (1986) (members of the public have a

23 "privileged position" in the CEQA process). "Each public agency should include provisions in

24 its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its

25 existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

26 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, § 15201.

27 [Emphasis added.]

28 41. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

given a full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project. (Discussion

2 following Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15082. See also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15201 and

3 15200.

4 42. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws.

5 A lead agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is

6 "otherwise permissible under applicable laws and regulation." Pub. Resources Code c0.

7 21002.1(c).

8 43. Absent a notice of determination having been issued, an action alleging that a

9 public agency is "carrying out or has approved a project that may have a significant effect on the

10 environment" without having followed CEQA procedures with a legitimate approval of the

11 project must be commenced within "180 days from the date of the public agency's decision to

12 carry out or approve the project, or, if a project is undertaken without formal decision by the

13 public agency, within 180 days from the date of the commencement of the project." Pub. Res.

14 Code § 21167(a).

15 44. CEQA contains a strong preference in favor of preparation of an EIR whenever

16 a there is a Fair Argument that a proposed project "may have significant adverse environmental

17 impacts." County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 v. 2 County of Kern, 127 Cal. App. 4th 1544, 1559 (2005).

18 Environmental Impact Report

19 45. To ensure that governmental agencies and the public are adequately informed

20 about the environmental impact of public decisions, CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare an

21 environmental impact report (EIR) before approving a new project that "may have a significant

22 effect on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21067; Pub. Res. Code § 21151, subd. (a); Friends

23 of College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist., Cal. 5th 937,

24 943 (2016).

25 46. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to

26 alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached

27 ecological points of no return." Laurel Heights Improvement Ass 'n V. Regents of University of

28 Cal., 47 Cal.3d, at 392.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

- 47. The purpose of the EIR is "to provide public agencies and the public in general

2 with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the

3 environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized;

4 and to indicate alternatives to such a project." Pub. Resources Code 21061.

5 48. Under Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15168, program

6 EIRs are used for a series of related actions that can be characterized as one large project. If a

7 program EIR is sufficiently comprehensive, the lead agency may dispense with further

8 environmental review for later activities within the program that are adequately covered in the

9 program EIR. Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, § 15168( c). For a program EIR to suffice as the EIR

10 for a subsequently proposed project, the programmatic EIR must contemplate and adequately

11 analyze the potential environmental impacts of the subsequent project. If the program EIR is

12 deficient in this regard, a tiered EIR may be in order. Pub. Res. Code § 21094; Center for Sierra

13 Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado, 202 Cal. App. 4th 1156, 1157 (2012).

14 49. An EIR's responses to comments must be detailed and must provide a reasoned,

15 good faith analysis. "Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice."

16

17 Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088( c). Failure to provide substantive response to a comment render the
EIR legally inadequate. Rural Land Owners Assoc. v. City Council, 143 Cal. App. 3d 1013,

18 1022-1023 (1983).

19 50. CEQA directs agencies to "tier" EIRs whenever feasible, in part to streamline
20 | regulatory procedures and eliminate repetitive discussions of the same issues in successive EIRs.

21 Pub. Res. Code § 21093; Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation, Inc. v. County of Los Angeles,

22 177 Cal. App. 3d 300, 307 (1986). Pub. Res. Code section 21068.5 defines "tiering" as the

23 "coverage of general matters and environmental effects in an [EIR] prepared for a policy, plan,

24 program or ordinance followed by narrower or site-specific [EIRs] which incorporate by

25 reference the discussion in any prior [EIR] and which concentrate on the environmental effects

26 which (a) are capable of being mitigated, or (b) were not analyzed as significant effects on the

27 environment in the prior [EIR]." See Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, § 15152; Sierra Club v. County

28 of Sonoma, 6 Cal. App. 4th 1307, 1318-1319 (1992).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

1 51. Without accurate and complete information pertaining to the setting of the project

2 and surrounding uses, it cannot be found that any EIR or Project EIR ("PEIR") adequately

3 investigated and discussed the environmental impacts of the project. See San Joaquin

4 Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus, 27 Cal. App. 4th 713, 729 (1994). Thus,

5 "[i]f the description of the environmental setting of the project site and surrounding area is

6 inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the EIR does not comply with CEQA." Cadiz Land Co. v.
Jail Cycle, 83 Cal. App. 4th 74, 87 (2000). A stable and accurate description of the surrounding

8 area is no less crucial than a stable and accurate description of the project. City of Irvine v.

9 County of Orange, 238 Cal. App. 4th 526, 542, fn. 8 (2015).

10 52. The data in an EIR must not only be sufficient in quantity, it must be presented in

11 a manner calculated to adequately inform the public and decision makers, who may not be

12 previously familiar with the details of the project and references in appendices is insufficient to is

13 adequately inform the public or decision makers.

14 53. "[I]nformation "scattered here and there in EIR appendices,' or a report 'buried

15 in an appendix,' is not a substitute for 'a good faith reasoned analysis . '* California Oak

16 Foundation V. City of Santa Clarita, 133 Cal. App. 4th 1219, 1239 (2005), quoting Santa Clarita

17 Org, for Planning v. County of L.A., 106 Cal. App. 4th 715, 722-723 (2003); See Vineyard Area

18 Citizens for Responsible Growth, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 442 (2007).

19 54. An EIR (and/or draft) must contain a project description. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14,

20 § 15124. That project description must include (a) the precise location and boundaries of the

21 proposed project, (b) a statement of the objectives sought by the proposed project; (c) a general

22 description of the project's technical, economic and environmental characteristics; and (d) a

23 statement briefly describing the intended us of the EIR (Id., § 15124, subds. (a) - (d).)"

2 provides in pertinent part: "Where a prior [EIR] has been prepared and certified for a program

3 [or] plan, ... the lead agency for a later project that meets the requirements of this section shall

4 examine significant effects of the later project upon the environment by using a tiered [EIR],

5 except that the report on the later project need not examine those effects which the lead

6 determines were agency
examined at a sufficient level of detail in the prior [EIR] ...." Subdivision

7 (c) provides, "For purposes of compliance with this section, an initial study shall be prepared to

8 assist the lead agency in making the determinations required by this section. The initial study

9 shall analyze whether the later project may cause significant effects on the environment that were

10 not examined in the prior [EIR]." [Italics added.] Sierra Club V. County of Sonoma, supra, at

11 1318-1319.

12 57. In a tiered EIR determination when Section 21166 has been found not to apply,

13 the next step in a tiered process is an inquiry (via an Initial Study) whether there is Fair

14 Argument that there are any environmental impacts not studied an earlier EIR for the tiered

15 project. If there is, a supplemental or subsequent EIR is required. Pub. Res. Code § 21094.

16 58. Section 21166, provides that when an EIR has been prepared for a project

17 pursuant to this division, no subsequent or supplemental EIR shall be required, unless one or

18 more of the following events occurs:

19 a. Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions

20 of the environmental impact report;

21 b. Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

22 project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact

23 report;

24 C. New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the

25 time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes available. Pub. Res.

26 Code, § 21166.

27 59. CEQA Guideline section 15384, subdivision (b) provides that "substantial

28 evidence" includes "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 15 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

supported by facts."

2 60. Section 21094, provides that:

3 "(a) Where a prior environmental impact report has been prepared and certified for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance, the lead agency for later project that meets the requirements of this section shall examine significant effects of the later project upon the environment by using a tiered environmental impact report,
5 except that the report on the later project is not required to examine those effects that the lead agency determines were either of the following:
6 (1) Mitigated or avoided pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 21081 as result of the prior environmental impact report.
7 (2) Examined at a sufficient level of detail in the prior environmental impact report to enable those effects to be mitigated or avoided by site-specific revisions,
8 the imposition of conditions, or by other means in connection with the approval of the later project.
9 (b) This section applies only to a later project that the lead agency determines is all of the following:
10 (1) Consistent with the program, plan, policy, or ordinance for which an environmental impact report has been prepared and certified.
11 (2) Consistent with applicable local land use plans and zoning of the city, county, or city and county in which the later project would be located.
12 (3) Not subject to Section 21166. (c) For purposes of compliance with this section, an initial study shall be
13 prepared to assist the lead agency in making the determinations required by this section. The initial study shall analyze whether the later project may cause
14 significant effects on the environment that were not examined in the prior environmental impact report.
15 (d) All public agencies that propose to carry out or approve the later project may utilize the prior environmental impact report and the environmental impact report
16 on the later project to fulfill the requirements of Section 21081."

17 Pub. Res. Code § 21094 (emphasis added).

18 V. STANDARD OF REVIEW

19 61. "In determining the adequacy of an EIR, the CEQA Guidelines look to whether

20 the report provides decision makers with sufficient analysis to intelligently consider the

21 environmental consequences of a project. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15151. The CEQA

22 Guidelines further provide that "the sufficiency of an EIR is to be reviewed in the light of what is

23 reasonably feasible. . The courts have [therefore] looked not for perfection but for adequacy,
completeness, and a good faith effort a at full disclosure.' Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15151..." In 24

25 re Bay-Delta etc, 43 Cal. 4th 1143, 1175 (2008). The overriding issue on review is thus "whether

26 the [lead agency] reasonably and in good faith discussed [a project] in detail sufficient [to enable]
agency traveled from evidence to 27 the public [to] discern from the [EIR] the "analytic route the

28 action.' Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles, 11 Cal. 3d 506, 515

3 227, 262 (2010).

4 Abuse of Discretion Test- Non Deferential to Agency

5 62. Under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, a prejudicial abuse of discretion

6 may be shown if the agency "has not proceeded in a manner required by law." Western States

7 Petroleum Ass'n, 9 Cal. 4th, beginning at 568.

8 63. "Where the challenge is that the agency did not proceed in the manner required by

9 law, a court must decide de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures,

10 'scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements. . ." Vineyard Area

11 Citizens for Responsible Growth Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th, at 425, cited to by

12 Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th, at 1164.

13 64. Agency compliance with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section

14 21094 is subject to the "abuse of discretion" standard.

15 65. When courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the

16 reviewing court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project

17 proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no
18 judicial deference.'" Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v. Bd. of Port Comrs., 91 Cal.

19 App. 4th 1344, 1355 (2001) (Quoting Laurel Heights, supra, at 409 n. 12). There is a prejudicial a

20 abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision

21 making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR

22 process." Kings County Farm Bureau, 221 Cal. App. 3d, at 712 (Citing Laurel Heights, supra, at

23 403-405).

24 66. Under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, a prejudicial abuse of discretion

25 may be shown if the agency's finding, determination, or decision is not supported by substantial

26 evidence. Western States Petroleum Ass'n v. Superior Court, 9 Cal. 4th beginning at 169.

27 67. "Substantial evidence for CEQA purposes is 'enough relevant information and

28 reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 17 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §

2 15384.

3 68. "Substantial evidence includes 'facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon

4 facts, and expert opinion supported by facts.' (Id., subd. (b).) It does not include argument,

5 speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, clearly erroneous or inaccurate evidence, or

6 evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical

7 impacts on the environment. (Id., subd. (a).))" Preserve Wild Santee V. City of Santee, 210 Cal.

8 App. 4th 260, 275-276 (2012).

o 69. "[I]f there is substantial evidence in the record that the later project may arguably

10 a have a significant adverse effect on the environment which was not examined in the prior

11 program EIR, doubts must be resolved in favor of the environmental review and the agency must

12 a prepare a new tiered EIR, notwithstanding the existence of contrary evidence. . ." Sierra Club V.

13 County of Sonoma, 6 Cal. App.4th, at 1319, cited by Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231

14 Cal App. 4th, at 1164.

15 70. "[WJhen a prior EIR has been prepared and certified for a program or plan, the

16 question for the court reviewing an agency's decision not to use a tiered EIR for a later project 'is

17 one of law,' i.e., the sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument.' Sierra Club v.

18 County of Sonoma, 6 Cal. App.4th 1307, at 1318, cited by Sierra Club v. County of San Diego,

19 231 Cal App. 4th, at 1164.

20 71. The Fair Argument standard applies to whether or not a supplemental EIR must be

21 applied to a Tiered EIR pursuant to Section 21094. Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma, 6 Cal.

22 App.4th 1307, at 1318-1319.

23 72. The Fair Argument test is derived from Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21151, which

24 requires an EIR on any project which may have a significant effect on the environment. That

25 section mandates preparation of an EIR in the first instance whenever it can be fairly argued on

26 the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact. If

27 there is substantial evidence of such impact, contrary evidence is not adequate to support a

28 decision to dispense with an EIR. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15064(g), (h). Section 21151 creates

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 18 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

a low threshold requirement for initial preparation of an EIR and reflects a preference for

2 resolving doubts in favor of environmental review when the question is whether any such review

3 is warranted. Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma, 6 Cal. App.4th 1307, at 1312.

73. The court must set aside the decision if the administrative record contains

5 substantial evidence that proposed project may have a significant environmental impact; in

6 such a case, the agency has not proceeded as required by law. Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma,

7 6 Cal. App.4th, at 1317, cited by Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th, at 1164.

8 Substantial Evidence Test - Deference to Public Agency

9 74. As distinct from Section 21094, which involves the requirements of subsequent

10 environmental review of tiered projects which are subject to the Abuse of Discretion Test, as set

11 forth above, "[o]nce an agency has prepared an EIR, its decision not to prepare a supplemental

12 or subsequent EIR for the same project is controlled by Section 21166. [Emphasis added.]

13 75. As set forth above, Section 21166 provides that subsequent review is required if

14 there are:

15 a. Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions

16 of the EIR;

17 b. Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

18 project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the EIR; and/or

19 C. New information, which was not known and could not have been known at the

20 time of the initial EIR.

21 76. Under Section 21166, for an agency decision not to require a subsequent or

22 supplemental EIR on a project, the traditional, deferential substantial evidence test applies. The

23 court decides only whether the administrative record as a whole demonstrates substantial

24 evidence to support the agency determination that the changes in the project or its circumstances

25 were not so substantial as to require major modifications of the EIR. Fund for Environmental

26 Defense v. County of Orange, 204 Cal. App. 3d 1538, 1544-1545 (1988); Bowman v. City of

27 Petaluma, 185 Cal. App. 3d 1065, 1075 (1986); Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma, 6 Cal.

1 VI. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 77. On multiple grounds, Petitioners challenge Respondent's approval of the 2019

3 Zoning Text Amendments to Zone 1, approved of on June 11, 2019, and for Zone 2 approved on

4 August 27, 2019.

5 78. First, Respondent abused its discretion by failing to follow the requirements of

6 Section 21094 by its failure to conduct the mandatory initial study of impacts under Section

7 21094 and also by its failure to conduct any subsequent or supplemental EIR based upon the Fair

8 Argument of numerous impacts on the environment, which will be fully discussed below.

9 79. Second, as discussed herein, Respondent abused its discretion by ignoring the

10 substantial evidence in the record concerning the existence of new information of impacts never

11 studied in the 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan.

12 80. Third, as discussed herein, Respondent there is no substantial evidence in the

13 record to support Respondent's making of factual findings that there was no new information

14 regarding potential impacts in the record nor changes from the earlier project (2017 Final EIR for

15 the General Plan), since Respondents' purported findings were not based upon facts in the

16 record, but based only upon conclusory statements without any facts or expert opinion to support

17 Respondent's conclusory statements.

18 81. On October 23, 2017, Respondent certified a Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan.

19 82. The 2017 certified Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan was the first part in a

20 tiered EIR process which would be followed by Implementation Ordinances also referred to as

21 Zoning Text Amendments. Respondents have previously determined and publicly announced

22 that said Zoning Text Amendments will be part of a later tiered EIR process.

23 Unstudied Environmental Impacts - Zone 1

24 83. Associated with the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendment before the Board, comments

25 were received from the public'2 regarding previously unstudied environmental impacts, which

26 included, without limitation:

27

28 12 This public comment before the Board took the form of direct testimony, written comments, and/or notes taken by Humboldt County Planning Department Staff of oral testimony at the community workshops conducted by the County for the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

The impacts to the community of reducing wetland buffers from that which was

2 previously in the existing Zoning Ordinance to that of the 2019 Zoning Text

3 Amendments;"3

4 The impact of the purposed Zoning Text Amendments on Affordable Housing, especially

5 in McKinleyville, caused by the change in Respondent's definition of wetlands, as well as

6 Respondent's use of the one-parameter jurisdictional change for wetlands in

7 McKinleyville;'4 and

8 Whether existing limited industrial uses in the zoned areas along Murray Road would

9 have to alter their business practices, and/or close their business(es) due to Respondent's

10 suggested Text Amendment changes regarding wetland buffers and Streamside

11 Management Area changes.15

12 Unstudied Environmental Impacts - Zone 2

13 84. On June 18, 2019, July 9, 2019, and August 27, 2019, Respondent conducted

14 hearings and/or its deliberative process on the 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments. As with the

15 consideration of the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendments, the only environmental document before

16 the Board was the 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan. Petitioners and other members

17 from the general public who attended the Board hearings and community meetings (notes of and

18 correspondence from which were before the Board at these hearings), and written commenters,

19 gave testimony regarding unstudied environmental impacts of the proposed Zoning 2 Text

20 Amendments, which included but was not limited to:

21

22 13 This public comment before the Board took the form of direct testimony on June 11, 2019 and August 27, 2019.
23 14 Public comment was received that Respondent's change in approach to wetlands
24 would result in the shutting down most housing development, especially affordable housing, throughout the entire unincorporated area of McKinleyville both before the Planning
25 Commission and then the Board on June 11 and August 27, 2019.

18 Deficiencies From Actions of the Board

19 85. On both June 11, 2019, and August 27, 2019, Respondents failed to address

20 public comments regarding the deficiencies caused by Respondents relying solely upon the 2017

21 Final EIR to the 2017 General Plan as the only environmental document for review of the 2019

22 Zoning Text Amendments. The Board left largely unchanged the unsupported conclusions

23 previously relied upon for its assertion that CEQA had been adequately complied with. Further,

24 the staff report and 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan do not stand alone as a complete

25 document, despite being the only supporting evidence in the Administrative Record for the Board

26 actions on both these dates.

27 86. Respondents made purported "factual findings" that, 1) there was no "new

28 information" regarding impacts from the proposed 2019 Zoning Text Amendments; and 2) there

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 27 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

- were no changes from the 2017 General Plan in the proposed 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

2 Respondent made these purported factual findings without any factual/evidentiary substantiation

3 in the record, and, instead, merely relied upon a single conclusory statement by staff in the staff

4 report before the Board.

5 87. Respondent did not conduct any initial study pursuant to Section 21094 to identify

6 all impacts from the then proposed 2019 Zoning Text Amendments, nor did Respondent

7 articulate how all impacts, including those associated with the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments,

8 had been fully studied in the 2017 Final EIR.

9 88. Based on a highly disorganized record, Respondent passed the 2019 Zoning Text

10 Amendments without describing the exact areas/parcels in the unincorporated areas of the

11 County of Humboldt that would be effected by the Amendments and ignored all public

12 comments regarding unstudied impacts.

13 89. Petitioners allege that Respondent was not even interested in considering any of

14 the unstudied impacts from the Project, nor was Respondent concerned with any public

15 comments regarding these unstudied impacts from the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

16 Petitioners allege that this is evidenced by the fact that, as soon as the staff presentation was

17

18 concluded on August 27, 2019, and before any public comment was even taken regarding
unstudied impacts, Respondent Supervisor Madrone moved to pass the 2019 Zoning Text

19 Amendments. Supervisor Madrone's motion was seconded by Respondent Supervisor Wilson,

20 before any public comment at all was taken, and even thought Chair Bohn questioned this

21 motion being made before public comment had been called for.

22 90. After Public Comment was concluded, even though the members of the public

23

24 had pointed out the existence of numerous and significant unstudied impacts, Respondent passed
the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments without addressing the now identified unstudied

25 environmental impacts identified. These comments from the public, recieved by Respondent
26 before its vote, comprise "substantial evidence" of unstudied environmental impacts.

27 Failure to Provide the Public Its Right of Review

16 Cumulative Impacts

17 92. Respondent failed to consider the cumulative impacts occasioned by its

18 implementation of the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments, including without limitation:

19 a. Adverse environmental impacts from the new wetland buffer standards when

20 combined with a decreased ability to build housing on land zoned TE and AE under the 2019

21 Zoning Text Amendments, which combine to concentrate population elsewhere than TE and AE

22

23 38 "The March 14, 2019 Green Point/Redwood Valley Area Zoning Implementation Workshop (approximately two hours long and not a part of the Board of Supervisors list of 24 communities to reach out to in their December 2018 and January 2019 meetings) with the County's Planning and Building Department was enlightening. It informed me about how much
25 we community members don't understand about the planning process, for example: Planning staff may not have visited the areas they are planning for; Impacted agencies such as CalFire,
26 who has the primary responsibility for responding to fires, and the Blue Lake Fire Protection District that has an agreement to respond when possible, were not consulted in the initial
27 planning process and they, like the public, provide comments afterwards; Assessed (and possibly illegally subdivided) versus legal lot sizes are being used to determine proposed minimum
28 acreage for building . . . New wildland fire research was only indirectly considered (there was not enough time in the workshop to ask about how oak woodland preservation and restoration state priorities informed the planning decisions) . ..:

- zones; and

2 b. Combined new adverse environmental impacts from the reduction of housing on

3 land zoned both TE and AE results in an increase of traffic, as people no longer live where they

4 work and must commute to engage in businesses permitted on TE and AE land.

5 2017 General Plan Inconsistencies

6 93. The following written comments, which are included in the Administrative

7 Record, reference the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments inconsistency with the 2017 General Plan:

8 a. The August 26, 2019 Harland Law Letter which states the following concerns at

9 page AR-0823 sates, "The staff report (along with Attachment 1 and the sole attached

10 environmental document) fails to legally identify how the item is legally consistent with the 2017

11 General Plan to be implemented in the manner set forth in the staff report, in Attachment and

12 the environmental document attached to the staff report. . ." AR-0823. "If some topics are not

13 even mentioned in the 2017 General Plan (TE; M; the elimination of AE 20), it is not possible

14 that data concerning these effect of these designations has ever been collected for consistency

15 review …[T]here is no legally sufficient basis for a finding of 2017 General Plan Consistency

16 for the reasons in the staff report; merely finding a policy in the 2017 General Plan, or a note in a

17 footnote does not establish 2017 General Plan Consistency at all. That is finding you have to

18 make and cannot make based

19 b. upon what is articulated in the Staff Report. AR-0830.
The letter of April 10, 2019, from the Humboldt County Farm Bureau, signed by

20 Johanna Rodoni, President, and found at AR-0517. states. "Do the changes proposed allow uses

21 that are not allowed within the current zoning, like cannabis cultivation? We are not sure how

22 this would be consistent with the County's current policies and ordinances concerning where to

23 allow cannabis activities. ..":

24 C. The March 15, 2019, letter from Coalition for Responsible Transportation

25 Priorities, signed by Colin Fiske, Executive Director and found at AR-0525-27, states, "In

26 addition to the problem of parking standards noted above, other development standards do not

27 meet the 2017 General Plan's requirement of providing higher density development (Policy UL-

28 P6). Most notably, although proposed yard setbacks have been somewhat reduced compared to
other zones, they still will be applied in many cases, resulting in lower density. Precisely in

16 there a is a Fair Argument that there are environmental impacts regarding the 2019 Zoning Text

17 Amendments for Zone 2.

18 113. Respondent abused its discretion in failing to proceed in the manner required by

19 law and conduct either Supplemental/Subsequent EIR for the Zone 2 Text Amendments after

20 Public Comment revealed that there is Substantial Evidence in the Administrative Record that

21 there is Fair Argument regarding environmental impacts of the Zone 2 Text Amendments.

22 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of Section 21166, There Is No Substantial Evidence to Support Respondent's Findings
24 of No New Information/Changes Regarding Zone 1 Text Amendments)

25 114. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above

26 115. The obligation to conduct supplemental review under Public Resources Code

27 section 21166, applies regardless of whether the project under consideration has undergone

28 previous, project-specific environmental review or is being carried out under plan for which the
agency has previously certified a program EIR report. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15162 and

15168(c)(2); Citizens for a Sustainable Treasure Island v. City & County of San Francisco, 227

2 Cal. App. 4th 1036, 1038 (2014).

3 116. "Although CEQA distinguishes 'subsequent EIRs ($21116) from initial EIRs (See
§ 21151), both types of EIRs are subject to the same general procedural and substantive

5 requirements. See generally Pub. Resources Code, § 21061 [defining environmental impact

6 report]; see also id, §§ 21100, 21100.1 [information to be included], 21004, 21153 [consultation

7 requirements], 21091-21092 [public notice and comment]; Friends of College of San Mateo

8 Gardens, 1 Cal. 5th, at 953, fn. 3.

9 117. As set forth above, substantial evidence means facts, or expert opinion based upon

10 facts. Substantial evidence is not factually unsupported conclusory statements.

11 118. The public comments provided the Board of Supervisors regarding the 2019

12 Zone 1 Text Amendments establish that there are changes/new information of impacts not

13 studied in the Final EIR - the only Environmental Document in the Administrative Record for the

14 Hearings on the 2019 Zone Text Amendments.

15 119. There is no substantial evidence in the record of any facts or expert opinion based

16 upon facts to support Respondent's factual findings that Section 21166 is not applicable to the

17 2019 Zoning Text Amendments for Zone 1.

18 120. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support any finding that there are

19 no changes or no new information of environmental impacts from the Project nor that any

20 changes or new information had been previously and sufficiently studied in the 2017 Final EIR

21 for the 2017 General Plan. The 2017 General Plan is not the same Project as the 2019 Zoning

22 Text Amendments. While the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments are clearly contemplated by the

23 2017 General Plan, as considered by the Board, these 2019 Zoning Text Amendments are a
24 different/changed project from the 2017 General Plan. To justify its assertion that there was no

25 changes/new information presented by the Project Text Amendments, Respondent simply
26 provided conclusory statements with absolutely no supporting facts (nor expert opinion based

27 upon specified facts) that there are no changes and/or new information from the 2017 General

28 Plan, regarding the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments as written and considered by the
Respondent.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 38 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

121. Because the Administrative Record is void of any facts or expert opinion based

2 upon facts, there is no substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that there are no

3 changes and no new information regarding the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments for Zone 1, as

4 written and considered by Respondent, the Administrative Record contains only conclusory

5 statements that no changes or new information exist. The Factual Findings regarding the 2019

6 Zone 1 Text Amendments are legally insufficient as a matter of law.

7 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (CEQA Violation, Section 21166, No Substantial Evidence in Record for Findings That There Is No New
9 Information/changes Regarding 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments)

10 122. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above

11 123. As set forth above, substantial evidence means facts, or expert opinion based upon

12 facts. Substantial evidence is not factually unsupported conclusory statements.

13 124. There is no substantial evidence in the record of any facts or expert opinion based

14 upon facts to support Respondent's Factual Findings that section 21166 is not applicable to the

15 Project 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments.

16 125. Because the Administrative Record is void of any facts or expert opinion based

17 upon facts, there is no substantial evidence in the record to support a finding that there are no

18 changes and no new information regarding the 2019 Zoning 2 Text Amendments, as written and

19 considered by Respondent, the Administrative Record contains only conclusory statements that

20 no changes or new information exist. The Factual Findings regarding the 2019 Zone 2 Text

21 Amendments are legally insufficient as a matter of law.

22 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (CEQA Violation, Section 21166. Uncontroverted Substantial Evidence in Record Is That There Is New Information Impacts
24 That Were Previously Unstudied or Impact Greater That Previously Studied Regarding the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendments)
25 126. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above
26 127. As set forth above in the General Allegations, the only facts in the Administrative
27 Record regarding the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendments is that there is substantial evidence of
28 changes from the 2017 Final EIR for the 2017 General Plan and/or New Information by way of

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 39 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

- the public comments, outlining facts of environmental impacts which had not been studied in the

2 2017 Final EIR for the 2017General Plan the only environmental document in the

3 Administrative Record regarding the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendments.

4 128. Petitioner alleges as set forth above (see Paragraphs 77-93) that because the

5 uncontroverted substantial evidence in the record is that there are environmental impacts neither

6 studied, or if studied, more significant impacts than were studied in the 2017 Final EIR for the

7 2017 General Plan, Respondent failed to proceed as required by law and conduct

8 supplemental/subsequent environmental review of the changes/new information in regards to

9 environmental impacts.

10 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (CEQA Violation, Section 21166,

12 Uncontroverted Substantial Evidence in Record That There Is New Information Regarding 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments)

13 129. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above

14 and adds:

15 130. As set forth above in the General Allegations (see Paragraphs 77-93) and by way

16 of the public comments, the only substantial evidence in the Administrative Record regarding the

17 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments is that there is evidence of changes in the Zoning 2 Text

18 Amendments from the 2017 Final EIR for General Plan, and/or new Information of

19 environmental impacts exist which had not been studied in the 2017 Final EIR for the General

20 Plan.

21 131. The only environmental document in the Administrative Record regarding the

22 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments is the 2017 Final EIR for the General Plan.

23 132. Because the uncontroverted substantial evidence in the record is that there are

24 environmental impacts not studied or, if studied, more significant environmental impacts than

25 studied in the 2017 Final EIR for the General Plan, Respondents have failed to proceed as

26

27 required by law and conduct supplemental/subsequent environmental review of the changes/new
information in regards to environmental impacts.

1 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Provide the Public Its Right of Review)

3 133. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
134. "Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process," and CEQA

5 guarantees the public a right of participation and review in the EIR process and public agencies

6 are required to provide for wide formal and informal public involvement so as to receive and

7 evaluate public reactions to environmental issues related to the agency's activities. Cal. Code

8 Regs. tit. 14, § 15201.

9 135. The purposes of engaging the public in the review of an EIR or negative

10 declaration is to share expertise, disclose agency analyses, check for accuracy, detect omissions,

11 discover public concerns, and solicit counter proposals. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15200. An

12 agency must provide "adequate time for other public agencies and members of the public to

13 review and comment" on draft environmental documents.

14 136. "As the California Supreme Court has explained, "If CEQA is scrupulously

15 followed, the public will know the basis on which its responsible officials either approve or reject

16 environmentally significant action, and the public being duly informed, can respond accordingly

17 to action with which it disagrees. [Citations.] The EIR process protects not only the environment

18 but also informed self-government." Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th, at

19 1164, citing Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, 47 Cal.3d, at 392.

20 137. Petitioners allege that the 2017 Final EIR (Exhibit C) fails to provide both

21 mapping and/or adequate descriptions of each of the parcels in the unincorporated area of

22 Humboldt County that will be effected by the Project and therefore fails to provide the public

23 with its right to review.

24 138. Petitioners allege upon information and belief that many if not all of the parcels

25 which will be effected by the 2019 Zoning Text Amendment have not been identified and

26 mapped, or if identified and mapped, have not been shared with the public. Moreover,

27 Petitioners are informed and believe that Respondent has failed to apprise the owners of said

28 identified properties and failed to identify in the Administrative Record such mapped parcels to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 41 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

avoid environmental review of impacts from the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

2 139. Respondent's failure to accurately and consistently depict parcels effected by the

3 either the 2019 Zone 1 Text Amendments and/or 2019 Zone 2 Text Amendments violated CEQA

4 by failing to notice the public nor the property owners who would be specifically effected by the

5 project Text Amendments to allow them input as to environmental impacts from the Project.
140. Respondent has failed to adequately respond to public comments on the 2019
Zoning Text Amendments when public commenters opined that the 2017 Final EIR for the

8 General Plan was inadequate and did not consider new environmental impacts caused by the

9 proposed 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

10 141. Petitioners allege that on August 27, 2019, directly after the Staff Report was

11 made regarding the Zone 2 Text Amendments, that Supervisor Madrone moved to pass the

12 amendments before any Public Comments were made. This motion was seconded by Supervisor

13 Wilson for Respondent to vote on the matter before any Public Comments were heard.

14 142. Petitioners are informed and believe that neither Supervisor was interested in the

15 public comments yet to be made, nor were they interested in proceeding in the manner required

16 by law and respond to the Public Comments. Petitioners further allege that said disinterest in

17 public comment is further evidenced by Respondent failing to address and respond to public

18 comments regarding unstudied impacts as set forth above in Paragraphs 77-93.

19 143. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondent has prejudicially abused

20 its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law, nor has Respondent supported

21 its decision by substantial evidence by, among other things, failing to provide an opportunity for

22 public review and comment before it adopted its environmental documents for the Project.

23 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Evaluate Significant Environmental Impacts)

25 144. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

26 145. Respondent is required to disclose and analyze significant adverse effects upon

27 the environment, and to discuss and adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation measures to

28 eliminate or substantially reduce all significant impacts.

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 42 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

1 146. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondent has prejudicially abused

2 its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law and not supported its decision by

3 substantial evidence by not property disclosing, analyzing or mitigating the Project's adverse

4 effects upon the environment.

5 TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Evaluate and Adopt Feasible Alternatives)

7 147. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

8 148. Respondent is required to consider and adopt feasible alternatives to substantially

9 lessen significant adverse effects on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(a),

10 21100(b)(4); Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15126(a). CEQA requires government agencies "to

11 consider alternatives to proposed actions affecting the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21001(g).

12 149. "CEQA establishes a duty for public agencies to avoid or minimize environmental

13 damage where feasible." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15021(a); Pub. Res. Code §§ 21001, 21002.1.

14 150. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

15 required by law and did not support its approval of the Project Text Amendments with

16 substantial evidence because not only did Respondent fail to identify potential impacts and fail to

17 point out where each of these potential impacts had been previously studied, Respondent

18 completely failed to incorporate any/all feasible and prudent alternative or mitigation measures,

19 to substantially reduce all significant adverse impacts on the environment. This resulted in a lack

20 of any adequate written analysis of feasible alternatives and any/all mitigation measures designed

21 to reduce the significant adverse environmental effects of the Text Amendments (the Project).

22 151. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondent prejudicially abused its

23 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law and did not support its approval of

24 the Text Amendments by, among other things, not performing an adequate analysis, in violation

25 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, sections 15021 and 15126, as well as, Public

26 Resources Code section 21001 and 21002.1. Respondent failed to consider less environmentally

1 THIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adequately Disclose and Evaluate Cumulative Impacts)

3 152. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

4 153. "Cumulative impacts" are defined as "two or more individual effects which, when
considered together, are considerable or which compound or in crease other environmental

6 impacts." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15355. "The cumulative impacts can result form

7 individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time." Cal.

8 Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15355(b).

154. Respondent's environmental documents for both Zone 1 and Zone 2 Text

10 Amendments (the Project) are deficient in that these documents failed to identify and discuss any

11 potential cumulative impacts related to either Text Amendments.

12 155. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

13 required by law in that Respondent failed to discuss or analyze any cumulative impacts at all or

14 provide mitigation for cumulative impacts resulting from the actions proposed by the Project

15 Text Amendments.

16 156. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondent prejudicially abused its

17 discretion by making determinations and/or adopting findings that do not comply with the
18 requirements of CEQA and approving the Project Texts Amendments in reliance thereon.

19 Accordingly, Respondent's decisions approval of the Project must be set aside.

20 FOURTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Violation of CEQA Failure to Adopt Adequate Mitigation Measures)

22 157. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

23 158. Public Resources Code § 21002 prohibits agencies to approve projects that have

24 significant impacts on the environment when feasible mitigation measures can substantially

25 lessen or avoid such impacts.

26 159. "A 'mitigation measure' is a suggestion or change that would reduce or minimize

27 significant adverse impacts on the enjoinment caused by the project as proposed." Sierra Club V.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 44 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

- App. 4th, at 445.

2 160. An adequate EIR must describe mitigation measures that could feasibly

3

4 substantially reduce or avoid each identified significant effect. "If a mitigation measure would
cause one or more significant effects in addition that would be caused by the project as proposed,

5 the effects of the mitigation measure shall be discussed by in less detail than the significant

6 effects of the project as proposed." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15126( c).

7 161. Relying on conclusory statements that there were no adverse environmental

8

9 impacts to mitigate, Respondent abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required
by law in that it failed to adopt any adequate and/or effective mitigation measures for the 2019

10 Zoning Text Amendments.

11 162. Respondent failed to proceed according to the law and prejudicially abused its

12 discretion in that, to the extent it did adopt any mitigation measures and/or adequate mitigation

13

14 measures, said measure are not effective, are not supported by substantial evidence in the record,

15 and are not supported by legally required findings. Accordingly, Respondent's approval of the
Project must be set aside.

16 FIFTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adopt Adequate Findings)

18 163.

19 164. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
To ensure that mitigation measures are considered and adopted, Public Resources
20 § Code 8 21081 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations § § 15091, 15092 and 15093

21 require agencies to make specific findings before they can approve projects with significant

22 environmental effects. Agencies cannot approve projects with significant environmental effects

23

24 unless they find either that such effects can be avoided or substantially lessened by adoption of

25 mitigation measures or project alternatives; that other agencies with jurisdiction over the projects

26 have adopted such alternatives or mitigation measures; or that mitigation measurers or alternative
are infeasible due to specific economic, social or other considerations.

4 V. City Council, 229 Cal. App. 3d 1011, 1037, fn. 17 (1991).

5 167. Respondent is required to determine that the Project has a significant impact upon

6 the environment if the project has the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to the

7 disadvantage of long-term environmental goals, or cause environmental effects which are

8 individually limited but cumulatively considerable. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15065(a)-(c).

9 168. If a Project modification will not eliminate all significant impacts, Respondent

10 was required to issue a statement of overriding considerations regarding the Project Text

11 Amendments if it can not approve the Project or an alternative to the Project is not viable. Cal.

12 Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15093.

13 169. Public comments submitted to Respondent, as set forth above, identify significant

14

15 adverse environmental impacts, which Respondent either ignored or glossed over the substance
of, with only conclusory responses which lack any factual support. These public comments
16 identify potential adverse environmental impacts related to the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments

17 which are significant, and for which there have not been any finding(s) of any overriding
18 considerations with respect to these 2019 Zoning Text Amendments.

19 170. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

20 required by law. Respondent has not supported its decisions by substantial evidence or

21 otherwise, under California Code of Regulations §§ 15091 through 15093, in that (among other

22 things):

23 a. Respondent has failed to identify the significant environmental effects of the

24 Project and has approved the Proposed Project Text Amendments without making written

25 findings for each of these significant effects as required by California Code of Regulations, Title

26 14 section 15091;

27 b. Respondent approved the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments without eliminating or
28 substantially lessening all significant effects on the environment where feasible, nor determining

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 46 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

that remaining significant effects on the environment are acceptable due to overriding concerns

2 as required by California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15092; and

3 C. Respondent has failed to issue a statement of overriding considerations with its

4 approval of the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments as required by California Code of Regulations

5 Title 14, section 15093.

6 171. Because of the numerous, significant or presumptively significant impacts
enumerated herein, Respondent was required to devise specific, concrete mitigation measures or

8 alternatives which would substantially reduce or avoid those impacts. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,

9 21081; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15091.

10 172. Respondent has breached its duties and prejudicially abused its discretion and

11 failed to proceed according to law in its failure to devise and require mitigation measures,

12 alternatives, and adopt findings and a statement of overriding considerations.

13 SIXTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Respond to Public Comments at Hearing Before Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors)
15 173. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
16 174. "The evaluation and response to public comments is an essential part of the
17 CEQA process. Failure to comply with the requirements can lead to disapproval of a project."
18 ("Discussion" following Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15088). By forcing the approving agency to
19 acknowledge, summarize and respond to the public's concerns, the requirement "enable[s] the
20 public to determine the environmental and economic values of their elected and appointed
21 officials thus allowing for appropriate action come election day should a majority of the voters
22 disagree." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15003(e).
23 175. Respondent must include and respond to comments regarding the EIR of the
24 Project. Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, §§ 15132, 15088. To meet legal standards, an agency's
25 responses to comments must specifically explain the reasons for rejecting suggestions received in
26 comments and for proceeding with project despite its environmental impacts. Such
27 explanations must be supported with specific references to empirical information, scientific
28 authority and/or explanatory information. The responses must manifest a good faith, reasoned

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 47 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

1 analysis. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. Cal. Code

2 Regs. tit. 14, § 15088.

3 176. A great number of Public Comments were submitted to Respondent throughout

4 the review process and are in the Administrative Record for both Zone 1 and Zone 2 Text

5 Amendments. See Paragraphs 77-93. These Project Text Amendments came before the Planning

6 Commission and then before Respondent Board on June 11, 2019; June 18, 2019; July 9, 2019;

7 and August 27, 2019. Respondent ignored, glossed over and/or disregarded these Public

8 Comments before Respondent Board on June 11, 2019; June 18, 2019; July 9, 2019; and August

9 27, 2019

10 177. Because of these actions by Respondent, the Project Text Amendments' potential

11 impacts identified by the Public, as well as its cumulative impacts, must therefore be considered

12 still "significant" due to the fact that Respondent has failed to address them. Nor has Respondent

13 successfully mitigated the impacts of the Project in the manner or to the extent required by law.

14 178. Respondent did not proceed according to law and has not supported its decisions

15 by substantial evidence. As such, Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion .The 2017

16 EIR for the General Plan fails to provide, evaluate, and respond to the issues and comments

17 raised during the review process for the 2019 Zoning Text Amendments. These failures include

18 the following failure, among other inadequacies, to include and adequately respond to the public

19 comments regarding:

20 d. The Project's scope;

21 b. The Project's description;

22 C. The Project's impacts as described herein;

23 d. The lack of adequate study and documentation in its environmental review

24 process; and

25 e. The need for a second tier EIR.

26 179. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a

27 manner required by law because Respondent did not issue adequate evaluations and responses to

28 environmental concerns raised by public comment which provided, among other things, a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 48 HUM CPR AFFILIATES V. County of Humboldt

response to significant environmental concerns raised by the public comment. These concerns

2 include, but are not limited to, the environmental impacts set forth herein.

3 SEVENTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adopt an Adequate Mitigation Monitoring Plan)

5 180. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

6 181. CEQA requires that whenever an agency finds that potential adverse impacts exist

7 which can be mitigated, it is required to adopt a mitigation monitoring program "designed to

8 ensure 'compliance during project implementation" to ensure that the mitigation measures are

9 followed. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6; see also Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231 Cal App.

10 4th, at 1165.

11 182. Respondent has prejudicially abused its discretion because in addition to failing to

12 identify mitigation measure to the Project Text Amendments, Respondent failed to adopt legally

13 adequate reporting or monitoring program(s) for any mitigation measures for the 2019 Zone 1

14 and Zone 2 Text Amendments.

15 EIGHTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Failure to Comply with CEQA - Failure to Explain How Evidence Supports Conclusions Pub. Res. Code §§ 21268, 21168.5)
17 183. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
18 184. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
19 the requirements of the statute.
20 185. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
21 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
22 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
23 reached.
24 186. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings regarding the Zone 1 Text 1
25 Amendments on June 11, 2019, and regarding the Zone 2 Text Amendments on August 27, 2019.
26 The findings purportedly made on those dates are inadequate as a matter of law because they are
27 not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, without limitation, the finding that

environmental effects.

2 187. Respondent, the lead agency for the Project, violated CEQA by certifying that the

3 previous 2017 Final EIR for the General Plan covered the all environmental effects of the Project

4 Text Amendments when it did not.

5 188. As a result of the defects described herein, Respondent prejudicially abused its
discretion by making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the
7 requirements of CEQA and approving the Project Text Amendments in reliance thereon,
8 Accordingly, Respondent's decisions approval of the Project text Amendments must be set aside.
NINETEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of Government Code Section 65300.5 - 2017 General Plan Inconsistencies)

11 189. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

12 190. "[TJhe propriety of virtually any local decision depends upon consistency with

13 the applicable general plan and its elements.' [Citation.] 'Since consistency with the general plan

14 is required, absence of a valid general plan, or valid relevant elements or components thereof,

15 precludes enactment of zoning ordinances and the like.' [Citation.] . . ." Fonseca v. City of

16 Gilroy, 148 Cal. App. 4th 1174, 1182 (2007).

17 191. Because the adopted 2017 General Plan makes no mention of any Timber

18 Exclusive Zone, nor Agricultural Zones which eliminate all development potential for small
19 parcels so zoned, fails to address incompatible uses therein, and is in conflict with the General

20 Plan's Affordable Housing Element, there is no valid general plan as to these designations.

21 TWENTIETH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Alternate Writ of Mandate)

23 192. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

24 193. Mandamus will lie to correct an abuse of discretion, whether the actions being

25 compelled or corrected can itself be characterized as "ministerial" or "legislative." Santa Clara

26 County Counsel Ass'n v. Woodside, 7 Cal. 4th 525, 539-540 (1994).

27 194. "A refusal to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion. . [mandamus]

28 does lie to command the exercise of discretion to compel some action upon the subject

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 50 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

F involved." Sunset Drive Corp. V. Redlands, 73 Cal. App. 4th 215, 222 (1999).

2 195. Article XI, section 7 of the California Constitution provides that "[a] County .

3 may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and

4 regulations not in conflict with general laws."

5 196. As stated herein, Respondents have a clear and present duty to comply with

6 CEQA, California Planning and Zoning Law, as well as refraining to take action in areas

7 preempted by the State of California.

8 197. Petitioner has beneficial interest in seeking performance as stated herein.

9 198. As stated herein, Petitioner has no adequate remedy to address Respondents'

10 failures.

11 199. At all times material hereto, Respondents have, and continue to have, the ability

12 to comply with its legal duties and obligations. Respondents have failed and refused to perform

13 those duties and obligations including without limitation notwithstanding the substantial
contrary to law and 14 evidence presented by Petitioners that such failures and refusals are

15 regulations and will have adverse consequences on Petitioners and those residing in Humboldt

16 County.

17 200. Respondents acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, unreasonably, and

18 without any or an adequate legal or evidentiary basis to not comply with the requirements of

19 CEQA, California Planning and Zoning Law, as well as refraining to take action in areas

20 preempted by the State of California.

21 TWENTY-FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Injunctive Relief)

23 201. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

24 202. At all times complained of herein, and continuing to the present time, Respondent

25 has wrongfully and unlawfully failed to comply with CEQA:

26 203. The 2019 Zoning Text Amendments, as approved by Respondent, will cause

27 irreparable injury and harm to Petitioners and the public at large. The significant environmental

28 impacts from 2019 Zoning Amendments have not been adequately evaluated, must less mitigated

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDA
AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 51 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

1 to less than significant level. Further feasible and/or reasonable alternatives have not been

2 properly evaluated by Respondent. This wrongful conduct, unless and until enjoined and

3 restrained by order of this Court, continue to cause great and irreparable injury to Petitioners and

4 the public at large.

5 204. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law for the injuries currently being

6 suffered due to the actions taken by Respondent.

7 205. The errors and prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondent constitute the basis

8 for injunctive relief, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526, to prevent this irreparable

9 injury.

10 VIII. AWARD OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES

11 206. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public

12 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the

13 public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the County, and will result in

14 the enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and

15 other legal requirements applicable to the Project by voiding the Project approvals and
16 prohibiting Respondent from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has

17 complied with those legal requirements and by prohibiting Respondent from undertaking any

18 portion of the Project until it has fully complied with these requirements

19 207. Under CEQA, a winning plaintiff does confer a significant benefit when the court

20 indicates environmental review needs to be conducted (given that the "preservation of biological

21 resources and safety of public roadways" being "matters of interest to the general public.")39;

22 "Society as a whole benefits when law enforcement agencies properly interpret and implement

23 the law.'"40; and "the cost of ... legal victory transcends ... personal interest and places a burden on

25 39 Keep Our Mountains Quiet V. County of Santa Clara, 236 Cal. App. 4th 714, 739 (2015). (Attorney fees were property awarded under Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, because there
26 a was a significant benefit to requiring an EIR, even if no new mitigation measures resulted).

27 40 Schmidt v. Department of California Highway Patrol, 1 Cal. App. 5th 1287. 1299 (2016). (*The CHP argues that contrary to the trial court's finding, there was no significant
28 benefit conferred on the general public. The CHP overlooks that it was misinterpreting statutes designed to benefit members of the public. Society as a whole benefits when law enforcement agencies properly interpret and implement the law.")

the claimant out of proportion to his or her individual stake in the matter."41, Petitioners should

2 be awarded the costs and attorney fees incurred in the prosecution of this action pursuant to Code

3 of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5.

208. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorney's fees as provided in Code of Civil

5 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of

6 enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioners to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees

7 pursuant to that section.

8 WHEREFORE, Petitioner demands the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate

9 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9, entry of judgment, and further relief as

10 follows:

11 1. For a stay pending trial of Respondent's decisions approving the Project (2019

12 Zoning Text Amendments.).

13 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering:

14 a. Respondent to vacate and set aside its certification of the environmental

15 document for the project and decisions approving the Project.

16 b. Respondent to suspend all activity under the certification of environmental

17 documents for the Project that could result in any change or alteration to

18 the physical environment until Respondent has taken all necessary action

19 to bring the certification of the Project approvals into compliance with

20 CEQA;

21 C. Respondent to prepare, circulate, and consider an Initial Study identifying

22 all the potential impacts from the Project and identifying where each

23 potential environmental impact was studied in Exhibit C; and

24 d. Respondent to prepare, circulate, and consider a

25 Supplemental/Subsequent EIR for those potential impacts

26

27 41 Robinson V. City of Chowchilla, 202 Cal. App. 4th 382. 400 (2011); (Even if the
28 primary effect of the lawsuit was to advance the police chief's personal economic interests, a fee award was permissible. Private enforcement was necessary because no government action was being taken.)

AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 53 HUM CPR AFFILIATES v. County of Humboldt

for which a Fair Argument exists which were raised by the

2 Public in their comments, so Respondent will be in

3 compliance with CEQA to any subsequent action to

4 approve the Project.

5 3. For a interlocutory and permanent injunction directing Respondent and all

6 Defendants to cease and refrain from engaging in any and all activities in

7 furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondent and all Defendants takes all

8 necessary steps to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA.

Q 4. For costs of suit herein incurred;

10 5. As to all Causes of Action, for attorney fees incurred by Petitioners in prosecuting

11 the instant action as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure Section

12 1021.5 and/or any other applicable provision(s) of law; and

13 6. For such other and further relief as the court may deem proper.

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose of Final EIR

This document, together with the Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report (RDEIR), is the Final Environmental Impact Report (Final EIR) for the Humboldt County General Plan Update (State Clearinghouse Number 2007012089). The RDEIR identified the likely environmental consequences of the project and recommended mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate significant impacts. This document responds to public comments on the RDEIR, revises the RDEIR as necessary, and provides a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) for the project.
According to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (as amended January 1, 2016), lead agencies are required to consult with public agencies having jurisdiction over a proposed project and to provide the general public with an opportunity to comment on the RDEIR. For this project, Humboldt County is the lead agency. This
document has been prepared to respond to comments received on the RDEIR and to clarify any errors, omissions, or misinterpretations of the analysis or findings in the RDEIR.
This document, together with the RDEIR, will constitute the Final EIR if Humboldt County certifies the Final EIR as complete and adequate under CEQA.

1.2. Environmental Review Process

The RDEIR was made available for public review from April 19 through June 30, 2017. The general public was advised of the availability of the RDEIR through notification via email and Notices of Availability mailed to neighbors of the project site. Public agencies and interest groups were also notified by mail. The RDEIR was posted on the County's website on April 29, 2016.
During the public review period on the RDEIR, written comments were made. A copy of written comments on the RDEIR and responses to the comments can be found in
Chapter II of this document.

The Final EIR will be presented to the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors at its meeting scheduled for October 10, 2017 in the Board of Supervisors Chamber,
Humboldt County Courthouse, 825 Fifth Street, Eureka, California 95501. Before acting on the project, the Board of Supervisors must certify the Final EIR and adopt the MMRP (see Chapter IV of this document). In addition, the Board of Supervisors must make the necessary findings for the adoption of mitigation measures associated with the project.

Mr. Michael Richardson Supervising Planner

County of Humboldt

Eureka, CA 95501

Dear Mr. Richardson:

Thank you for including Caltrans in the environmental review process for the Recirculated Draf Environmental Impact Report (RDEIR) for the Humboldt County General Plan Update (GPU). The mission of Caltrans is to provide a safe, sustainable, integrated and efficient transportation system to enhance California's economy and livability. The Caltrans Local Development- Intergovernmental Review (LD-IGR) Program reviews land use projects and plans through the lens of our mission and state planning priorities of infill, conservation, and travel efficient
development. To ensure a safe and efficient transportation system, we encourage carly consultation and coordination with lead agencies and project proponents on all development projects that utilize the multimodal transportation network. We provide these comments consistent with the State's smart mobility goals that support vibrant economy and build communities, not sprawl. The following comments are in response to the Draft EIR for the Humboldt County GPU.

Caltrans' mission and vision, as well as number of goals and policies, have been revised to better reflect recent legislation including the following: A1-1

Assembly Bill (AB) 857, Infrastructure Planning: Priorities and Funding (2002), requires the State to adopt consistent planning and capital spending priorities. It establishes three priorities that encourage all state agencies to promote infill development within existing communitics, protect environmental and agricultural resources, and encourage efficient development patterns overall.

Assembly Bill 32, The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, mandates reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions most responsible for climate change. Nearly 40 percent of emissions in California come from the transportation sector.
The Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, or Senate Bill (SB) 375, legislation that required regions throughout California to improve their long-term Regional Transportation Plans (RTPs) to reflect more efficient land use, improved transportation, and

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 3

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

reduced GHG emissions.

Assembly Bill 1358 (2008), the California Complete Streets Act, requires that the legislative body of a city or county, upon any substantive revision of the circulation element of the general plan, modify the circulation element to plan for a balanced, multimodal transportation network that mects the needs of all users of streets, roads, and highways, defined to include motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, children, persons with disabilities, seniors, movers of commercial goods, and users of public transportation, in a manner that is suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context of the general plan.
Senate Bill 391 (2009), California Transportation Plan, adds new requirements to mcet California's climate change goals under Assembly Bill 32. SB 391 requires the state's long-range transportation plan (California Transportation Plan) to identify the "statewide integrated multimodal transportation system" necded to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from current levels by 2020, and 80-percent below the 1990 levels by 2050.
Senate Bill 743 (2013), "The Kings Arena Bill", exempted the Sacramento Kings Arena from CEQA compliance and attempts to promote infill development through a change in how determinations of significance are measured for transportation impacts under CEQA. New housing, commercial and office uses located within Transit Priority Areas are now exempt from CEQA. Outside of Transit Priority Areas, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research has A1-1
the discretion to identify new measures of significance for determining transportation impacts under CEQA, which is expected to include Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).
In April of 2015, Governor Brown issued Executive Order (EO) B-30-15 establishing a California GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2030, which is a mid-term goal that is consistent with California's existing long-term commitment to reduce emissions 80 percent under 1990 levels by 2050. In addition, the Governor is committed to reduce by one-half current petroleum use in cars and trucks; and manage farm and rangelands, forests and wetlands to store more carbon.
In 2016, Caltrans completed California Transportation Plan 2040, which establishes a new model 8 for developing ground transportation systems, consistent with the above-referenced legislation: [Regional] plans represent a shift in long-term planning away from simply a list of transportation projects and towards a strategy for sustainable growth. Their plans value efficient land use by proposing to locate more housing closer to job centers; they recognize consumer demand by proposing to invest in numerous modes of transportation-roads, public transit, walking, and biking facilities. They value taxpayer investments by proposing to spend more on taking care of our existing assets before building more. Regions have adopted growth plans, and will soon begin revising them, to deliver the more sustainable transportation system now required by California law.

Over the next 25 years, California will be working to improve transit, reduce long-run repair and maintenance costs of roadways, developing a comprehensive assessment of climate-related vulnerabilities, and improving the efficiency of operations on existing facilities using A1-1
transportation demand management and new technologies rather than continuing to expand capacity on existing roadways.

We request that the Humboldt County General Plan Update strive to address transportation challenges including: transportation needs of demographic groups, specifically the youth, the aging, and low-income groups or areas that qualify for State "disadvantaged" or "severely disadvantaged" status. Suggested methods for providing more robust transportation system include the expansion of transit capacity, frequency, and connectivity; higher proportion of funding for walking and biking projects; greater focus on more efficient land uses and denser A1-2
development near transit; support for streamlined CEQA review of infill projects; and greater coordination between government and stakeholders.

We agree with and support the County's determination of significant and unavoidable VMT impacts within the Circulation Element of the RDEIR. With respect to VMT impacts, we have the following comments:
Increasing VMT, whether on a per capita basis or as an absolute value, is inconsistent with State efforts to reduce GHG. County land use decisions have the potential to impact State efforts to reduce VMT on State highways. The "Area of Known Controversy" related to dispersed versus compact development in the General Plan Update could lead to significant impacts as a contributing factor to increasing VMT. A1-3
Without existing or proposed Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) for reducing VMT, we request that the County, through the implementation of the General Plan, seek to maintain
consistency between the Circulation Element of the General Plan, California Transportation Plan 2040, the Regional Transportation Plan developed by Humboldt County Association of Governments (HCAOG), the Regional Transportation Planning Agency (RTPA) for Humboldt County. We request that the County work with Caltrans and HCAOG to establish meaningful VMT reduction strategies.

Page 3.5-9 of the Transportation Section of the Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report describes State Route 299 as a California Legal Network Highway that allows STAA (Surface Transportation Assistance Act) trucks. Please note that with the completion of the Buckhorn Grade projects in Shasta County last fall, SR 299 is in the process of being designated an STAA A1-4

Terminal Access Route.

Richardson Grove State Park. We request that the RDEIR's description of the project be revised for clarity. Instead of attributing the controversy to the removal of trees (no old growth trees will be removed), the controversy can be attributed to "road improvements within a grove of old A1-5
growth redwood trees, as well as concerns regarding growth inducing impacts."
Caltrans requests to participate in the County's update of the Local Coastal Program in an effort to coordinate long-range planning efforts for adapting to Sea Level Rise, Caltrans District is interested in the Humboldt Bay Arca Plan and other planning areas where State highway facilities are vulnerable to the effects of Climate Change.

Responses to California Department of Transportation • Letter A1
Comment A1-1: This comment states the GPU should strive to address transportation
challenges. Suggestions include improved transit, increased funding for walking and
bicycling projects, denser land uses near transit, streamlining CEQA review of infill
projects, and improved coordination among stakeholders including government.
Response to Comment A1-1: Comment noted. These are all desirable goals of the GPU
but the comment does not address the RDEIR.

Comment A1-2: This comment states the GPU should strive to address transportation
challenges. Suggestions include improved transit, increased funding for walking and
bicycling projects, denser land uses near transit, streamlining CEQA review of infill projects, and improved coordination among stakeholders including government.

Response to Comment A1-2: Comment noted. These are all desirable goals of the GPU
but the comment does not address the RDEIR.

Comment A1-3: Caltrans agrees that VMT impacts are significant and unavoidable. However, they assert this is inconsistent with State efforts to reduce VMT. The "dispersed vs. compact development" contributes to increased VMT. They state there should be consistency among the General Plan Circulation Element, the California Transportation
Plan 2040, and the Regional Transportation Plan developed by HCAOG. Finally, they
recommend the County work with Caltrans and HCAOG to develop VMT reduction
strategies.

Response to Comment A1-3: Comment noted. The DEIR concludes the patterns of development in the County are well-established and will not change substantially due to the very modest growth projections for the GPU. Indeed, the County shares the
concerns of Caltrans and HCAOG to reduce VMT, in part through consistency with
goals of, and cooperation with, all applicable agencies.

Comment A1-4: This comment states that recent projects on SR 299 at the Buckhorn Grade are resulting in enhanced STAA designation status that should be reflected.
Response to Comment A1-4: The text of the second paragraph on page 3.5-9 of the
RDEIR is revised to reflect this upgraded status as follows:

"Additionally, there is an economic effect on transportation costs due to the
limitations on large STAA truck sizes on both U.S. 10lat Richardson Grove and on
State Route 299 at Buckhorn Grade. Because of the restrictions on the length of
trucks that can travel this route into the County, goods often need to be transferred to smaller trucks, which increase the transportation cost of goods shipped to and from the County. With completion of the Buckhorn Grade projects in Shasta County in 2016, State Route 299 is in the process of being designated an STAA Terminal Access Route. State Route 299 frem Arcate to Trinity County is considered a
Celifornia LegalNetwork-highwey and-allews that will allow STAA trucks."

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 7

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Comment A1-5: In this comment, Caltrans request that the description of the reason for controversy surrounding an improvement project in Richardson Grove State Park be revised so that the controversy is attributed to "road improvements within a grove of old redwood trees, as well as concerns regarding growth inducing impacts."

Response to Comment A1-5: The text of the third paragraph on page 3.5-9 of the RDEIR is revised to reflect the suggested language:

"Caltrans has completed a Final EIR (SCH # 2009012070) for a project to provide
access for larger trucks on U.S. 101 through Richardson Grove State Park near the Humboldt County line. The proposed project extends from post mile (Humboldt) 1.1 to post mile (Humboldt) 2.2 and would include minor realignments and widening of the existing roadway, culvert improvements, and repaving the roadway. This
project has been controversial because it involves read imprevements and the
removal of trees-within-a-State-Park road improvements within a grove of old growth
redwood trees, as well as concerns regarding growth inducing impacts.
Comment A1-6: Caltrans requests to participate in the County's update of the Local Coastal Program in an effort to coordinate long-range planning efforts for adapting to Sea Level Rise. Caltrans District 1 is interested in the Humboldt Bay Area Plan and other planning areas where State highway facilities are vuinerable to the effects of Climate Change. Caltrans offers a number of planning grants to assist the County in working to further State goals and initiatives recently established through legislation.
Response to Comment A1-6: Comment noted. The County is committed to working collaboratively with CalTrans to mitigate the impacts of sea level rise on its facilities.

Mr. Michael Richardson
Humboldt County Community Development Services 3015 H Street
Eureka, CA 95501

Dear Mr. Richardson:

Subject: Comments on the General Plan 2017 DEIR, SCH No. 2007012089

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the 2017 General Plan Amendment and tentative language adopted by the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors (Board of Supervisors). The North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (Regional Water Board) is a responsible State agency with jurisdiction over the quality of groundwater and surface waters (including wetlands) and the protection of the beneficial uses of those waters.

Regional Water Board staff reviewed the tentative language adopted by the Board of Supervisors and the DEIR dated April 2017 for the General Plan, and offer the following comments. The general comments are listed below. In the case of specific suggested language related to climate change, which we hope the Board will consider, we have identified it in strikeout / underline in the attached documents: Chapters 9, 11, 14, and 15 of the 'Chapters Tentatively Approved by the Board of Supervisors (2015) showing edits From Planning Commission Draft (2012)'.

GENERAL COMMENTS

The Regional Water Board would like to be viewed as a partner with the County in water quality protection. We have worked closely with the County on a project-by-project basis in the past and we look forward to continuing to do so,

Regional Water Board staff shares the concerns of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) related to aquatic species and habitat and supports their recommendations. Below is a list of the general categorles our agency is concerned about A2-1

as they relate to water quality and beneficial uses. Regional Water Board authorities and that of CDPW coincide with respect to several of these important issues.

Surface water and groundwater
Aquatic species and wildlife
Riparian and instream habitat

Climate Change
The issue of climate change will likely evolve and change ovor the timeframe addressed in this General Plan. Regional Water Board staff oncourage Humboldt County to procood with due diligence to address issues related to climate change that can affect any number of water quality and beneficial uses. The County should consider the following:
Climate change is a risk multiplier when it comes to water quality conditions. That is, existing water quality impacts and landscape vulnerabilities are likely to worsen under future altered climatic conditions.

Forward thinking and planning is essential to reducing risks associated with potential climate change impacts. Climate change adaptation plans should be incorporated into the County's General Plan.
A2-2
Numerous mitigation measures appropriate to adapt to changing climatic conditions have multiple environmental benefits (e.g. forest retention for carbon sequestration may reduce erosion and subsequent sediment discharge from hillslopes). Use of such measures should be high priority now and in the future,
The County is advised to conduct and/or participate with Cities to conduct a comprehensive climate change assessment specific to the potential effects of drought, high intensity winter storms, and sea level rise (SLR) on wastewater infrastructure. The effect of such altered conditions should be assessed with respect to wastewater treatment facilities, sewerage collection systems, disposal areas, and vulnerable areas serviced by onsite waste treatment systems (OWTS). Vulnerable areas of most concern include floodplains and the low gradient areas (e.g., diked and drained wetlands) surrounding Humboldt Bay.

Responses to Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) - Letter A2

Comment A2-1: The comment begins with general statements, "The Regional Board
would like to be viewed as a partner with the County in water quality protection…Regional Board staff shares the concerns with CDFW related to aquatic species and habitat and supports their recommendations." The comment lists issues shared in common with CDFW including surface water and groundwater.
Response to Comment A2-1: Comment noted. CDFW did not comment on the DEIR, but their recommendations and suggestions over the years have been incorporated into the GPU, which is supported by the RWQCB.
Comment A2-2: The comment encourages the County to "proceed with due diligence to address issues related to climate change that can affect any number of water
quality and beneficial uses." The comment identifies considerations and issues for
developing a climate change adaptation strategy.
Response to Comment A2-2: Comment noted. The considerations raised by the RWQCB will be relevant for development of the County's Climate Action Plan which will be developed through Implementation Measure AQ-IM3:
"AQ-IM3. County-wide Climate Action Plan. Develop and implement a
Climate Action Plan that effectively mitigates the carbon emissions
attributable to this Plan, consistent with the requirements of the state
Global Warming Solutions Act and subsequent implementing legislation and regulations.'

Ladies/Gentlemen:

The Division of Oll. Gas, and Geothermal Resources (Division) oversees the drilling, operation, maintenance, and plugging and abandonment of oil, natural gas, and geothermal wells.. Our regulatory program emphasizes the wise development of oll, natural gas, and geothermal resources in the state through sound engineering practices that protect the environment, prevent pollution, and ensure publlo safety, Northern Californis I9 known for Its rich gas fields and Humboldt County for one of the first oll flelds In California at Petrolla.
From the Californie Office of Historic Preservation:
"California's first drilled oll wells that produced crude to be refined and sold commercially were located on the North Fork of the Mattole River approximately three miles east of here. The old Union Mattole Oil Company made its first shipment of oll from here, to a San
Francisco refinery, in June 1865. Many old well heads remain today.'
The Division maintains digital production data dating back to 1977. From the years 1977 to 2016 A3-2
64,232,699 (Mcf) of natural gas was produced from gas wells located in Humboldt County (Figure 1). Currently there are two active fleids and one idle field in Humboldt County (Figures 2 and 3). Tompkins Hill Gas Fleld, located approximately 1-mile north of Fortune, has 22 active wells and
17 idle wells. The Grizzty Bluff Gas Fleld located near Ferndale has 3 active wells and 7 idle wells. The Petrolia Gas fleld has 3 Idle wells that are shut in and not producing gas. We do not have any records of the oll production.
Data for wells located on private and public land shown on the maps can be found at the Division's
websites:

Permitting agency(s) and property owner(s) should be aware of, and fully understand, that A3-2
significant and potentially dangerous lssues may be associated with development near oil and
gas wells. These issues are non-exhaustively Identifled in the following comments, and are provided by the Division for consideration by the permitting agency, in conjunction with the property owner and/or developer, on a parcel-by-parcel or well-by-well basis.
1. Maintaining sufficient access to an oil or gas well may be generally described as maintaining "rig access" to the well. Rig access allows a well servicing rig and associated necessary equipment to reach the well from a public street or access way, solely over the parcel on which the well is located. A well servicing rig, and any necessary equipment, should be able to pass unimpeded along and over the route, and should be able to accass the well without disturbing the integrity of surrounding infrastructure.
2. The Division recommends that a permitting agency consider the use of surface mitigation measures as a condition for project approval, If and when appropriate. Exampies of surface mitigation measures include venting systems for wells, venting systems for parking lots, patios, and other hardscape, methane barriers for building foundations, methane detection systems, and collection cellars for well Nuids. The Division does not regulate the design, installation, operation, or adequacy of such measures. The Division recommends that such surface mitigalion measures are designed, installed, and operated by qualified engineers. The permitting of surface mitigation measures falls under the jurisdiction of the permitting agency.

3. If during the course of development of a parcel any unknown well(s) is discovered, the Division should be notified immedlately so that the newty discovered well(s) can be incorporated into the records and investigated.

4. The Division recommends that any soll containing significant amounts of hydrocarbons to be disposed of in accordance with local, state, and federal laws. Please notify the appropriate authorities if soil containing significant amounts of hydrocarbons is discovered during development.
5. The Division recommends that any wells found in the course of this project and any pertinent Informatlon obtained after the issuance of this letter, be communicated to the appropriate county recorder for inclusion In the title information of the subject real property, This is to ensure that present and future property owners are aware of (1) the wells located on the property, and (2) potentially significant issues associated with any improvements near oil or gas wells.

No well work may be performed on any oll or gas well without written approval from the Division in the form of an appropriate permit. This includes, but is not limited to, mitigating leaking fluids A3-2 or gas from abandoned wells, modifications to well casings, and/or any other re-abandonment work. (NOTE: the Division regulates the depth of any well below final grade (depth below the surface of the ground). Title 14, Section 1723.5 of the California Code of Regulations states that all well casings shall be cut off at least 5 feet but no more than 10 feet below grade. If any well needs to be lowered or raised (i.e. casing cut down or casing riser added) to meet this grade regulation, a permit from the Division is required before work can start.)
To reiterate, the permitting agency, property owner, and/or developer should be aware of, and fully understand, that the above comments are made by the Division with the intent to encourage full consideration of significant and potentially dangerous Issues associated with development near oil or gas wells.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this project.
Sincerely,

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Responses to Humboldt County Association of Governments - Letter B1

Comment B1-1: This comment suggests that a sentence relating to State Route 211 in
the environmental setting be revised for clarity.
Response to Comment B1-1: To provide additional clarity regarding State Route 211, the discussion of State Highways/Routes on Page 3.5-4 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
S.R. 211 is a short two-lane highway that extends from U.S. 101 to the City of
Ferndale, crossing historic Fernbridge over the Eel River ever historie-Fernbridge.

Comment B1-2: This comment identifies an error in the reference to the current
Humboldt County Regional Transportation Plan, which should be 2014 and not 2008.
Response to Comment B1 -2: To correct the reference to the discussion of Regionally
Significant Streets and Roadways in the Humboldt County Regional Transportation Plan, the text at the top of Page 3.5-5 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"In addition, Humboldt County has identified the following roads as Regionally Significant Streets and Roadways as part of the 20082014 Regional Transportation Plan (see HCAOG 20-Year Humboldt County Regional Transportation Plan, 2014, 2008Table HRStreets-1 Regionally, Significant Roadways and the discussion on page HR-tof the "Existing Roadway System" from page 24 to 28):"

Comment B1-3: The comment adds missing information regarding the following transit
service providers: Tish Non-Village service and Fortuna Transit.
Response to Comment B1 -3: To supplement the information regarding transit service providers, the discussion after the heading "Redwood Transit System" on Page 3.5-6 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
Redwood Transit System. The Redwood Transit System (RTS) consists of "mainline" commuter service along the U.S. 101 corridor from Scotia to Trinidad. Regular commute service is available to McKinleyville, as well as regional service to the California Redwood Coast - Humboldt County Airport. Although some trips serve the entire corridor, most trips provide service only along shorter sections of the
route. Service was recently added to southern Humboldt, now connecting
Garberville, Redway, Phillipsville, Miranda, Myers Flat, and Weott with the Humboldt Bay area. In addition to the mainline route serving U.S. 101, a separate
route Tish Non-Village service provides service between Willow Creek and various
locations in Arcata and McKinleyville.
and..
Fortuna Transit. The City of Fortuna operates Fortuna Transit, which provides
transportation within the City limits to seniors or persons with a disability.

Comment B1-4: The comment suggests edits to a sentence relating to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) for Non-Motorized Transportation to improve readability. To clarify a statement regarding the American with Disabilities Act (ADA),

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 24

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment B1-4: Page 3.5-7 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: is "Pedestrian facilities, primarily sidewalks and crosswalks, are also most commonly provided in the urban areas. Most pedestrian facilities were constructed prior to the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and are therefore not compliant. Compliance issues include inadequate sidewalk width, excessive cross-slope, inadequate curb ramps at intersections, and obstacles in the sidewalk. Such obstructions and impediments can force pedestrians on foot or those who use wheelchairs onto road
shoulders, and into parking and bike lanes. Over time, the County Department of Public Works is upgrading pedestrian facilities to be ADA compliant."
Comment B1-5: The comment recommends a better word choice to describe the
proportion of commuters using horses.
Response to Comment B1-5: To clarify a statement regarding equine commuters, the paragraph at the top of Page 3.5-7 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Rural areas and small communities do not often have pedestrian facilities that are
separated from the roadway. Pedestrians and bicyclists frequently utilize roads in Humboldt County that lack sidewalks and/or bicycle lanes. As a result, sharing of roadways by pedestrians, car and truck drivers, bicyclists, and even equestrians, is common in many rural areas. While equine use does not constitute a significant
detectable portion of daily commuter travel in Humboldt County, equestrian trails
can be a significant recreational resource. A number of community and public land
trail systems provide transportation and recreation opportunities; however, most of the facilities dedicated exclusively for non-motorized use are provided only in urban
areas of the County."
Comment B1-6: The comment identifies a missing space between paragraphs.
Response to Comment B1-6: To correct paragraph spacing, the second paragraph from the top of Page 3.5-8 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
Pedestrian facilities are most commonly found in the County's seven cities and larger unincorporated communities. Sidewalks and pathways of varying width are found in commercial areas, residential neighborhoods, and near schools. In many cases, existing sidewalks meet only the minimum ADA standards and often are obstructed by utility poles, signposts, and other obstacles. There are also sidewalk gaps, uncontrolled intersections, and street crossings that pose pedestrian travel impediments, especially to the mobility-impaired.
Most facilities dedicated for bicycle use are in the urban and suburban areas of
the County, with bicycle lanes in place in Eureka, Arcata, McKinleyville and Fortuna. The City of Arcata provides the most interconnected system of bicycle lanes/routes that facilitates access to and from a number of trip-generating
areas. In Eureka, the bike lane/route system includes both north-south and east-
west lanes; however, not all trip generating areas are connected. Fortuna has
limited systems of bike lanes and designated routes.
Comment B1-7: The comment identifies an open parenthesis at the top of Page 3.5-8.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 25

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment B1-7: To the open parenthesis, the last paragraph from the top of Page 3.5-8 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"The Elk River Hikshari' Trail (is a multiple-use, paved trail that runs between Truesdale
Avenue (just south of the Bayshore Mall) 1.5 miles south to the Pound Road Park & Ride lot, off the Herrick Avenue and Highway 101 interchange."
Comment B1-8: The comment identifies outdated references to the Humboldt People
Powered Pathways (HP3) non-motorized funding proposal.
Response to Comment B1-8: To revise the references to the HP3 proposal, the first
paragraph of Page 3.5-9 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"In conjunction with other cities and counties across the nation. Humboldt County is
was the lead agency in a funding proposal to the federal government in 2009 called the Humboldt People Powered Pathways (HP3) funding proposal te the federal-gevernment. The HP3 proposal seeks sought transportation funding to implement local jurisdiction's plans for improving active transport systems and programs as part of 2010 Campaian for Active Transportation. The Campaian for Active Transportation was a national effort aimed at the inclusion of a program that
provides funding for non-motorized systems (vs. singular projects) as a permanent program in the federal transportation legislation reauthorization. The HP3 plan identifiesd approximately 25 active transport planning, implementation programs, and partnerships thet identify related to approximately $50 million of non-motorized
transportation projects located across the County._ Although the HP3 funding
proposal was unsuccessful, a number of the individual projects included in the proposal have since been funded and the interagency coordination to improve
active transport systems and programs continues."
Comment B1-9: The comment provides updates to references to the Caltrans Richardson Grove project.
Response to Comment B1-9: To revise the references to the Caltrans Richardson Grove
project, the second paragraph from the bottom of Page 3.5-9 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Caltrans has completed a Final EIR (SCH # 2009012070) and Addendum to the EIR,
a Finding of no Significant Impact, and a Notice of Determination in May 2017 (see
project web page at .http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist1/d1projects/richardson_grove/l for a project to provide access for larger trucks on U.S. 101 through Richardson
Grove State Park near the Humboldt County line. The proposed project extends from post mile (Humboldt) 1.1 to post mile (Humboldt) 2.2 and would include minor realignments and widening of the existing roadway, culvert improvements, and repaving the roadway. This project has been controversial because it involves road improvements and the removal of trees within a State Park as well as concerns
regarding growth inducing impacts."
Comment B1-10: The comment corrects a missing number in a reference to a year a in a
in a sentence regarding scheduled passenger flights.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 26

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment B1-10: To correct a missing number in a sentence regarding scheduled passenger flights, the first paragraph from the bottom of Page 3.5-10 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Air travel is a growing transportation option in Humboldt County with passenger enplanements at California Redwood Coast - Humboldt County, the only airport in the County with scheduled passenger flights, and passenger enplanements are expected to increase from 98,453 in 2004 to 167,000 in 2024 (Arcata-Eureka Airport Master Plan Report, Chapter 2, Airport Role and Activity Forecasts). Several daily flights are provided, connecting Humboldt County with San Francisco and Portland,
Oregon. The airport continues to work to add more flights to more destinations."
Comment B1-11: The comment suggests a clarification for a confusing sentence
regarding annual maintenance dredging of Humboldt Bay.
Response to Comment B1-11: To clarify the description of annual maintenance dredging of Humboldt Bay, the third from the last paragraph from the bottom of Page 3.5-11 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
Annual maintenance dredging of Humboldt Bay is vital to maintaining safe and navigable access. Federal channels in Humboldt Bay are dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Any other area that requires dredging is the responsibility of local governments-; in this area that is-the Harbor District is that agency.
Comment B1-12: The comment recommends that a sentence in the environmental
baseline section under road safety describing an effect of implementing the General
Plan Update be moved to the impact analysis section.
Response to Comment B1-12: To address the misplaced statement, the third from the last paragraph from the bottom of Page 3.5-12 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"The operation of agricultural vehicles on roadways may also affect traffic on rural roadways in the unincorporated area. Agricultural activities are an important element of the local economy and agricultural vehicles operate regularly on County roadways. Agricultural vehicles are slow moving vehicles and considered incompatible with other motorists. implementation-of the-propesed General Plan
Update would-iIncreases in the amount of traffic on roadways and could increase
the potential for conflict with agricultural vehicles."
Comment B1-13: The comment recommends that a misplaced capital letter and a sentence be clarified and asks that a reference to persons between the ages 5 of 5 and
24 be clarified.

Response to Comment B1-13: In researching the source of the reference, the web address was found to have been changed. To address the misplaced statement and
correct the website reference, the second from the last paragraph from the bottom of
Page 3.5-12 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Another factor that can impact roadway safety is the incompatibility of some
unincorporated area roadway and highway facilities with multi-modal
transportation uses. Many existing roadways and intersections in the County do not
contain pedestrian or bicycle facilities. Humboldt County Transportation-

There are substantially higher bicycle injuries and fatality rates in Humboldt County than all other rural areas in California. Bicycle injury and fatality rates are also significantly higher than the state average, particularly for youth and-the ages 05five to--24 age greups. In spite of this, bicycle and pedestrian injuries and fatalities are decreasing in Humboldt County."
Comment B1-14: The comment recommends that a misplaced capital letter be
corrected.

Response to Comment B1-14: To address the misplaced statement, the second from the
last paragraph on Page 3.5-13 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"The traffic impacts resulting from General Plan Update land uses were evaluated
by TJKM Transportation Consultants using the latest Humboldt County Travel Demand Model. The Humboldt County Travel Demand Model was updated in 2013 by the Humboldt County Association of Governments (HCAOG) and the California
Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to forecast travel patterns in both rural and
urbanized portions of Humboldt County. The main purposes of the Humboldt County Travel Demand Model are to support the rRegional transportation planning process', to evaluate potential improvements to the roadway system, and evaluate the impacts of land use changes in the County. The model also includes limited transit and non-motorized analysis capabilities. The base year for the model is 2010, with a forecast year of 2040."
Comment B1-15: The comment suggests that the phrase "volume to capacity" be
revised to add hyphens.
Response to Comment B1-15: Although adding hyphens may be correct grammar, this
phase is in common usage with and without hyphens and the Transportation Research
Board's Highway Capacity Manual, an authoritative source for methodologies used to calculate ratios of volume to capacity for transportation facilities, does not use hyphens
in this phrase. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment B1-16: The comment suggests that the description of transportation analysis
zones is confusing.
Response to Comment B1-16: To address this possible confusion, the second from the second sentence below the heading "2010 Scenario" Page 3.5-14 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"The transportation analysis zones cover the entire County and each city, and
inelude contain data representing existing and projected future population and
employment levels.'
Comment B1-17: The comment suggests that the phrase "worse-case" should be corrected to read "worst-case." The comment also suggests that the phrase "18 year"
be corrected to add a hyphen.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 28

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment B1-17: To correct this grammar error, the second to last sentence
in the last paragraph on Page 3.5-14 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Consequently, an interim year (2028) scenario was developed using the 2028
population from the DOF and 2028 employment from Caltrans 2015 Economics
Forecasts, and analyzed as a worset-case scenario."
To correct the hyphen, the first sentence in the first paragraph on Page 3.5-15 of the
RDEIR is revised as follows:
"As shown, the forecast 18-year and 30-year growth in both households and employment is relatively modest."
Comment B1-18: The comment recommends that repeated words in a sentence be
deleted.

Response to Comment B1-18: To correct this grammar, the first sentence in the second paragraph on Page 3.5-18 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"There are no are-ne adopted plans, ordinances or policies establishing measures of effectiveness for the performance of the circulation system in Humboldt County."
Comment B1-19: The comment recommends that a policy from the Eureka Community
Plan be placed in quotes.
Response to Comment B1-19: To ensure that the reader knows that this policy is quoted verbatim, the second sentence in the second paragraph on Page 3.5-19 of the RDEIR is
revised to add quotes as follows:
"The Eureka Community Plan contains a general goal that does not include an
MOE: Policy 4220.1, "the County shall strive to maintain a Level of Service of C or
better on arterials in the Planning Area. The acceptable level of service goal will be consistent with the financial resources available and the limits of technical
feasibility."
Comment B1-20: The comment suggests that the wording of a sentence relating to a goal of the General Plan Update to reduce vehicle miles traveled should be revised for
clarity.
Response to Comment B1-20: To clarify the reference to Circulation Element goals, the second sentence in the third to last paragraph on Page 3.5-19 of the RDEIR is revised as
follows:
"Due to already established auto-oriented land use patterns, the private automobile would likely continue to be the dominant mode of transport in Humboldt County. The General Plan Update seeks to reduce vehicle miles traveled per person by
considering the needs of motorized vehicles, public transit, bicyclists, and
pedestrians during land use and transportation planning and by providing balanced
transportation opportunities, whereby the-needs of meterized vehieles, publie-transit, bieyelists, and-pedestrians are-considered-during land use and transpertation
planning."

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 29

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Comment B1-21: The comment points out that Policy C-P2, Consideration of Land Uses in Transportation Decision Making, is mischaracterized and states that it directs the
County to decide on transportation projects based on existing and planned future
developments.
Response to Comment B1-21: To correct the description of Policy C-P2, the second
sentence in the first paragraph on Page 3.5-20 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Policy C-P2, Consideration of Land Uses in Transportation Decision Making, netes requires that a comprehensive planning approach be utilized used in transportation decision making. that considers the transportation consequenees of land use
changes te-aveid eperational and ecenomie impaets-existing and proposed land
uses."

Comment B1-22: The comment states that complicated syntax is used to describe Table
3.5-7 and suggests a revision.
Response to Comment B1-22: To improve the description of Table 3.5-7, the first sentence in the third paragraph on Page 3.5-20 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Table 3.5-7 lists only one road in the City of Eureka, that would be affected by the implementation of General Plan Update, and countywide growth expected to occur during the planning period, thet which is the responsibility under the
jurisdiction of Caltrans and not Humboldt County."
Comment B1-23: The comment correctly states that in the description of Policy IS-P7,
Mitigation of Cross-jurisdictional Impacts, "affected" should be used rather than
"affect" and asks if the County is still relying on Level of Service as a transportation metric, likely relating to the future implementation of Senate Bill 743 substituting vehicle miles traveled for level of service as the metric of transportation impact across the state.
Response to Comment B1-23: For a response to the comment relating to the use of LOS
rather than VMT, see response to comment C1-1 on page 2-43. To improve the description of Policy IS-P7, Mitigation of Cross-jurisdictional Impacts, the third sentence in
the third paragraph on Page 3.5-20 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Community Infrastructure and Services Element Policy IS-P7, Mitigation of Cross- jurisdictional Impacts, directs the County to work with cities to mitigate impacts associated with new development for each affected jurisdiction."
Comment B1-24: The comment indicates that in the description of Policy C-P7, Joint Use
of Traffic Models, is confusing.
Response to Comment B1-24: To improve the description of Policy C-P7, the last sentence in the third paragraph on Page 3.5-20 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Policy C-P7, Joint Use of Traffic Models, encourages the use of area-wide travel demand models in the preparation of the County-Wide Transportation Plan (CWTP) and in evaluating projects with potentially significant transportation impacts te use
area-wide travel demand models."

Comment B1-27: The comment identifies a missing word in policy C-Px. Countywide Traffic Impact Fee Program, of Mitigation Measure 3.5.3.2.a.
Response to Comment B1-27: The following edit is made to correct the wording of C-Px. Countywide Traffic Impact Fee Program, of Mitigation Measure 3.5.3.2.a:
"C-Px. Countywide Traffic Impact Fee Program. In coordination with the cities within the County, shell develop and implement a countywide traffic impact fee program that addresses impacts on major roads resulting from development in cities and unincorporated areas. Adopt this fee within one year of the adoption of the General Plan Update. A traffic impact fee is currently being evaluated for the
Greater Eureka Area, encompassing the Eureka urbanized area."
Comment B1-28: The comment asks if the conclusion for Impact 3.5.3.2.-1, Unacceptable LOS on U.S. 101 Between S.R. 255 in Arcata and 6th Street in Eureka, using Level of Service as a transportation metric is consistent with Senate Bill 743.
Response to Comment B1-28: For a response to the comment relating to the use of LOS rather than VMT, see response to comment C1-1 on page 2-43.
Comment B1-29: The comment notes that the words "Traffic Signal" are incorrectly capitalized in the second paragraph of Impact 3.5.3.2-2: Unacceptable LOS on U.S. 101/Broadway, City of Eureka, on page 3.5-25.
Response to Comment B1-29: The following edit is made to the third sentence in the second paragraph of Impact 3.5.3.2-2:

Comment B1-30: The comment notes that an end parenthesis is missing in the third is paragraph of Impact 3.5.3.2-2: Unacceptable LOS on U.S. 101/Broadway, City of Eureka, on page 3.5-25.
Response to Comment B1-30: The following edit is made to the final sentence in the
third paragraph of Impact 3.5.3.2-2:
"While limited relief could be achieved through optimized signal timing, changes in traffic patterns occur routinely and signal timing should therefore be modified as necessary to reflect such changes (City of Eureka General Plan Update Mobility Policy Paper
thttp://www.eureka2040gpu.com/Links/pdfs/Mobility%20Policy%20Paper%203-23-
15.pdf)."
Comment B1-31: The comment suggests that inappropriate wording is used to describe the conclusion to Impact 3.5.3.2-2: Unacceptable LOS on U.S. 101/Broadway, City of
Eureka.

Response to Comment B1-31: The following edit is made to the final paragraph of
Impact 3.5.3.2-2 on page 3.5-26:
"The traffic model projects that buildout of the General Plan Update, in conjunction with the implementation of city general plans within the County, would result in traffic levels that would reduce the LOS of the U.S. 101 Broadway corridor et eF
below-to LOS "D," or below, which is the General Plan update LOS standard and the LOS concept established by Caltrans for this facility. Therefore, this would be a potentially significant impact."
Comment B1-32: The comment notes that an incorrect reference to another mitigation
measure is made in the paragraph below the heading "Level of Significance after Mitigation" of Impact 3.5.3.2-2: Uhacceptable LOS on U.S. 101/Broadway, City of Eureka, on page 3.5-26.

RE: Comments on Proposed Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report (RDEIR) for Draft
Humboldt County General Plan

Mr. Miller:

The Coalition for Responsible Transportation Priorities (CRTP) is an organization whose mission
is to promote transportation solutions that protect and support a healthy environment, healthy
people, healthy communities and a healthy economy on the North Coast of California. CRTP
appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed Revised Draft Environmental Impact
Report (RDEIR) for the County's General Plan Update (GPU). Our comments are as follows:

Level of Service & Vehicle Miles Traveled
The use of vehicular Level of Service [LOS) as a primary tool for assessing transportation impacts of the GPU leads is extremely problematic. LOS is an outdated metric which is
increasingly recognized as leading to unintended consequences when used to measure the
impacts of development and to determine appropriate mitigation. One researcher succinctly
summarizes: "The use of LOS is often criticized for its bias towards automobiles at the expense
of bicycling, transit, and walking, and it complicates smart growth or compact development.**
We agree with this criticism.

Furthermore, the use of LOS and other measures of automobile congestion to assess C1-1

transportation impacts leads to mitigation measures which add automobile capacity to the road
system. This tendency can be seen in the list of circulation system improvements in Table 3.5-6
of the RDEIR, which consists of additional roadway construction projects meant to relleve
congestion. However, there is a growing consensus in transportation planning that adding capacity induces new travel and does not reduce congestion. We highly recommend that the

literature on induced travel be carefully reviewed and considered. A recent policy brief for the
National Center for Sustainable Transportation, appropriately titled "Increasing Highway
Capacity Unlikely to Relieve Traffic Congestion," contains a concise summary.2

The fact that the RDEIR considers "unacceptable LOS on roadways in the County" (impact
3.5.3.2) to be a potentially significant impact of the GPU leads to counterproductive and
internally inconsistent mitigation measures. Other than some Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) strategies which the RDEIR itself admits would be difficult to implement C1-1
effectively (p.3.5-21), these mitigation measures are designed to decrease congestion-1.e.,
increase speed of travel-by adding capacity, and will therefore induce additional vehicle miles
traveled (VMT). This is an inevitable result is of any project which decreases congestion by adding
capacity, because the increased speed of travel resulting from such projects is what actually
induces additional VMT.3 Meanwhile, increased VMT is considered a significant and
unavoidable impact of the GPU. This internal inconsistency within the RDEIR should be
addressed by replacing LOS with VMT as the primary vehicular impact measure.

The RDEIR shows that Humboldt County already has a high VMT per capita and that the GPU
will exacerbate this problem. Tables 3.5-4a and 3.5-4b project VMT to increase at nearly twice
the rate of population increase through 2040, and at nearly three times the rate in the near
term (through 2028). At p.3.5-19, the RDEIR attributes not only current high VMT but future
disproportionate VMT growth to "already established auto-orlented land use patterns."
However, this defies common sense. Existing land use patterns influence but do not dictate the
pattern of future development-that is in large part the purpose of the GPU. Similarly, there is
no fixed correlation between "levels of development" and VMT, as implied on p.3.5-19 of the
RDEIR. Rather, it is the type and pattern of development which determines the impacts on C1-2

VMT.

In this case, a review of the GPU's proposed land use maps and circulation system
improvements make it clear that increased VMT will be the result of growth planned largely for
the outskirts of population centers-in other words, sprawl. But instead of proposing to
mitigate increased VMT by modifying the land use planning in the GPU which causes it, the only
proposed mitigation measure which even mentions land use limits itself to the consideration of

future land use decision making. In other words, the RDEIR adopts an aspirational and largely
unenforceable mitigation measure in place of a concrete and meaningful one.

Additionally, Proposed GPU Policy C-P5, establishing a minimum LOS for county roadways, is
likely to ensure additional capacity increases and thus VMT increases for the life of the General
Plan. An effective mitigation measure for increased VMT would be removal of Policy C-P5.

VMT is used as a "measure of congestion" in the RDEIR (p.3.5-20) and the discussion of VMT
impacts beginning at p.3.5-18 is largely limited to congestion, but it is a much more meaningful
indicator than that. The California Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) is currently
in the process of implementing SB 743 (2013) by replacing LOS in the CEQA Guidelines with
VMT. As OPR notes in its latest proposal, "vehicle miles traveled directly relates to emissions of C1-2
air pollutants, Including greenhouse gases, energy usage, and demand on infrastructure, as well
as indirectly to many other impacts including public health, water usage, water quality and land
consumption."4 While the amendments to the CEQA Guidelines are not yet in effect, the
current draft and supporting analysis are instructive, and it would behoove the RDEIR to follow
the draft to the greatest extent possible.

In sum, the RDEIR should shift its focus away from LOS impacts. Further, the conclusion that
increased VMT is an unavoidable impact of the GPU is not supportable. Reasonable mitigation
measures which modify the GPU's proposed policies, land use maps and circulation
improvements while still accommodating population growth and achieving the GPU's other
goals could effectively mitigate VMT increases and must be adopted, as opposed to the
speculative and unenforceable mitigation measures currently proposed.

Active Transportation & Transit
In summarizing the benefits and costs of different transportation modes, the RDEIR lists only
"travel time, effort, convenience, and expense" (p.3.5-1), leaving out such critical
considerations as safety, health, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is thus perhaps
unsurprising--but nevertheless unacceptable-that modes which may take more time but which promote greater health and safety and lower GHG emissions such as walking, bicycling C1-3
and transit are given substantially less serious consideration than automobiles in the RDEIR. For
example, the list of "issues affecting the County road system" (p.3.5-2) does not include
anything about the capacity, safety or effectiveness of the road system for non-vehicular users.
This is despite the fact that the document discusses in some detail how deficient the County's

current bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure is, and the County's high rate of serious accidents
invollving bicyclists and pedestrians is also separately identified and discussed (p.3.5-12).

Furthermore, while vehicular travel impacts are extensively and quantitatively measured and
discussed, and the GPU's proposed Policy C-P25 directs the County to adopt objective bicycle
and pedestrian LOS/Quality of Services standards for County roads, the RDEIR makes no
attempt to use any such standards to identify or measure the GPU's impacts on active
fransportation.

Without such objective measures, it is unclear how the RDEIR can come to conclusions such as
that the GPU would increase walking and bicycling trips (p.3.5-31). It is important to note,
however, that since thhe RDEIR does show that the GPU will result in increased vehicular trips
regardless of whether bicycle and pedestrian trips will increase, the "hazards to roadway users"
identified at this point in the RDEIR are real. Vehicles are the primary type of roadway users
which pose a safety hazard. C1-3

in fact, the increase in vehicle trips and VMT creates a serious risk of decreased safety for all
roadway users and a significant impact under CEQA. The RDEIR concludes on p.3.5-33 that
safety impacts would be less than significant on the basis of the GPU's proposed goals and
policies to promote safe multimodal transportation and encourage better design for bicycle, pedestrian and transit infrastructure. However, these aspirational policies do not outweigh the
safety threat of additional VMT. Furthermore, the GPU's prioritization of the convenience of
wehicular road users over the safety of non-vehicular road users is made clear by the use of the
wague and permissive words "should" and "if possible" In proposed Policy C-P5, which states
that road improvements to address congestion "should not adversely affect Level of Service
and/or Quality of Service for other modes of transportation, if possible." This analysis applies
equally to the RDEIR's conclusion that impacts to the performance or safety of bicycle, transit
and pedestrian facilities will be less than significant.

Im sum, the RDEIR must provide greater attention and analysis to non-vehicular transportation impacts. Furthermore, conclusions that the roadway safety and multimodal safety and
performance impacts of the GPU are less than significant are not supportable and must be
revisited.

Outdated Anolysis and Trucking impacts
The GPU process has taken many years, and we understand the difficulty of keeping the
analyses in the RDEIR up to date. Nevertheless, it is not acceptable for the RDEIR to rely on
documents and analyses which are substantially outdated and reflect conditions which no C1-4
longer prevail. For example, the RDEIR explicitly relies on a reports from 2002 and 2008 to
describe "existing transportation system conditions" (p.3.5-1}. At p.3.5-5, the RDEIR also relies

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 41

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

CRTP
Coalition for Responsible Transporlation Priorities
on the County's 2008 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for a list of "regionally significant
streets and roadways," despite the fact that the RTP was completely overhauled in 2014. Characterizing current conditions based on documents which are 15 years old and 9 years old,
respectively, and categorically out of date, simply cannot lead to supportable impact
assessment.

One glaring example of outdated analysis is the claim that Humboldt County is "dependent on
logging and heavy commercial truck traffic to sustain its economy" (p.3.5-5). While logging and
truck transportation still play a role in the local economy, the County can no longer be said to
depend on them. The most recent Census data (2015) show that the entire forestry &
agriculture sector provides only 2.3% of the County's payroll and 1.6% of its employment. Even
adding this sector to manufacturing, wholesale, transportation and warehousing-the other C1-4
main industries dependent on heavy trucks-produces only 16% of the payroll and 13% of the
employment.

The RDEIR recognizes that "a key concern for the County is the impact of heavy truckloads on
deteriorating County roads" (p.3.5-9), but provides no analysis of the GPU's impact on truck
traffic os County road maintenance and repair. Indeed, the word "truck" appears only once in
the entire Section 3.5.3 on transportation impacts and mitigation measures, and there is no
discussion at all of the GPU's impacts on efforts to maintain and repair County roads. This lack
may be partly explained by the incorrect assumption that the County is still heavily dependent
on industries like logging-and that therefore there is no reasonable way to limit or control
heavy truck traffic. Regardless, the RDEIR must be amended to include an analysis of truck
traffic and maintenance/repair impacts, along with any needed mitigation.

Thank you for your consideration of our comments.

Responses to Coalition of Responsible Transportation Priorities - Letter C1

Comment C1-1: This comment asserts the General Plan Update RDEIR's usage of LOS as a primary assessment tool is inappropriate, and that LOS should be replaced with VMT.
Response to Comment C1-1: The RDEIR uses both level of service (LOS) and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) as assessment tools. The use of VMT as a travel metric was emphasized by SB 743, which in 2013 was enacted to facilitate/simplify CEQA approvals
of infill development projects in urban areas with strong transit services. Specific guidelines to modify CEQA procedures are currently being promulgated by the Office and Planning and Research. OPR's proposed guidelines summarize the intent this way:
"Substantively, a focus on vehicle miles traveled will facilitate the production of badly-needed housing in urban locations. It will also
facilitate transit projects and better uses of existing infrastructure as well as bicycle improvements. As a result, people will have better transportation
options. It also means that CEQA will no longer mandate roadways that
focus on automobiles to the exclusion of every other transportation option. It will It no longer mandate excessive, and expensive, roadway
capacity." 1

The degree to which this legislative intent meshes with existing and planned conditions
in Humboldt County can be argued. The guidelines clearly target urbanized areas in California and many of its features and recommendations do not seem have application to rural counties. For example, most of the important roadways in Humboldt County have two lanes as their ultimate planned width. The exceptions include some state highways and a few urban arterials. Humboldt County agencies have no plans for massive roadway widening or other capacity-increasing efforts. Table 3.5-6 lists 43
potential circulation system improvements, all two-lane local or collector streets, whose purpose is to enable the roadway system to accommodate the increased travel demand from General Plan Update development without causing unacceptable
traffic congestion. In many cases, these are "missing links" in the roadway system whose
need will arise as anticipated development projects occur.

Using LOS as a metric, the GPU identifies only four projects with unacceptable future
conditions for which mitigation measures are investigated: US 101 north of Eureka, U.S.
101 in Eureka between 6th Street and Herrick Avenue, and sections of Main Street and
Kenmar Road in Fortuna. Widening is considered impractical for the Fortuna projects. The two remaining projects recommended by the GPU are safety and operational improvements on the two sections of U.S. 101 in and near Eureka that are not classified
as capacity-enhancing projects. It can be seen that the use of LOS instead of VMT has
not produced any widening or capacity-enhancing projects in the County.

CEQA, Governor's Office of Planning and Research, January 20, 2016
Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 43

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

One important non-CEQA use of LOS in the analysis of new development projects enables the reviewing agencies to ensure that necessary nearby transportation
improvements are identified and enacted. A VMT project analysis provides no value in
these circumstances.

Because of these issues, it is appropriate for Humboldt County to continue to use both LOS and VMT as transportation assessment tools.

Comment C1-2: In support of the concept that VMT is a better indicator to measure
transportation impacts, the RDEIR should propose and support measures that mitigate VMT increases described in the text. The Office of Planning and Research proposed guidelines to evaluate transportation impacts should be followed.

Response to Comment C1-2: In addition to responses to comment T1-2, it should be noted that the only factors related to increased VMT are; 1) number of vehicular trips, 2)
trip length, and 3) induced travel resulting from higher speeds due to improved roadway capacity. The commenter argues that land use patterns should be more
compact so that trips would be fewer and shorter. However, with the minimal growth forecasted for the County, there would hardly be the ability to realign existing and future land uses to achieve such a scenario. The earlier response also points out that there are essentially no capacity enhancing projects expected in the County during the life of the GPU, eliminating induced travel as a significant factor. Also, most would argue that "sprawl" is not an applicable description of the consequences of adoption of the Humboldt County GPU.
The references to VMT increasing at a faster rate than population and employment are partly explainable by the lack of precision inherent in estimating both current and future VMT. A variety of approaches and models are possible, all of which rely on assumptions and qualitative assessments.
Comment C1-3: The RDEIR should focus on non-vehicular travel including transit,
walking and bicycle trips. The document should develop measures to identify or
measure impacts on active transportation. Conclusions that roadway safety and multimodal safety and performance impacts of the GPU are less than significant are not supportable.

Response to Comment C1-3: The GPU document itself has 22 (out of 78 total) proposed goals and policies, standards and implementation measures that directly relate to
active transportation - transit, walking and bicycling. These policies make it clear that
the County is intent on promoting active transportation as it reviews development applications and as it develops infrastructure improvement projects. Contrary to the comment, implications that roadway safety and other features related to active transportation create significant impacts are not supported by the comment.
Comment C1-4: The RDEIR relies on outdated trucking statistics that do not reflect the County's diminished activities in forestry and agriculture. The impacts of truck traffic should be reanalyzed and appropriate mitigation measures should be developed.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 44

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C1-4: The commenter seems to make contradictory statements and requests: The description of truck activity in the RDEIR is outdated and overstated
but the document should be revised to include an analysis of truck impacts and
mitigation measures. The observation that the GPU process has taken many years to analyze possibly accounting for outdated information may be correct. However, to the same extent it may overestimate truck activity, it also overestimates negative truck
impacts on the roadway system.

7. Where is the Titlow Hill area (p 3.2-17 and 18)? The County did extensive research and reporting in
relationship to its lawsuit against Bareilles. County even states that in Schmook and Villa that nothing C2-7

abated.

8. How were the Redwood Creek housing units calculated (p 3.7-38]? Projected legal housing only? If yes,
then the quantity is way too low and there will be no addresses for emergency services, nor accessible C2-8
roads or driveways.
9. What are the real impacts to air quality (p 3.12-2) where all of the surrounding roads are dirt and there a
numerous illegal subdivisions (Titlow Hill area)? C2-9
10. How can the County make certain assertions about air quality when it has no monitoring systems in
eastern Humboldt (p 3.12-3) where the sky becomes dark and the air crunchy when there are forest C2-10
fires and everything near dirt roads becomes covered with dust?
11. Why are farming operations, off-road equipment, etc. listed multiple times with different numbers in Table 3.12-3. Annual PM10 emissions estimated percent contribution by source (p 3.12-5)? C2-11
12. How can the assumptions about the daily activity on unpaved roads be true (p 3.12-6) when areas
where there are marljuana growing (activities go through fall, increase when their trimmers come, and C2-12
all of them go back and forth, back and forth along the roads multiple times a day and night)?
13. What does the County think about having odors (especially marijuana) for visitors and legal residents (p
3.12-7? What is the cost to property owners if they are surrounded for miles by marijuana
growers/processors? What is the negative impact on their property rights and ability to enjoy their own C2-13

properties tespecially when the problems did not exist when their properties were purchased)? The
County also claims that it has "unknown" odor causing sites (p 3.12-16), but they are well aware of C2-13
thousands of marijuana growing and production sites.
14. How does "Reduce Length and Frequency of Vehicle Trips," (p 3.13.-19 ) happen when the County is
proposing to increase the quantity of parcels, number of businesses, etc. in unincorporated areas (and
farther from the coast]? Here and elsewhere, where is the County going to come up with the money to | C2-14
implement and support these activities (the County already says that they don't have resources for the
current laws on the books]?
15. What laws does the County have or propose to mitigate light pollution that can be seen for miles and
megatively impact a person's ability to enjoy the night sky and negatively impact wildlife (p 3.16-4)? Just
in thhe last year, there are several new and large greenhouses just in the Titlow Hill area. C2-15

There are over a hundred more pages to read and review (out of the 582 total), so I'm going to let my general
statements at the beginning of this public comment stand for the rest of the pages. It would be meaningful to
understand how many public comments (separated by general public, government agencies, legal entities, real C2-16
estate/development businesses, etc.) continue to be participate in this process since it has be going on for over
a decade (and how this compares to other counties).

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Responses to Marisa D'Arpino Letter C2

Comment C2-1: The comment questions the "real impact" of not adhering to the current General Plan and what the impact would be if the County doesn't enforce the General Plan Update policies, standards, and implementation measures in the future.
Response to Comment C2-1: This comment expresses an opinion about the implementation of the current Humboldt County General Plan, a baseline condition,
and speculates that the implementation of the proposed General Plan Update will not occur. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C2-2: The comment questions what the "real impact" is of the RDEIR relying on background reports that, in some cases, are over ten years old.
Response to Comment C2-2: The comment does not identify specific background reports of concern or impacts or mitigation measures that may be affected by such information. Section 3.0, Baseline Environmental Conditions Assumed in the RDEIR, describes the environmental setting information contained in the RDEIR. In addition, the Environmental and Regulatory Setting of each impact topic in the RDEIR describes the specific environmental setting information relied upon in that section of the RDEIR and the information that has been updated since release of the Notice of Preparation on January 22, 2007, or the Draft Environmental Impact Report, April 2, 2012. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C2-3: The comment questions the "real impact" of "individuals not following
the laws."

Response to Comment C2-3: The RDEIR discusses the following illegal or unpermitted activities in the description of the environmental baseline and analysis portions of the following RDEIR Chapters: cannabis cultivation, grading, land division (Chapter 3.2, Agricultural and Timber Resources); stream diversions, dumpsites (Chapter 3.3, Utilities and Services Systems); accidental spills and illegal disposal of hazardous waste (Chapter 3.7, Hazards and Hazardous Materials); water diversions (Chapter 3.10, Hydrology and Water Quality); water diversions, homeless encampments, trash dumping, and illegal filling (Chapter 3.11, Biological Resources); PM10 emissions and the extent to which this may be attributable to travel to and from remote unpermitted illegal cannabis cultivation sites (Chapter 3.12, Air Quality); illegal billboards (Chapter
3.16, Scenic Resources). The RDEIR is intended to disclose the possible environmental
impacts from approving the policies, standards, and implementation measures in the
General Plan Update and the population growth that is projected to occur during the
General Plan Update planning period. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 48

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Comment C2-4: The comment asks if Table 2.1-4, Humboldt County Changes in Housing Units 1995-2015, includes "all of the illegal building and illegal subdivisions (and that haven't been abated and have only increased)."

Response to Comment C2-4: Table 2.1-4 contains data from the State Department of
Finance that is benchmarked to the US Census. Humboldt County cannot verify whether or not Census data may include some or all housing units that were
constructed without building permits. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required is under
CEQA.

Comment C2-5: The comment asks if Table 2.1-5, Humboldt County Population Growth Forecasts, includes "the full- and part-time people related to the marijuana industry."
Response to Comment C2-5: Table 2.1-5 includes data from the State Department of Finance that is benchmarked to the US Census. Humboldt County cannot verify whether or not Census and Department of Finance estimates include some or all "the full- and part-time people related to the marijuana industry." The comment does not
address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further
response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-6: The comment asks about the effect of the General Plan Update
Guiding Principles to "preserve and enhance ...and the quality of life," have a
"...balance approach to protect natural resources...." "..utilize common sense," particularly in relation to the Titlow Hill area.
Response to Comment C2-6: According to Section 1.4 of the General Plan Update, the Guiding Principles "provide a statement of community values and of the overall objectives of the General Plan" and "have been used to guide the drafting of the goals and policies in each plan element, to create a vision for the future, and to serve as the basis for evaluating future amendments." The RDEIR is intended to disclose the possible environmental impacts from approving the policies, standards, and implementation measures in the General Plan Update and the population growth that is projected to occur during the General Plan Update planning period. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further
response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-7: The comment appears to ask how the Titlow Hill area "in relationship to its lawsuit against Bareilles" is addressed in the discussion of the trends relating to the increased monetary valuation of resource lands for rural residential purposes rather
than resource production uses of the Agricultural and Timber Resources - Environmental
and Regulatory Setting, found on pages 3.2-17 and 18 of Chapter 3.2, Agricultural and
Timber Resources.

Response to Comment C2-7: Humboldt County Planning and Building recently issued a request for proposals to prepare an environmental impact report for Titlow Hill General
Plan Amendment, Zone Reclassification, and Subdivision Application. The concerns
addressed by the commenter would be best addressed in the environmental review of

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 49

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

that project. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in
the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-8: The comment asks how the Redwood Creek housing units were
calculated in Table 3.7-6. Housing Units Projected within High Fire Hazard Severity Areas.

Response to Comment C2-8: The methodology used to distribute the 1,721 dwelling units projected to be developed within the unincorporated area during the planning period can be found in Appendix T - Assumptions Used in the Development Projections. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-9: The comment asks about the "real impacts" to air quality of dirt roads that are related to illegal subdivisions in the Titlow Hill area in particular.
Response to Comment C2-9: The discussion of "Criteria Air Pollutants" beginning on page 3.12-4 and Table 3.12-3, Annual PM10 emissions estimated percent contribution by source, discloses the annual PM10 emissions estimated percent contribution from unpaved road dust. Page 3.12-9 of Chapter 3.12, states that "Air Quality Attainment Plan or the General Plan Update policies, standards, or implementation measures. The
potential impact of permitting cannabis cultivation sites in remote areas accessed by unpaved roads will be examined in a separate EIR to be prepared prior to the adoption of future land use ordinances for permitting cannabis activities authorized by the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (Bus. & Prof. Code § 19300, et. seq., etc.) or the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (Prop. 64 (2016); Bus. & Prof. Code § 26000, et. seq.,
etc." The comment does identify specific additional impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C2-10: The comment asks how assertions about air quality, in particular those impacts relating wildland fire and dirt roads, can be made without air quality monitoring stations in eastern Humboldt County.

Response to Comment C2-10: All air quality data in the RDEIR is from the California Air Resources Board. Impact 3.12.4.1, Conflict with Air Quality Plan, Violate Air Quality Standard, Increase Criteria Pollutant in Non-Attainment Status, discloses impacts
relating to criteria pollutants such as unpaved road dust and concludes that "(bJecause the County is in nonattainment status for PM10, increases in PM10 emissions that could increase exceedances are significant. Implementation of the proposed General Plan Update would result in a cumulatively considerable net increase in PM10 emissions. Although applying the General Plan Update policies and standards would reduce impacts that might otherwise be greater, the impacts remain significant and unavoidable." The comment does identify specific additional impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C2-11: The comment asks why farming operations and off-road equipment, etc. are listed multiple times with different numbers in Table 3.12-3, Annual PM10
emissions estimated percent contribution by source.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 50

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C2-11: These data are compiled by the California Air Resources
and presented in this format. Off-road vehicles are likely used for other activities in
addition to farming operations. The comment does not address specific impacts or
mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C2-12: The comment questions the validity of assumptions regarding the use of unpaved roads, especially relating to marijuana operations.
Response to Comment C2-12: Environmental effects relating to PM10 (road dust) are addressed in Impact 3.12.4.1, Conflict with Air Quality Plan, Violate Air Quality Standard, Increase Criteria Pollutant in Non-Attainment Status. See response to comment C-1-9 and C-1-10 for a discussion of the RDEIR conclusions regarding PM10. The comment
does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no
further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-13: The comment expresses concerns about existing sources of objectionable odors, especially relating to marijuana cultivation and refers to a statement on page 3.12-16 about "unknown odor causing sites."

Response to Comment C2-13: Existing sources of odors within the unincorporated area
are described on page 3.12-7 under the headings "Odors" and "Sensitive Receptors."
The RDEIR analyzes potential new sources of objectionable odors in Impact 3.12.4.3,
Objectionable Odors, and states on page 3.12-16 that "It is unknown at this point what types and locations of specific establishments could be developed under implementation of the Draft General Plan, and it is possible that some uses (e.g., wastewater treatment plants) could have the potential to produce odors." The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR.
Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-14: The comment questions how General Plan Update Policy AQ-P1,
Reduce Length and Frequency of Vehicle Trips, will be accomplished "when the
County is proposing to increase the quantity of parcels, number of businesses, etc. in
unincorporated areas."

Response to Comment C2-14: The analysis in "Land Use and Circulation Elements" on
page 3.13-21 is related to this question and states that "(n)onetheless, as described
above, the project will generate increased daily vehicle trips at buildout." The RDEIR concludes that the proposed General Plan update would exceed an adopted Greenhouse Gas significance threshold. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required
under CEQA.

Comment C2-15: The comment asks how light pollution is proposed to be mitigated, in particular impacts relating to existing greenhouses with lights.
Response to Comment C2-15: Impact 3.16.3.3, Sources of Light and Glare, analyzes
whether implementation of the General Plan Update could result in increased
development that would be new sources of light that could affect day or nighttime

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 51

views. The RDEIR concludes that light and glare impacts from increased development
are potentially significant and incorporates a Mitigation 3.16.3.3.a, which would add a new program to the Scenic Resources Chapter of the Conservation and Open Space
Element to amend the Zoning Regulations to include lighting design guidelines for
discretionary projects. Humboldt County Planning and Building Department issued a
Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report on April 4, 2017, for
Amendments to Humboldt County Code Regulating Commercial Cannabis Activities. The County acknowledges that new unpermitted cannabis cultivation in greenhouses that uses lights during some or all of the plant production cycle has caused significant
new sources of light across the landscape. The concerns expressed by the commenter that relate to cannabis production are discussed in the environmental review of that
project. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the
RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C2-16: This comment notes the number of pages that comprise the RDEIR
and indicates that the commenter would be interested in learning how many
commenters continue to participate in the General Plan Update process.
Response to Comment C2-16: Public comments that have been received throughout the General Plan Update process, including RDEIR comments, are available on the
General Plan Update webpage at http://humboldtgov.org/577/Public-Comments. The
comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR.
Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Re: Mercer Fraser Company / General Plan Update - Revised Draft EIR

Dear Mr. Richardson:

On behalf of the Mercer Fraser Company ("Mercer Fraser"), we thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Board of Supervisors Draft of the County's General Plan Update ("Drafi GPU"). The purpose of this letter is to voice our opposition 1o a suggestion in the EIR that changes be made to the Draft GPU's current definition of wetlands.

This letter will discuss the Draft GPU's current definition of wellands und then discuss
the EIR's suggested changes to that definition.

Draft GPU Definition of Wetlands

Prior to adoption of the current Draft GPU, Mercer Fraser submitted letters on May 30, and July 9, 2014 requesting the Board to adopt a wetlands definition that aligns with the US Army Corps of Engineers (the "Corps") wetlands delincation standards. As Mercer Fraser indicated in its May 30 and July 9 letters, the Corps has exclusive jurisdiction over wetlands C3-1

delineation in California.

On September 8, 2014, in response to the comments of Mercer Fraser and others, the Board approved the Draft GPU's current definition of wetlands. This definition is found in standard BR-S11 of the Conservation and Open Space Element:
BR-S11. Wellands Defined. The County considers wetlands as lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or neat
the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. Wetlands must have all of the
following three attribules: (1) at least periodically, the land supports hydrophytes, (2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric soil, and (3) the substrate is non-soil and is safurated with water or covered by shallow water at some time
during the growing season of each year.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 53

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Mr. Michael Richardson
Mercer Fraser Company - General Plan Update : RDEIR
June 20,2017

(See Exhibit A.)

The above language is acceptable because it aligns with the Corps' delineation standards
for wetlands.

We will now discuss the changes that the EIR suggests be made to BR-S11. These changes conflict with both the Board's prior directions and the Corps' standards.
The EIR's Suggested Changes to the GPU's Wetlands Definition'
The EIR claims that the current Draft GPU language for BR-S11is problematic because "areas cannot logically have both hydric soil subsirate and non-soil substrate at the same time." However, the changes suggested in the EIR are not necessary and conflict with the Corps' wctlands delincation standards.

In "Mitigation Measure 3.11.3.2" the EIR suggests the following change to the text of
BR-$11:

BR-$11. Wetlands Defined. The County considers wetlands as lands transitional between
terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. Wetlands-must-have-all-of the following three C3-1
attributest (H) at least-periedically, the land-supponts hydrsphyles, (2) the-substrale-is predeminantly -undrained-hydric-soil,-and-(3}-the-substrats-if-non-soil-and-is-Rafurate with-water-or-covered-by-shallow water-at-some-time-during-the-growing-seasen of-each year. An area is wetland if, under normal circumstances, (I) the area has continuous or recurrent saturation of the upper substrate caused by groundwater, or shallow surface water, or both; (2) the duration of such saturation is sufficient to cause anaerobic
conditions in the upper substrate; and (3) the area's vegetation is dominated by
bydrophytes or the area lacks vegetation.

(emphasis added) (See Exhibit B.)

The changes above are not necessary because there is po logical Naw in the current language of BR-S11. The subsirate can contain hydric soil as well as non-soil saturated with water or covered by shallow water in the same area.

More importantly, by indicating that wetlands can lack vegetation, the wetlands definition suggested in the EIR conflicts with the Corps standards. Unlike the language suggested above, the Corps standards require that wetlands "under normal
circumstances…support, a prevalence of vegetation" adapted for water saturated soil. (See. Wetlands Delineation Mamual, US Army Corps of Engineers (1987) at pages 9-10, attached hereto as Exhibit C.)
1 Tn the second paragraph of page 3.11-14 of the EIR, a statement is made that the County must follow the identification and classification policies of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW") in its wetland delineation policies. As we outlined in our July 9, 2014 leller to the Bourd, the Corps and not the DFW has exclusive authority over wedands delincation.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 54

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Mr. Michacl Richardson
Mercer Fraser Company - General Plan Update : RDEIR June 20, 2017

The wetlands definition currently found in BR-S11 more accurately aligns with the Corps' wetlands standards related to vegctation. Similar to the Corps' standards, the current version of BR-S11 requires that an arca support hydrophytes (water adapted plants), at least periodically, in order for a positive wetlands determination to be made. The current language of BR-S11 also aligns with the Corps' wetlands characteristics related to bydrology and soil.
The changes suggested by 1he EIR are not necessary and conflict with the Corps' current wetlands delineation standards. The County should retain the current language found in BR-S11 C3-1
of the Draft GPU.

CONCLUSION

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the EIR and trust that the County will find the above comments helpful in the GPU process. Plcase do not hesitate to contact mc if you
have any questions.

Very truly yours, HARRISON, TEMBLADOR, HUNGERFORD &
JOHNSON

In working with County Planning and Buliding Department staft, bullders, developers, and environmental corsultants to prevent the loss of wellands and wet and habitat values, CDFW delermined there is a strong interest and need for a wetland mitigation bank in the Humboldi Bay-Eel River Delta area. Whlle I1 Is CDFW's policy to provide for the protection, preservotion, restoration, enhancement ond expansion of natural wetland habitat, CDFW finds that in cortoin limited Instances, utilzalion of a local welland bank may be the most envronmentally sound, feasible, and cost-ellective approach to miligate for impacis to wellands. CDFW therefore
recommended the County consider working wilh local, stale, and foderal agencies and privato stakeholdass to promote or facilitate developing a wetland bank for the Humboldt Bay-Eal River Dello crea. CDFW is willing to provide tachnical support for the creation of a local welland bank. The Board of Supervisors incorporated this recommendation into the GPU with
Implementation Measure BR-IMx2 - Wellands Bonk.
Under Standard BR-$11, Wetlands Definad, the County must follow the identification and classification policies of the Califomia Department of Fish and Wildlife which considers wetlands as lands transitional between terrestrial and aqualic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water, In Standard BR-S11, wetlands must have the following three altrbutes: 11) at least periodically, the land supporls hydrophytes, (2) the substrate is predominantly undrained hydric sol. and (3] the substrate is non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shollow water ol some time during the growing season of each year, This definition does not work wel because areas cannot logically have both hydric soil substrate and non-soil substrate at the same time.

Conclusion

Through implementation of General Plan Updale policies, standards, and implementalion
measures the Counly will assess development impacts on wellands and associated sensilive habitats, as port of the review process for discretionary permits, as well as to protect water
quality, As discussed above, the definition of wetland contairs o logical flaw, and needs to be
revised,

Miligation

The following implementation measure below sholl be fultilled to help address tha potential
impacks related to the definition of wetlands in the General Plon Update. Allamotive lunguage is presented below that would correct the existing logical flaw in Slandard BR-S11.

Lovel of Significance Alter Miligation
With the above revision to Standard BR-S11 and continued implomentation of exisling lederal and state regulations, and proposed new policies and implementation measures of the General Plan Update regarding protection of wellands, impacts to federally protected wellands would be less than signilicanl.

Impact 3.11.3.3. Wildlife Comidors and Nursery Sites
implementation of the General Plan Update would result in additional developmen! lhat could interfere wilh the movement of nalive resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with their migratory wildlife comdors, or impede the USO of notive wildlife nursery sites.
This impact analysis addresses ilem "d" of the signiticonce standards listed in Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines as provided in Section 3.11.2 above. Pursuant to these standards, the proposed County General Pian Update would have a signiticant impact if it would:
a) Interfere subslantiaty wilh the movement ot any native resident or migratory fish of wildile species or with establlshed native resident or migratary wildlle comdors. or
impede the use of native wildlife nursery sites.
Devalopment and land use activilles consistent with the Generol Plan Updale could result in a reduction in existing hobitol, could contribute to further fragmentation of remaining natural areas, and could substantially interfere with the movement ol native fish and wildllfe species. These include potential impacts lo special-status spacies, sonsitive natural communitles, and streams and wellands. as well as more generol wildlife habllat resources.
Roosevell Elk habitat and deer winter range are mapped on the Biological Resources mops that identity important wildiile caridors. Wilhin the coastal zone, a Roosevelt Elk Habital combining zone is applied to lands which contain elk corridors, and calls for their protectian.
Streams tend to serve as important movement corridors for terrestrial and aquatic wildlife, and protaction of areas that quality as SMAs is esseniial to protecting existing habitat tunctions and values. Forestad areas ond native woodlands oso tend to provide Imporiant habitat resources
to wildlite.

A substantial amount of development could occur in the unincorporated areas as a resull of bulldout of the Generol Plan Update land use designations al speciled minimum parcal sizes, despite many sile specilic constroinis that moy exist. A portion of this development would occur on parcels containing SMAS.
Discretionary development that would occur under the General Pian Update would be sited and designed to avoid impocis to the movement of native resident migratory fish or wildlile species and to avoid established native resident or migrotory corridors and wildllife nursery silos.

Part II: Technical Guidelines

24. The interaction of hydrology, vegetation, and soil results in the develop. mcnt of characteristica unique to wetlanda. Therefore, the following tecnical guideline for wetlands is based on these three parametera, and diagnostic envi- ronmental churacteristics used in applying the technical guideline ure repre- sented by variouus indicators of thesc paramcters.
25. Bccauge wotlands mnay be bordered by both wetter areas (aguatic labi- tats) and by drier arcas (nonwetlands), guidelines are presented for wetlands, deepwater aquotic habitats, and nonwctlands, However, procedures for applying the technical guidelines for decpwater aquatic habitals and noowetlands re not included in the manual.

Wetlands

26. The following definition, diagnostic enviroumental characteristics, and techmical approuch comprisc a guideline for the identification and delineation of wetlands:

. Definition. The CE (Federal Register 1982) and the EPA (Federal Reg- ixter 1980) jointly define wetlands as: Those areas thoi are inundated or saturated by surfacc or ground water at a frequency and duration suffi- cient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prev- alence of vegetation typically adapled for life in saturated soil conditians. Wetlands generally include swampa, marsher, bogs, and similor areas.

b Diagnosuc environmental characteristics. Wetlauds have the folkowing general diagnostic environmental characteristics:

(1) Vegctation. The prevalent vogetation consists of macrophytcs that ore typically adupted to arcas having hydrologic and soll conditions described in a above. Hydraphytic species, due 1o morpbological, physiological, and/or reproductive adaptation(s), have the ability to grow, cffectively compete, reproduce, and/or persist in anaerobie

soil conditions.' Indientors of vegetution associaled with wetlands
are liated in paragraph 35.
(2) Sofl. Soils are presem and hove buen cinssified as hydric, or they possess characteristics that are associnted with reducing soil condi.
tions. Indicators of soils developed under reducing conditious are
listed in paragraphs 44 and 45.

(3) Hydrology. The arca is inundated either permancatly or periadi- cally at mean water depths s 6.6 N, or the soil is saturated to the surface a1 some time doring the growing season of the prevalent
vegctation.' Indicators of hydrologic conditions that occur in wet-
lands arc listed in parngraph 49.

c. Tecluical approach for the identiftcation and delineation of wetlands. Except in cenain situmtions defined in this manual, evidence of a nsini- mum of onc positive wetland indientor from cach parumeler (hydrology, $ail, and vegetaticn) must be found in order to make a positive welland determination.

Deepwater Aquatic Habitats

27. The following definition, diagnostic environmental characteristics, and tcchnical upproach comprise a guldeline for decpwaler aquatic habitnts:

Et. Defuitton. Deepwater aquatic habitnts nre arens that are permanently imundated at mean annual water deptles >6.6 ft or permunently inundated
BICas $6.6 ft in depth that do nos support sooted-emergent or woody plant

b. Diagnostic environmental characteristics. Deepwater aguatic habimts have the following diagnostic enviroumental characteristics:
(1) Vegeiation. No rooted-emergent or waody plunt species are present in these permanently inundated areas.
(2) Sof. The substrate fechmically is not defined as a soil if the mcan
water depth is >6.6 f or if it will not support rooted emergent or

Responses to Mercer Fraser - Letter C3

Comment C3-1: The comment questions whether Mitigation Measure 3.11.3.2 is
necessary. The commenter does not consider the definition of wetlands straw-voted by the Board to be flawed in the first place, and secondly, does not consider the replacement language in the mitigation measure to be an improvement because it conflicts with the Corps' current wetland definition.

Response to Comment C3-1: This mitigation is proposed to address the definition of wetlands straw-voted by the Board which contains the language that a wetland is an area that both contains substrate that is "predominantly undrained hydric soil" and at the same time, the substrate is "non-soil". While there may conceivably be circumstances where wetlands are both soil and non-soil at the same time, this
language seems to be contradictory on its face, and is therefore unnecessarily
confusing to the users of the GPU.

To clarify Standard BR-S11 consistent with the commenters request to be consistent with the US Army Corps definition of wetlands, which is also the intent of the wording straw- voted by the Board, Mitigation Measure 3.11.3.2 in the DEIR is revised to substitute the Corps' definition of wetlands into BR-S11:
"Mitigation Measure 3.11.3.2. Replace BR-S11 with the below definition of wetlands:

BR-$11. Wetlands Defined. The County shall follow the US Army Corps of Engineers
Wetland Delineation manual in the identification and classification of wetlands
which considers wetlands as those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface
or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs
and similar areas. lands transitienal-between terrestrial and aquatie systems where the water-table is usuelly at er neer the surface or the land is covered by shallew
water. Wetlands must have all-of the fellewing three-attributes: (4 at least periedieally, the land supperts-hydrephytes, (2) the substrate is-predeminantly undrained-hydrie soil, and (3} the substrate-is-nen-soil and is-saturated with water or

I. Concerns regarding the RDEIR's treatment of cannabis cultivation and the
CMMLUO

Beginning on Page 3.2-7, the RDEIR discusses the existence, historical basis, and potential impacts of the commercial cannabis industry in Humboldt County. Though the discussion of cannabis cultivation goes on for some length, the RDEIR goes on to state that "the environmental impacts of the future regulatory program will be evaluated in a separate environmental document, and are therefore not discussed any further in this EIR" (RDEIR Page 3.2-9),
RDEIR Pagé 1-2, section 1.1.1. Paragraph 2., Tiering and Required approvals, states:

*This Program EIR is a first-tier onvironmental documont thal assosses and documents tho broad environmental Impacts that can be expected to occur from the adoption and implernentation of the General Plan Updete...*

It is our position that faiture to more adequately address the broad environmental impacts of illegal cannabis cultivation, regulated commercial cannabis production, and the impact of the CMMLUO is a flaw in the RDEIR that violates the California Eaviconmental Quality Act's guidelines perteining to the requirements of a General Plan's EIR.

The RDEIR docs not analyze and discuss the "significant broad environmental impacts" duc to recent changes in the zoning maps and ordinance(s) that accommodated the cannabis industry in the CMMLUO. Similarly, the RDEIR does not analyze and discuss the economic and equitable impacis of the net loas of induytrial zoned Jands for commercial and industrial uses other Lhan for the cannabis
industry. C4-1
In several sections in the document, the RDEIR docs discuas some of the impacts that will arise due to advancement of the CMMLUO, and which are already present due to historical cannabis cultivation activily. For example, Beginning on page 3.2-7, the RDEIR states:
"New roads have been bulldozed Into the landscape without pennits or proper design to prevent eroston. Traffic on unpaved roads is estimated to contribute as much as 60% of Humboldt County's PM , the only criteria air pollutant for which the County exceeds established standards.'
The County lightly touches on the effocls of the cannabis cultivation, and by extension the CMMLUO, is having on resources lands. This acknowledgment of the implications of cannabis cultivation is
appreciated.

However, what is conspicuously missing from the RDEIR is the discussion of its impacts with respect to each chapter of the GPU.
Despite the awareness ol those impacts, the document states that there will not be discussion and
analysis bere in this RDEIR on CMMLUO, rather there is to be a saparate EIR for the CMMLUO that provides mitigation via an outside agency's Epvironmental Review and its mitigation measures.

culti vation in the General Plan. There has to be discussion and analysis of it in this RDEIR for the
General Plan per CEQA. It not rectified. the decision makers and the public are provided with an C4-1
inaccurate and incomplete analysis.
In addition, the Notice of Preparntion that was issued in 2007 is now severely out of date, particularly in relacion to existing environmental condittons on the ground. The impacts of cannabis cultivation in Humboldt County have increased exponentially over the past decade, and particolarly over the last five to seven ycars. It is our concern thet the RDEIR's discussion of cannabis impacis is inadequate because it is derived from a baselino that way astablished over a decade ago.
RDEIR Page 1-3. Section 1.3.1., Scoping the Essuos to be Discussed in the EIR, states: C4-2

The County distributed a Nolica of Proparation (NOP) (Appendh P) to numerous agencies to let them know an EIR wus baing prepared for the GPU. and akking the agencies for comments on what should be Includad in the EIR

The NOP wa circulated In 2007, and the formal comment period for that first GPU NOP was from January 22, 2007 tn Februnry 22, 2007. This poriod was prior to the Humboldt County Planning Commission bad making its rocommendations on the GPU, and nine years prior to the Humboldt County Boud of Supervisors' revlew of the GPU. This prucess creuted inconsistencies as well as confusion about which of the various drafts formed the nctuul basis for the environmental analysis.

II. Conceros regarding proposed changes to General Plan Standard BRS-11,
Wetlands Defined

In 2014, following significant debate and public input, the Board of Supervisors voted upon the language of Standard BRS-11, Wetlands Defined, and arrived at the following definition:
BR-S11. Wellands Delined. The County shell-tellow the-identileatlen and-elassificalion pollcies- ofthe Depertmeat-of-Fish-and-Game-which considers welilands as lands transitional between terrestriol and aquatic systems where the water table is usuailly at or near the surface or the land is covered by shallow water. Wetlands must have ene gll of or-mere-of the following Ihree altributes: (1) at least periodically, the land supports hydrophytes, (2) the substrate is predominanily undrained hydric soll, and (3) the substrate is non-soil and is saturated with water or covered by shallow waler at some time during the growing season of each year. Straw Vote: 4-1 (Lovelace) 9-8-14 (RDEIR Appendix
A, Pg. A-78)

The RDEIR proposes the following changes to the language, which appears thusly on Page3.11-14:
Mitigation Moasuro 3.11.3.2. Replace BR-$11 with the below definition of wetlands:
"BR-811. Wetlands Defined. The County considers wetlands as lands transitional
between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the
surface or the land is covered by shallow water. Wellands-muel-have-all of-the following three-altributes: (4)-aHeast-periodically the-land-supporte-hydrophytes, (2)-the-subsirale-is predominantly-undrained-hydrio soll-and-(3)-the-substrate-le-non-soll and is-saturated-with water-or-oovered by-shallow-water-at-some-time-during-the-growing-season-of-ea-sh-year An area ig welland if, under normal circumstances. (1) the area has continuous or recurrent
saturation of the upper substrate caused by groundwater, or shall allow gurfaco water. or C4-3
both: (2) the duration of such saturation is sufficient to cause anaerobic conditions in the urper substrate: and (3)the area's vegetation is dominated by hydrophytes or the area lack
vegelation.

The logical reasoning for the change, that "This definition does not work well because areas cannot logically have both hydric soil substrate and non-soil substrate at the same time" (RDEJR 3,11.3.1.,
Pgs. 3.11-12), is incorrect. An example of a situation in which hydric soil substrate and non-soil
substrate can coincide is sand.

Furthermore, the proposed changes stand to have significant impact on the identification of wetlands in Humboldt County, and a significant impact on the economic viability of commercial, industrial, or residential uses that center on areas which would potentially be re-classified as wetlands under the proposed changes. The proposed language creates ambiguity and the potential for interpretation of the term "wetlands" that is not in keeping with the intent of the Board of Supervisors as reflected by their straw vote from September 9, 2014. We suggest refraining from making any changes to the language approved by the Board of Supervisors, as the proposed modification amends what has been previously agreed upon without public discussion or input.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 70

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

III. Concerns regarding RDEIR's evaluation of economic and social effects
Section 21083(c) of CEQA guidelines requires an agency to determine that project may have a significant effect on the environment if it will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly. The RDEIR largely ignores vetting the vast majority of policies, goals, and implementation measures contained within the proposed General Plan with considerations given to social or cconomic impacta.
A 2015 ruling by the CA Supreme Court in Callfornia Building Industry Assoc. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management District (Dec. 17, 2015) Cal.4th does establish that "CEQA gencrally does not require an analysis of how existing environmental conditions will impact project's future users or residents." C4-4
(2016 CEQA State Guidelines Pg. Xxiv). However, that ruling applics only to existing conditions, and not to conditions which may be created as a result of the implementation of the proposed General Plan.
Further, leeway is sometimes given to the lead agency preparing an EIR to determine whether
analyzing impacts of a social or economic nature is necessary. This may have been the position taken in the preparation of this specific RDEIR document. However, due to the exhaustive number of policies and new regulations contained within the proposed General Plan which stand to have extremely significant impacts on the social and economic fabric of Humboldt County, failure to address those potential impacts is in conflict with the intent of both the proposed General Plan and EIR.
Furthermore, the Section 21083(c), as discussed in CBIA v. BAAQMD, is still codified in the language presented in the most up-to-date CEQA State guidelines.

a. Absence of analvsis of the Economic Development element
A majority of policies, goal, implementation measures, etc., contained within the General Plan's Economic Development element undoubtedly stand to have far-reaching effects on both the environment and on the human rcsidents of Humboldt County.
The RDEIR states that the Economic Development element is an optional element. We wish to note that a number of optional clements in the GPU are fully analyzed in the RDEIR - this creates an C4-5

inconsistency in the approach to the General Plan and seems to conflict with the notion that an EIR. should examine all facets of a Gencral Plan that have potential for significant environmental impacts.
In keeping with 21083(c), in which CEQA requires an agency to determine that a project may have a significant effect on the environment if it will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly, we were anticipating a section which would examine potential impacts of the GPU on industrial and commercial growth. We were similarly anticipating an entire section on jobs, commercial uses and industrial uses to be in this section, or at least within this document as is required by CEQA. Jobs, or the lack of them, resulting from the regulatory zoning constraints on available develop-able lands directly and significantly impacts people and their families.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 71

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

b. Analvsis of regulatory constraints

A number of policies in the proposed General Plan would place regulatory constraints on both private and public lands. Whether the reasoning behind creating these regulatory constraints is sound or not, the RDEIR fails to address how these regulatory constraints may or may not impact the environment, the economy, or the people of Humboldt County,
From RDEIR Page 2-23, Section 2.5:

"The resulting developable acreage is shown in Table 2.5-1. Approximately 1,491,900 acrcs will therefore likely remain in open space, resource production, and recreational uses, with little or no development. There remains 748,861 acres of vacant and underdeveloped area available for C4-6
development without these physical constraints. That area could theoretically provide for as many as 38,972 additional dwelling units in the unincorporated area of the County if developed at the full density allowed for each land use designation as proposed in the GPU. The GPU provides ample room for future development, even without the areas with significant physical constraints."
The above statement holds that County policy under the proposed plan would allow for a significantly larger number of new dwelling units than the RDEIR anticipates and accounts for. Per CEQA, the County must address the potential impacts of the GPU, particularly when those impacis would be explicitly allowed and/or created by the implementation of the General Plan, County policy pertaining to land use, zoning, and development regulations will be the direct cause of these forcsccable impacts.
Conversely, assuming that the apparently conflicting statements and tables in the RDEIR arc a correct measure of available develop-able land within Humboldt County, the general plan does not allow for this level of development. There is an insufficient amount of appropriately zoned land for the theorctical 38,972 additional dwelling units, and there is similarly an inadequate amount of land zoned for the commercial and industrial services that would be required to support the families residing in
those new dwelling units.

A further illustration of the RDEIR's failure to examine regulatory constraints can be found in the
discussion in RDEIR Section 3.16, Scenic Resources, particularly with regards to limitations on
development that would impinge upon "scenic" vistas. This excerpt from 3.16 Pg. 3.16-7
demonstrates the potential problems:

The General Plan Update land use diagram largely maintains existing resource and open space land
use designations, which would serve to limit the development of forested and agricultural open space lands. In addition, in Conservation and Open Space Element, Scenic Resources, C4-7

Policy SR-P1, Development in Identified Scenic Viewsheds, in combination with Implementation
Measure SR-IM1, Mapping of Scenic Areas and Scenic Highways, would Identify and map scenic areas and allow development within such lands only in a manner consistent with natural slopes and contours. Scenic vlewsheds are not currently identifled or mapped, and would be mapped as part of a public process as an implementation of the General Plan Update. Standard SR-S1, Development in Mapped Scenic Areas, requires that discretionary and ministerial development avoid visual disturbance of natural contours, hilltops, tree lines, forest landscapes, bluffs and rock outcroppings, to the maximum extent feasible. It further requires that roads and public utility corridors be as narrow as feasible and follow natural contours, natural features disturbed by construction be restored as close to natural condition as feasible, and prohibits new off-premise

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 72

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

billboards.

A number of issues arise from the implications of this text with regards to regulatory constraint. If the concepts described are proposed to apply to private property, this would represent a significant regulatory burden. It would lead to significant angst for private property owners, substantial new costs
on new development, would economically encumber many tens of thousands of acres in Humboldt
County, and would be inconsistent with goals stated in both the Economic Development and Conservation and Open Space elements (ED-G1, ED-G2, CO-G1), C4-8

There is no analysis of this concept that justifies such an encumbrance for private landowners. In viewing the full text of the chapter, it seems that free rein is granted to the County to designate an alarmingly significant amount of land as "scenic" without providing any basis for how the process of designating and mapping "scenic" areas would occur. This improper delegation of authority is not analyzed whatsoever for its potential social and economic impacts.
Further, no definition of terms that are crucial to the reading of this section are provided in either the proposed General Plan or in the RDEIR. Without definitions for key terms herein (e.g., "identified scenic view shed", "visual disturbance of natural contours", "hilltops", "tree lines", "forest landscapes", "bluffs and rock outcroppings"), it is impossible to understand the scope or impacts of the proposed goals, policies, standards and implementation measures. There is a lack of quantifiable measures by which to analyze the impacts of such a policy.

c,. Water capacit for industrial and commercial uses

There is a conspicuous lack of discussion regarding wastewater and water capacity for industrial and commercial uses and development. The RDEIR discusses the capacity available for newly constructed dwelling units at length and in great detail; however, the omission of the same discussion with regards C4-9
to industrial and commercial uses continues a trend of minimizing concern for industrial and commercial uses.

The RDEIR's discussion of water and wastewater capacity occurs on RDEIR Pages 3.3-42, -55. Although text within those pages generally acknowledges the potential for increased need for wnter capacity for commercial or industrial use, the lack of detail in those discussions is blatant when
compared to similar discussions with regards to residential dwelling units.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 73

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

1V. Concerns regarding RDEIR's discussion of maximum build-out potential
and densities

a. Proiected build-out density

The RDEIR states that "The estimated maximum feasible housing development potential of the Gencral Plan Update land uses is far greater (38,972 housing units) than can reasonably be expected to be developed within the planning period of the General Plan (2016-2040)' (RDEIR 2-23). It also provides: "The proposed General Plan Update (GPU) establisbes land use patterns and policies to guide development in a manner consistent with State law. The GPU has a 20 - 25 year planning horizon and there is morc than enough allocated land use to meet projected demands for rosidential, commercial,
and industrial uses during this period." (RDEIR 2-9).

The fundamental assumption of the law is that general plans guide for future development within the C4-10
plan area for a given plan period. There is no analysis or discussion in this RDEIR as to how the maximum growth levels stated above can be accommodated in an environmentally bulanced way if the community or the populace of a given area experiences growth. Discussion of the Gencral Plan should not be limited to projected levels of growth, but rather on the potential maximum build-out density. Though it may soem far-fetched at this point in time, growth to that level is possible. According to the RDEIR, the County's own policies, land use designations, and zoning allow for the maximum build-out to occur, The RDEIR must analyze the level of growth that the acreage in the county allows.
Purthermore, Table 2.5-1 shows that the anticipated need for housing units in the County's unincorporated areas at poak projected population is 1,721 units. In addition to concerns stated above regarding the need to account for increased or maximum potential growth should it occur, it is also highly Jikely that a significant number of those anticipated 1,721 units needed by 2028 have already been constructed without the knowledge of the County of Humboldt, primarily as result of cannabis cultivation in unincorporated areas and the construction of dwelling units and structures related to the support of those activities. While this is not an issue that the RDEIR or County need address directly, it underscores the danger of assumption when considering anticipated build-out levels.

b. Acreage for industrial and commercial use
Table 3.7-5 lists a total acreage of land planned for industrial uses by community planning arens for the
IG and IR plan designations. However, that total only reflects the inland areas of the County. This is noteworthy, because in Section 3.4, Public Services, the RDEIR claims that there is sufficient land zoned for commercial and industrial uses in the County, but also states that the majority of that land is located in and around Humboldt Bay and/or the coastal zone. C4-11

The inconsistency arises when one considers that the RDEIR does not otherwise address any of the arcas located in the coastal zone, instead deferring discussion of those arcas to the Locul Coastal Plan, yet opts to include them in its inventory of industrial and commercial land. If those arcas are included in the General Plan or the RDEIR as areas that will likely undergo future development, they need bo addressed and the impacts of that development accounted for.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 74

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

A. further illustration of the complexity and conflicting statements regarding the constal zone can be found in Mitigation Measure 3.10.3.4.a (RDEIR pg. 3.1-35), which reads:
Mitigation 3.10.3.4.a. The following Safety Element implementation measure shall be added to require the County address new development in tsunami hazard areas:
S-S7. Tsunamis. New development below the level of the 100-year tsunami run-up elevation shall be limited to public access, boating, public recreation facilities, agriculture, wildlife management, habitat restoration, and ocean intakes, outfalls, C4-12
pipelines, and dredge spoils disposal.
While assuming that the above mitigation measure does not preclude private development in the tsunami run-up zone entirely, but rather would require such development to occur at elevation above the run-up clevation, this mitigation measure clearly illustrates an intent in the RDEIR to regulate activity in the coastal zone. However, the intent and attention to the coastal zone is not consistent throughout the RDEIR.

c. Cumulative Impacts

As an extension of the RDEIR's focus on an estimated need for development as compared to the maximum possible level of build-out density, section 5.2 of the RDEIR, Cumulative Impacts, also vastly undercstimates the potentially massive impacts on public services that the General Plan may stand to produce.
The discussions of Impact 3.3.3 - Utilities and Services, Impact 3.3.3.2 - Water supply, Impact 3.4.3.1 - C4-13
Schools, Impact 3.4.3.2 - Fire Protection, and Impact 3.4.3.3. - Law Enforcement are all based on the assumption of the RDEIR that relatively low-levels of development will occur. While this may be true, the fact is that the proposed General Plan's potential development impacts would leave all of these services woefully unable to cope with higher level of service demands.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 75

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

V. Numerical and Table Inconsistencies

a.Available water and wastewaler connections
The primary numerical inconsistencies identified within the RDEIR revolve around numerical
differences in values set forth in narrative text and corresponding tables. The most prevalent inconsistency of that nature occurs in the RDEIR's discussion of the current and projectod capacity of a number of Community Service Districts in various areas of Humboldt County.
For example, RDEIR Table 3.3-1 shows that the Loleta Community Services District has 258 water connections, and that there an additional 56 water connections available. However, narrative text in the
RDEIR found on page 3.3-15, "Loleta Community Services District," cites a 2008 LAFCo report which states that "The [Loleta Community Services] District believes that they can supply an additional 60-70 (40 to 50 based on Building Permit data as of 2016) homes.". This apparent inconsistency in
numbers is confusing, especially when one considers that the RDEIR does not mention the number of C4-14

available connections for certain CSD's at all in the narrative text pertaining to those CSD's.
For example, Table 3.3-1 and Table 3.3-2 show that additional water and wastewater connections are avallable for a number of CSD's which are not reflected in the narrative text of the RDEIR.

To illustrato, Table 3.3-2 shows that the Garberville CSD has 353 existing wastewater connections, and that there are an additional 180 connections available. However, the RDEIR does not explicitly state that there are additional connections available for Garberville. The inconsistency between the numbers presented in Table 3.3-1 and Table 3.3-2 and as presented in corresponding narrative text, in addition to the inconsistency in which the capacity of individual CSD's, is confusing.
These two issues with consistency between RDEIR text and tables concerning the carrying capacity of water and wastewater districts apply to the following:
Garberville CSD, Weott CSD, Loleta CSD, Riverside CSD, Scotia CSD, Orleans CSD, Willow Creek CSD, Hydesville CWD, Orick CSD, Fieldbrook/Glendale CSD, RID (Shelter Cove), and Manila CSD.

h. Total available acreage

Table 3.2-3 shows total number of available acreage for lands designated T, AE, and AG. The table C4-15
shows there arc 897,026 available T-designated acres, 76,311 available AE-designated acros, and 377,838 available AG-designated arcas, for a total of 1,351,175 available acres,

Those numbers are inconsistent as compared to tables 3.2-4 through 3.2-15, which provide total available acreage for lands designated T, AE, or AG, in specific and smaller geographic arcas located in in Humboldt County,

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 76

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

The totals for tables 3.2-4 through 3.2-15 show there are 893,840 available T-designated acres, 113,608 available AB-designated acres, and 381,846 available AG-designated acres, for a total of 1,389,294 C4-15
available acres. This represents a 38,119 acre discrepancy between the tables.

c. Acreage for industrial use

RDEIR page. Table 3.7-5 (pp 7-21, -22) lists a total of land planned for industrial uscs by community planning arcas for the IG and IR plan designations. However, that total only roflects the inland arcas of C4-16
the county. This is noteworthy, because in section 3.4, Public Services, the RDIER mukes the claim that there is sufficient land zoned commercial/industrial in the county - primarily in and around Humboldt Bay and/or in the coastal zone.

Further, the industrial acreages shown in Table 3.7-5 are inconsistent with those shown in Table 2.5-1 on page 2-24.

d Incorrect table provided

RDEIR Pg. 3.7-21 through 3.7-23 contain numerous incorrect references to Table 3.7-4 Land Planned for Industrial Uses. Tablo 3.7-4 appears on 3.7-16 and is titled Summary of Humboldt County Risk C4-17
Assessment. We assume that the incorrect references to Table 4.7-4 contained in RDEIR Pgs. 3,7-21 through 3.7-23 are meant to reference Table 3.7-5, found on Pg. 3.7-21.

VI. Mitigation Measures which do not meet CEQA/State EIR requirements

Paragraph 4 of the RDEIR, Page 1-2, Section 1.1.1 states:

All mitigation measures in the certified EIR will be incorporated into future actions carrying out the General Plan. To assist in the implementation of the General Plan Update, this EIR contains recommendations for some of the analysis that will be needed in the future. For example, this EIR establishes performance measures that would be applled for future projects when the County Issues permits and approvals required for those projects.
Of concern is that some of the "mitigation measures" listed throughout this Program EIR do not mect the criteria for mitigation as laid out in CEQA. Mitigation measures must be measurable or quantitative measures attainable in a reasonable time frame, and no mitigation can be deferred to another report or future action. Many of the "mitigation measures" in the RDEIR call for deferral or stipulate that future yet unspecified action will be taken to accomplish their mitigation goals.
In a number of instances, some items identified as "mitigation measures" are similar in wording to goals, policies, standards or implementation measures that were formally rejected by the planning C4-18
commission in their review of the draft general plan update.
is There is absolutely no objection to presenting the "mitigation" items in question which are currently identified ay miligation measures, but would more appropriately be identified as new or modified goals, policies, standards or implementation measures, to the Board of Supervisors for consideration and re-circulation; however, they should not be identified as mitigation.
In other instunces, impacts are lacking mitigation measures where they require one. This often results from either relying on the efforts of other agencies or underestimating the level of significance to which an impact rises,

The following impacts lack mitigation measures: 3.3.3.1, 3.3.3.3, 3.4.3.1, 3.4,3.2, 3.4.3.3, 3.11.3.1, 3.11.3.3, 3.12.4.3, 3.13.4.1, 3.14.3.2, 3.15.3.2, 3.17.4.1, 3.17.4.2
The following items are mitigation measures which do not comply with CEQA requirements: 3,5.3.1a, 3.5.3.2a, 3.11.3.2, 3.11.3.5, 3.15.3.1, 3.15.3.1a, 3.16.3.1, 3.16.3.2, and 3,16.3.3a
The items which do not comply with CEQA requirements are shown, in full, in Appendix A of this document.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 78

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

VII. Policies lacking Implementation Measures
There are a number of policies present in the General Plan that lack implementation measures which explicitly demonstrate the manner in which the aim of the policy is to be carried out. This is a defect per the state guidelines which dictate the requirements of a General Plan.
As it pertains to the RDEIR, it is our concern that policies which may have future impacis but lack implementation measures are difficult to evaluate from an EIR standpoint as there is no indication of what the impacts of carrying out that stated policy goal may be.
For example, consider Urban Lands Policy P2:
"UL-P2. Streamlined Subdiyision Approval. The County shall streamline the approval process for subdivisions located in designated Housing Opportunity Zones within Urban Development Areas."
Without an implementation measure to accompany this policy, it is imposaible to gauge whether the method by which the County shall streamline the approval process for the type of subdivision referenced above will have an impact at all, let alone whether that impact is significant. C4-19

Again, with regards to the RDEIR, the evaluation of UL-P2 is inadequate because the RDEIR has no
stated or implied potential impact(s) arising from implementation which it can address.
Below is a list of all a policies we were able to locate; potentially, there are policies which lack implementation measures which we did not identify remaining in the General Plan.
Policies lacking implementation measures:

GP-P10, UI.-P2, UL.-P9, UL-P11, UL-P15, UL-P17, UL-P18, UL-P19, UL-P20, UL-P21, UL-P21, RL-P1, RL-P2, RI-P3, RL-P4, RL-P6, RL-P7, AG-P2, AG-P7, AG-P9, AG-P11, AG-P12, AG-P13, AG-P14, AG-Px, AG-Pxx, FR-P8, FR-P9, FR-PX, FR-PX2, FR-P11, FR-P14, FR-PX3, FR-P16, FR-P19, IS-PX, IS-P20, IS-P21, C-P4, C-P5, C-P8, C-PX, C-P9, C-P10, C-P13, C-P17, CP-19, C-P27, C-P28, C-P30, C-P32, C-P35, C-P36, C-P?, C-P38, C-P39, C-P40, C-P41, C-P42, C-P44, C-P45, C-P47, C-PX8, ED-P3, ED-P7, ED-P8, ED-P9, ED-P10, ED-PI1, ED-P18, ED-PSX, BR-P4, BR-PG, BR-P9, SR-PX, SR-PI, SR-PXX, WR-P1, WR-P2, WR-P4, WR-P5, WR-P6, WR-XX, WR-Px1, WR-P8, WR-P10, WR-P11,WR-P12, WR-Px7, WR-P18, WR-P20, WR-P25, WR-P27, WR-P28, WR-P29, WR-P29x, WR-P31, WR-P32, WR-P33, WR-P33, WR-P34, WR-P40, CO-P1x, CO-P1xx, CO-P4, CO-P7, CO-Px4, N-P1, N-P4, S-P1, S-P2, S-PX7, S-P6, S-P7, S-P8, S-PX1, S-P11, S-PX2, S-PX3, S-PX4, S-P13, S-P25, S-P26, S-P30, E-P2, E-P7, E-P9, E-P9x, E-P10, F-P13, E-P14, E-P15, E-PX2, E-PX3, AQ-P1, AQ-P2, AQ-P4, AQ-P5, AQ-P6, AQ-P7, AQ-P8, AQ-Px, AQ-P11, AQ-P12, AQ-P13, AQ-P15, H-P3, H-P6, H-P7, H-P10, H-P12, H-P13, H-P29, H-P30, H-P31.

VIIL Concerns regarding the lack of an Implementation Action Plan
Per Government Code Soction 65564, "Every local open-space plan shall contain an action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative bocy intends to pursue in implementing its open-space pilan.'
The County has yet to produce an Implementation Action Plan. The general plan includes a placcholder for such a plan, but the failure to circulate the implomentation action plan for public review renders the general plan update process inadequate. The public must be given the opportunity to evaluate the implementation action plan in light of the GPU and to provide comments on the implementation action C4-20 plan. Until the implementation action plan is complete and provided for public review, the County cannot approve the GPU.

A thorough implementation action plan includes the following:
The specifics of the mitigation measure and how it will be designaled and implemented. Identify measurable performance standards by which the success of the mitigation can be determined.
Provide for contingent mitigation if monitoring reveals that the success standards are not
satisfied.
Identify the agency, organization or individual responsible for implementing the measure. Identify the specific locations of the mitigation measure.

IX. Miscellaneous Issues

A significant number of items in this RDEIR state certain policics, goals, implementation measures, etc., are to be given "priority" consideration, or are a "priority" of the plan. However, per the ruling of Sierra Club v. Bd. Of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704, all sections, policies, goals, etc., of a plan must stand C4-21
on equal footing and cannot be prioritized over or subverted by any other item of the plan. This is not to say that the word "priority" is impermissible as a whole, but is inappropriate in places which attempt to give priority to a policy, goal, or proposed action at the expense of another. A. suggestion would be to simply alter the word "priority" to a similar descriptor, such as the word "focus".

A numbor of references are made to the Ridgewood Village Draft EIR, notably on page 3.4-18; it is our understanding that this document cannot be relied on in the RDEIR in C4-22
any manner because the EIR for that project was never acceptod or certified by the County of Humboldt.

RDEIR Chapter 4, Evaluation of Plan Alternatives, does not address General Plan Alternative C. The beginning of Chapter 4 discusses the RDEIR's reasoning for precluding Alternative C; however, in light of CEQA requirements regarding discussion C4-23
of plan alternatives, this seems to be a deficiency.

Response to Comment C4-1: Illegal cannabis cultivation is addressed in the environmental baseline sections of Chapter 3.2, Agricultural and Timber Resources, Chapter 3.3 Utilities and Services Systems, and Chapter 3.12, Air Quality of the RDEIR. Regulated commercial cannabis production is described in the environmental baseline discussion of Chapter 3.2, Agricultural and Timber Resources.

As quoted in this comment, this "Program EIR is a first-tier environmental document that
assesses and documents the broad environmental impacts that can be expected to
occur from the adoption and implementation of the General Plan Update." Other than
Policy UL-P21, Cannabis Cultivation, and Implementation Measure UL-IM15, Cannabis Cultivation and Dispensary Ordinance, there are no other policies, standards, or implementation measures in the GPU that relate to cannabis cultivation, processing, or manufacturing. The significance of the production and sale of medicinal and illicit cannabis to Humboldt County's economy is discussed in the Economic Development Element. In addition, Housing Element Policy H-P30, Conservation of Affordable Housing Damaged or Displaced by Indoor Marijuana Grows, directs the County to earmark
revenue from any future excessive energy tax toward programs for conservation of affordable housing. However, the Housing Element is included in the GPU for reference purposes, but is not considered in the RDEIR as it was evaluated in a separate environmental document.

UL-P21 and UL-IM15 were recommended by the Planning Commission in 2012, prior to changes in state law relating to commercial medical or recreational cannabis, and specify that medical cannabis cultivation shall be regulated by ordinance that protects
the health, safety and welfare and that ensures the cultivation and dispensing sites are
compatible with neighboring uses. In 2016, Humboldt County approved the
Commercial Medical Marijuana Land Use Ordinance, largely implementing UL-P21 and
UL-IM15, referenced on Page 3.2-8, of Chapter 3.2, Agricultural and Timber Resources.
The environmental impacts of the Commercial Medical Marijuana Land Use Ordinance
were analyzed in the Mitigated Negative Declaration for Medical Marijuana Land Use Ordinance - Phase IV - Commercial Cultivation of Cannabis for Medical Use (SCH
Number: 2015102005).

Section 3.0, Baseline Environmental Conditions Assumed in the RDEIR, states that
"comprehensive and reliable data regarding baseline conditions related to the pervasive and unregulated development of illicit cannabis cultivation in Humboldt

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 106

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

County is still not available. Although this RDEIR attempts to summarize some of the data
that is available in Chapter 3.2 - Agriculture and Timber Resources, future regulation of cannabis cultivation, processing, manufacturing, or distribution is not within the scope of the draft GPU and potential impacts of such a regulatory program are not analyzed in this RDEIR." The County of Humboldt is in is the process of developing a separate
Environmental Impact Report for ordinances regulating commercial cannabis industry
development in accordance with rapidly evolving state and federal law." Humboldt County has initiated a project to amend the Humboldt County Code regulating cannabis land use activities. An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is currently being prepared by Humboldt County to evaluate the environmental effects of proposed
changes to the County's Commercial Cannabis Land Use Ordinances (SCH Number:
2017042022).

The comment also states that the RDEIR does not analyze and discuss the economic
and equitable impacts of the net loss of industrial zoned lands for commercial and industrial uses other than for the cannabis industry. According to CEQA Guidelines Section 15382, "(a)n economic or social change by itself shall not be considered a significant effect on the environment. A social or economic change related to a physical change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is significant."

For the comment relating to the environmental impacts of "illegal cannabis cultivation"
and "regulated commercial cannabis production," the RDEIR is intended to disclose
the possible environmental impacts from approving the policies, standards, and implementation measures in the General Plan Update and the population growth that
is projected to occur during the General Plan Update planning period. This comment
does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA. Regarding economic and equitable impacts of the net loss of industrial zoned lands for commercial and industrial uses other than for
the cannabis industry, the comment does not identify physical change that could have
an effect on the environment.

Comment C4-2: This comment states that the Notice of Preparation (NOP) was circulated in 2007, and is now out of date particularly for cannabis impacts. The comment also states that the NOP was circulated prior to the recommendations of the
Planning Commission in 2012 and the tentative approval by the Board of Supervisors of the draft General Plan Update in 2016, which could create confusion for the public.

Response to Comment C4-2: See response to comment C2-2 for a discussion of how the
RDEIR addresses the environmental setting information contained in the RDEIR and the
information that has been updated since release of the Notice of Preparation on January 22, 2007, and the Draft Environmental Impact Report, April 2, 2012.
Regarding the date of the NOP and potential confusion regarding the project that is under review, RDEIR Section 1.3.1, Scoping the Issues To Be Discussed in the EIR,
describes the NOP and scoping process, the review of the General Plan Update by the Planning Commission from 2007 to 2012, and the review of the General Plan Update by the Board of Supervisors from 2012 through 2017 and concludes with the statement that

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 107

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

"(t)he Board of Supervisors held 66 public hearings on the Project and Plan alternatives
from June, 2012 through March, 2016, to take straw votes and refine the Planning
Commission Approved Draft GPU, resulting in the Board of Supervisors 2016 Markup
Draft which is the Project being considered in this EIR." RDEIR Section 1.3.2, Prepare and
Distribute Revised Draft Program EIR, states that the RDEIR was prepared "to address the changes to the Project made by the Board of Supervisors since June, 2012, and to address the comments made on the 2012 Draft EIR for the Planning Commission
Approved Draft" and that the RDEIR "also incorporates significant new information which became available after 2012." Chapter 2, Project Description, clearly indicates
in the introduction that the RDEIR analyzes the Board of Supervisors Markup Draft from
October 19, 2015, and that the Board of Supervisors made modifications, additions, and deletions to that draft plan recommended by the Planning Commission.
Comment C4-3: This comment expresses dissatisfaction with proposed Mitigation
Measure 3.11.3.2 which proposes new language for Standard BR-S11. Wetlands Defined. The comment claims the proposed new language is unnecessary and will cause confusion.

Response to Comment C4-3: See Response to Comment C3-1 above.
Comment C4-4: This comment references California Public Resources Code Section
21083(b) and 21083 (b) (3), which state that "(t)he guidelines shall specifically include criteria for public agencies to follow in determining whether or not a proposed project may have a "significant effect on the environment...and... shall require a finding that a project may have a "significant effect on the environment" if "(t)he environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly." The comment further states that the RDEIR does not analyze the social and economic impacts of the majority of GPU policies, goals, and implementation measures.
Response to Comment C4-4: The RDEIR evaluates the environmental impacts expected to occur from adoption and implementation of the General Plan Update. Analysis of
the social and economic impacts of the GPU is not required by CEQA. The comment does not identify environmental effects of the GPU that will cause substantial adverse
effects on human beings. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C4-5: This comment suggests that the majority of the policies, goals and implementation measures of the Economic Development Element stand to have
effects on the environment and human residents.

Response to Comment C4-5: The RDEIR project description describes the Economic Development Element as one of six optional elements included in the GPU that outlines the County's economic development strategy and provides relevant supporting policies, and generally describes the policies at the top of Page 2-20. Policies within the
Economic Development Element generally promote and support a stable, and growing
local economy, seek to acquire funding for infrastructure and workforce training, and
to plan for demographic changes and an appropriate supply of industrial and
commercial land. The RDEIR analyzes reasonably foreseeable environmental effects

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 108

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

that are related to the Economic Development Element in terms of population and employment growth during the planning period, planned land uses, and infrastructure. The RDEIR also analyzes how relevant General Plan Update policies would lessen potential environmental effects of the GPU. Chapter 3.7, Hazards and Hazardous Materials references Policy ED-P16, Brownfields, in Impact 3.7.4.1: Hazardous Materials,
and how it would direct the County to pursue and distribute funding and technical assistance to assess, clean up, and reuse Brownfields as well as streamline the regulatory review for proposed development in commercial and industrial zoned Brownfields. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C4-6: This comment states that a number of GPU policies would place regulatory constraints on both private and public lands and the RDEIR fails to address how these regulatory constraints may or may not impact the environment, the
economy, or the people of Humboldt County. The comment also refers to Project Description Section 2.5, Proposed Plan Estimated Maximum Feasible Development
Potential, and states that the GPU "would "allow for a significantly larger number of
new dwelling units than the RDEIR anticipates and accounts for."
Response to Comment C4-6: Table 2.5-1, General Plan Update Acreage of Land Use Designations, Estimated Maximum Feasible Housing Development Potential and
Projected Development 2016 - 2040, shows the acreage of each land use designation
within the unincorporated area and excludes areas subject to physical constraints (100- year flood zones, Alquist-Priolo earthquake fault zones, wetlands, streamside management areas, areas with slopes greater than 30 percent, and areas with known history of landslide activity) to identify total vacant developable acres. The discussion in Section 2.5 states that these areas could theoretically provide for as many as 38,972
additional dwelling units in the unincorporated area of the County if developed at the
full density allowed for each land use designation as proposed in the GPU.

The discussion in Section 3.0-1, Growth Assumptions under the General Plan associated with the Planning Area & Period, states that, "(t)he estimated maximum feasible housing development potential of the General Plan Update land uses is far greater (38.972 housing units) than can reasonably be expected to be developed within the planning period of the General Plan (2016-2040)." "(T)he most recent population projections for Humboldt County from (California Dept. of Finance) reveal that Humboldt County's population is projected to grow fairly slowly in the coming years, and reach a peak population in 2028 of 141,441 persons, and then it is projected to start to decline to 138,307 persons in 2040, at the end of the planning period. The project
Description states that "if the unincorporated share of total county housing remains
constant at approximately 53 percent with the same vacancy rate, a projected 1,721 new dwelling units will be needed to be to support the peak population level in the unincorporated area of the County," according to the California Dept. of Finance,
2014.

The Project Description further states that "This Revised Draft Environment Impact Report evaluates the impacts associated with the growth expected during the planning horizon lasting until 2040. The peak impacts will be realized in the year 2028 when

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 109

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

population reaches 141,441. The years between 2028-2040 will see a decline in the population. The EIR uses the population in 2028 as the point at which the maximum level of impacts will be realized. This RDEIR does not analyze buildout of all allocated land use
within the county because based upon foreseeable population trends buildout of all
land uses is highly speculative and is not projected to occur within the next 100 years."
The RDEIR analyzes the environmental effects of reasonably foreseeable development
and does not analyze speculative impacts that could occur as a result of theoretical buildout if all land were developed at the full density allowed for each land use designation as proposed in the GPU. Analysis of the theoretical buildout in the EIR could lead to new mitigation measures such as impact fees and additional regulatory requirements on new development needed to address the buildout that would occur
beyond the timeframe of the GPU.

Regarding the comment that the RDEIR fails to address how these regulatory constraints may or may not impact the environment, the economy, or the people of Humboldt County, the EIR analyzes the regulatory constraints of the GPU on the environment. Analysis of social and economic impacts is not required by CEQA. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C4-7: This comment states that Scenic Resources policies, especially relating to scenic vistas, create regulatory constraints and that there is no analysis of this concept, which could result in potential social and economic impacts. This comment excerpts a discussion of GPU policies from the Analysis of Relevant General Plan Update Policies from Impact 3.16.3.1: Adverse effect on Scenic Vistas and Scenic Resources.
Response to Comment C4-7: The analysis of adverse effect on Scenic Vistas and Scenic Resources concludes that the impact of the GPU, even after the implementation of a
mitigation measure, is significant and unavoidable. This comment suggests the EIR should consider economic and social impacts of the GPU, which is not a requirement of CEQA. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C4-8: The comment objects to the lack of justification for scenic resource protection measures in the GPU.
Response to Comment C4-8: This comment suggests the EIR should consider economic and social impacts of the GPU, which is not a requirement of CEQA. The comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no
further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C4-9: This comment suggests that the analysis of water and wastewater capacity omits commercial and industrial uses and continues a trend of minimizing concern for industrial and commercial uses.
Response to Comment C4-9: The analysis of available service connections for water and wastewater systems in Chapter 3.3 Utilities and Services Systems is based on the Community Infrastructure & Services Technical Report, July 2008, and information and capacity updates provided by services providers and Local Agency Formation

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 110

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Commission Municipal Service Reviews. The presentation of water and wastewater
capacity if based on the Community Infrastructure & Services Technical Report format, which generally used average usage rates per connection and peak usage rates per connection source capacity, storage capacity, and distribution system standards are set forth in the Waterworks Standards regulations, outlined in the California Code of
Regulations and the permit requirements from the Regional Water Quality Control
Board - or an average usage per connection regardless of land use type. Available capacity could be used by new residential, commercial, or industrial development. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR.
Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C4-10: This comment states that the GPU would allow for a significantly larger number of new dwelling units than the RDEIR analyzes. This comment also states that
the 1,721 housing units that are needed to accommodate projected population
growth with the unincorporated have already been constructed without the County's knowledge, or without permits.
Response to Comment C4-10: See response to comment C4-6 above for a discussion of
the environmental effects of reasonably foreseeable development versus speculative impacts that could occur as a result of theoretical buildout if all land were developed at the full density allowed for each land use designation as proposed in the GPU. See response to comment C2-4 above for a discussion of illegal building and illegal subdivisions. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in
the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C4-11: This comment notes that Table 3.7-5, Land Planned for Industrial Uses, on Page 3.7-21 shows land planned for industrial uses within inland Community Planning Areas and not with Coastal Zone Areas. The comment further states that Section 3.4, Public Services, "claims that there is sufficient land zoned for commercial and industrial
uses in the County, but also states that the majority of that land is located in and around Humboldt Bay and/or the coastal zone." The comment suggests that the RDEIR is inconsistent because "does not otherwise address any of the areas located in the coastal zone, instead deferring discussion of those areas to the Local Coastal Plan, yet opts to include them in its inventory of industrial and commercial land."
Response to Comment C4-11: The discussion above Table 3.7-5 states that "Including the coastal zone area, which is not the subject of this EIR, there are over 3,370 acres of
land planning for industrial purposes. Approximately 48 percent of that land is within the coastal zone, almost all of which is within the Humboldt Bay Area coastal planning
area."

References to "commercial and industrial" in Section 3.4, Public Services, are contained
in Impact 3.4.3.2. Fire Protection, and are used to describe the distribution of new
development across the unincorporated area to accommodate project peak
population and commercial/industrial employment growth. This analysis does not
suggest that "that there is sufficient land zoned for commercial and industrial uses" as
suggested in the comment, rather this analysis reports that "3.1 million square feet of commercial and industrial building (will be needed) to accommodate projected new

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 111

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

employment by 2040. Although new construction would be distributed across the
unincorporated area, 89 percent of housing units and 92 percent of commercial and industrial square footage are projected to be developed within the more urbanized community plan and coastal zone areas. Almost 60 percent of new housing units are
projected to be located within the communities around the Humboldt Bay, including
the residential areas of Cutten, Ridgewood, and McKinleyville. Approximately 50
percent of commercial and industrial square footage is projected to be located within the communities around the Humboldt Bay, two-thirds of which would occur in the
industrial areas along the Samoa Peninsula and Fields Landing." (Page 3.4-17)
Although the comment does not identify a new impact or the need for a new mitigation measure, it would be appropriate to modify Table 3.7-5, Land Planned for Industrial Uses in the EIR, to include industrial land within the Coastal Zone, given that
the narrative discloses the proportion of industrial land within the Coastal Zone. The following edits are made to Table 3.7-5. Land Planned for Industrial Uses, Impact 3.7.4.1: Hazardous Materials, on Pages 3.7-21 and 3.7-22 to include industrial land in the Coastal

Comment C4-12: This comment suggests that the RDEIR is inconsistent because
Mitigation 3.10.3.4.a in Impact 3.10.3.4: Housing within a 100-year Flood Hazard Area or Expose People or Structures to Flooding from Levee or Dam Failure, Tsunami, or Mudflow
addresses the Local Coastal Program.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 112

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C4-12: The analysis in Impact 3.10.3.4 states that "(t)sunami inundation areas lie almost exclusively within the Coastal Zone, where they are addressed as part of the Hazards section of the certified Local Coastal Program and the Coastal Act." A review of the Humboldt County Web GIS shows that tsunami evacuation areas extend outside the Coastal Zone in a number of areas and as mapping of the 100-year tsunami run-up elevation in concert with sea level rise mapping are revised, Mitigation 3.10.3.4.a may affect more non-Coastal Zone areas. This comment does not identify additional impacts or the need for additional mitigation
measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Comment C4-13: This comment suggests that the focus of the RDEIR on the "estimated need for development as compared to the maximum possible level of build-out density" in Chapter 5. Other CEQA Considerations, 5.2 Cumulative Impacts, "vastly underestimates the potentially massive impacts on public services that the General Plan
may stand to produce."
Response to Comment C4-13: Response to comment C4-6 describes how the RDEIR analyzes the environmental effects of reasonably foreseeable development and does not analyze speculative impacts that could occur as a result of theoretical buildout if all land were developed at the full density allowed for each land use designation as
proposed in the GPU. The CEQA Guidelines Section 15130(b) states that "(t)he discussion of cumulative impacts shall reflect the severity of the impacts and their
likelihood of occurrence." Section 5.2 Cumulative Impacts relies on projected population growth countywide by the State of California, Department of Finance, and the cumulative environmental effects which may reasonably be expected to occur during the 24-year planning period of the GPU, 2016-2040. As stated in the response to
comment C4-6 above, this RDEIR does not analyze buildout of all allocated land use
within the county because based upon foreseeable population trends buildout of all land uses is highly speculative and is not projected to occur within the timeframe of the
GPU.

Comment C4-14: This comment states that there are inconsistencies between the
narrative discussion of water and wastewater providers in Chapter 3.3 Utilities and
Services Systems and the tables that summarize available water and wastewater
connections. The example provided by the commenter states that "RDEIR Table 3.3-1 shows that the Loleta Community Services District has 258 water connections, and that
there an additional 56 water connections available.

The comment further states that "Table 3.3-2 shows that the Garberville CSD has 353
existing wastewater connections and that there are an additional 180 connections
available. However, the RDEIR does not explicitly state that there are additional
connections available for Garberville. The inconsistency between the numbers presented in Table 3.3-1 and Table 3.3-2 and as presented in corresponding narrative text... is confusing."
The comment further lists twelve water and wastewater service providers and states
that the RDEIR text and tables contain issues with consistency.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 113

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C4-14: narrative text in the RDEIR found on page 3.3-15, "Loleta Community Services District," cites a 2008 LAFCo report which states that "The [Loleta Community Services] District believes that they can supply an additional 60-70 (40 to 50 based on Building Permit data as of2016) homes."

The RDEIR is "a substantial revision of the Draft EIR for the County of Humboldt GPU that was originally circulated for public comment between April 2, 2012 and June 15, 2012" (Section 1.1, Purpose of the EIR). •Table 3.3-8, Projected Housing Units (2028) by Water Service Provider, is a substantial revision of the Draft EIR Table 3.3-9, Allowable Development by Water Service Provider. For the Loleta CSD, there were an estimated 239 existing water service connections in 2012 and an estimated 75 available water
service connections. Between 2012 and 2016, there were 19 approved building permits
with the boundaries of the Loleta CSD. As a result, the estimated existing water service
connections was increased from 239 to 258 and available connects was reduced from
75 to 56.

The narrative for the Loleta CSD was updated based on the best available information
to add a statement from the LAFCo Municipal Service Review regarding the District's ability to supply water to additional developments. The methodology described in this paragraph was used to update the narrative descriptions of water and wastewater service providers as well as the estimated existing water and wastewater service connections and estimated available water and wastewater service connections for
each service provider.

In response to the Garberville SD comment, the RDEIR states on Page 3.3-39: "Garberville SD. Approximately three housing units are projected to be developed within Garberville by 2028, which is fraction of the 180 additional connections that are
estimated to be available." There does not appear to be any inconsistency between the text and the tables in this instance.

In response to the comment that text and tables contain issues with consistency in discussion of twelve other CSD'S, the comment does not identify any inconsistencies.
This comment does not identify additional impacts or the need for additional mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

This comment does not identify additional impacts or the need for additional mitigation
measures in the RDEIR.

Comment C4-16: This comment states that Table 3.7-5, Land Planned for Industrial Uses,
lists land planned for industrial uses by community planning areas, but only reflects the inland areas of the county. The comment also states that total industrial acreages in
Table 3.7-5 are not consistent with Table 2.5-1, General Plan Update Acreage of Land Use Designations, Estimated Maximum Feasible Housing Development Potential and Projected Development 2016 - 2040.
Response to Comment C4-16: See response to comment C4-11 for the response to concerns regarding Table 3.7-5, Land Planned for Industrial Uses.
For the comment regarding a potential inconsistency between Table 3.7-5, Land Planned for Industrial Use, and Table 2.5-1, General Plan Update Acreage of Land Use
Designations, Estimated Maximum Feasible Housing Development Potential and Projected Development 2016 - 2040, Table 3.7-5 is intended to only show land planned for industrial purposes within Community Planning Areas whereas Table 2.5-1 shows all
industrial land. It should be noted that as a result of comment C4-11, Table 3.7-5 is
revised to include industrial land in the coastal zone. This comment does not identify
additional impacts or the need for additional mitigation measures in the RDEIR.
Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 115

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Comment C4-17: This comment identifies two incorrect references to Table 3.7-4 on pages 3.7-21 and 3.7-22. The incorrect references contain the correct table name, Land Planned for Industrial Uses, but the wrong table number.
Response to Comment C4-17: The following edits are to be made to the first sentence of the last paragraph on page 3.7-21 and to the first sentence of the last paragraph on 3.7-22 in the discussion of Impact 3.7.4.1: Hazardous Materials:
"Table 3.7-54 below displays how much land is planned for industrial uses in
Humboldt County. Including the coastal zone area, which is not the subject
of this EIR, there are over 3,370 acres of land planning for industrial purposes."
"Table 3.7-54, Land Planned for Industrial Uses, identifies the acres within each
community planning area that are planned for industrial uses."
Comment C4-18: This comment states that "that some of the "mitigation measures" listed throughout this Program EIR do not meet the criteria for mitigation as laid out in CEQA." The comment further states that "(t)here is absolutely no objection to presenting the "mitigation" items in question which are currently identified as mitigation measures, but would more appropriately be identified as new or modified goals, policies, standards or implementation measures, to the Board of Supervisors for
consideration and re-circulation; however, they should not be identified as mitigation" and that "In other instances, impacts are lacking mitigation measures where they require one. This often results from either relying on the efforts of other agencies or underestimating the level of significance to which an impact rises."
Response to Comment C4-18: The proposed project is the adoption and implementation of the GPU, a comprehensive amendment to the County General Plan. The Governor's Office of Planning and Research General Plan Guideline, Chapter 3,
Preparing and Amending the General Plan, state that "CEQA requires that general
plan policies and the implementation program reflect the mitigation measures identified in the plan's EIR. In addition, the jurisdiction must adopt a mitigation monitoring or reporting program to ensure that mitigation measures are implemented (Public Resources Code §21081.6(b))." In response to this requirement, mitigation measures contained with the RDEIR are structured as new or modified General Plan
policies, standards, or implementation measures so that they can be integrated into the General Plan and therefore properly reflecting the GPU EIR.

CEQA Guidelines Section 15097 states that "(w)here the project at issue is the adoption of a general plan, specific plan, community plan or other plan-level document (zoning, ordinance, regulation, policy), the monitoring plan shall apply to policies and any other portion of the plan that is a mitigation measure or adopted alternative. The monitoring plan may consist of policies included in plan-level documents. The annual report on general plan status required pursuant to the Government Code is one example of a reporting program for adoption of a city or county general plan." The GPU implementation action plan that is to be prepared as part of the GPU adoption package, with the final EIR, will contain the GPU goals, policies, standards, and implementation measures and will identify the timeline for implementation, responsible party, and the cost of implementation (if the responsible party is a County department).

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 116

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

The mitigation monitoring and reporting program for the RDERI will be identical to the portions of the implementation action plan, that address policies, standards and implementation programs that are integrated into the General Plan by action of the
Board of Supervisors.

Regarding the comment that the listed Impacts lack mitigation measures, where RDEIR impact analyses lack mitigation measures, either: (1) the impact was determined to be less than significant, or (2) the impact was determined to be significant and that no
feasible mitigation measures were identified, beyond the policy, standards, and implementation measures of the GPU. The following table lists each of the Impact items Identified as lacking mitigation measures and the corresponding conclusion contained in the RDEIR and proposed mitigations measures, if any. if

Impact Items Identified as Lacking Mitigation Measures

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Comment C4-19: This comment states that a number of policies lack implementation measures and that the commenter is concerned that policies "which may have future impacts but lack implementation measures are difficult to evaluate from an EIR
standpoint as there is no indication of what the impacts of carrying out that stated policy goal may be." Also included with the comment is a list of policies that the
commenter has determined lack implementation measures.
Response to Comment C4-19: The RDEIR assesses and documents the broad
environmental impacts that can be expected to occur from the adoption and implementation of the General Plan Update during the planning period to 2040, as more fully explained in Chapter 2 Project Description. Each section of Chapter 3, Environmental Setting and Impacts, further describes the potential impacts of the GPU and how GPU policies, standards, and implementation measures may lessen potential impacts. Where the lack of a policy, standard, or implementation measure would result in a significant environmental effect, a mitigation measure is proposed that that specifies an appropriate policy, standard, or implementation measure. Lack of an implementation measure in and of itself is not a significant environmental effect.

The documents that will accompany the adoption of the GPU will include an Implementation Action Plan, which is identified as Appendix A to the GPU. The Implementation Action Plan will identify how each policies and standard will be implemented and identify the priority, timing, resources needed, and cost of each
implementation. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation
measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C4-20: This comment identifies that the Draft GPU lacks an Implementation
Action Plan.

Response to Comment C4-20: See response to comment C4-19 above which describes the content and timing of the GPU and the Implementation Action Plan. This comment
does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR and as a result,
no further response is required under CEQA,
Comment C4-21: This comment states that certain GPU policies, goals, implementation measures, etc., are to be given "priority" consideration, or are a "priority" of the plan.
References to priorities in the RDEIR relate to the wording of specific goals, policies, or implementation measures in the GPU.
Response to Comment C4-21: This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.
Comment C4-22: This comment states that a number a of references are made to the
Ridgewood Village Draft EIR, which cannot be relied upon because it was not certified.
Response to Comment C4-22: The RDEIR does not rely on the Ridgewood Village Draft EIR for mitigation, only to assist in characterizing the types of impacts that may result from the construction of a fire station. The Ridgewood Village Draft EIR identified

potentially significant environmental effects in a number of areas which are listed on
Page 3.4-18 of the RDEIR. The RDEIR describes how the GPU policies, standards, and
implementation measures could lessen the potential impacts of a fire station, if one
were to be constructed.

Comment C4-23: This comment states that Chapter 4, Evaluation of Alternatives, does not address GPU Plan Alternative C, "which seems to be a deficiency."
Response to Comment C4-23: Page 4-4 of the RDEIR explains why Alternative C was not
analyzed as a CEQA alternative:
"(Alternative C) is rejected from further consideration in this EIR because it increases environmental impacts compared to the Project, and because CEQA only requires evaluation of alternatives in the EIR that would reduce or eliminate environmental
impacts of the Project."
This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further response is required under CEQA.

While the 60 acre minimum parcel for AE lands is universally supported by Humboldt agriculture, most all of the agricultural conversions, through land use designation changes in the GPU, are located in these more infand agricultural districts.
The new "Residential Agriculture" designation, like its predecessors "Agricultural Rural" and "*Agriculture Suburban" is a residential designation. These designations are intended to provide first for residential development and do not recognize the mique value and productivity of prime agricultucal soils. Retaining those soils in units large enough to sustainably support a wide range of agriculttural crops, is not the purpose of these designations.

Responses to Letter C6 - Food Fiber and Flowers
Comment C6-1: The commenter describes the agriculture industry in the County and concludes that the GPU does not recognize the highly productive agricultural areas for their unique and important agricultural contributions to the County. He states the new GPU land use designations are contributing to the conversion of these areas away from productive agricultural use. Specifically, the Residential Agriculture designation does not "recognize the unique value and productivity of prime agricultural soils. Retaining these soils in units large enough to sustainably a wide range of agricultural crops, is not the purpose of these designations."
Response to Comment C6-1: The comment expresses objection to the application of the RA designation to areas with prime agricultural soils. This comment does not
address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR. Therefore, no further
response is required under CEQA.

Comment C6-2: The commenter expresses concern that the allowance of two residential units by right within a three-acre curtilage on small parcels with prime soils may preclude use of smaller parcels for agriculture. The commenter goes on to request an implementation measure be added to the GPU to inventory prime agricultural soil parcels "within the agricultural districts listed above and any other unique locations
throughout the County."
Response to Comment C6-2:

The comment requests an implementation measure be added to the GPU. This comment does not address specific impacts or mitigation measures in the RDEIR and thus, no further response is required under CEQA. The establishment of an inventory of
parcels that contain prime agricultural soils is a proposal related to the General Plan itself rather than the GPU EIR, and could be considered as an implementation measure
to be added to the Plan.

Re: Green Diamond Resource Company comments; Revised Draft EIR and the Appendices for the
Humboldt County General Plan Update.

Deer Mr. Richardson,

With 1his letter Green Diamond Resource Company, a Washington corporation ("GDRCo"),
respectfully submits comments regarding the Humboldt County General Plan Update Revised Draft EIR (RDEIR) and the Appendices. GDRCo's comments are specifle to the project analyzed in the RDEIR,
described on page 2-1 of the RDEIR in Chapter 2. Project Description, as follows:
"The project onalyzed in this recirculoted and revised draft Environmental Impact Report (RDEIR) Is the proposed Humboldt County General Plon (referred to as the proposed General Plan Updota (GPU)). The text reflects the Boord of Supervisors Morkup Droft from October 19, 2015. The proposed General Plon Includes gools, palicies, standards, implementation measures, and land
use mops as recommended by the Planning Cammission. This draft, revlewed by the Plonning
Comnmission, was evaluoted in the Aprll 2, 2012 Draft Environmental Impact Report, During
public hearings between June, 2012 and March, 2015, the Boord of Supervisors has made
modifications, additions, and deletions to that droft. The RDEIR Is focused on environmentol
effects which may reasonably be expected to occur during the 24-yeor planning period of the
GPU, 2016-2040, as detailed In subchopters 2.1 und 2.5 below."

Furthermore, as discussed in detail below, GDRCo's comments are submilted based upon the opinion and position that the RDEIR, the Natural Resources and Hazards Report (Sept. 2002 draft] (Appendix D to the RDEIR), and the Forest Resources Report (Oct. 2003 draft) (Appendix F to the RDEIR)
all incorrectly characterize the process of recognizing and/or determining the scope and extent of "legal
parcels" and/or adjusting parcel boundarles (without creating "new" parcels) under the California
Subdivision Map Act (California Government Code 59 66410, et seq.) as acts of "conversion" and/or
"subdivision" of timberlands. Specifically, the RDEIR and cited Reports conclude, without support or C7-1
justification, that the Determination of Status process, the Certificates of Compliance process, the recognition of Patent Parcels, and Lot Line Adjustments under the Subdivision Map Act constitute a conversion and/or subdivision of timberlands for purposes of assessing environmental impacts. As
discussed in detail in Attachment A 10 these Comments and the legal opinion appended as Attachment
8, these conclusions and the general commentary on the subject included in the RDEIR are not
supported by substantial evidence, materially contradict the conclusions reached in studies
commissioned and cited as support for the RDEIR, and misstate the findings reached by Callfornia
resource agencles when revlewing the issue.

Lastly, GDRCo has submitted requests for land use designation changes throughout the General Plan Update process. In reviewing the Map Book (Appendix F to the RDEIR Planning Commission Draft) and the associated County GIS land use maps, many of these land use designation changes have been incorporated but some discrepancies remain, and those are identified in these Comments. Specifically, Attachment Cto these Comments summarizes the discrepancies identified and provides what GDRCo C7-2
believes to constitute the correct land use designation changes for each affected parcel based upon the Board of Supervisors' Draft General Plan Update and previous work during the Update process.

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Attachment A

GDRCO
Comment Page Comment
#1 3.2-11 Beginning with the second paragraph on page 3.2-11, the RDEIR makes an unsubstantiated statement regarding timberland "conversion". Specifically, the RDEIR characterizes the Determination of Status and Certificate of Compliance process established for recognizing legal parcels of land under the California Subdivision Map Act (California Government Code 55 66410, et seq.) (the "Subdivision Map Act") ta constitute acts of "converting" and/or "subdlviding" timberlands. This is incorrect and a
misstatement of fact. The Incorrect characterization of what constitutes "timberland conversion" is repeated in multiple locations in the RDEIR and portions of the RDEIR materially misstate the reports cited in support of the discussion regarding Forest and Agricultural resources.

Although GDRCo acknowledges that timberland conversion can certainly occur as part of new subdivisions and associated zoning reclassifications and General Plan amendments, timberland conversion does not occur through the Certificate of Compliance process. The Certificate of Compliance process is simply the procedure to determine the baseline parcel status of units of land, subject to conveyance in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act, nothing more. Recognition of a legal parcel under the Subdivision Map Act is C7-3 not a "subdivision", to the contrary it is recognition of a legal unit of land which pre- existed adoption of the Act (adopted and made effective on March 1, 197S) and, for purposes of RDEIR evaluation, constitute a baseline condition. Issuance of a Certificate of Compliance in no way affects the zoning assigned to the recognized parcel or the permitted principal and conditional uses attendant to that zone classification, Any substantive change in the principal and conditionally permitted uses of the parcel requires a discretionary zoning reclassification and accompanying General Plan
amendment.

Furthermore, and of substantlal significance, the conversion of timberland to a use other
than growing timber requires, prlor to conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit
approved by the Callfornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE") or, If elígible, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption (likely affecting only a portion of a parcel) accepted by CAL FIRE.
The general commentary included in the RDEIR equating issuance of Certificates of Compliance and recognition of legal parcels/units of land under the Map Act with
"timberland conversion" should be revised and/or removed as it does not accurately depict what a Certificate of Compliance is and the process does not directly result in the conversion of agricultural land or timberland. As discussed in greater detail below, these presumptions included in the RDEIR are not supported by substantial evidence or the studles cited in support of the conclusions.

#2 3,2-11 Beginning with the third paragraph on page 3.2-11, the RDEIR contains an incorrect
statement that a Certificate of Compliance results In a change in "land use". Again, C7-4

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 132

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

changes in land use may only be achleved through either General Plan Amendment and accompanying zoning change or through the General Plan Update process. The language regarding Certificates of Compliance should be removed as it does not accurately depict the circumstances under which a change in land use may occur. As the County 1 well aware, the Certificate of Compliance process on agricultural lands and timberlands C7-4
routinely yields the identification of parcels containing substantial acreage volume, oftentimes in Increments equal to the entirety of the original United States Patent. There is no basis to conclude the parcel recognition, in and of itself, constitutes a "conversion" of pre-existing land uses and the County has not identifled substantial evidence to reach this conclusion.

3.2-11 Beginning with the fourth paragraph on page 3.2-11, the RDEIR again makes a reference
to conversion of agricultural lands and timberlands.

The conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, a Timberlend Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if ellgible, a Less C7-5
Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE.
To the extent that the statement provided in the RDEIR relles upon the incorrect assumption that the Certificate of Compliance process results in conversion of agricultural lands and timberland it Is not supported and should be revised or removed accordingly.

#4 3.2•12 The Information and discussion appearing in the first paragraph regarding County parks and community parks appears to exclude the 1,000 acre (+/-) McKay Community Forest acquired by the County of Humboldt in August, 2014, If the Community Forcst acreage is omitted, the County park acreage recited in the RDEIR does not represent current C7-6
conditions and should be revised accordingly,

#5 3.2-12 Beginning with the third paragraph, the information provided regarding the County's timber industry does not reflect current condilions. According to the California State Board of Equalization, between 2010 and 2015, the total value for Humboldt County's timber harvest has fluctuated between approximately $68 million and $71 million, with a C7-7
high of $81 million in 2014. This information should be revised to represent current
conditions. (Supporting information for these statistics is enclosed as Attachment D.)

#6 3.2-14 Under the topic "Timberland Conversion" appearing on page 3.2.-14, the commentary regarding the existence of multipie viewpoints of "timberland converslon" depending on how the terms is defined and in what context the term is used is unsubstantlated and
misleading, The operative definition provided in the RDEIR and recognized in the timber industry for "Timberland Conversion" is that appearing in the California Forest Practices Act and implementing Regulations (California Code of Regulations Title 14, Article 7). This iS the only definition that should be used in the context of discussing Timberland C7-8
Conversion in the RDEIR or anywhere else in conjunction with the Humboldt County General Plan Update.
The conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if eligible, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemptlon accepted by CAL FIRE.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 133

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

The information provided in the RDEIR should be revised to rely solely upon the definition of Timberland Conversion recognized by the Forest Practices Act and implementing Regulations and remove any discussion and/or reference to altemative definitions as absolutely none are provided in the RDEIR and this renders the document confusing, C7-8 subjective and unsupported. The entire RDEIR should be evaluated to ensure the term "Timberland Conversion" is used only in the context recognized by applicable law, i.e., the conversion of timberland to non-timber growing use.

#7 3.2-15 As provided in the previous GDRCo comment, the discussion appearing in the first paragraph on page 3.2-15 describing "conversion" based on parcel size, market conditions or ownership values is speculative and should be removed. The general conclusion that "forest management practices are not enhanced with smaller parcel sizes" is vague, speculative and not supported by empirical evidence. No discussion appears in the RDEIR regarding what is considered a "small" timberland parcel. In fact, this is a major flaw in the RDEIR and the conclusions reached in the RDEIR are implicitly at odds with those reached by CAL FIRE as explained further in Comment #8, immediately below. C7-9

The conversion of timberland to a use other lhan growing timber requires, prior to conversion, Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if eligible, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE.

This chapter should be revised to remove any reference to *conversion" in the context of discussing land management priorities or economles of scale based on undefined "parcel sizes".

#8 3.2-15 It must be noted and the RDEIR corrected to reflect the fact that the flrst sentence of the second paragraph on page 3.2-15 has been restated and manipulated throughout the General Plan Update process beginning first with the Forest Resources Chapter of Natural Resources and Hazards Report prepared by Dyett & Bhatla (September 2002), then materially restated with the Forest Resources and Policies Report (October 2003 Draft, revised, April 2006) prepared by the Humboldi County Department of Community Development Services, and finally again as the text appears in this chapter of the RDEIR, C7-10
Of note, the Natural Resources and Hazards Report prepared by Dyett & Bhatia (September 2002) first used the sentence in the following discussion regarding timberland conversion beginning on page 3-1 under Chapter 3; Forest Resources:
TIMBERLAND CONVERSION

Timberlond conversion, the tronsfer of timberland to other uses, occurs as a result of General Plan amendments and new subdivisions, os well us through the Certificate of Complionce process, which involves recognition of historic parcels that may be substandard to minimum parcel sizes ond densitles established by the General Plon. One quarter of all the Certificate of Complionce applications submitted since 1985 have been on agricultural propertles ond timberlands, affecting more than 18,000 ocres, Also, more than one holf (53 percent) of oll the lot line adjustment applications since 1985 huve been

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 134

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

on agricultural and timberlands, affecting more than 16,000 acres.
Thése changes are primarily reflective of the breakup of old family ranches. Timber production on these areas is likely still vioble; therefore, these changes are not deeply significant with respect to the timber economy, Direct land use conversions by rezone out of TPZ (Timber Praductian Zone) have been mare limited, on the order of 1,000 ocres over the lost 25 years, 910 acres af which were part af the Caunty's Eureka Community Pion in
1995.

An additional conversion issue that has long been a topic of debate is conversion by public acquisition, highlighted most recently by the Headwaters Forest Reserve ocquisition, which removed 7,500 ocres from timber production. While such conversions maintain the open space volues of the londs, they are lost to the economic sector.
Subsequently, the Forest Resources Chapter of the Natural Resources and Hazards Report prepared by the Department of Community Development Services incorrectly references Certificates of Compliance and Lot Line Adjustments as a means of "converting" timberland to other uses. The Department of Community Development Services reached this conclusion in direct contradiction to the finding by Dyett & Bhatia that "Timber production on these areas [i.e., parcels recognized under the Certificate of Compliance process] is likely still vlable; therefore, these changes are not deeply significant with respect to the timber economy". (The operative sentence from the actual Dyett & Bhatia Report is highlighted in vellow above).
Of note, the Forest Resources and Policies (October 2003 Draft, revised, April 2006), subsequently prepared by the Humboldt County Department of Commnunity Development Services, relled upon the Natural Resources and Hazards report prepared by Dyett & Bhatla. The Forest! Lesources and Policies report provided the following discussion regarding timberland conversion beginning on page 1-16 under Section 1.4; Conversion of Timberlands:

1.4 CONVERSION OF TIMBERLAND

Timberland conversion, the transfer of timberlond to other uses, occurs as o result of General Plan amendments and new subdivisions, os well os through the Certificate of C7-10
Compliance process, which Involves recognition of historic porcels that may be I substandord to minimum porcel sizes and densities estabilshed by the Generol Pian. One quarter of all the Certificate of Compliance applications submitted since 1985 have been on ogricultural properties and timberlands, affecting more than 18,000 acres. Also, more
thon one holf (53 percent) of oll the lot line adjustment applications since 1985 have been on agricuitural and timberlands, affecting more than 16,000 acres.
These changes are primarily reflective of the breakup of old family ranches. Timber production an these areas may still be viable; and it is uncleor whot specific effects this trend has had on the timber economy: However, forest management practices are generally not enhanced with smaller parcel sizes. Land ownership patterns, for example, are likely to became more camplicated with smaller parcel sizes, which may inhibit resource production. Direct land use conversions by rezone out of TPZ (Timber Production

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Zone) have been more limited, on the order of 1,000 ocres over the last 75 yeors, 910 acres of which were port of the County's Eureka Community Plan in 1995.
An odditional conversion issue that has long been a topic of debate is conversion by public acquisition, highlighted most recently by the Headwaters Forest Reserve acquisitian, which removed 7,500 acres from timber production. While such conversions maintoin the open space values of the londs, they are lost to the economic sector.
Finolly, onother process by which timberland conversion occurs is through the "Less thon. acre Conversion Exemptlons" which ollow for the ministerlal approval of conversion of less thon 3 ocres for other permitted land uses such os residential development.
As the highlighted text makes clear, the Forest Resources and Policies Report incorrecily references Certificates of Compliance and Lot Line Adjustments as a means of converting timberland and materially misstates the findings of the Natural Resources and Hazards Report prepared by Dyett & Bhalia, 2002. The County's conclusion that changes in ownership by issuance of Certilicates of Compliance "primarily reflective of the breakup of old family ranches* creates "unclear" effects on the timber economy contradicts the C7-10
retained consultant's conclusion that any changes are not deeply significent.
Finally the first sentence of the second chapter of the RDEIR at page 3.2-15 uses the same sentence in discussing timberland conversion in the context of changes in land management priorities. As stated in GDRCo comment #7, above, the use of the term conversion is misused in the context of discussing land management priorities and assumptions regarding parcel size, market conditions or ownership values are not supported and thus have not basis for inclusion in the RDEIR.

Although GDRCo recognizes that there is no opportunity to revise any of the Background Reports used as parl of the RDEIR, it does illustrate the importance of using the correct terminology in the correct context in a consistent manner throughout the process. Also, any discussion in the RDEIR should recite the actual conclusions of the retained
consultants included in the supporting materials.

#9 3.2-15 The last paragraph on page 3.2-15 entitled "Conversion from Fragmentation" is entirely misleading, Incorrect, and not substantiated by the material cited or the text in this
section of the RDEIR. Moreover, the discussion materially omits the relevant discussion points and parcel size distinctlons included in the cited CAL FIRE Fire and Resource Assessment Program's (FRAP) Forest and Range 2003 Assessment rendering the entire discussion in the RDEIR misleading and without proper context.
Specifically, although the CAL. FIRE Fire and Resource Assessment Program's (FRAP) Forest and Range 2003 Assessment, cited in the RDEIR, does include consideration of C7-11
"tragmentation" and "parcelization" and the potentiol impacts that may consequently occur on agricultural and forest resources, the 2003 FRAP Assessment does not make a direct correlation between "parcelization" and "converslon" as does the litle of this
sectlon. Of substantial import, although the RDEIR provides a definition of "parcelization", per the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report at the foot of page 3.2-15 along with the FRAP definition of "rural residential" as being a housing

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 136

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Assessment appears to provide an appropriate detinition.

It Again, it must be noted that, based on historic experience factors, the Certificate of Compliance process in Humboldt County routinely yields the identification of parcels C7-11
substantially greater in size than 20 acres.

#10 3.2-16 In the second paragraph of page 3.2-16 as part of its "parcelization" discussion the RDEIR
references a study prepared by the North Coast Regional Land Trust (NRLT). However, the NRLT study does not utilize the term "parcellzation" anywhere in the report. The NRLT report does use the term "subdivision" which is much more narrowly defined. However, the NRLT report fails to provide any data to substantlate that approximately 35,000 acres of forcstland was subdivided in Humboldt County, as defined by the Subdivision Map Act. If, in fact, the approximate 35,000 acres simply changed hands as a result of a change in ownership, the report is overreaching and materially misleading in referring to the 35,000 acres as being subdivided.

Furthermore, both the RDEIR and the NRLT report falled to consider the economic effects of varlations In log prices and market demand which play a critical role in a landowner's decislon to harvest timber. C7-12

Any discussion regarding the NRLT report in the RDEIR should be limited to terminology and/or the data utilized in the NRLT report. If in fact the approximate 35,000 acres referenced in the NRLT as being subdivided actually represents a change in ownership, the RDEIR should not rely on the NRLT report and any assumptions in the report regarding decreased timber harvest on these lands should be reconciled with market influences
during the Ilmited time perlod considered in the report.

#11 3.2-16 The first sentence, third paragraph of page 3.2-16 misrepresents what a patent parcel is
and incorrectly slates that the existence of patent parcels affects "fragmentation" of land. The balance of the paragraph more accurately explains what a patent parcel is and the process by which it can be determined whether a patent parcel, or any parcel, ls
considered a separate legel parcel.
Legal parcels, whether they are unaltered patent parcels or parcels created in conformance with the Subdlvision Map Act, are the means by which property is hekd (owned). GDRCo does support retaining the rights of property ownership to the extent they exist. Any "fragmentation" of the forest resource land bose in Humboldt County occurs as result of external factors (economic, social, or other), not based upon the existence of patent parcels the vast majority of which substantially exceed 20 acres in C7-13
size--which generally results in no fragmentation as concluded in the CAL FIRE 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report.

The first sentence of the paragraph should be removed from the RDEIR as it
misrepresents what a patent parcel Is and incorrectly states that the existence of patent
parcels creates fragmentation of land.

#12 3.2-17 in the second paragraph, first two sentences on page 3.2-17 the RDEIR fails to explain that the change in ownership pattern for industrial timberland owners during the period from C7-14

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 137

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

2001 to 20D8 was largely a result of companies closing sawmills due to a lack of timber supply from the US Forest Service. Many of these companies were heavily rellant upon timber from the US Forest Service and when sawmills closed all assets were typically liquated, including timberland holdings. C7-14

This information should be revised to further explain or substantiate the change in timberland ownership during this time period.

#13 3.2-17 In the second paragraph, last sentence on page 3.2-17, a misleading statement appears regarding the recognition of patent or legal parcels. The recognition of patent or legal parcels (l.e. Certificates of Compliance) does not In and of Itself serve as a legal mechanism to break up large ranches and timberland and has no impact on the permitted and/or conditionally permitted uses of land based on zoning classifications.
Certificate of Compliance relates only to issues of compllance or noncompliance with the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. A Certificate of Compliance does not certify that the real property for which the certificate has been C7-15
issued Is sultable for development in accordance with existing or future regulations nor does issuance of a Certificate of Compliance in any way permit uses of land not allowed by its zoning classification. Certificates of Compllance can be used to assist in valuing conservation easements, for financing purposes, or for matters pertaining to title and any restraint on their Issuance violates the Subdivision Map Act and creates an unlawful
restriction on the alienation of land.

This information should be revised to state that landowners may elect to sell individual patents or legal parcels upon receipt of a Certificate of Compliance.

#14 3.2-17 Beginning with the fourth paragraph and continuing through the third paragraph on page 3.2-18, the discussion of a previous proposal by MAXXAM Corporation is outdated and irrelevant as it was never a project, never came to fruition and any land use planning based on this artifact is unsupported and entirely speculative. The discussion regarding C7-16
other land sales and any reference to illegal activities by the sellers or purchasers of property is Irrelevant as these are issues related to enforcement and not the current
Framework Plan or the proposed General Plan Update.

#15 3.2-18 The fourth paragraph on page 3.2-18 contains a faise narrative perpetuated throughout Section 3.2 that an ndividual timberland patent or legal parcel, when sold, is converted and no longer suitable for timber production. While It is acknowledged that there is an economy of scale related to the size of timberland holdings, and the corresponding management of same, the conveyance of an individual patent or legal parcel does not
constitule conversion (as defined by CAL FIRE) nor does it constitute detrimental C7-17
fragmentation, per se, as evaluated by the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource
Report referenced above. Therefore, the timber producing capabilities of timberlands are not necessarily lost as a result of the sale of an Individual patent or legal parcel and the RDEIR discussion on this point is entirely speculative and unsupported.
The conversion of timberland to use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, If eligible, a Less

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 138

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE.

It 1s important to note that GDRCo's ownership in Humboldt County represents hundreds
of real estate transactions, both purchases and sales, beginning in approximately 1956. In
other words, the GDRCo ownership did not always look as it does today. When acquired
these lands had economic value not only as timberland but also as individual parcels. Il is
of importance to GDRCo that economic value is maintained for resource lands, especially
to the extent that these lands had a certain economic value when acquired. C7-17
If the County intends to accurately assess if resource lands are adequately protected, there must first be a comprehensive revision of Section 3.2 to more narrowly define what
constitutes conversion of timberland, and what constitutes "fragmentation" or "parcelization" with detrimental effects on timber resources and ecology. Again, the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report acknowledges 20 acre parcels as a defining mechanism, recognizing continued timber productivity and ecological benefits of
parcels 20 acres or greater. The false narrative that Certificates of Compliance, Determinations of Status, and even the sale of individual patents or legal parcels
constitute "conversion" of timberland with detrimental environmental effects should be
removed from the discussion of timberland resources in Section 3.2. The discussion is not
defined, has no definitional reference polnts, and is thus vague and in violation of EIR
requirements under CEQA. (See Attachment B appended hereto).

#16 3.2-19 The first paragraph of page 3.2-19 states that the General Plan Update (i.e. the Project)
..could include new policies which could facilitate conversion of farmland or forest land"
is extremely speculative and unsupported, in the context of assessing impacts and Mitigation Measures, only those policies which are included as part of the General Plan
Update as presented in this RDEIR can be considered and/or evaluated. This language C7-18

should be deleted from the RDEIR.

#17 3.2-19 The fourth paragraph, last sentence of page 3.2-19 is misleading in that conversion of timberland does not directly result from the subdivision or the sale of Individual patents or legal parcels,

The subdivision of TPZ zoned lands is allowed down to 40-acre minimum parcel size with
an approved JTMP, The intent of a JTMP Is to ensure that timber management is still
viable subsequent to a subdivision being approved, The County should recognize that the
conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to
conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, If eligible, a Less
Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE. C7-19

Again, the sale of an individual patent or legal parcels does not in and of itself constitute
conversion of timberland. As previously stated, the term Timberland Conversion should
be limited to that which is provided in the Forest Practice Act (Title 14, Artide 7}.

This sentence should be removed from the RDEIR.

#18 3.2-32 Under the heading 'Trinidad Planning Watershed, Changes from T" on page 3.2-32, the
42 acres referenced as being east of Bíg Lagoon is believed to be GDRCo property for C7-20

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 139

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

which GDRCo submitted a change in land use designation. GDRCo had initially made a request to have the land use designation changed from T to RE so that the land use would conform with what was an existing residential use. GDRCo no longer provides residential use of this approximately 42 acre property and subsequently requested that the land use C7-20
be changed from T to CR, which was approved by the Board of Supervisors and is reflected in the current land use maps.
Information provided under the Trinidad Planning Watershed, Changes from T should be revised to describe the change in land use for the approximately 42 acre propcrty located east of Big Lagoon as changing from T to CR.

#19 3.2-34 The last paragraph of page 3.2-34 contains the title "Conversion as a result of increased parcelization and subsequent development" which is materially misleading and I unsubstantiated by the subsequent content.
As previously stated, selling individual patents or legal parcels does not constitute conversion, nor does it constitute a change in parcel size. Patents and/or legal parcels can form the basis in which real property Interests are held, with larger ownerships being C7-21
comprised of multiple patents and/or legal parcels. While such properties may change ownership they are still available for resource production and it is up to the individual landowner and applicable zoning regulations as to how those resources are used and managed.

The conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if eligible, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAI. FIRE.
The term "conversion" should be removed from the subsection title-the RDEIR wholly fails to provide any definition to what constitutes actual "fragmentation" or what sized parcels cause these concerns and general commentary of this nature is not appropriate in an EIR.

#20 3.2-35 In the first paragraph on page 3.2-35 regarding the density standard for patents and legal parcels it should be recognized that one dwelling unit per parcel is allowed regardless of whether the acreage meets the minimum parcel size (I.e. 160 acres for TPZ).
Patents were orlginally established based upon the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) resulting in patents averaging approximately 160 acres +/- in size, upwards to 640 acres. C7-22
The fact that a patent parcel is less than 160 acres should not be a basis for nonconformance. Furthermore, the Subdivision Map Act provides a process to recognize existing legal parcels with the undorsl anding that said recognition does not constitute subdivision.

Patents and/or legal parcels can form the basis in which real property interest are held, with larger ownerships being comprised of multiple patents and/or legal parcels. Selling individual patents or legal parcels docs not constitute subdivision, nor does it violate the Subdivision Map Act. It 1s misleading for the County to insinuate that the compliance with the Subdivision Map Act Is somehow being avoided through the recognition, sale or

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 140

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

purchase of patents and/or legal parcels.

This paragraph should be removed. C7-22

#21 3.2-35 The discussion in the second paragraph on page 3.2-35 regarding patent parcels is both
speculative and subjective. The Determination of Status process, as provided for by the
Subdivision Map Act, is the only accurate means of establishing the number unaltered and
altered patent parcels and delining base units of land. The last sentence in this paragraph C7-23

should be revised to specify that any unaltered or altered patent parcel found to be in
conformance with the Subdivision Map Act Determination of Status process would retain
its historic rights. Any other assumption is contrary to law.

#22 3.2-35 The discussion in the third paragraph on page 3.2-35 comingles the Determination of Status process (L.e. Certificates of Compliance) and development criteria which are not
mutually exclusive.

A Certificate of Compliance relates only to issues of compliance or noncompliance with
the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. A Certificate of C7-24
Compliance does not certify that the real property for which the certificate has been
issued is suitable for development in accordance with existing or future regulations.
The information provided in this paragraph should be revised to clearly state that the
Determination of Status process is not contingent upon development criteria.

#23 3.2-35 The first paragraph under "Other changes that could result in Conversion of Farmland or Forestland" on page 3.2-35 and discussion regarding conversion as used in the subsection title should be limited to the definition of Timberland Conversion as provided in the C7-25
Forest Practice Act (Title 14, Article 7).

#24 3.2-36 The third paragraph, first sentence of page 3.2-36 contains : general statement wilhout
sufficient facts to support the conclusion. Conflicts may occur however it must be
recognized that timber harvesting is a relatively short-lived event with short term
disruptions as compared to ongoing timber management activities and, as the 2003 FRAP C7-26
Forest and Range 2003 Resource Reporl and updates clearly recognize, any "conflicts" greatly diminish on parcels in excess of 20 acres in size. Again the use of the term
conversion should be limited to the definition of Timberland Conversion as provided in
the Forest Practice Act (Title 14, Article 7),

#25 3.2-36 The third paragraph, third sentence of page 3.2-36 should be changed as follows: the
term "llmiting incompatible uses" should be further clarified to state "limiting
incompatible uses consistent with Government Code 51100-51104". C7-27

#26 3.2-39 The sixth paragraph, first sentence on page 3.2-39, regarding the use of the term "parcelization", is again misleading, Nelther the RDEIR nor the Board of Supervisors'
approved draft General Plan Update provides any definition for "parcelization", If the C7-28
term, as used In the first sentence of the sixth paragraph on page 3.2-39 of the RDEIR
assumes that a Certificate of Compliance constitutes parcelization, then this is a false and

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 141

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

misleading statement and should be revised accordingly. Likewise, every conveyance of land constitutes a "parcelization" to some extent-the purpose of the EIR is analyze detrimental environmental effects, without evaluating parcel size relative to any C7-28 discussion of "parcelization" and/or "fragmentation" renders the entire narrative vague and unsupported.

#27 3.2-39 In the sixth paragraph, starting with the third sentence on page 3.2-39 and continuing onto page 3.2-40, the discussion assumes that the non-implementation of the Merger Ordinance will cause the "conversion" or "loss" of timberlands to rural residential uses.
This assumption Is entirely unsupported and the narrative in the RDEIR lacks context.
Again, the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report does provide context in this regard (i.e., recognizing density at less than 20 acres to cause fragmentation concerns), but the RDEIR makes no effort to define "parcelization" or "fragmentation" in a meaningful, substantive manner. The narrative is vague, unsupported and should be stricken.

As previously stated, selling individual patents or legal parcels does not constitute conversion, nor does it constitute a change in parcel size. Patents and/or legal parcels can C7-29
form the basis in which real property interest are held, with larger ownerships being comprised of multiple palents and/or legal parcols. While such properties may change ownership they are still available for resource production and it is up to the individual landowner as to how those resources are managed,
The conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, a Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if eligible, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE,

The fourth sentence of the sixth paragraph on page 3.2-39 should be deleted as it is not adequately substantiated.

#28 3.2-40 The first paragraph on page 3.2-40 contains information thal is misleading because the term "conversion" infers that the timber growing capacity of resource production lands is lost If used in conjunction with rural residential purposes. This gross generalization gives no consideration to parcel size and fails to recognize that these parcels likely retain the land use and zoning that support resource production and can provide ecological benefits as well, as expressly concluded in the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report for parcels 20 acres or greater.

As previously stated, selling individual patents or legal parcels does not constitute conversion, nor does it constitute a change In parcel size, Patents and/or legal parcels can C7-30
form the basis In which real property interests are held, with larger ownerships being comprised of multiple patents and/or legal parcels. While such properties may change ownership they are still avallable for resource production and it Is up to the individual landowner as to how those resources are managed,

The conversion of timberland to a use other than growing timber requires, prior to conversion, Timberland Conversion Permit approved by CAL FIRE or, if eligible, a less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption accepted by CAL FIRE.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 142

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

The finding provided here that there is a significant unavoidable impact is unsubstantiated and inaccurate if the County presumes (as the RDEIR text implies) that "conversion" occurs as a result of elther the sale of individual patents/legal parcels or the residential use of timber resource lands, This Implicit finding relles upon a false narrative C7-30

without any context and should be re-evaluated by limiting the use of the term "conversion" in a manner that is consistent with the Forest Practice Act.

critical watersheds.
C7-32
If Mitigation 3.3.3.2.a. is adopted the sole cost of completing said evaluation should be the responsibility of the County, not individual project applicants, and any failure on the part of the County to complete the evaluation within the specifled two-year timeframe should not result in a de facto moratorium on development or any other project in a given
watershed.

#31 3.11-17 Impact 3.11.3.5. Habitat Conservation Plans; suggest the first sentence under this
subchapter be revised as follows:

"Implementation of the General Pian Update could result in additionol develapment that conflicts with adopted habitat conservation pions". C7-33

This suggested change is relevant considering that an HCP may provide for limited land use changes and therefore be an absolute conflict.

#132 3.11-18 First paragraph, beginning with the fourth sentence; the information provided in the
RDEIR herein is misleading and hyperbolic.

As stated in Chapter 2 of the RDEIR, "The RDEIR is focused on the environmental effects which may reasonably be expacted to occur during the 24-year planning period of the GPU, 2016-2024, as described in subchapters 2.1 and 2.5 below". Table 2.5-1 on page 2- 24 of the RDEIR provides the estimated number of dwelling units by land use designation C7-34
that will be required to accommodate the estimated maximum feasible housing
development and potential and projected development from 2016 10 2040. For lands planned T or TC the estimate provided is 44 housing units assuming thal peak demand occurs In 2028. The discussion provided on page 3.11-17, under "Analysis of Relevant General Plan Update Pollcies", should be limited to the scope of the Project as described in the RDEIR. The discussion which refers to the theoretical construction of as many as
"20,000 dwelling units" on lands planned Timberlands (T) is completely hyperbolic and irrelevant as the analysis of relevant General Plan Update policies related to land planned
T. Specifically, in order to maintain internal consistency, the number of dwelling units on lands zoned T considered in the RDEIR should be limited to the estimated 44 units as

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 143

identified in the RDEIR. The "20,000" unit assumption is entirely misplaced and without support. Furthermore, the presumption, as framed, violates accepted EIR scoping and project description standards under CEQA. (Sec legal opinion appended as Attachment
B), C7-34

The discussion provided under Analysis of Relevant General Plan Update Polldes
regarding the planned densilies and theoretical maximum buildout of lands planned Tto
"20,000 units" should be removed as it is outside the scope of the Project as described in the RDEIR and it is not substantiated by any analysis elsewhere in the RDEIR.

Re: Humboldt County General Plan Update Revised Environmental Impact Report (dated April 19, 2017)

Dear Mr. Compion:
You requested that our law office review pertinent portions of the Humboldt County General Plan Update Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report (dated April 19, 2017) (the "RDEIR") prepared in accord with the Culifornia Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and provide a legal analysis and response to the following questions:

1. Does issuance of a Certificate of Compliance under the California Subdivision Map Act (California Oovernment Code § 66410, et seq.) on rcal property parcels zoned for timber production ("TPZ"), timberland ("T*), or any form of agriculture (principally agriculture (AG) and/or agriculture exclusive (AE)) enable or entitle the owner of real property to "convert" the use(s) made of the property to something other than uses principally or conditionally permitted by the parcel's zoning classification?

2. Do the general references and discussion points contained in the RDEIR related to the "conversion", "parcclization" and/or "fragmentation" of timberlands and agricultural lands in the Agricultural and Timber Resources Chapter (Chapter 3.2) and clsewhere in the RDEIR satisfy requirements applicable to Environmental Impact Report preparation under the California Environmental Quality Act?

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 146

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Each of these questions is answered, in turn, as follows:

1, Certificate of Compliance Issuance Does Not Constitute Timberland
Conversion

The RDBIR repeatedly and erroneously equatcs the issuance of Certificates of Compliance under the California Subdivision Map Act (Calif. Govemment Code § 66410, et scq.) as a form of timberland or agricultural land "conversion." Specifically, the discussion commences at page 3.2-11 of the RDEIR as follows: "U]n addition to conversion occurring because of General Plan amendments and new subdivisions, resource lands may be converted through the Certificate of Compliance process, which involves recognition of historic parcels that may be substandard to minimum parcel sizes and densities established by the General Plan."
This "presumption" is not supported by substantial evidence, and it is contrary to established law. The issuance of a Certificate of Compliance does not, by itself, affect land use designations, zoning designations, or parcel size. (See Gov. Code, § 66499.35 [Certificates of Compliance "relate[] only to issues of compliance or noncompliance with the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. The parcel described herein may be sold, leased, or financed without further compliance with the Subdivision Map Act or any local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto. Development of the parcel may require issuance of a permit or permits, or other grant or grants of approval." (Emphasis added)].) The effect of a certificate is limited to legitimizing divisions of property that have already occurred. (Save Mount Diablo v. Contra Costa County (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 1368, 1389, review denied (Jan. 20, 2016).)
Timberland conversion is an cstablished, technical term. As the RDEIR
appropriately recites, the recognized definition of the term "T'imberland Conversion* appears in the California Forest Practices Act ("FPA") and implementing regulations. (See RDEIR at p. 3.2-14, citing Calif. Code of Regulations ("CCR") Title 14, Article 7.) In pertinent part, "Timberland Conversion" is defined as follows:

(g) *Timberland Conversion":

(1) Within non-Timberland Production Zone (TPZ) timberland, transforming timberland to a non-timber growing use through timber operations where;

(A) Future timber harvests will be prevented or infensible because of land occupancy and activitics thercon; or

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 147

P

Final EIR Humboldt County General Plan

(B) Stocking requirements of' the applicable district forest practice rules will not be mel within five years after
completion of timber opcrations; or

(C) There is a cleur intent to divide timberland into ownerships of less than three acrcs (1.214 ha.).

(2) Within TPZ lands, the immediate rezoning of TPZ lands, whether timber operations are involved or not except as exempt from a timberland conversion permit under 14 CCR 1104.1.

(14 CCR § 1100(g).)

Timberland conversion is only accomplished by way of a Timberland Conversion Permit or, if eligiblo, a Less Than 3 Acre Conversion Exemption, each of which the California Department of Forestry ("CAL FIRE") bus jurisdiction. (See Calif. Code of Regulations Title 14, Article 7.) The RDBIR seems to acknowledge this fact by correctly noting that the "Forest Practices Act ... provides a legal definition of 'timberland conversion?" and that such conversions are only accomplished through the issuance of permits or excmptions. (RDEIR pg. 3.2-14.) Nevertheless, the RDEIR then confuses the concept by assuming "another type of 'conversion' that is more difficult to define and track is the change in land management priorities based upon parcel size, market conditions and ownership values." (RDEIR pg 3.2-15.) The RDEIR then procceds with a lengthy narrative about assumed "conversion" caused by "[f]ragmentation and 'parcelization'" of timberlands and further equates "*conversion" with Certificate of Compliance and/or Conditional Certificate of Compliance issuance under the Subdivision Map Act. (RDEIR, pgs. 3.2-15-3.2-16.)
Despite the general commentary in the RDEIR, nothing about Certificate of Compliance issuance, Lot Line Adjustments or other non-divisional parcel adjustments "converts" any existing uses of land or create an entitlement to additional uses of land.
The false narrative that Certificates of Compliance, Determinations of Status, and even
the sale of individual patents or legal parcels constitute "conversion" of timberland or agricultural Jands with detrimental environmental effects should be removed from the discussiou of agricultural and timber resources in Chapter 3.2 of the RDEIR. There is no basis in law to equate Certificates of Compliance or legal parcel recognition as a form of timberland and/or agricultural land "conversion". Morcover, as discussed immediately below, the assumption that "conversion" occurs as a result of the Certificate of

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 148

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Compliance process is not supported by subslantial evidence and is thus an improper
consideration in the RDEIR.

2. The RDEIR Discussion Regarding "Fragmentation" and "Parcelization" of
Timberland Is Vaque, Undefined and Not Supported by Substantial Evidence
as Required by CEOA.

It is well established that the findings in an Environmental Impact Report must be
supported by "substantial evidence." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15384.) "Substantial
evidence" means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though otber conclusions might also be reached." (Id.) "Substantial evidence" does not include "argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence which is clearly erroncous or inaccurate." (Id.; see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21080(e)(2) and Sterra
Club v. California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 370,
381.)

Of consequence, the RDEIR contains a protracted discussion about alleged "fragmentation" and "parcelization" of timberlands and agricultural lands and presumed adyerse environmental consequences associated with these potential practices. (RDEIR
at pgs. 3.2-15 through 3.2-18.) Rendering the discussion entirely vague and without
context, the RDEIR makes no attempl to independently define the terms "fragmentation** or "parcelization". Further complicating the confusion, in support of the discussion about "parcelization" the RDEIR cites the 2003 CAL FIRE and Resource Assessment
Program's (FRAP) Forest and Range 2003 Assessment. (RDEIR at p. 3.2-15, fn. 1.) The
RDEIR's reference to the 2003 Assessment is entirely misleading and withoul proper
context, however, because the RDEIR materially omits the relevant discussion points and parcel size distinctions included in the 2003 Assessment.
Specifically, although the FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Assessment does include
consideration of "fragmentation" and "parcelization" and the potential impacis that consequently occur on agricultural and forest resources, nothing in the Assessment may

establishes any correlation to the history of the Certificate of Compliance process in Humboldt County recited in the RDEIR. Rather than provide support, the FRAP Forest and Range Assessment actually contradicts any such conclusion. Without justification, the RDEIR completely omits the discussion appearing in the FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Assessment regarding the decrease/luck of parcelization/fragmentation concems associated with timberland and resource parcels 20 acres or greater. The following is an

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 149

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

excerpt from the 2003 FRAP Assessment which includes the identification of a category above "rural residential parcels (sized 20 acres or less)" which is described as "working/private parcels (sized 20 acres or greater)", and recites the decreased fragmentation or "conversion" concerns associated with this larger parcel classification:
Working/Private

Working/Private landscapes are those lands in private ownership with sparse housing density (less than one unit per 20 acres). They are used for a variety of purposes with commodity production often as the primary focus. These areas, where the role of private investment for production of energy, lumber, and livestock is coupled with supportive policy tools can potentially play the biggest role in maintaining lands in an unfragmented condition. In addition, these areas still provide for habitat restoration or managemeni, recreation, and dispersed living space. These areas provide significant traditional ecosystem services as complements to the primary revenue producing management goals.
As the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range Assessment cleurly indicates, parcels with a housing density of one unit per 20 acres or greater do not constitute "fragmentation", and, to the contrary, may play an important role in maintaining lands in an unfragmented condition and "provide significant traditional ecosystem services as complements to the primary revenue producing management goals", as the Assessment concludes.
1t ghould be noted that a subsequent FRAP Forest and Range Assessment was completed in 2010, and a FRAP Forest and Resource Assessment for 2015 is in the process of being completed. The FRAP 2010 Forest and Range Assessment provides updated definitions for both "parcelization" and "fragmentation" as follows:
Parcelization: The process of land ownership being broken into increasiugly smaller tracts; by definition in the Assessment, housing density of one or more units per 20 acres and less than one unit per acre.
Fragmentation: The process by which a contiguous land cover, vegetative community, or habitat is broken into smaller patches within a mosaic of other forms of land usefland cover, e.g., islands of an older forest age class immersed within areas of younger aged forest (Helms, 1998), or patches of oak woodlands surrounded by housing development.

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

If any discussion is to be included in the ETK about "fragmentation" and/or "parcelization" of timberlands and agricultural lands, the conclusions about decreased fragmentation concerns on parcels sized 20 acres contained in the FRAP 2003 Assessment and 2010 update should be incorporated. All pertinent text included in the FRAP Assessment Reports (original and updated) should be included in the RDEIR. A *parcelization" discussion may be appropriate in the General Plan Update EIR provided a definition for the term is included and used consistently throughout the document. The 20 acre standard for "parcelization" and "fragmentation" definitions included and analyzed in the 2010 FRAP Assessment appears to provide an appropriate definition/reference.

Additionally, as Humboldt County's experience factor with the Certificate of Compliance process demonstrates, it is rare that the process yields the identification of parcels of land measuring less than 20 acres in size on parcels zoned T or TPZ.
In summary, the discussion regarding "fragmentation" and/or "parcelization" appearing at pages 3.2-15 through 3,2-18 of the RDEIR is vague, misleading, materially misquotes and ignores pertinent discussion points in the "evidence" cited (principally the CAL FIRE FRAP Assessments) and, as a whole, materially lacks "substantial evidence" to support the discussion about adverse environmental impacts associated with the Certificate of Compliance process and/or the sale and conveyance of patent parcels. As such, the discussion violates California Code of Regulations Title 14, § 15384, and should be deleted from the RDEIR.

As we have discussed, you indicated that GDRCo intends to submit this
correspondence along with, and in support of, comments GDRCo is offering to the RDBIR. We acknowledge your right and authorization to do so.
Very truly yours,

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 184

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Responses to Letter C7 - Green Diamond Resource Company

Comment C7-1: The commenter states the RDEIR and supporting documents all incorrectly characterize the process of recognizing and/or determining the scope and extent of "legal parcels" and/or adjusting parcel boundaries as acts of conversion and/or subdivision of timberlands. The conclusion that determinations of legal status of parcels and lot line adjustments result in conversion of timberlands is not supported by
substantial evidence, contradicts the conclusions of supporting documentation for the EIR, and misstates the findings reached by California resource agencies when reviewing the issue.

Response to Comment C7-1: The County recognizes that determinations of status, certificates of compliance, and/or lot line adjustments do not result in conversion of
timberland by themselves. Other actions would need to follow, such as issuance of
building permits for single family homes by the County or approval of timberland conversion permits by CalFire before conversion of timberland occurs.

Also, the County recognizes that determinations of status, certificates of compliance,
and lot line adjustments can lead to more efficient timber management. Where the
text of the EIR concludes that conversion of timberland solely due to determinations of
status, certificates of compliance, or lot line adjustments of timberland, the text will be revised to clarify these actions do not by themselves convert timberland to other uses.

Comment C7-2: The commenter states some of the land use maps in the GPU are in
error because they do not reflect the land use designations for their property that was
tentatively approved by the Board of Supervisors.
Response to Comment C7-2: The corrections to the GPU land use maps will be brought forward to the Board of Supervisors with the GPU for adoption. The draft resolution of
adoption will include findings that the corrections to the GPU land use maps align with the straw votes taken by the Board, and are a part of the project evaluated in the FEIR.
Comment C7-3: The commenter states the second paragraph on page 3.2-11 of the
RDEIR characterizes determinations of status, certificates of compliance and lot line
adjustments as acts of converting and/or subdividing timberland, which is not supported by substantial evidence, and that this statement needs to be revised or
removed,

Response to Comment C7-3: The second paragraph on page 3.2-11 of the RDEIR is
revised as follows:
"A study of the County's agricultural and timberland conversions identified substantial amounts of land potentially lost to production through zone reclassifications, subdivisions, and conditionally permitted uses that conflict with
agricultural and timber operations (Humboldt County Forest Resources and Policy
Report, October 2003, updated in 2008). In addition to conversion occurring because of General Plan amendments and new subdivisions, resource lands may
be eenverted impacted through a combination of the Certificate of Compliance process, which involves recognition of historic parcels that may be substandard to

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 185

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

minimum parcel sizes and densities established by the General Plan and other
actions such as subdivisions or issuance of timberland conversion permits.
Approximately 25 percent of all the Certificate of Compliance applications
submitted from 1985 - 2000 occurred on agricultural properties and timberlands, affecting more than 18,000 acres. From 2001 to June 2005, this rate increased from
25 percent to over 67 percent, affecting over 53,000 acres, While some of those actions were precursors to conversion of timberland to other uses, most notably illicit
cannabis cultivation, others provided for more efficient timber management."

Comment C7-4: The commenter states the third paragraph on page 3.2-11 of the RDEIR characterizes certificates of compliance as acts that change land use, which is not
supported by substantial evidence, and that this statement needs to be revised or
removed

Response to Comment C7-4: The third paragraph on page 3.2-11 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: "These changes in land use as a result of zone reclassifications, and
subdivisions, and the-issuanees ef Gertifieates of Complianee-on histerie-pareels, are primarily reflective of the breakup of old family ranches."

Comment C7-5: The commenter objects to the wording of the fourth paragraph on
page 3.2-11 of the RDEIR that refers to conversion of timberland.

Response to Comment C7-5: The changes to the RDEIR made in response to comments C7-1 through C7-4 are sufficient to address this comment.
Comment C7-6: The commenter points out that the acreage of County parks on page 3.2-12 of the RDEIR does not include the recent acquisition of the McKay Community Forest (from the Green Diamond Resource Company).
Response to Comment C7-6: The first paragraph on page 3.2-12 of the RDEIR is revised
as follows: "County parks and community parks account for +,000 approximately 2,000
acres."

Comment C7-7: The commenter suggests the language on page 3.2-12 describing the county's timber industry should be updated, and provides updated information.
Response to Comment C7-7 The third paragraph on page 3.2-12 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: "However, the County's timber industry has been in decline over the past 30
years. In 2000, the County's total gross value of timber production was $285,232,953, for which Humboldt County ranked first in the state. By 2008, the total gross value of timber dropped to $108 million, 25 percent less than the 2007 gross value of $147 million.
According to the California State Board of Equalization, between 2010 and 2015, the total value for Humboldt County's timber harvest has fluctuated between
approximately $68 million and $71 million, with a high of $81 million in 2014."

Comment C7-8: The commenter objects to the wording of the fourth paragraph on page 3.2-14 of the RDEIR that refers to conversion of timberland.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 186

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C7-8: The changes to the RDEIR made in response to comments C7-1 through C7-4 are sufficient to address this comment.
Comment C7-9: The commenter objects to the wording of the first paragraph on page 3.2-15 of the RDEIR that describes a form of conversion of timberland that is not based
on substantial evidence - the change in land management priorities based upon parcel size, market conditions, and ownership values.
Response to Comment C7-9: The first and second paragraphs on page 3.2-15 of the RDEIR are revised as follows:

"Another ‡ype-ef "conversien" impact to timberland that is more difficult to define
and traek measure is the change in land management priorities based upon parcel
size, market conditions, and ownership values. As-pareel sizes-go-dewn, the cost of timber harvest per acre (permitting and harvest costs) increases, and timber

Comment C7-10: The commenter objects to the wording of the second paragraph on page 3.2-15 that states in part, "it is unclear what specific effects this trend has had on
the timber economy".
Response to Comment C7-10: This comment is addressed by the changes in Response
to Comment C7-9.

Comment C7-11: The commenter objects to the conclusion in the last paragraph on Page 3.2-15 that parcelization leads to conversion of timberlands. The commenter also
reiterates their objection to associating Certificates of Compliance and Lot Line
adjustments with conversion of timberlands.
Response to Comment C7-11: The last paragraph on page 3.2-15 of the RDEIR is revised
as follows: "Conversion frem Fragmentation. Fragmentation and "parcelization" studies
have found that there is a direct positive relationship between timber production
volumes and land holding size. As the California Forest Legacy Program Assessment notes:" In response the concern about Certificates of Compliance and Lot Line
Adjustments, Response to Comments C7-1 through C7-4 address this concern.

Comment C7-12: The commenter states, "In the second paragraph of page 3.2-16 as
part of its "parcelization" discussion the RDEIR references a study prepared by the North

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 187

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Coast Regional Land Trust (NRLT). However, the NRLT study does not utilize the term "parcelization" anywhere in the report. The NRLT report does use the term "subdivision"
which is much more narrowly defined. However, the NRLT report fails to provide any
data to substantiate that approximately 35,000 acres of forestland was subdivided in Humboldt County, as defined by the Subdivision Map Act. If, in fact, the approximate 35,000 acres simply changed hands as a result of a change in ownership, the report is overreaching and materially misleading in referring to the 35,000 acres as being
subdivided.

Furthermore, both the RDEIR and the NRLT report failed to consider the economic
effects of variations in log prices and market demand which play a critical role in a
landowner's decision to harvest timber.

Any discussion regarding the NRLT report in the RDEIR should be limited to terminology and/or the data utilized in the NRLT report. If in fact the approximate 35,000 acres referenced in the NRLT as being subdivided actually represents a change in ownership, the RDEIR should not rely on the NRLT report and any assumptions in the report regarding decreased timber harvest on these lands should be reconciled with market influences during the limited time period considered in the report."

Response to Comment C7-12: The RDEIR on page 3.2.16 is revised as follows, "A study commissioned by the North Coast Regional Land Trust for Humboldt County in 2009 documented the-effects of timberland-parcelization en annual harvest velumes. The
study found that as parcel size went down, the amount and rate of timber harvest went down significantly."
Comment C7-13: The commenter states the first sentence, third paragraph of page 3.2- 16 misrepresents what a patent parcel is and incorrectly states that the existence of patent parcels affects "fragmentation" of land.
Response to Comment C7-13: The RDEIR on page 3.2.16 is revised as follows:
"Fragmentation-of the forest-resouree-land-base in Humboldl-Gounty-is-affected-by the existence-of patent parcels and-streng suppert for the property rights-assumed to be asseciated with land ewnership. A land patent is the right of ownership to a parcel of land granted by government to an individual or private company. The Subdivision Map Act sets out a process that determines whether a patent parcel is
considered a separate legal parcel under the law, a process usually culminating in a the recordation of a Certificate of Compliance or Conditional Certificate of
Compliance."

Comment C7-14: The commenter states: "In the second paragraph, first two sentences on page 3.2-17 the RDEIR fails to explain that the change in ownership pattern for industrial timberland owners during the period from Page 9 of 56 GDRCo GPU RDEIR Comments 2001 to 2008 was largely a result of companies closing sawmills due to a lack of timber supply from the US Forest Service. Many of these companies were heavily reliant upon timber from the US Forest Service and when sawmills closed all assets were typically liquated, including timberland holdings.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 188

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

This information should be revised to further explain or substantiate the change in timberland ownership during this time period."
Response to Comment C7-14: The RDEIR on page 3.2.17 is revised as follows: "There has also been an overall decrease in acres held by industrial timber owners in
the past eight years. During the years of 2001 through 2008, industrial timberland owners transferred approximately 8 percent (51,000 acres) of their total ownership of forest lands for purposes ranging from sales to public agencies (primarily BLM) to rural residential development. Many of the affected companies were heavily reliant upon timber from the US Forest Service and when the supply from the US Forest Service
dropped, the sawmills closed, and all assets were typically liquated, including
timberland holdings."
Comment C7-15: The commenter states: "In the second paragraph, last sentence on page 3.2-17, a misleading statement appears regarding the recognition of patent or legal parcels. The recognition of patent or legal parcels {i.e. Certificates of Compliance) does not in and of itself serve as a legal mechanism to break up large
ranches and timberland and has no impact on the permitted and/or conditionally
permitted uses of land based on zoning classifications.

This information should be revised to state that landowners may elect to sell individual
patents or legal parcels upon receipt of a Certificate of Compliance."
Response to Comment C7-15: The RDEIR on page 3.2.17 is revised as follows: "As was stated in the Agricultural Resources section above, the County has experienced a
significant increase in the recognition of patent and legal parcels in the resource lands,
which ean serve as a-legal mechanism may lead to break up large ranches and timberland into smaller ownerships because landowners may elect to sell individual
patents or legal parcels upon receipt of a Certificate of Compliance. Conversely,
Certificates of Compliance can h › make commercial timberlands more productive. For example, they can lead to consolidation of timberlands for more efficient timber
management.

Comment C7-16: The commenter states: "The Beginning with the fourth paragraph and
continuing through the third paragraph on page 3.2-18, the discussion of a previous proposal by MAXXAM Corporation is outdated and irrelevant as it was never a project, never came to fruition and any land use planning based on this artifact is unsupported and entirely speculative. The discussion regarding other land sales and any reference to illegal activities by the sellers or purchasers of property is irrelevant as these are issues related to enforcement and not the current Framework Plan or the proposed General
Plan Update."
Response to Comment C7-16: Comment noted. Documentation of the MAXXAM
proposal in the setting section of this chapter is appropriate because it was a topic of
discussion during the Planning Commission hearings on the GPU. The large-scale subdivision proposed by the Maxxam corporation was a unique and highly speculative proposal, and may not be helpful in developing policy or reviewing applications for

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 189

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

certificates of compliance, determinations of status or lot line adjustments to ensure
long-term productivity of timberland in the future.
Comment C7-17: The commenter states: "The fourth paragraph on page 3.2-18 contains a false narrative perpetuated throughout Section 3.2 that an individual timberland patent or legal parcel, when sold, is converted and no longer suitable for timber production. ... Therefore, the timber producing capabilities of timberlands are
not necessarily lost as a result of the sale of an individual patent or legal parcel and the RDEIR discussion on this point is entirely speculative and unsupported."
Response to Comment C7-17: The fourth paragraph on page 3.2-18 is revised as follows, "The protection of forestlands and their timber producing capabilities was one of the key issues during the many public meetings during the General Plan Update process. During those discussions, the timberland stakeholders also noted the timber producing capabilities of timberlands are not necessarily lost as a result of the sale of an individual patent or legal parcel. The main source of controversy identified during this process
centers around how the County can pretect these reseurees help ensure efficient long- term productivity of forestlands while balancing the desire of property owners to maintain their economic value through residlential-develepment eredits en resouree
lands.' The Responses to Comments C7-1 through C7-4 also address Comment C7-17.
No further changes to the RDEIR are necessary to respond to this comment.

Comment C7-18: The commenter states: "The first paragraph of page 3.2-19 states that the General Plan Update (i.e. the Project)" ... could include new policies which could facilitate conversion of farmland or forest land" is extremely speculative and unsupported. In the context of assessing Impacts and Mitigation Measures, only those policies which are included as part of the General Plan Update as presented in this RDEIR can be considered and/or evaluated. This language should be deleted from the
RDEIR."

Response to Comment C7-18: This part of the RDEIR is intended to explain that General Plan policies can conceivably include measures that encourage conversion of farmland or forest land. For instance, the General Plan Update could replace policies encouraging continued productivity of commercial timberlands for others that threaten their continued timber production. While this is not the approach of the General Plan Update, it is important for the reader to understand that a General Plan could facilitate
conversion of timberland to other uses not involving commercial timber production.
The Responses to Comments C7-1 through C7-4 also address Comment C7-18. No
further changes to the RDEIR are necessary to respond to this comment.

Comment C7-19: The commenter states: "The fourth paragraph, last sentence of page 3.2-19 is misleading in that conversion of timberland does not directly result from the subdivision or the sale of individual patents or legal parcels."
Response to Comment C7-19: The RDEIR on page 3.2.19 is revised as follows: "Conversion Adverse impacts to resource land can also occur when parcel sizes of
resource lands (for both agricultural and timberlands) become too small for economic
viability through either subdivisions or the-breek-up-of ranches ane timber-holdings-from

the sell-off of patent and/or legal parcels [primarily substandard parcels) and subsequent development of the property for other uses."

Comment C7-20: The commenter notes that, "Under the heading "Trinidad Planning
Watershed, Changes from T on page 3.2-32, the 42 acres referenced as being east of
Big lagoon is believed to be GDRCo property for Page 11 of 56 - GDRCO GPU RDEIR Comments which GDRCo submitted a change in land use designation. GDRCo had initially made a request to have the land use designation changed from T to RE so that the land use would conform with what was an existing residential use. GDRCo no longer provides residential use of this approximately 42-acre property and subsequently requested that the land use be changed from T to CR..."

Response to Comment C7-20: The RDEIR on page 3.2.32 is revised as follows:
"Approximately 42 acres proposed to be changed to RE CR are located on the east
side of Big Lagoon. Approximately -and-anether 172 acres are located east of Trinidad along Stumptown Road, Westhaven Drive, and Adams Foxfarm Road are proposed to be changed to RE."
Comment C7-21: The commenter states that, "The last paragraph of page 3.2-34 contains the title "Conversion as a result of increased parcelization and subsequent is development" which is materially misleading and unsubstantiated by the subsequent
content."

Response to Comment C7-21: The heading of the last paragraph of page 3.2-34 is revised as follows: "Cenversion as e-result of inereased pParcelization and subsequent
development".

Comment C7-22: The commenter states in the first paragraph on page 3.2-35 the County insinuates that the "compliance with the Subdivision Map Act is somehow being
avoided through the recognition, sale or purchase of patents and/or legal parcels."

Response to Comment C7-22: The RDEIR first paragraph on page 3.2-35 is deleted as
follows, "The County has witnessed the increased use of recognizing legal pareels, in pertieuler land-patents, on reseuree lands as a-teel te-break up and sell-eff smaller pareels-independently of the-Subdivision-Map-Act-procedures-that-would- typieally ensure-conformity with the-General Plan."
Comment C7-23: The commenter believes the discussion in the second paragraph on page 3.2-35 regarding patent parcels is both speculative and subjective, and suggests a revision to the last sentence to "specify that any unaltered or altered patent parcel found to be in conformance with the Subdivision Map Act Determination of Status process would retain its historic rights."
Response to Comment C7-23: The RDEIR first paragraph on page 3.2-35 is revised as
follows, "Although a complete review has not been conducted on these patent parcels, many of these retain their historic rights. Patent parcels that have been altered
through subdivision, merger or lot line adjustment may also be recognized as legally

through a Determination of Status process."

Comment C7-24: The commenter states "discussion in the third paragraph on page 3.2- 35 comingles the Determination of Status process (i.e. Certificates of Compliance) and development criteria which are not mutually exclusive... The information provided in this paragraph should be revised to clearly state that the Determination of Status not contingent upon development criteria." process is

Response to Comment C7-24: The third paragraph on page 3.2-35 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: "Because the Determination of Status process is not contingent upon

Comment C7-25: The commenter states, "the first paragraph under 'Other changes that could result in Conversion of Farmland or Forestland' on page 3.2-35 and discussion regarding conversion as used in the subsection title should be limited to the definition of Timberland Conversion as provided in the Forest Practice Act (Title 14, Article 7).'
Response to Comment C7-25: There are other forms of timberland conversion that do not appear in the definition of Timberland Conversion in the Forest Practice Act2, so it is
not appropriate to limit the use of the term as suggested in this comment. As noted in
response to some of the previous comments, the term "impacts to timberland" is better
suited and has been substituted for the term "conversion". The changes to the RDEIR
made in response to comments C7-1 through C7-4 also address this comment. No other changes to the RDEIR are needed to respond to this comment.
Comment C7-26: The commenter states, "The third paragraph, first sentence of page 3.2-36 contains a general statement without sufficient facts to support the conclusion. Conflicts may occur however it must be recognized that timber harvesting is a relatively
short-lived event with short term disruptions as compared to ongoing timber management activities and, as the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report and updates clearly recognize, any "conflicts" greatly diminish on parcels in excess of 20 acres in size. Again the Use of the term conversion should be limited to the definition of
Timberland Conversion as provided in the Forest Practice Act (Title 14, Article 7).

2 "Timberland Conversion" is defined in as :(1) Within non-Timberland Production Zone (TPZ) timberland, transforming timberland to a non-timber growing use through timber operations where:
(A) Future timber harvests will be prevented or infeasible because of land occupancy and activities thereon; or (B) Stocking requirements of the applicable district forest practice rules will not be met within five years after completion of timber
operations; or (C) There is a clear intent to divide timberland into ownerships of less than three acres.
Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 192

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C7-26: The third paragraph, first sentence of page 3.2-36 of the RDEIR is revised as follows, "Conflicts between timber operations and surrounding
residential land uses {mest-eften, residenees}-often-oeeur, and-een-cause-a-disruptien
in harvest and ultimate can make commercial timber operations more difficult and
expensive conversion of timberlands-te-other uses."

Comment C7-27: The commenter states, "The third paragraph, third sentence of page 3.2-36 should be changed as follows: the term 'limiting incompatible uses' should be
further clarified to state 'limiting incompatible uses consistent with Government Code
51100-51104'."

Response to Comment C7-27: Government Code 51100-51104 describes the uses that are compatible with timber production in areas zoned TPZ - Timber Production Zone. Since some areas with a General Plan Land Use designation of "T - Timber Production" in the County are not zoned TPZ, this section of the Government Code does not apply in some areas assessed in the RDEIR, so it would be inaccurate to make the requested change. No changes to the RDEIR are needed to respond to this comment.
Comment C7-28: The commenter states, "The sixth paragraph, first sentence on page 3.2-39, regarding the use of the term "parcelization", is again misleading. Neither the RDEIR nor the Board of Supervisors' approved draft General Plan Update provides any definition for "parcelization". If the term, as used in the first sentence of the sixth paragraph on page 3.2-39 of the RDEIR assumes that a Certificate of Compliance constitutes parcelization, then this is a false and misleading statement and should be
revised accordingly. Likewise, every conveyance of land constitutes a "parcelization" to some extent-the purpose of the El R is analyze detrimental environmental effects, without evaluating parcel size relative to any discussion of "parcelization" and/or "fragmentation" renders the entire narrative vague and unsupported.

Response to Comment C7-28: The sixth paragraph, first sentence on page 3.2-39 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: "The Plan also does not fully protect against the loss of timber
lands from inereased-percelization on parcels that are too small to be economically viable for timber production on their own. Current County Code contains a Merger
Ordinance that directs the County to merge substandard parcels zoned TPZ into those
that meet density requirements; however, this ordinance was never fully implemented. The proposed Plan recommends revising this section of the code to remove the merger requirement because it was not implemented. On parcels that are too small to be economically viable for timber production on their own, Ethis will-ellew may lead to a higher density of development on lands planned T and cause conversion of resulting in land use changes from timberlands to rural residential, illicit cannabis cultivation or other non-timber uses. Therefere, the This potential loss of timber lands cannot be
mitigated to a level of insignificance once these lands they are converted to a non-
timber land use, and therefore is a significant unavoidable impact of the General Plan
Update."

Comment C7-29: The In the sixth paragraph, starting with the third sentence on page 3.2-39 and continuing onto page 3.2-40, the discussion assumes that the non- implementation of the Merger Ordinance will cause the "conversion" or "loss" of

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 193

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

timberlands to rural residential uses. This assumption is entirely unsupported and the narrative in the RDEIR lacks context. Again, the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003
Resource Report does provide context in this regard (i.e., recognizing density at less
than 20 acres to cause fragmentation concerns), but the RDEIR makes no effort to
define "parcelization" or "fragmentation" in a meaningful, substantive manner. The narrative is vague, unsupported and should be stricken... The fourth sentence of the sixth paragraph on page 3.2-39 should be deleted as it is not adequately substantiated.
Response to Comment C7-29: As explained in Response to Comment 28, the RDEIR is
being revised to clarify the impact of the General Plan being considered in the RDEIR
involves the conversion of parcels that are too small to be economically viable for timber production, such as those that could be developed at a density of less than 20
acres, as recognized in the 2003 FRAP Forest Resource and Range Report cited by the
commenter. No further modifications to the RDEIR are necessary to respond to this
comment.

Comment C7-30: The commenter states, "The first paragraph on page 3.2-40 contains information that is misleading because the term "conversion" infers that the timber growing capacity of resource production lands is lost if is used in conjunction with rural residential purposes. This gross generalization gives no consideration to parcel size and fails to recognize that these parcels likely retain the land use and zoning that support resource production and can provide ecological benefits as well, as expressly concluded in the 2003 FRAP Forest and Range 2003 Resource Report for parcels 20 acres or greater... The finding provided here that there is a significant unavoidable impact is unsubstantiated and inaccurate if the County presumes (as the RDEIR text implies) that "conversion" occurs as a result of either the sale of individual patents/legal parcels or the residential use of timber resource lands. This implicit finding relies upon a false narrative without any context and should be re-evaluated by limiting the use of
the term "conversion" in a manner that is consistent with the is Forest Practice Act."

Response to Comment C7-30: The first paragraph on page 3.2-40 of the RDEIR is revised as follows: "The Plan also does not fully protect against the loss of resource production lands from conversion to rural residential or other non-timber uses. Limiting housing on lands-parcels that are too small to be economically viable for timber production on their own which are presently managed for as industrial timberlands may help prevent the conversion of these resource production lands to other uses, but this policy option is
not considered feasible because it could significantly diminish the economic value of those lands. Therefore, the This potential loss of timber lands on parcels that are too
small to be economically viable for timber production on their own (for example, some
parcels less than 20 acres in size) which are presently managed as industrial timberlands cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance once these lands are converted to a non-timber land use, and therefore, is a significant unavoidable impact of the General
Plan Update."
Comment C7-31: The commenter suggests the fourth paragraph, first sentence; T as used at the end of this sentence should be revised to be TPZ.

Chapter 2 Comment Letters and Responses for the RDEIR Page 2- 194

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

Response to Comment C7-31: The fourth paragraph, first sentence on page 3.2-40 of
the RDEIR is revised as follows, "The General Plan Update land use map maintains
existing or equivalent agricultural or timber production land use designations for lands under Williamson Act Contract or lands zoned TPZ."
Comment C7-32: The commenter states, "Mitigation 3.3.3.2.a.; It should be recognized that the mitigation proposed is an onerous undertaking and it is likely unrealistic that
such an evaluation could be completed within a two-year timeframe. The County, under current State regulations, is required to evaluate critical watersheds.

If Mitigation 3.3.3.2.a. is adopted the sole cost of completing said evaluation should be
the responsibility of the County, not individual project applicants, and any failure on the part of the County to complete the evaluation within the specified two-year timeframe should not result in a de facto moratorium on development or any other project in a given watershed."
Response to Comment C7-32: Mitigation 3.3.3.2.a. is revised as follows:
"WR-IMx. Water Supply Evaluation and Monitoring. Conduct watershed level evaluations within two years after the adoption of the General Plan Update to dletermine the ensure sufficient long term surface and groundwater supply, including seasonal, average, dry year, and multiple dry year supplies, and beneficial uses of water to-determine-an-estimate ef the quantity ef water will be available for the level of future development described in the Revised Draft EIR for the GPU. Work
with water and wastewater related special districts, regulators, and other appropriate organizations to monitor watershed conditions.

Comment C7-33: The commenter states, "Impact 3.11.3.5. Habitat Conservation Plans;
suggest the first sentence under this subchapter be revised as follows:
'Implementation of the General Plan Update could result in additional development. that conflicts with adopted habitat conservation plans".
This suggested change is relevant considering that an HCP may provide for limited land use changes and therefore be an absolute conflict.
Response to Comment C7-33: Page 3.11-17 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Implementation of the General Plan Update weuld could result in additional
development that conflicts with adopted habitat conservation plans."

Comment C7-34: The commenter states, "First paragraph, beginning with the fourth
sentence; the information provided in the RDEIR herein is misleading and hyperbolic.

As stated in Chapter 2 of the RDEIR, 'The RDEIR is focused on the environmental effects
which may reasonably be expected to occur during the 24-year planning period of the GPU, 2016-2024, as described in subchapters 2.1 and 2.5 below'. Table 2.5-1 on page 2- 24 of the RDEIR provides the estimated number of dwelling units by land use designation that will be required to accommodate the estimated maximum feasible housing development and potential and projected development from 2016 to 2040.

planned Tor TC the estimate provided is 44 housing units assuming that peak demand occurs in 2028. The discussion provided on page 3.11-17, under 'Analysis of Relevant General Plan Update Policies', should be limited to the scope of the Project as
described in the RDEIR. The discussion which refers to the theoretical construction of as many as "20,000 dwelling units" on lands planned Timberlands (T) is completely hyperbolic and irrelevant as the analysis of relevant General Plan Update policies related to land planned T. Specifically, in order to maintain internal consistency, the
number of dwelling units on lands zoned T considered in the RDEIR should be limited to the estimated 44 units as identified in the RDEIR. The "20,000" unit assumption is entirely misplaced and without support. Furthermore, the presumption, as framed, violates
accepted EIR scoping and project description standards under CEQA. (See legal opinion appended as Attachment B).

The discussion provided under Analysis of Relevant General Plan Update Policies
regarding the planned densities and theoretical maximum buildout of lands planned T to "20,000 units" should be removed as it is outside the scope of the Project as described in the RDEIR and it is not substantiated by any analysis elsewhere in the RDEIR."
Response to Comment C7-34: The fourth and fifth sentences of the first paragraph on Page 3.11-18 of the RDEIR are revised as follows: "Under the proposed General Plan
Update, residential uses are planned at densities of 40 to 160 acres per dwelling unit on

Letter C8 Steven S. Madrone

To: Planning Director and Humboldt County Board of Supervisors From: Stephen Sungnome Madrone, Parcel #515-291-12 Date: 6-30-17
RE: Public Comment on Draft EIR on GPU

Dear Director, Chair and members of the Board:

have several comments.

The county has illegally recommended a GP Designation of RA 5-20 for parcels 515-291-047, 515-291-048, 515-291-049, and 515-291-050. The zoning for these parcels is 20 acre AE. The current GP designation is 1 acre dispersed housing, but that is old and from the 1970's. The new recommendation from the Planning Commission in 2014 was 20-acre minimums but the Board of Supervisors changed this at its June 25th 2015 public hearing.
This public hearing notified parcel owners of any changes proposed for their zoning and it gave adjacent parcel owners a chance to offer public comment. What the public was not notified of was the fact that at this June 25th hearing changes were made in the GP Designation for these 4 parcels listed above.
Without any public notice of a possible change, The Board of Supervisors (BOS) agreed to re-designate these parcels as 5-20 acre minimums. There was C8-1
opposition to this from the City of Trinidad, and several local residents, but the BOS overruled that input from a Referral Agency (the City). When the BOS Chair asked the County Planner why the Planning Commission had recommended such low densities, the planner said it was because of water supply and fisheries issues and that "there were no overriding considerations for recommending higher densities". The BOS then proceeded to approve higher densities simply by asking the BOS rep from that district what his preference was. Supervisor Sundberg recommended higher densities without stating any "overriding considerations". This is illegal and a violation of CEQA.
The EIR should stay with the earlier planning commission recommendation of 20- 80 acre minimums. The reasons for this are well documented in the files for the
subdivision of these parcels as part of the Moss Minor Subdivision.

Please change these designations.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

Sincerely,

Stephen. S. Madrone

Response to Steven S. Madrone - Letter C8

Comment C8-1: The commenter objects to the land use designations tentatively approved by the Board of Supervisors on a set of parcels in the Foxfarm Road neighborhood in Westhaven, and requests the land use designations recommended by the Planning Commission for these properties be applied instead.
Response to Comment C8-1: Comment noted. The land use designation tentatively approved by the Board of Supervisors will result in lower densities than what is currently allowed by the General Plan, and is consistent with the existing zoning that applies to the property. The comment does not address the RDEIR text. No changes to the RDEIR are needed to respond to this comment.

"A study of the County's agricultural and timberland conversions identified substantial amounts of land potentially lost to production through zone reclassifications, subdivisions, and conditionally permitted uses that conflict with
agricultural and timber operations (Humboldt County Forest Resources and Policy Report, October 2003, updated in 2008). In addition to conversion occurring because of General Plan amendments and new subdivisions, resource lands may be eonverted impacted through a combination of the Certificate of Compliance process, which involves recognition of historic parcels that may be substandard to minimum parcel sizes and densities established by the General Plan and other actions such as subdivisions or issuance of timberland conversion permits.
Approximately 25 percent of all the Certificate of Compliance applications submitted from 1985 - 2000 occurred on agricultural properties and timberlands, affecting more than 18,000 acres. From 2001 to June 2005, this rate increased from
25 percent to over 67 percent, affecting over 53,000 acres. While some of those
actions were precursors to conversion of timberland to other uses, most notably illicit cannabis cultivation, others provided for more efficient timber management.'

By 2008, the total gross value of timber dropped to $108 million, 25 percent less than the 2007 gross value of $147 million. According to the California State Board of Equalization, between 2010 and
2015, the total value for Humboldt County's timber harvest has fluctuated between approximately $68 million and $71 million, with a high of $81 million in 2014."

"There has also been an overall decrease in acres held by industrial timber owners in the past eight years. During the years of 2001 through 2008, industrial timberland owners transferred approximately 8 percent (51,000 acres) of their total ownership of forest lands for purposes ranging from sales to public agencies (primarily BLM) to rural residential development: Many of the affected companies were heavily reliant upon timber from the US Forest Service and when the supply from the US Forest
Service dropped, the sawmills closed, and all assets were typically liquated,
including timberland holdings."

The fourth paragraph on page 3.2-18 of the RDEIR is revised as follows,
"The protection of forestlands and their timber producing capabilities was one of

Page 3.5-7 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Rural areas and small communities do not often have pedestrian facilities that are
separated from the roadway. Pedestrians and bicyclists frequently utilize roads in
Humboldt County that lack sidewalks and/or bicycle lanes. As a result, sharing of
roadways by pedestrians, car and truck drivers, bicyclists, and even equestrians, is common in many rural areas. While equine use does not constitute a significant detectable portion of daily commuter travel in Humboldt County, equestrian trails can be a significant recreational resource. A number of community and public land trail systems provide transportation and recreation opportunities; however, most of the facilities dedicated exclusively for non-motorized use are provided only in urban
areas of the County."

Page 3.5-8 of the RDEIR is revised as follows:
"Pedestrian facilities are most commonly found in the County's seven cities and larger unincorporated communities. Sidewalks and pathways of varying width are found in commercial areas, residential neighborhoods, and near schools. In many cases, existing sidewalks meet only the minimum ADA standards and often are
obstructed by utility poles, signposts, and other obstacles. There are also sidewalk
gaps, uncontrolled intersections, and street crossings that pose pedestrian travel impediments, especially to the mobility-impaired.
Most facilities dedicated for bicycle use are in the urban and suburban areas of the
County, with bicycle lanes in place in Eureka, Arcata, McKinleyville and Fortuna. The
City of Arcata provides the most interconnected system of bicycle lanes/routes that facilitates access to and from a number of trip-generating areas. In Eureka, the bike lane/route system includes both north-south and east-west lanes; however, not all trip generating areas are connected. Fortuna has limited systems of bike lanes and
designated routes. "

Chapter 4. Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
Program

This Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) has been prepared to comply with the requirements of State law (Public Resources Code Section 21081.6). State law requires the adoption of an MMRP when mitigation measures are required to
avoid significant impacts. The MMRP is intended to ensure compliance with mitigation
measures during implementation of the project.

This MMRP has been formulated based upon the findings of the RDEIR, and the comments received on the RDEIR and addressed herein. This MMRP identifies mitigation measures recommended in the RDEIR to avoid or reduce identified impacts, and
specifies the parties responsible for, and timing of, their implementation and
monitoring/reporting.

Table IV-1 below comprises the core of the MMRP and is explained as follows:

• The first column includes mitigation measures identified in the GPU EIR. The Policies, Standards and Implementation Measures included in the GPU itself, which serve to reduce the potential impacts of the GPU below a threshold of significance (in most
cases) are part of the 'project', and are therefore not included in the table. The mitigation measures included in the table provide amended or additional GPU text, Policies, Standards or Implementation Measures required to insure potential impacts are sufficiently mitigated.
The second column entitled "Party Responsible for Implementation" refers to the person(s), in this case County personnel, who will undertake the mitigation measures.
The third column entitled "Implementation Method and Timing" identifies how the mitigation measure will be implemented, and when and/or for how long implementation will take. This column may include a citation for an Implementation
Measure(s) associated with a policy included in a mitigation measure as further
demonstration of how that policy will be implemented.
Note that all mitigation measures require the amendment of or addition of GPU text,
Policies, Standards or Implementation Measures. The timing for the additions or
amendments will be upon adoption of the GPU by the Board of Supervisors with the
actual edits to the GPU occurring within 1 to 2 months. The timing and responsible party for these actions will not be further addressed in the table below.
The party responsible for monitoring the implementation of the mitigation measures, and the timing for that monitoring, is also part of the MMRP. Pursuant to Section
15097(b) of the CEQA Guidelines, "where the project at issue is the adoption of a general plan, specific plan, community plan or other plan-level document (zoning,

Chapter 4 Mitigation and Monitoring Program Page 4-

Humboldt County General Plan Final EIR

ordinance, regulation, policy), the monitoring plan shall apply to policies and any other portion of the plan that is a mitigation measure or adopted alternative. The monitoring plan may consist of policies included in plan-level documents. The annual report on general plan status required pursuant to the Government Code is one example of a reporting program for adoption of a city or county general plan." Long Range Planning will be the Responsible Monitoring Party for implementation of the mitigation identified in the MMRP. The County's annual report to the California Office of Planning and Research, reporting on the County's progress implementing the General Plan, is prepared by Long Range Planning, and will serve to provide the monitoring and reporting portion of the MMRP annually.
