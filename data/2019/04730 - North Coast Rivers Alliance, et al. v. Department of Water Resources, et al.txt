27 and respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and by this Verified Petition for Writ of
28 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorney's Fees (*Verified

/Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees

1 Petition") hereby allege as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

4 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC') section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), the Delta Reform Act

5 ("DRA"), Water Code section 85000, et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action

6 to challenge DWR's November 13, 2018, Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report

7 ("FEIR") for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project ("Project"), and December 11, 2018, Project
8 approval. In taking these actions DWR violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust

9 Doctrine.

10 2. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public agencies to

11 examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect
12 California's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency
13 actions.

14 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider
15 alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does neither.

16 4. The Project extends the terms of the State Water Project ("SWP") contracts to December

17 31, 2085, without adequately examining the environmental impacts of doing so, without studying a

18 reasonable range of alternatives, and without compliance with other state law protecting the

19 environment.

20 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

21 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

22 ("CCP") sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus);

23 PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California

24 Constitution.

25 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers)

26 and 395 (actions generally) because DWR's offices are located in Sacramento.

27 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a

28 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 2-

F served DWR with notice of this suit.

PARTIES 2

3 8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit

4 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California.-North Coast Rivers was-

5 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of

6 excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and

7 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds

8 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North
Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will

10 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the

11 Project.

12 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt

13 organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the communities

14 that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR

15 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR

16 seeks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has
17 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection
18 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR
19 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.
20 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to

21 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.

22 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS

23 ("PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

24 San Francisco, California. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

25 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined

26 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial

27 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's

28 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 3 -

salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its
2 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing
3 livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta

4 and its associated ecosystems.

5 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco

6 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats

7 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in

8 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento

9 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in
10 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich

11 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco

12 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DWR's Project approval because it would threaten

13 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected

14 ecosystems.

15 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
16 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The

17 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural
18 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of

19 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta"). The
20 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced

21 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other

22 environmental harms that implementation of the Project will allow.

23 13. Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

24 ("DWR") is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of

25 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on November

26 13, 2018, and approval of the Project on December 11, 2018, was subject to and violated the

27 requirements of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency

28 under CEQA for environmental review of the Project.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 4 -

14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to

2 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

3 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the

4 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in
part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

6 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe

7 respondents have been ascertained.

8 15. Real party in interest State Water Contractors ("SWC") is a non-profit corporation
composed of and representing public water agencies throughout California that have contracted with

10 DWR to receive SWP water. The Project purports to amend the contract terms that govern DWR's

11 delivery of water to SWC members.

12 16. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to

13 PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any specific real parties in

14 interest exist. However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is
15 necessary, petitioners have identified SWC as a potential real party in interest. The true names and

16 capacities of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore

17 sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners are
18 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real

19 parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
20 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe real parties

21 in interest have been ascertained.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 17. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate

24 their substantial beneficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.

25 18. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified

26 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

27 required by law.

28 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 5 -

the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

2 DWR's Certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project, and ordering it to comply with the laws
whose violation is alleged herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are

4 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other

5 legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the

6 environment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct.

7 20. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual

8 controversy exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

9 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitioners are
10 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is

11 therefore necessary and appropriate.

12 21. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of

13 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project

14 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental

15 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to DWR's failure to take the required

16 steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et

17 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

18 LEGAL BACKGROUND

19 CEOA

20 22. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

21 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

22 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

23 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

24 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

25 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible

26 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)

27 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.

28 23. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
|Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 6 -

P [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

2 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. Mountain

3 Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; PRC §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D),
4 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects

5 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of

6 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

7 24. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary

8 projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is a "public agency" and a "state agency" as defined in CEQA. PRC §
9 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.
10 25. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the
11 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the
12 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and
13 Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory
14 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and recognized under CEQA
15 Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the
16 California Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2),
17 15300-15333 and 15354.

18 26. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that a
19 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those effects and
20 suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve
21 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant environmental effects. PRC §§
22 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.
23 27. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid
24 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA's
25 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,
26 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only
27 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.

The Delta Reform Act

2 28. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature

3 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and

4 California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water

5 Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that "the Delta' a is a critically important

6 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the

7 California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North

8 and South America." Water Code § 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization

9 of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added.
10 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,
11 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water
12 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state
13 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." § Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.
14 29. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta
15 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight
16 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

17 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state

18 over the long term.

19 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta as an evolving place.

20 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem. 21

22 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.

23 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.
24 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.

25 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency
26 preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.

27 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.

28 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees . 8 -

30. The Legislature also declared that:

2 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for
4 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

6 Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

7 The Public Trust Doctrine

8 31. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
10| particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

11 32. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted

12 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions

13 they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,

14 sO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society

15 Court went on to explain:

16 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative 17 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state
18 may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In sO

19 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the

20 uses protected by the trust.

21 Id., citations omitted.

22 33. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

23 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

24 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

25 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

26 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] .. . the

27 preservation of those lands in their natural state, sO that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
28 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
|Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 9-

1 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

2 34. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

3 the public trust doctrine . . . . [,] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

4 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

5 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. V. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A]

6 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

7 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at 570.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 35. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and
10 international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest

11 and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in

12 peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of

13 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." Id.

14 36. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two

15 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for
16 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California (or "State") Water Project (SWP").

17 Second, for too long, agricultural diverters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off

18 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are

19 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,
20 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

21 37. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

22 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant

23 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in

24 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run

25 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been

26 driven perilously close to extirpation.

27 38. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered

28 Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population declines,

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 10 -

declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its

2 tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared

3 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

4 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat

5 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of

6 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical

7 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fed.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58

8 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

9 39. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and diversions

10 that would have destroyed the free-flowing rivers of California's North Coast and removed additional

11 essential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steelhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was

12 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre feet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,

13 DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all

14 but the wettest of water years.

15 40. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water

16 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that

17 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas

18 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils

19 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and

20 sodium chlorides and sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries

21 threatens the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

22 41. DWR's existing waters supply contracts with the SWC begin to expire in 2035 and the last

23 ends by 2042. DWR states that an extension of these contracts is necessary to finance capital

24 expenditures for the SWP through the use of revenue bonds. DWR entered into a negotiation process a

25 regarding potential terms for its contract extensions, and petitioners provided detailed comments

26 regarding the environmental impacts and considerations that must be addressed during the contract

27 extension process that became the Project, including comments dated July 3, 2013, July 10, 2013, and
28 January 29, 2014, by PCFFA, and March 3, 2014 by PCFFA and the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees -11 -

1 42. On or about September 12, 2014 DWR issued a Notice of Preparation notifying the public

2 that it would act as the lead agency for the preparation of an EIR for the Project. That Notice of

3 Preparation identified the Project as "amending certain provisions of the State Water Resources

4 Development System (SWRDS) Water Supply Contracts.»

5 43. In response to the Notice of Preparation, in October 2014, petitioners PCFFA, IFR, North

6 Coast Rivers, San Francisco Fishermen, and other environmental groups, agencies, and members of the

7 public submitted detailed scoping comments to DWR. Commentors raised concerns regarding the scope

8 of DWR's Project and exclusion of interrelated decisions and approvals. Commentors raised concerns

9 regarding the ways in which climate change and sea level rise will occur during the Project's term and
10 the need to examine how the Project's impacts would change over time. Commentors requested that

11 DWR disclose and analyze the Project's potential changes regarding responsibility for fish, wildlife and

12 recreation mitigation measures. And commentors requested that DWR study alternatives that reduced

13 total contract amounts in light of the SWP's historic over-allocation and likely reduction in available

14 water over the duration of the Project, and that established water conservation standards for SWP water,

15 among other concerns.

16 44. In August 2016, DWR released its Draft EIR for the Project. The Draft EIR failed to

17 address many of the concerns raised during the scoping process.

18 45. Petitioner PCFFA provided detailed comments on DWR's Draft EIR via letter dated
19 October 17, 2016. These comments highlighted DWR's failure to address the Project's impacts, refusal

20 to study appropriate Project alternatives, and improper piecemealing of its environmental analysis.

21 46. PCFFA and IFR submitted additional comments on the Project that DWR received on or

22 about August 13, 2018.

23 47. IFR, North Coast Rivers and San Francisco Fishermen, along with other concerned

24 organizations, submitted additional comments regarding the Project that DWR received on or about

25 September 25, 2018.

26 48. On November 13, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth certified the FEIR.

27 49. On December 11, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth approved the Project.

28 50. DWR's Notice of Determination was received by the Governor's Office of Planning and

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Violation of CEQA)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 51. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

6 reference.

7 52. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, on

8 the grounds that DWR committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner

9 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.

10 53. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about

11 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential

12 alternatives to the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter

13 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
14 potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).

15 The FEIR's Analysis Is Improperly Segmented

16 54. CEQA requires agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may have

17 significant environmental impacts. Guidelines 15064(a)(1). CEQA defines "project" to mean "the

18 whole of an action." Guidelines § 15378(a). "The term 'project' refers to the activity which is being

19 approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The

20 term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." Guidelines § 15378(c).

21 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when
22 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc. for

23 Sensible Development of Bishop Area V. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." Guidelines cop

24 15003(h), see also Guidelines § 15378(a), (c).

25 55. CEQA thus intends to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become submerged

26 by chopping a large project into many little ones each with a minimal potential impact on the

27 environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local Agency

28 Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 13 -

1 56. Here, instead of studying all of its interdependent actions together, DWR has improperly

2 segmented its analysis of the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

3 Management and California WaterFix from its analysis and consideration of the Project. DWR

4 circulated a Draft EIR for the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

5 Management and California Waterfix for public comment in October 2018. Yet DWR's Project

6 approval is necessary for its implementation of WaterFix and its related contract amendments.

7 57. This segmentation violates CEQA's demand for unified and comprehensive environmental

8 review:

9 Theoretical independence is not a good reason for segmenting the environmental analysis

10 of the two matters. Doing so runs the risk that some environmental impacts produced by the way the two matters combine or interact might not be analyzed in the separate
11 environmental reviews. Furthermore, if the two matters are analyzed in sequence . . . and the combined or interactive environmental effects are not fully recognized until the review of the second matter, the opportunity to implement effective mitigation measures as part 12 of the first matter may be lost. This could result in mitigation measures being adopted in

13 the second matter that are less effective than what would have been adopted if the matters had been analyzed as a single project.

14 Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214,

15 1230. DWR's segmented review subverts CEQA's informational purposes.

16 DWR's No Project Alternative Violates CEQA

17 58. The CEQA Guidelines direct that "[t]he 'no project' analysis shall discuss the existing

18 conditions at the time the notice of preparation is published .. . as well as what would be reasonably

19 expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the project were not approved . . . ." (Guidelines !
20 15126.6(e)(2).)

21 59. DWR's No Project Alternative improperly assumes that the SWP contracts would be

22 renewed absent the Project, and that all water deliveries would occur with or without the Project. As

23 such the scenario examined in the environmental documents does not describe a situation where an

24 agency approval is not granted. Instead it describes a scenario where a different Project alternative is

25 approved, and SWP water deliveries continue. DWR has not examined the environmental conditions of

26 the Project against an appropriate No Project Alterative where these deliveries are not made. This failure

27 violates CEQA.

28 ///

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 14 -

DWR Failed to Fully Consider A Reasonable Range of Alternatives and
Dismissed Feasible Alternatives from Review
2

60. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even

4 if they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

5 Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

6 61. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow

7 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

8 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible

9 alternatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project

10 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.

11 Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).

12 62. The FEIR fails to study a reasonable range of alternatives, including an alternative that

13 significantly reduces deliveries, or an alternative that implements conservation targets. Instead, DWR

14 dismissed any reduced contract quantity alternatives or water conservation target alternatives from

15 detailed analysis before it prepared its Draft EIR.

16 63. All but one of the Alternatives studied in the FEIR contemplate the same level of water

17 deliveries, and only vary in end year and financial structure. For this reason, DWR concludes that

18 Alternatives 2 through 6 have the same impacts as the Project. Alternative 7 would extend the end-date

19 of the contracts to 2085 but allows some current contractors to "choose not to sign." None of these

20 Alternatives are sufficiently distinct to provide a reasonable range of alternatives under CEQA.

•21 64. Because none of the Alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive

22 exports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the FEIR failed to analyze a reasonable range of

23 alternatives as CEQA requires.

24 The FEIR Improperly Concludes That the Project Has No Impacts

25 65. DWR concludes that the Project will have no impact on any resource topics "because it

26 would amend and add financial provisions" to its SWP contracts and "would not create new water

27 management measures, alter the existing authority to build or modify existing SWP facilities, or change

28 water allocation provisions" of those contracts. ES-4. But DWR overlooks the essential purpose of the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 15 -

1 Project's contracts to deliver water through the SWP. DWR's SWP water deliveries have impacts to

2 the source and receiving watersheds, including impacts on important habitat, yet DWR fails to consider

3 these impacts as impacts of the Project. DWR's failure to address the impacts of Project approval
4 violates CEQA.

5 66. DWR also improperly concludes that the Project has no cumulative impacts. Id. But DWR

6 has failed to examine the closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future

7 projects that, when taken with the Project's water deliveries, will result in significant cumulative

8 impacts. This violates CEQA.
9 DWR Fails to Analyze Changed Circumstances

10 67. DWR's FEIR relies upon the 1986 Coordinated Operating Agreement ("COA") between
11 DWR and the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to describe the operating criteria for
12 the SWP, and assumes that Project operations will be constrained by the 1986 COA. Yet as DWR

13 prepared the FEIR, it was actively renegotiating the COA with Reclamation, and executed an addendum
14 to the COA the day after it approved the Project. The FEIR fails to address this reasonably foreseeable
15 change in SWP operations as either part of the Project itself or a closely related and reasonably
16 foreseeable probable project, despite its likely significant cumulative impacts.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)
19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20 68. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
21 reference.

22 69. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., was passed by the Legislature in
23 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water
24 infrastructure are in crisis" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the

25 state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was
26 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provide
27 for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the
28 Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 16 -

1 legally enforceable Delta Plan." § Id. § 85001(c).

2 70. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered

3 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

4 action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship

5 Council. Water Code $ 85225.

71. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined

7 by PRC section 21065 that:

8 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.
(2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency.

10 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

11 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

12 goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.
13 Water Code 85057.5(a). While the Delta Reform Act states that "[rJoutine maintenance and operation
14 of the State Water Project" is not a covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption

15 because it is neither routine maintenance nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).

16 72. The 2013 Delta Plan prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set

17 aside by the Sacramento Superior Court because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reform

18 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated

19 with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring
20 more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with the Delta Reform Act.3
21 Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. The Delta

22 Stewardship Council's appeal of this decision is pending before the Third District Court of Appeal (Case

23 No. C082944). In addition, petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's

24 2018 Delta Plan Amendments, as those amendments violate CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public

25 Trust Doctrine and other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacrament Superior Court Case Nos.
26 34-2018-80002898, 34-2018-80002900, 34-2018-80002901, 34-2018-80002904.

27 73. DWR denies that the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act. FEIR 2-100.

28 But under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve the Project without first making a determination

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 17 -

of consistency with the Delta Plan. Water Code 85225. And because approval of the Project continues
2 DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the
Delta is Reform Act's coequal goals, the Project is inherently inconsistent with what would be required by

4 any valid Delta Plan.
74. Because DWR failed to "prepare written certification of consistency with detailed findings

6 as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,

7 its approval must be set aside. Water Code § 85225.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)
10 • (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
11 75. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
12 reference.

13 76. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
14 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
15 particularly important and applicable to the Delta.33

16 77. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
17 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
18 they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
19 So far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
20 Court went on to explain:

21 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative 22 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

23 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In SO doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the 24 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as uses protected by the trust. consistent with the public interest, the
25

26 Id., citations omitted.

27 78. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and
28 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

/Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees . 18 -

general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

2 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For
nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the

4 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

5 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

6 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

7 79. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and

8 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Despite public comment regarding the Project's
9 impacts to public trust resources, DWR declined to address or examine the issue in its FEIR.

10 80. Feasible alternatives exist that would mitigate or avoid these significant impacts, including,

11 but not limited to a reduced Table A alternative, or an alternative that incorporates water conservation

12 goals. Such alternatives would reduce diversions, have beneficial effects on fish and wildlife, and attain

13 most of the Project's basic objectives.

14 81. By approving the Project despite the fact that feasible alternatives exist that would preserve

15 public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, DWR abdicated its affirmative statutory and

16 constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever feasible,"

17 based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on public trust

18 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

21 Project Approvals as Contrary to CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

22 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

23 82. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

24 reference.

25 83. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to

26 approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085

27 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:

28 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law;

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
|Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 19 -

1 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

2 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

3 before DWR.

4 84. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects, among

5 others:

6 a. DWR violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

7 b. DWR violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged hereinabove; and

8 C. DWR violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged hereinabove.
9 85. DWR's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures required by
10 CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded DWR's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of
11 discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:
14 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR from taking any action to
15 carry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

16 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to set aside and vacate its approval of the
17 Project, and certification of its FEIR;

18 3. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful;
19 4. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all activity implementing the
20 Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it has taken all
21 actions necessary to bring its approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA, the Delta
22 Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and the Code of Civil Procedure;

1 Petition") hereby allege as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

4 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code (*PRC') section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), the Delta Reform Act

5 ("DRA"), Water Code section 85000, ct seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action

6 to challenge DWR's November 13, 2018, Cettification of the Final Environmental Impact Report

7 ("FEIR") for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project ("Project"), and December 11, 2018, Project

8 approval. In taking these actions DWR violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust

9 Doctrine.

10 2. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public agencies to

11 examine the potential advetse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect
12 California's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency

13 actions.

14 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider
15 alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does neither.

16 4. The Project extends the terms of the State Water Project ("SWP*) contracts to December
17 31, 2085, without adequately examining the environmental impacts of doing so, without studying a
18 reasonable range of alternatives, and without compliance with other state law protecting the
19 environment.

20 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

21 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
22 ("CCP*) sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief). and 1085 (traditional mandamus);
23 PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California
24 Constitution.

25 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers)
26 and 395 (actions generally) because DWR's offices are located in Sacramento.
27 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a
28 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely

served DWR with notice of this suit.

2 PARTIES

8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE (*North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit
4 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was

5 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of

6 cxcessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and

7 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds

8 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The intcrests of North

9 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested berein is granted, will

10 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the

11 Project,

12 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt

13 organization that works to protect and réstore salmon and other fish populations aud the communities
14 that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR
15 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR
16 sccks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has
17 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry strcam protection
18 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR
19 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlifc.
20 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to
21 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.
22 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS
23 ("PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in
24 San Francisco, California, PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel
25 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined
26 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial
27 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's
28 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

1 salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

2 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing
livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta

4 and its associated ecosystems.

5 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
6 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats

7 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in

8 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento

9 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in
10 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich

11 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco

12 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DWR's Project approval becausc it would threaten
13 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected
14 ecosystems.

15 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
16 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The

17 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural
18 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recrcational interest in the continued viability of
19 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta ("Delta"). The
20 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced
21 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
22 environmental harms that implementation of the Project will allow.
23 13, Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES
24 (*DWR") is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of
25 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on November
26 13, 2018, and approval of the Project on December 11, 2018, was subject to and violated the
27 requirements of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency
28 under CEQA for environmental review of the Project.

1 14. The true names aud capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to

2 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

3 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the

4 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in
part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

6 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe

7 respondents have been ascertained.

8 15. Real party in interest State Water Contractors ("SWC") is a non-profit corporation

9 composed of and representing public water agencies throughout California that have contracted with
10 DWR to receive SWP water. The Project purports to amend the contract terms that govern DWR's

11 delivery of water to SWC members.

12 16. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to
13 PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any specific real parties in
14 interest exist. However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is
15 necessary, petitioners have identified SWC as a potential real party in interest. The true names and
16 capacitics of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore
17 sue such real parties in intcrest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners are
18 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real
19 parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
20 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacitics of said Doe real parties
21 in interest have been ascertained.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 17. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
24 their substantial bereficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.
25 18. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
26 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
27 required by law.

28 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

01/07/2019 16:39 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 10/29

1 the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

2 DWR's Certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project, and ordering it to comply with the laws

3 whose violation is alleged herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are

4 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other

5 legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the

6 environment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct.

7 20. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
8 controversy exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

9 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitioners are
10 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is

11 therefore necessary and appropriate.

12 21. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of
13 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project
14 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental
15 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable barm due to DWR's failure to take the required
16 steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et
17 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

18 LEGAL BACKGROUND

19 CEQA

20 22. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to
21 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

22 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

23 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry
24 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to
25 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible
26 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)
27 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.
28 23. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

1 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

2 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. Mountain

3 Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; PRC $$ 21080.5(d)(2)(D),
4 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines*) § 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects

5 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of

6 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

7 24. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary

8 projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is "public agency" and a "state agency" as defined in CEQA. PRC
9 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.

10 25. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

11 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the
12 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and

13 Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory
14 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC scction 21080(b) and recognized under CEQA
15 Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the
16 California Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2),
17 15300-15333 and 15354.

18 26. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that a
19 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those effects and
20 suggest fcasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve
21 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant environmental effects. PRC §§
22 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines 88 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.
23 27. In epplying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid
24 preparing an EIR on the entirety, Or whole, of the project. Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA's
25 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,
26 individually considered, might be found to have no significaut effect on the environment or to be only
27 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.

The Delta Reform Act

2 28. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature

3 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and

4 California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water

5 Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that *'the Delta' . . . is critically important
6 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the
Califomnia water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North

8 aud South America." Water Code § 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization
of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code 85001(a), cmphasis added.
10 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,

11 a to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and cnhance the quality of water

12 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across stale
13 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.
14 29. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "*coequal goals" of restoring the Delta

15 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight
16 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

17 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state over the long term. 18

19 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta as an evolving place.

20 (o) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.
3 8 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.
(e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.
24 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage,
25 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection. 26

27 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.
28 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

01/07/2019 16:39 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 13/29

30. The Legislature also declared that:

2 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Bach region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for
4 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water

5 technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

6 con Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

7 The Public Trust Doctrine

8 31. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable

9 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
10 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

11 32. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted

12 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
13 they . consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
14 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimizc any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
15 Court went on to explain:

16 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of

17 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause
18 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may bave to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so
19 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the
20 uses protected by the trust.

21 Id., citations omitted.

22 33. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

24 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
25 | waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For
26 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] ... the
27 preservation of those lands in their natural state, SO that they may serve as ccological units for scientific
28 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life. and

1 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

2 34. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

3 the public trust doctrine .. .- [] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

4 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever
fcasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. v. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A]
6 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

7 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at 570.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 35. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statcwide, national, and
10 international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest

11 and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in

12 peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of

13 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." Id.

14 36. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
15 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for
16 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California (or "State") Water Project (*SWP").
17 Second. for too long, agricultural di verters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off
18 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are
19 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,
20 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.
21 37. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to
22 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant
23 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in
24 grave dauger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run
25 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been
26 driven perilously closc to extirpation.
27 38. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered
28 Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population declines.

Verifiod Petition for Writ: of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 10 -

declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its

2 tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared

3 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA in 2005, 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

4 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat

5 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of

6 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical

7 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fod.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58

8 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).
39. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and diversions
10 that would have destroyed the free-flowing rivers of California's North Coast and removed additional

11 essential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steclhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was

12 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre feet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,
13 DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all
14 but the wettest of water years.

15 40. In addition to harming maoy fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water
16 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and gurface waters that
17 flow into the Delta. Irrigatiou leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas
18 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils
19 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and
20 sodium chlorides and sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries
21 threatens the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.
22 41. DWR's existing waters supply contracts with the SWC begin to expire in 2035 and the last
23 ends by 2042. DWR states that an extension of these contracts is necessary to finance capital
24 expenditures for the SWP through the use of revenue bonds. DWR entered into a negotiation process
25| regarding potential terms for its contract extensions, and petitioners provided detailed comments
26 27 tegarding the environmental impacts and considerations that must be addressed during the contract
extension process that became the Project, including comments dated July 3, 2013, July 10, 2013, and
28 January 29, 2014, by PCFFA, and March 3, 2014 by PCFFA and the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.

42. On or about September 12, 2014 DWR issued a Notice of Preparation notifying the public

2 that it would act 25 the lead agency for the preparation of an EIR for the Project. That Notice of

3 Preparation identified the Project as "amending certain provisions of the State Water Resources

4 Development System (SWRDS) Water Supply Contracts."

5 43. In response to the Notice of Preparation, in October 2014, petitioners PCFFA, IFR, North

6 Coast Rivers, San Francisco Fishermen, and other environmental groups, agencies, and members of the
7 public submitted detailed scoping comments to DWR. Commentors raised concerns regarding the scope

8 of DWR's Project and exclusion of interrelated decisions and approvals. Commentors raised concerns

9 regarding the ways in which climate change and sea level rise will occur during the Project's terr and
10 the need to examine how the Project's impacts would change over time. Commeutors rcquested that

11 DWR disclose and analyze the Project's potential changes regarding responsibility for fish, wildlife and
12 rccreation mitigation measures. And commentors requested that DWR study alternatives that reduced
13 total contract amounts iv light of the SWP's historic over-allocation and likely reduction in available
14 water over the duration of the Project, and that established water conservation standards for SWP water,
15 among other concerns.
16 44. In August 2016, DWR relcased its Draft EIR for the Project. The Draft EIR failed to
17 address many of the concerns raised during the scoping process.

18 45. Petitioner PCFFA provided detailed comments on DWR's Draft EIR via letter dated
19 October 17, 2016. These comments highlighted DWR's failure to address the Project's impacts, refusal

20 to study appropriate Project alternatives, and improper piecemealing of its cnvironmental analysis.
21 46. PCFFA and IFR submitted additional comments on the Project that DWR received on or
22 about August 13, 2018.

23 47. IFR, North Coast Rivers and Sau Francisco Fisberen, along with other concerned
24 organizations, submitted additlonal comments regarding the Project that DWR received on or about
25 September 25, 2018.

26 48. On November 13, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth certified the FEIR.
27 49. On December 11, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth approved the Project.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 51. The paragraphs set forth above and below arc realleged and incorporated herein by

6 reference.

7 52. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 aud 21168.5, on

8 the grounds that DWR committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner
9 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.

10 53. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a

11 proposed project's potential environmental effcots, ways to minimize those effects, and potential
12  alternatives to the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR, must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter

13 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
14 potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).
15 The FEIR's Analysis Is Improperly Segmented

16 54. CEQA requircs agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may have
17 significant environmental impacts. Guidelines § 15064(a)(1). CEQA defines "projcct" to mean "the

18 whole of an action." Guidelines 15378(a). "The torm 'project' refers to the activity which is being
19 approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The
20 term *project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." Guidelines § 15378(c).
21 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when
22 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc, for
23 Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." Guidelines
24 15003(h), see also Guidelines § 15378(a), (c).
25 55. CEQA thus intends to ensurc "that environmental considerations do not become submerged
26 by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on the
27 environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local Agency
28 Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.

b 56. Here, instead of studying all of its interdependent actions together, DWR has improperly

2 segmented its analysis of the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

3 Management and California WaterFix from its analysis and consideration of the Project. DWR

4 circulated a Draft EIR for the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water
Management and California Waterfix for public comment in October 2018. Yct DWR's Project

6 approval is necessary for its implementation of WaterFix and its related contract amendments.
57. This segmentation violates CEQA's demand for unified and comprehensive environmental

review:

9 Theoretical independence is not a good reason for segmentiug the environmental analysis of the two matters. Doing so runs the risk that some environmental impacts produced by
10 the way the two matters combine or interact might not be analyzed in the separate and
11 environmental reviews. Furthermore, if the two matters are analyzed in sequence . the combined or interactive environmental effects arc not fully recognized until the review of the second matter, the opportunity to implement effective mitigation measures as part

5 12 of the first matter may be lost. This could result in mitigation measures being adopted in the second matter that are less effective than what would have been adopted if the matters
13 had been analyzed as a single project.
14 Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214,

15 1230. DWR's segmented review subverts CEQA's informational purposcs.

16 DWR's No Project Alternative Violates CEQA

17 58. The CEQA Guidelines direct that "[t]he. 'no project' analysis shall discuss the cxisting

18 conditions at the time the notice of preparation is published ... as well as what would be reasonably
19 expected to occur in the foresecable future if the project were not approved. ..." (Guidelines §
20 15126.6(e)(2).)

21 59. DWR's No Project Alternative improperly assumes that the SWP contracts would be
22 renewed absent the Project, and that all water deliveries would occur with or without the Project. As
23 such the secnario examined in the environmental documents does not describe a situation where an
24 agency approval is not granted. Instcad it describes a scenario where a different Project alternative is
25 approved, and SWP water deliveries continue. DWR has not examined the environmental conditions of
26 the Project against an appropriate No Project Alterative where these deliverics are not made. This failure
27 violates CEQA.

1 DWR Failed to Fullv Consider A Reasonable Range of Alternatives and Dismissed Feasible Alternatives from Review
2

3 60. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even

4 if they "would impede to some degrce the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

5 Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

6 61. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each altemative to allow

7 meaningful evaluation, enalysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

8 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible

9 alternatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC $§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project
10 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as hore, ignored.

11 Guidclines § 15021(a)(2).

12 62. The FEIR fails to study a reasonable rauge of alternatives, including an alternative that
13 significantly reduces deliveries, or an alternative that implements conservation targets. Instead, DWR
14. dismissed any reduced contract quantity alternatives or water conservation target alternatives from
15 detailed analysis before it prepared its Draft EIR.
16 63. All but one of the Alternatives studied in the FEIR contemplate the same level of water
17 deliverics, and only vary in end year and financial structure. For this reason, DWR concludes that
18 Alternatives 2 through 6 have the same impacts as the Project. Alternative 7 would extend the end-date
19 of the contracts to 2085 but allows some current contractors to "choose not to sign." None of these
20 Alternatives are sufficiently distinet to provide a rcasonable range of alternatives under CEQA.
21 64. Because none of the Alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive
22 exports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the FEIR failed a to analyze a reasonable range of
23 alternatives as CEQA requires.
24 The FEIR Improperly Concludes That the Project Has No Impacts
25 65. DWR concludes that the Project will have no impact on any resource topics "bccause it
26 would amend and add financial provisions" to its SWP contracts and "would not create new water
27 management measures, alter the existing authority to build or modify existing SWP facilities, or change

• 28 water allocation provisions" of those contracts. ES-4. But DWR overlooks the essential purposc of the

1 Project's contracts - to deliver water through the SWP. DWR's SWP water deliveries have impacts to

2 the source and receiving watersheds, including impacts on important habitat, yet DWR fails to consider

3 these impacts as impacts of the Project. DWR's failure to address the impacts of Project approval

4 violates CEQA.

5 66. DWR also improperly concludes that the Project has no cumulative impacts. Id. But DWR
6 has failed to examine the closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future
7 projects that, when taken with the Project's water deliveries, will result in significant cumulative

8 impacts. This violates CEQA.

9 DWR Fails to Analyze Changed Circumstances

10 67. DWR's FEIR relies upon the 1986 Coordinated Operating Agreement ("COA") between
11 DWR and the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to describe the operating criteria for

12 the SWP, and assumes that Project operations will be constrained by the 1986 COA. Yet as DWR

13 prepared the FEIR, it was actively renegotiating the COA with Reclamation, and executed an addendum
14 to the COA the day after it approved the Project. The FEIR fails to address this reasonably foresceable
15 change in SWP operations as either part of the Project itself or a closcly related and reasonably
16 foreseeable probable project, despite its likely significant cumulative impacts.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20 68. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

21 reference,

22 69. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., was passed by the Legislaturc in
23 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water
24 infrastructure are in crisis" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the
25 state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was
26 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provide
27 for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the
28 Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a

1 legally enforceable Delta Plan." Id. § 85001(c).

2

3 70. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered

4 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

5 action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship
Council. Water Code $ 85225.

0

7 71. 'The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]oveted action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined
by PRC section 21065 that:

8 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part,
O within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.

10 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency.

11 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

12 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce

13 risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.
Water Code § 85057.5(a). While the Delta Reform Act states that "[r]outine maintenance and operation
14 of the State Water Project" is not a covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption
15 because it is neither routine maintenance nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).

16

17 72. The 2013 Delta Plan prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set
aside by the Sacramento Superior Court because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reform
18 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated
19 with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring

20

21 more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with the Delta Reform Act."
Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. The Delta
22 Stewardship Council's appeal of this decision is pending before the Third District Court of Appeal (Case
23 No. C082944). In addition, petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's
24 2018 Delta Plan Amendments, as those amendments violate CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public
25 Trust Doctrine and other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacrament Superior Court Case Nos.
26 34-2018-80002898, 34-2018-80002900, 34-2018-80002901, 34-2018-80002904.

2 of consistency with the Delta Plan. Water Code 85225. And because approval of the Projcct continues

3 DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the

4 Delta Reform Act's cocqual goals, the Project is inherently inconsistent with what would be required by
any valid Delta Plan.

5

6 74. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings
as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,
7 its approval must be set aside. Water Code $ 85225.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)

11 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
75. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
12 reference.

13

14 76. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
15 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

16 77. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
17 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "bofore state courts and agencies approve water diversions

18

19 they - . consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,

20 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
Court went on to explain:
: N 22 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative

23 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state

24 may have to approve appropriations despite foresesable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustec to consider the effect of the

25 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

26 Id., citations omitted,

27 78. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and
28 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

1 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

2 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

3 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[]... the

4 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

5 study, as open space, and as enyironments which provide food and babitat for birds and marine life, and

6 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."
79. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and
8 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Despite public comment regarding the Project's

9 impacts to public trust resources, DWR declined to address or examine the issue in its FEIR.

10 80. Feasible alternatives exist that would mitigate or avoid these significant impacts, including,

11 but not limited to a reduced Table A alternative, or an alternative that incorporates water conservation

12 goals. Such alternatives would reduce diversions, have beneficial effects on fish and wildlife, and attain
13 most of the Project's basic objectives.

14 81. By approving the Project despite the fact that feasible alternatives exist that would preserve
15 public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, DWR abdicated its affirmative statutory and
16 constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever feasible,"
17 based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on public trust
18 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside
21 Project Approvals as Contrary to CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5)
22 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
23 82. The paragraphs set forth above and below are rcalleged and incorporated herein by
24 reference.

25 83. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to
26 approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085
27 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:
28 3. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law:

1 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

2 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record
3 before DWR.
84. DWR failed to proceed in the mannet required by law in the following respects, among

others:

6 a. DWR violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

7 b. DWR violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged hercinabove; and

8 C. DWR violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged hereinabove.

9 85. DWR's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures required by
10 CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded DWR's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of

11 discretion, and therefore are invalid and unust be set aside.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:
14 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR from taking any action to

15 carry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

16 2, For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to set aside and vacate its approval of the
17 Project, and certification of its FETR;

18 3. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful:
19 4. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all activity implementing the
20 Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it has taken all
21 actions necessary to bring its approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA, the Delta
22 Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and the Code of Civil Procedure;
23 5. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;
