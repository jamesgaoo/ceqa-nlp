2 Petitioner THE SUNSET LANDMARK INVESTMENT, LLC ("Petitioner") seeks

3 a writ of mandamus and declaratory and injunctive relief against Respondents City of Los
Angeles and the Los Angeles City Council (sometimes collectively the "City" or
"Respondents"), and alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION

1.

7 This petition challenges the City's March 5, 2019 decisions, and all

8 subsequent actions, in approving: (a) a Mitigated Negative Declaration; (b) Vesting Zone

9 and Height District Changes; (c) Zoning Administrator's Adjustment; (d) Site Plan

10 Review; (e) Conditional Use Beverage, and other associated entitlements (collectively

APC Floor "Land Use Entitlements") for the Selma Wilcox Hotel project, an 8-story, approximately

DO9L-LOLL6 PNE PRLOCY OBLBIEIN AION MVT NIELSHEATIS 11 88.6-foot-tall, 79,878-square-foot hotel with 114 rooms/suites, a 20,624-square-foot
12 restaurant/bar and a 1,939-square-foot hotel restaurant/bar on the first floors, and an

8 13

14 outdoor swimming pool/nightclub/bar on top of the building, and a three-level

#% Pasadena, 15 underground parking garage, all on an approximately 21,505-square-foot "L"-shaped lot,

16 located at 6421-6429 1/2 North Wilcox Avenue and 1600-04 Selma Avenue in Hollywood
(the "Selma Wilcox Hotel portion of the Project").

17 2.

18 The Project site sits at the northeast corner of the intersection of Wilcox

19 Avenue and Selma Avenue, two narrow collector streets between Sunset Boulevard on the
south, Hollywood Boulevard on the north, Highland Avenue on the west, and Cahuenga
20 Avenue on the east, within a portion of the Hollywood Community Plan and the

21 Hollywood Redevelopment Plan areas.

22 3.

23 While the City purported to treat the Selma Wilcox Hotel portion of the

24 Project as a distinct project from other construction activities conducted by Real Party

25 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC (sometimes hereafter "Real Party") on the Selma Wilcox

26 Hotel site, the City's files contained substantial evidence alerting City officials to the fact

27 that Real Party was applying for and processing a series of ministerially-treated building

28 permits, and later, discretionary entitlements, which, once processed in four stages, would
culminate in the whole Selma Wilcox Hotel building.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 4. CEQA Guidelines Section 15268(d) states: "Where a project involves an

2 approval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the
project will be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of

4 CEQA."

5 5. Guideline Section 15268(d), when followed by the City, often finds its

6 expression in the section of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") where a Project's list

7 of requested entitlements and permits is set forth. For instance, in the EIR for the recently

8 proposed Hollywood Gower Project, the list of various approvals required to develop the

9 project ends with this final statement: "Other discretionary and ministerial permits and

10 approvals that may be deemed necessary." Thus, when a project description correctly

11
POSL-LOLLE MVT D00 HESPNARAY OGURIEN ALON SILVERSTEII SH encompasses the "whole of the action" contemplated by a developer, the City normally
12 acknowledges that a combination of ministerial and discretionary approvals are required in

8 13 order to construct the whole project, which combination subjects the project to CEQA
Pasadena, 14 review.

15 6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real
16 Party 6421 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC is wholly owned and/or managed and/or controlled

17 by Relevant Group, LLC. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,

18 that since at least 2014, Relevant Group, LLC (and its predecessor entity, Five Chairs

19 Holding, LLC) presented two public faces, depending upon its audience.

20 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that when

21 Relevant Group, LLC sought investors for and related to its proposed development of a

22 complex of hotels, restaurants, bars and outdoor dining facilities in Hollywood, and in the

23 general vicinity of Wilcox Avenue and Selma Avenue ("Relevant Group Complex"), it
24 communicated to potential investors that it was developing a comprehensive lodging and

25 late night entertainment district south of Hollywood Boulevard that it called "a crossroads

26 of entertainment, real estate, lifestyle, and hospitality." A true and accurate copy of a
27 Relevant Group financial investor marketing brochure is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. It

28 visually depicts the "whole of the action" for which Relevant Group was planning and
- 3 -
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

2 raising funds "in the past four years," which coincides with the commencement of the
expert studies for the Selma Wilcox Hotel.
8.

4 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Relevant

5 Group's marketing brochures depicted all of the hotels, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs

6 that, together, comprised the whole of the Relevant Group Complex to be developed for
itself and its investors.

9.

8 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that when

9 Relevant Group sought to obtain necessary discretionary and ministerial permits and
approvals from the City, it divided its Relevant Group Complex so as

10 to present a different

APC Floor 11 face to the public - one in which each piece of the "whole of the action" of its Relevant

POSL-LOLL6 12 Group Complex would be broken down into constituent ministerial permits, if possible,
followed by discretionary land use entitlements, all intended to mask the whole of the

3 BNRPNAROY ES TMAY AISE OS S Pasadena, 13 Relevant Group Complex project, and the cumulative impacts of all constituent parts of the

14 whole of that project.

15 10.

16 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
application process for individual pieces of the Relevant Group Complex was submitted to
17 the City under a series of subordinate corporations or companies under the control of
18

19 Relevant Group, LLC and its principals, Richard Heyman and Grant King.
11.

20 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that at least

21 two types of piecemealing in violation of CEQA occurred in this case. First, the Selma
Wilcox Hotel building was piecemealed into a series of ministerial building permits,
22 followed by two discretionary entitlement processes consisting of at least four steps (the
23

24 building permits for the Tao Restaurant and the portion of the parking garage beneath the

25 Tao, the building permits for the remainder of the parking garage to the west of the Tao

26 with one story of "retail" uses, the discretionary alcohol permit for the Tao Restaurant and

27 Retail Project, and the immediately following discretionary entitlements for the Selma

28 Wilcox Hotel building tower to be constructed over the two-story Tao and the remaining
three levels of underground parking and "retail"). Petitioner refers to all of these actions as
- 4 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 "internal piecemealing" of the Selma Wilcox Hotel. Second, the Selma Wilcox Hotel

2 building was piecemealed from all other parts of the Relevant Group Complex of hotels,

3 restaurants, bars, and nightclubs as part of a series of separate MNDs processed under

4 different corporate names, but each of which was formed merely to construct each of the

5 hotel, restaurant, bar portions of the overall Relevant Group Complex. Petitioner refers to

6 all of these actions as "external piecemealing" of the Selma Wilcox Hotel building from

7 the whole of the Relevant Group Complex.

12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
Selma Wilcox Hotel is but one of at least four hotels, three large restaurant/special event

10 spaces, five nightclubs and related facilities that Relevant Group conceived as an
J001 p8 'enuany APC WHld MV7 E SILVERSTEIN 11 integrated hotel/entertainment district within about one-block of the intersection of Wilcox
bO9I-LOLL6 12 and Selma Avenues.

8 North Marengo 13 13. Objections submitted by Petitioner and others focused, inter alia, on the

14 piecemeal submittal of permit and entitlement requests for the Selma Wilcox Hotel project

#8 Pasadena, 15 in a manner designed to obtain the City's approval for allowing construction to commence

16 before the discretionary hotel application was filed, and additionally, to allow the
17 piecemeal development of other hotel projects surrounding the Project site into a

18 constellation of noisy, alcohol-fueled hotels/nightclubs/bars and restaurants. Petitioner is

19 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that most or all of these other nearby

20 sites are controlled by Relevant Group, LLC, with the piecemeal environmental review
21 accomplished in part by the filing of entitlement requests under the names of differing

22 subsidiary or shell corporations or companies, including Real Party in this lawsuit: 6421

23 Selma Wilcox Hotel LLC.

24 14. In addition, objections submitted by Petitioner and others focused on the

25 City's failure adequately to disclose, study, and mitigate significant environmental impacts
26 related to, inter alia, noise, air emissions, greenhouse gases, traffic, cumulative impacts,

27 and other environmental issues.

2 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's approval and/or

3 certification of the MND and invalidating and setting aside the Land Use Entitlements, and

4 all Selma Wilcox Hotel project approvals, including because of the City's violations of the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

12 proceedings before the City and objected to the Project in those proceedings, leading up to

15 interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in conformity with the requirements of

#% law, and in having those requirements properly executed and the public duties of the City
16 enforced. Petitioner will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions

17

19 in this petition. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, and on behalf of others who will be

20 affected in the Hollywood area, as well as for all citizens of the City of Los Angeles and

21 more broadly, including all those who seek to maintain the integrity of the land use
entitlement process in Los Angeles.

22 17.

15 proposed by an applicant, and to examine project alternatives (which are only examined in
16 environmental impact reports), mitigation measures and their enforcement, multiple shell

17 corporate entities have been used to accomplish the deliberate splitting of entitlements for
18 the overall Relevant Group Complex of hotels, restaurants, bars and nightclubs to avoid
environmental assessment of the total impact of all of these facilities on noise, traffic,
20 parking, public infrastructure, public services such as police, fire and emergency services, 19
