Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2

3 1. On September 10, 2019, the City Council of the City of Orange, California (the
4 "City") approved the application of Orange Senior Housing, Inc. ("OSH') to demolish an

5 existing office building at 1249 E. Katella Avenue and construct a 74-unit affordable housing

6 complex for seniors (the "Project"). Tuskatella, LLC (*Tuskatella") challenges that decision.
7 2. Tuskatella owns and operates a large retail shopping complex (the "Tuskatella
8 Shopping Center"), located immediately adjacent to and east of the proposed Project.
9 3. A narrow alleyway runs between the Tuskatella Shopping Center and the proposed
10 Project. As proposed, the alleyway would provide the only access to the Project.
11 4. That alleyway also provides the only signaled access to the Tuskatella Shopping
12 Center. It is also the only safe and authorized access for trucks making deliveries to the
13 Tuskatella Center.
14 5.
15 Tuskatella's primary concern with the Project can be summarized in a single word:

16 traffic. The Project creates a chokepoint at the intersection of Katella Avenue and the alleyway.

17 Approval of the Project could threaten the long-term viability of Tuskatella Shopping Center

18 and its many tenants.

6.
19 The City improperly concluded that the Project is categorically exempt from the

20 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Certain "unusual circumstances" preclude a

21 categorical exemption under CEQA. These unique conditions include (1) the narrowness of the

22 alleyway and the fact that it does not align with the opposing street, and its status as the only

23 authorized point of entry for delivery trucks to the shopping center, and (2) the elimination by

24 the City of other points of access afforded by a private reciprocal easement.

25 7. The City ignored the materially adverse traffic effects and congestion and
26 resulting safety risks that will be caused by the Project and that will deteriorate neighboring land

27 uses, in violation of the City Code.

28

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

8. The City's approval allows the Project to illegally block a recorded reciprocal

2 access easement that benefits the adjacent parcels, which would cause the deterioration of

3 bordering land use, create special problems regarding access, and interfere with the general

4 welfare of the area.

5 9. The City Code requires the City to impose conditions necessary to preserve the
6 general welfare. Tuskatella identified four mitigating measures that would have resolved the
7 special problems created by the alleyway being the only access point. The City generally
8 ignored these conditions and approved the Project without considering neighboring land uses
9 and the general welfare.
10 10. The Project is not compatible with the surrounding building and residential 11 neighborhood, and violates at least four (4) provisions of the City zoning ordinance. The City 12

13 seeks to circumvent these zoning restrictions through the application of two concessions and twol

14 waivers under the California Density Bonus Law (Govt. Code §§ 65915-65918). However,

15 these concessions and waivers are not available under the California Density Bonus Law, and

16 are expressly prohibited under the City Code.

11. 17 Tuskatella is not rigidly opposed to the Project. It can be redeemed and brought

18 into compliance with the law if reasonable conditions are imposed. If these conditions are not

19 imposed, the Project will continue in violation of State law and the City Code.

20 JURISDICTION

21 12. This Court has jurisdiction over this writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

22 of Civil Procedure and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

23 13. The Court also has jurisdiction over this writ action under section 1085 of the

24 Code of Civil Procedure and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

25 PARTIES

26 14. Tuskatella, LLC is a California limited liability company.

27 15. The City of Orange is a municipal corporation of the State of California. The

7 STATEMENT OF FACTS

8 16. Orange Senior Housing, Inc. ("OSH") proposes to demolish a vacant 10,589
9 square foot office building (last occupied by a bank) located at 1249 E. Katella Avenue, and
10 replace it with an affordable apartment complex for seniors with 74 units and 43,351 square feet
11 of floor area.
12 17.
13 The proposal is part of an agreement OSH made with the City in 2016 when the

14 City allowed OSH to sell Triangle Terrace, an existing affordable apartment complex for

15 seniors, but required OSH to reinvest the proceeds to develop additional affordable senior

16 housing units.

18.
17 Under this agreement between OSH and the City, which was entered on July 12,

18 2016, OSH has five years to build another affordable housing complex for seniors within the

19 boundaries of the City. If OSH is not able to secure a location within the City within five years,

20 it can look for property in neighboring cities. Thus, the City has an additional incentive to

21 approve this Project.

22 19. The proposed Project would be three stories and 42 feet high at its tallest point.

23 OSH is utilizing affordable housing provisions of State law to qualify for concessions and

24 waivers that are needed for the three stories and the height, as the Project would otherwise be

25 limited to two stories.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Traffic Issues

2 20. As currently proposed, the only access to the Project will be from a substandard
3 alleyway north of North California Street that, in the words of the Planning Commission,
4 "appears like a driveway off Katella Avenue."

5 21. The bank that has historically operated on the Project site enjoyed at least two
6 additional access points off of Katella Avenue- both of which are being eliminated with City
7 approval.
8 22. Although the alleyway is for public use, it has been dedicated for use of truck
9 deliveries and access for the 35 tenants of the Tuskatella Shopping Center since its inception. It
10 is not a typical street, but a narrow alley. Between 75 and 100 delivery trucks, and occasionally
11 more, use the alleyway each week.
12
23.
13 In addition, garbage trucks, recycling trucks, tenant and employee vehicles, and

14 Toyota of Orange test drivers and customers use the alleyway.

24.
15 The City has posted signage at its entrance stating, "NO PARKING IN THE

16 ALLEY" and put a red "no parking" stripe along the side of portions of the alleyway due to its

17 narrowness and the inability of delivery trucks and emergency vehicles to pass through when

18 vehicles are parked in the alleyway.

19 25. The alleyway is the only signalized access for ingress and egress to the Tuskatella

20 Shopping Center. None of the other entrances or exits has a traffic signal.

21 26. The unsignaled points of access cannot be used by delivery trucks without causing

22 damage and risking pedestrian safety. They cannot maneuver through the Tuskatella Shopping

23 Center parking lot. Further, because these access points do not have a traffic signal, attempted

24 use by large delivery trucks would cause stacking in the center lanes on Katella Avenue that

25 would create traffic hazards.

26 27. If the Project is approved, the alleyway will be the only access point to the senior
27 housing facility. There are currently three other access points, but all of them would be

28 eliminated as part of the Project.

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

] 28.

2 alleyway: There are already significant problems with ingress and egress through the

3 a.

4 Right turn lane stacking: Vehicles exiting the alley by making a right

5 (westbound) turn onto Katella Avenue have very limited room to

6 maneuver. When two or more vehicles are waiting to make this turn the

7 stacking and narrowness of the alleyway blocks cars trying to turn north

8 into the alleyway off of Katella Avenue as well as those attempting to exit

o the alleyway in either direction.
b.
10 Lack of alignment with North California Street: The northbound lane

11 exiting North California Street aligns directly with the southbound lane

12 exiting the alleyway. Thus, northbound vehicles must jog to the right to

13 avoid a head-on collision. Given the odd-angle stacking in the southbound

14 lane, and the narrowness of the alleyway, there is very little room to enter.

15 C. Narrowness of the alleyway: The alleyway is dangerously and

16 impractically narrow, especially given its frequent use by large delivery

17 trucks. The delivery trucks have to be just inches from the building on one

18 side to allow a car to turn into the alley on the other side. At its widest

19 point, the alleyway is only 27 feet wide--narrower than the minimum City

20 requirement. (And, as discussed below, parts of it will be narrowed to just

21 24' as part of the Project.)

22 d.

23 Southbound stacking: Vehicles heading southbound out of the alleyway

can get stacked at the traffic signal and, when stacked like this, block

24 ingress and egress to and from the Project site.

25 e.

26 Corner cutting: Because the alleyway is SO narrow, it is not uncommon for
vehicles exiting the alleyway to cut the corner, which can put them into the

27 path of northbound traffic.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 29. These existing conditions already create dangers and cause practical problems, but

2 they have been manageable. The Project will significantly exacerbate these dangers and
3 problems.

4 30. The building currently located at the Project site is not in use. During construction
5 and when the Project is completed, the additional traffic will exacerbate the already-existing
6 traffic issues.

7 31. These problems will be worse than when the bank was in operation on the Project
8 site because bank traffic had at least three options that will be closed off by the Project.
9
a. The north portion of the bank parking lot has historically been open to
10 ingress and egress for almost half of the bank's frontage along the 11 alleyway. This gave bank patrons an alternative access to the bank parking 12

13 lot. These entrances to the Project parking will be closed off under the

14 current Project proposal.

b.
15 Bank patrons were also able to access the bank parking lot from the west.

16 This option was made possible by virtue of a recorded reciprocal easement

17 between the Project site and the Citizens Bank lot adjacent to the west. Part

18 of the Project approved by the City requires constructing a wall along the

19 west border of the Project site, eliminating access from the west. This will

20 also interfere with the recorded easement that runs to the benefit of the

21 Citizens Bank parcel.

22 C. Construction of this wall will also eliminate two points of ingress and

23 egress off of Katella Avenue, one on each side of the Citizens Bank

24 building. These points of access were used by patrons of the bank that used

25 to operate on the Project site. They have also been available for use for

26 over 50 years by patrons of the Tuskatella Shopping Center. Eliminating
27 these access points will force all Project traffic through the intersection that
28 is used as the sole entrance by delivery trucks for access to the alleyway.

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 32. Additionally, the 27' width of the alleyway is already not up to code for a City

2 street (it only meets code currently because it is classified as an alleyway), and the Project calls

3 for narrowing a portion of the alleyway to only 24' to make room for a pedestrian sidewalk.

4 Further narrowing the alleyway will further exacerbate the traffic problems that already exist.
5 This will, for example, further reduce the turning radiuses of semi-trucks entering the property
6 through signalized entrance and exacerbate safety issues for waiting vehicles and crossing
7 pedestrians.
8 33. This pedestrian sidewalk will be the only pedestrian entrance to the Project and
9 will put pedestrians within inches of semi-trucks on regular basis.
10 34. The original application called for a remote-controlled gated entrance to the
11 Project parking which, again, can only be accessed through the alleyway. This would have
12

13 caused additional stacking as vehicles wait for the gate to open. While the developer withdrew

14 this design feature, he did so a with a caveat that it may be reinserted in the future. The City did

15 not, in its conditions, foreclose this possibility.

16 Design Review Committee Recommends Denial

35.
17 The Design Review Committee ("DRC") met on June 5, 2019. Kevin Anderson,

18 owner of the Tuskatella Shopping Center, spoke in opposition to the Project.

19 36. The DRC raised 17 concerns about the Project. Without objection from OSH, the

20 DRC unanimously recommended denial of the Project.

21 37. The June 5, 2019 Design Review Committee Staff Report found that the Project

22 qualifies for a categorical exemption from the requirements of CEQA.

23 Planning Commission Approves the Project

24 38. The Project is defined as senior housing in Orange Municipal Code ("OMC") {

25 17.04.038 and listed as a conditionally permitted use in OMC Table 17.13.030. Accordingly,

26 review and approval by the City of Orange Planning Commission was required.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 39. The Planning Commission held a hearing on July 29, 2019. Tuskatella's owners

2 appeared and spoke in opposition to the Project. Tuskatella also provided detailed written
3 objections to the Project.

4 40. On July 29, 2019, the City of Orange Planning Commission adopted Resolution
5 No. 12-19, approving Conditional Use Permit No. 3083-19, Major Site Plan Review No. 0970-
6 19, Design Review No. 4970-19, two concessions, two development standard waivers, and the
7 demolition of the existing office building for the construction of a 74-unit affordable housing
8 complex for seniors.
9 41. The July 29, 2019 Planning Commission Staff Report found that the Project
10 a qualifies for a categorical exemption from the requirements of CEQA.
11 Appeal to City Council of the City of Orange
12
42. On August 12, 2019, Tuskatella submitted to the City Council an Appeal 13

14 Application, appealing Planning Commission Resolution No. 12-19. The City Council was

15 required by the City Code to conduct a de novo review.
43.
16 On August 15, 2019, Tuskatella was informed that the appeal had been scheduled

17 for hearing on September 10, 2019.

18 44. On August 22, 2019, Tuskatella requested a postponement of the hearing until

19 October 7, 2019, to enable Tuskatella to complete a peer-review traffic analysis in support of its

20 contentions.

21 45. The City ignored the request.

22 46. Tuskatella hired a different engineering firm to complete a less comprehensive,

23 rushed peer review analysis, over the Labor Day weekend. The results of that analysis were

24 delivered to the City Council at the September 10 hearing.

25 47. On September 10, 2019, acting pursuant to its authority under City Code

26 17.080.050, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 111181. The Resolution was 24 pages in

27 length, complete with extensive findings and legal conclusions, and was prepared in advance of
28 the hearing without the benefit of Tuskatella's oral or written submissions, including the results

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the independent peer review traffic study. The Resolution approved the Project without
2 imposing any conditions to address the traffic problems raised by Tuskatella.
3 48. The City concluded that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to State
4 CEQA Guidelines 15332 (Class 32, In-Fill Development Projects) "because the project complies
5 with the existing general plan and zoning and is located within an urbanized area, and the
6 project would not result in any significant traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality impacts,
7 among other criteria
8 49. The City made the following finding regarding traffic: "Traffic and parking have
9 been evaluated and Traffic Division staff have determined that there will be no detrimental
10 effects on traffic on E. Katella Avenue and N. California Street."
11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
12 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW
13
50.
14 Tuskatella submitted written and oral objections to the Planning Commission and

15 fully exhausted its remedies with the Planning Commission.

51.
16 Tuskatella submitted written and oral objections to the City Council and fully

17 exhausted its administrative remedies.

18 52. Tuskatella has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

19 unless this court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of

20 such remedies, the Project will move forward.

21 53. Tuskatella has complied with Public Resources Code 21167.5 by providing the

22 City of Orange with notice of its intention to commence this action. A copy of that notice is

23 attached as Exhibit A.

24 54. Tuskatella has complied with Public Resources Code 21167.7 by filing a copy of
25 this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit

26 B.

27 55. Tuskatella elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
28 attached as Exhibit C.

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)
4 56. Tuskatella incorporates all previous paragraphs.
5 57. CEQA provides an environmental impact report ("EIR") must be prepared on any
6 "project" a local agency intends to approve or carry out which may have a significant impact on
7 the environment. (Public Resources Code §§ 21100, 21151; Tit. 14 Cal. Code Regs
8 ("Guidelines"), § 15002, subd. (f)(1).) The California Environmental Quality Act, found at
9 Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of
10 quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide
11 concern." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).)'In CEQA, the Legislature has established
12 procedures designed to achieve these goals, principally the EIR. These procedures provide both
13 for the determination of and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the
14

15 environment of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve. CEQA

16 requires a description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation

17 measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.)
58. 18 Certain classes of projects are, however, categorically exempt from CEQA's

19 | requirements.

20 59. Both the June 5, 2019 Design Review Committee Staff Report and the July 29,

21 2019 Planning Commission Staff Report found that the Project at issue qualifies for a

22 categorical exemption from the requirements of CEQA. The City Council agreed. Substantial

23 evidence does not support this conclusion.

24

25 CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines for

26 the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Resources Code §21083.) These

27 guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15000 et seq.

28 ("Guidelines") and are binding on all state and local agencies.

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 60. However, CEQA also creates exceptions to these categorical exemptions. A

2 project that otherwise falls within a categorical exemption loses that exemption if, due to
3 "unusual circumstances" there is a "reasonable possibility" of adverse environmental impact.
4 61. Tuskatella identified two "unusual circumstances" that create such a possibility,
5 both caused by the significant traffic effects of the Project: (1) the unique aspects of the
6 alleyway as the only point of ingress and egress to the Project, including its narrowness and the
7 fact that it does not align with the opposing street and is the sole authorized and safe point of
8 entry for delivery trucks to the shopping center, and (2) the elimination of multiple other points
9 of access afforded by the reciprocal easement.
10 62. The Planning Commission found that "the project has been evaluated for
11 significant effects relating to traffic ... and no significant effects have been identified." The
12

13 City Council agreed. This finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
63.
14 The City's review of the traffic issues was cursory and consisted of nothing more

15 a than a rubber stamp of the traffic studies provided by OSH.
64.
16 The traffic studies on which the City relied were fundamentally flawed,

17 inaccurate, and incomplete in their analysis.

18 65. At the request of the City, OSH hired its consultant, RRM Design Group, to

19 prepare a traffic study for the Project site. RRM prepared a preliminary traffic study dated

20 February 4, 2019, which compared hypothetical trips per day at a bank versus a senior housing

21 project and concluded that the Project would generate fewer trips per day than the existing bank,

22 and therefore traffic concerns would decrease rather than increase.

23 66. a Based on a comment from the City's Traffic Division, the RRM Group conducted

24 an Intersectional Capacity Utilization Study, and prepared a supplemental traffic report dated

25 March 26, 2019. RRM again concluded that the Project "will not have any impact on the

26 Katella Avenue and California Street/Alley intersection or on the alley itself."

27

28

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 67. The study did not clude any figures or exhibits that illustrate the project location,
2 site plan, access points, or project trip distribution assumptions. It does not provide sufficient
3 information to fully document the project site as evaluated.

4 68. The site plan provided for the Design Review Committee does not show roadway
5 width dimensions for the California Street alleyway, which is proposed to be the sole access way
6 for the project site, nor does the study provide an evaluation of car and truck circulation through
7 the narrow alleyway. Based on the limited alleyway width, a truck turning path evaluation
8 should be performed to ensure the swept path of a truck trailer will not conflict with the
9 southbound alleyway lane.
10 69. The studies did not account for the fact that multiple existing alternative points of 11 access will be closed if the Project is approved.
12
70.
13 The studies did not take into account the fact that a portion of the alleyway will be
narrowed from 27' to 24' for the addition of a pedestrian sidewalk. Not only will this 14

15 exacerbate traffic issues, it will create serious safety concerns for those entering the Project on

16 foot and also for those that may be in the path of incoming delivery trucks and other vehicles.

17 71. The studies failed to address the elimination of access points for ambulances, fire

18 trucks and other emergency vehicles.

19 72. The studies focused on theoretical "peak" traffic hours of 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 4

20 p.m. to 6 p.m. The Tuskatella Center does not open until 10 a.m. and operates until 10 p.m.

21 And some days, such as Saturdays, generate far more traffic than others.

22 73. The studies failed to give any consideration to the impact of the Project on traffic

23 during the Saturday peak hours. Both shopping centers and senior housing have higher trip

24 generation rates during the Saturday mid-day peak period.

25 74. The left turn volumes at the intersection of Katella and the alleyway were

26 understated in the studies.

27 75. Traffic is inconsistent throughout the day, with multiple backups at the
28 intersection.

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P 76. The studies failed to take into account the type of vehicles (delivery trucks) that

2 are the primary users of the intersection. These are trucks with semi-trailers, box trucks, and

3 FedEx delivery trucks. While normal traffic may avoid the bottleneck, these trucks cannot.

4 77. The bank is not currently in operation so observed traffic counts could not
5 possibly have taken bank traffic into account.
6 78. The City's conclusion that the exception to CEQA's categorical exemption for
7 "unusual circumstances" was wrong as a matter of fact and law.

8
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
9 (VIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCES)
10 Deterioration of Bordering Land Uses
11 79. Pursuant to City Code 17.10.030(F)(2), "A conditional use permit shall not be
12 granted if it will cause deterioration of bordering land uses or create special problems for the
13 area in which it is located."
14
80. Regarding this requirement, the City found that the project did not cause 15

16 deterioration of neighboring uses or create special problems for the area because "[t]raffic and

17 parking have been evaluated and Traffic Division staff have determined that there will be no

18 detrimental effects to traffic on E. Katella Avenue and N. California Street."

81. 19 This finding is not supported by substantial evidence and was an abuse of

20 discretion.

21 82. The City failed to consider the severe traffic problems and safety issues the Project

22 would create - problems that potentially threaten the viability of surrounding business and that

23 are exacerbated by narrowing the alleyway from 27' to 24' for a pedestrian sidewalk.

24 83. The Project will also degrade the experience of tenants and customers of the

25 Katella Shopping Center.

26 84. These special problems are not created merely by the change from commercial to

27 residential use. It is primarily the result of cutting off the existing alternative points of access

28

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and the elimination of the existing reciprocal easement. The City abused its discretion by

2 approving construction of an unnecessary wall that causes this problem.

3 85. Eliminating the wall would not only benefit Tuskatella, it would benefit the

4 Project tenants by giving them another point of access. No reasonable rationale has been offered
5 for eliminating these access points.
6 86. The City also abused its discretion by illegally allowing the applicant to block the
7 private recorded reciprocal access easement that benefits the adjacent parcels. This action
8 directly "causes the deterioration of bordering land uses," creates "special problems" for the
9 area, and does not "preserve the general welfare of the area."
10 Imposing Conditions for the General Welfare
11 87. Pursuant to City Code 17.10.030(F)(4): "A conditional use, if granted, shall be 12

13 made subject to those conditions necessary to preserve the general welfare, not the individual

14 welfare of any particular applicant."

88.
15 Such conditions must be imposed for the general welfare "without regard to the

16 welfare of the individual applicant."

17 89. Regarding this requirement, the City made the following finding: "Conditions are

18 placed on the project to ensure necessary infrastructure is provided, to ensure safety of users, to

19 ensure quality aesthetic design and landscaping is implemented, and to ensure the property is

20 maintained in perpetuity. Conditions also remind the applicant of the need to pay development

21 impact and permit fees for the project's share of utilization of City infrastructure and services."

22 90. The City did not impose any conditions to promote the general welfare as related

23 to the existing problems of the narrow alleyway, which will be further exacerbated by the

24 Project.

25 91. Tuskatella identified four conditions that, if applied, would have mitigated the

26 special problems caused by the Project in support of the general welfare of the City and

27 surrounding property owners:

28 a. Widening the throat of the alleyway and creating three lanes;

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

b. Striping the alleyway to provide a visual reference for the northbound and
2 southbound lanes;

C. Eliminating the proposed barriers across the northern half of the Project site
and respecting the recorded easement that would be violated by the Project.
5 d. Requiring the Project to establish its own ingress/egress point off of Katella
6 Avenue.

7 92 Another reasonable condition would have been refusing to allow the
8 alleyway to be further narrowed from 27' to 24'.
9 93. Sometime after the Planning Commission hearing on July 29, the City striped the
10 alleyway. Otherwise, none of the proposed mitigating conditions were adopted. The City
11 abused its discretion by refusing to impose these or similar conditions that are necessary for the
12 general welfare. The City abused its discretion by never even seriously considering or
13

14 evaluating such conditions.

94.
15 If the City ever considered imposing traffic related conditions on the Project, it

16 never inquired of OSH whether such conditions would render the Project economically

17 infeasible. By failing to make such inquires, the City Council had no factual basis for rejecting

18 the mitigating conditions on the grounds of adverse economic impact on the Project.

19 Compatibility with Surrounding Uses

20

21 95. Pursuant to City Code 17.10.030(A), the City is required to determine whether the

22 proposed use, or the location of the use, is compatible with surrounding uses or can be made

23 compatible through the imposition of development conditions.

24 96. Regarding this requirement, the City's findings focused solely on architecture and
25 aesthetics.

26 97. The already-existing traffic problems, which will be significantly exacerbated by

27 the Project, make the Project incompatible with surrounding uses.

28

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 98. The Project could be made compatible with surrounding uses through appropriate
2 and reasonable development conditions, such as those proposed by Tuskatella, but the City
3 abused its discretion by ignoring these problems rather than imposing appropriate and
4 reasonable conditions.

5 Design Review Committee Guidelines

6

7 99. Pursuant to City Code 17.10.070(D): "The Design Review Committee shall make
8 a recommendation or final determination ... to approve, approve with conditions or deny a
9 project at a public meeting.
10 100. The DRC held a public hearing on the project on June 5, 2019. The minutes of
11 this DRC meeting document 17 concerns raised by the DRC.
12 101. Instead of working with the DRC to address those issues, OSH chose to ignore 13

14 them, hoping to bypass the normal design review process and find a more receptive audience

15 before the Planning Commission.

16 102. Accordingly, the five members of the DRC unanimously voted to recommend

17 denial of the CUP application.

18 Illegal Concessions and Waivers

19

20 103. The Project as approved violates four City development standards: (1) it is three

21 stories high (two is the maximum allowed by the City's development standards); (2) it is 42 feet

22 high (32 feet is the standard); (3) the existing masonry wall is in poor condition and is only five

23 feet tall (six feet is the standard); (4) the City Code requires 66 trees and the Project was

24 approved with only 48.

25 104. The City deemed these standards to be satisfied through the application of

26 concessions and waivers allegedly available under the California Density Bonus Law (Govt.

27 Code §§ 65915-65918).

28

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

105. The City misconstrued the California Density Bonus Law as applying to low-

2 income housing generally, when in fact it applies only in support of increased density.

3 106. City Code 17.15.050, which implements the California Density Bonus Law at the

4 City Code level, states: "A concession or incentive may be requested only if an application is

5 a also made for a density bonus."
6 107. The DRC Staff Report confirms that the Project meets the City's floor area ratio,
7 and accordingly OSH was not required to, and did not, request a density waiver. Accordingly,
8 OSH was not eligible for any concessions, incentives, or waivers.
9 108. Pursuant to City Code 17.15.050(B): "The applicant is required to show to the
10 satisfaction of the City that the development standard being waived ... is necessary to make the
11 housing development economically feasible."
12 109. The City did not ask for, and OSH failed to provide, any evidence that, absent
13

14 concessions and waivers, the Project would be economically infeasible.
110.
15 The City abused its discretion by granting waivers and concessions that OSH was

16 not eligible for under State law or City Code.

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays:

18 1. a For a stay of any permits to be issued in furtherance of the Project until this action

19 can be decided on the merits.

20 2. For an alternative and permanent peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City of

21 Orange to:

22 a. prepare an Environmental Impact Review as required by CEQA;

23 b. set aside the approval of OSH's application for a conditional use permit or,

24 alternatively, impose conditions that prevent deterioration of bordering land

25 uses;

26 C. set aside the approval of OSH's application or impose conditions necessary

27 to make the Project compatible with surrounding uses;

28 d. set aside the approval of the concessions and waivers applied for by OSH.

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

3. For attorneys' fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5.

2 4. For costs incurred; and

3 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010

To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are a filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must
complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type a that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money
owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general
time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
