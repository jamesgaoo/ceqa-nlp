20 Petitioners and Pläintiffs LAFA YETTE BOLLINGER DEVELOPMENT, LLC; DAVID
21 BRUZZONE and JOAN BRUZZONE (hereinafter collectively "Petitioners" or "Bruzzone
22 Family") hereby allege as follows:
INTRODUCTION 23

24 1. The Bruzzone Family has for all times alleged herein owned approximately 186
25 acres of property, within the Town of Moraga ("Town"), identified as APN 258-012-013 and 258-
26 012-023), in an area known as Bollinger Valley ("Bruzzone Property").

27 2. Following its incorporation in 1974, the Town adopted its initial General Plan in

28 1979 and designated the Bruzzone Property as "Study," meaning that before any development

021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 could occur, a study would be conducted so that an appropriate designation would be applied to
2 allow reasonable development.

3 3.

4 That was 40 years ago. Today, the Bruzzone Property remains designated as
"Study" and remains undeveloped. During this time, the Town failed to complete and approve a
5 study even though one numbering hundreds of pages and costing nearly a million dollars was
6 prepared. The Town failed to change - and refused to change -- the designation of the Bruzzone
7 Property from Study to a designation that would permit any development even though the study
8 analyzed a range of development options from 126 units to just 8 units.

9 4. By keeping the Bruzzone Property as "Study," the Town has maintained a de facto
10 40-year moratorium on development so as to devote the Bruzzone Property as open space without

e paying just-compensation.Tho Town-has-never-made-findings,-when-it-designated the Property-as

08 eMpeOJg bilL 24t° Floor Wendel, Rosen, Black ueaa 9807-L096 EjuJOHHBO 'pUBeO 12 "Study" or when it denied the Bruzzone Family's application to change the designation, that
13 would support a development moratorium as required by Government Code section 65858.

14 5. At all times as stated herein, the Bruzzone Family has attempted to process
15 applications for a reasonable single-family residential development project ("Project") on the
16 Bruzzone Property. The Town has denied such applications.

17 6. Given that a city's general plan is the constitution for all development, a city's
18 zoning designations must be consistent with the general plan. (Gov. Code § 65860(a)). Thus, for
19 example, if a city's general plan designation is "Residential," a corresponding zoning designation
20 would be "single-family residential, 1 unit per acre."

21 7. In this case, for the past 40 years and counting, the Town of Moraga's General
22 Plan failed to designate the Bruzzone Property for "Residential, ""Commercial, " Industrial," or
23 for any allowable land use, or for any allowable intensity of use, as expressly required by statute
24  at Gov. Code 65302.

25 8. Instead, for the past 40 years, the Town has designated the area merely as a "Study
26 Area" in the General Plan Land Use element, and as "Study" in its zoning ordinance thereby
27| ensuring that the Bruzzone Property cannot be developed. (See Moraga 2002 General Plan
28 (Moraga General Plan), Appendix A General Plan Diagram

021333.0003\5358149.2 2
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

9. The Moraga General Plan "Study Area" designation does not provide for any

2 specific type of use allowed on the Bruzzone Property, nor the extent of such use, as required by
Government Code section 65302(a). Instead, the "Study Area" designation merely states that the

4 Bruzzone Property will be "studied" for future development. Any development application must
include proposed general plan amendment since the "Study Area" designation does not permit
any development. As a result, no proposed project can be consistent with the General Plan, but
7 must, instead, require discretionary approval by the Planning Commission and Town Council. 6

10. It is undisputed that the "Study" designation precludes any development of the
Bruzzone Property. Given that a city's general plan is the constitution for all future development,
10 any decision by a city affecting development must be consistent with the general plan. (Friends of
11 Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville ((2007) 154 Cal. App. 4th 807, 815). Therefore, the Bruzzone
12 Family cannot develop the Bruzzone Property unless and until an amendment to the Moraga
10014 .72 *fempeos • d11 ueag 8 ype|g 'uesoy 'japueM SEO7-LO9P6 BIUJOHIEO *pUBIxeO 13 General Plan takes the Property out of the "Study Area" designation and sets forth a proper

14 designation for a certain use of the Property as required by Government Code section 65302.

15 11. The text of the Moraga General Plan labels the Bruzzone Property as being within
16 the "Bollinger Canyon Special Study Area." The text confirms that the Bollinger Canyon Special
17 Study Area is "one of the few remaining areas of development potential for the Town." (Moraga
18 General Plan at p. 3-14). However, the Moraga General Plan has failed for 40 years to designate

19 the Bruzzone Property for any type of use, development or intensity, as required by Government

20 Code section 65302. Instead, to ensure the Property is never developed, the Town has simply

21 indicated that the area will be the subject of "Study."

22 12. The Moraga General Plan text states as follows:

23 [T]he Bollinger Canyon Area will be the subject of a "special study" conducted by the property owners to document the site's 24 opportunities and constraints and define a conceptual plan of
development . . (Moraga General Plan at p. 3-14) 25

13. As shown herein, the Bruzzone Family prepared and funded the special study and
27 related documents, precisely as required by the Moraga General Plan. From the year 2002 to the 26

28| present, a total of 16 years, the Bruzzone Family spent millions of dollars in preparing, submitting

3
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

and processing all of the special study documents as referenced in the Moraga General Plan
2| ("Project Applications").

3 14. As part of the special study, the Bruzzone Family paid the Town over $800,000 for.
the preparation and certification of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) pursuant to the

5 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The EIR is the backbone of the special study.

6 The EIR studies and analyzes the potential environmental impacts of the 126-unit Project, as well
7 as six less intensive alternatives to the Project - including alternatives all the way down to only 8

8 units.

9 15. The Town's concurrent zoning designation for the Property is also "Study.". The
10 zoning ordinance at Chapter 8.60 (Study District) specifically states that the Study District will be•
11 temporary only. As shown herein, the Town of Moraga has not followed its own General Plan
12 and its own zoning or dinance. The Town has not kept the Bruzzone Property as "Study" for a

od5 j001d wtz "fempaoug btll Wendel, Rosen, Black c ueeg LLP 9E07-20976 BjuJOjEO Oakland, 13 temporary period of time. Instead, in order to ensure that no development occurs on the Bruzzone
14 Property, the Town has kept the Bruzzone Property as "Study" for 40 years - a Biblical amount of
15 time.

16 16. There is no legal authority for designating - and leaving - private property as
17| "Study" in a general plan for such a long length of time, and for the resulting purpose of ensuring
18 such property cannot be used or developed. Such a scheme is a de facto moratorium on
19 development and prevents a property owner from taking advantage of numerous state laws that
20 permit and/or streamline development that is consistent with a city's objective general plan and
21 zoning standards.

22 17. On November 28, 2003, the Bruzzone Family submitted the Project Applications
23 for residential development of the Property. Specifically, the Bruzzone Family requested a
24 General Plan Amendment (GPA) to take the Property out of the general plan designation for
25 "Study Area," to allow a reasonable usc/density for development: Residential-2 Dwelling Units

26 per Acre on 92 acres for the residential subdivision; and Non-MOSO Open Space lands for the
27 remaining 94.3 acres of the site. Further, the Bruzzone Family requested a rezone from "Study" to
28 allow for planned Single Family Residential and Open Space uses ("Rezone"). The Bruzzone

4
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a Family further submitted a conceptual development and conservation-plan ("CDCP") with
2. supporting environmental documentation.

3 18. Following adoption of the 2002 Moraga General Plan in 2002, the filing of the

4 Project Applications in 2003, the Bruzzone Family has for the past 16 years made extraordinary
efforts to gain approval of the Project Applications. The Bruzzone Family has spent millions of
dollars in processing in the Project Applications, and in payments to the Town for preparing an

7 EIR required by the Town for compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA") and to comply with the General Plan's "special study" requirement for the Bruzzone

o Property.

10 19. On June 7, 2006, the Bruzzone Family and the City entered into a separate, binding
11 contract (the "EIR Contract"). Under the EIR Contract, the Bruzzone Family agreed to pay
12 certain sums of money to the Town in return for the Town's agreement to (i) prepare, and (ii)
joold utz 'Kempeosg belt Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean •8 LLP 980½-L0976 Ejujojeo 'puejyeo 13 certify the EIR for the Project, sO that the Bruzzone Property could be taken out of the
14 "temporary" Study Area designation and given a designation for development. Since 2006, the
15 Bruzzone Family has spent millions of dollars in processing the Applications in direct reliance on
16 the Town's contractual promise to prepare and certify the EIR.

17 20. On November 14, 2018, after 15 years of processing, the Town Council ignored the
18 prepared EIR (that it refused to certify) and denied the Project in its entirety, as follows:
19 Denied the General Plan Amendment;
20 Denied the Rezoning;
21 Denied all alternatives to the Project (including less-dense alternatives of 8 units, 37 units, 85. 22 units, 100 units, and 121 units);
23 Did not certify the EIR as required by the
24 separate EIR Contract and CEQA; and

25 Left the Property designated as "Study."

26 21. The effect of the Town Council's denial of the Project after 40 years of "Study"
27 designation and 15 years of processing was to take all reasonable and economic use of the
28 Property. With the Property remaining as "Study," the Bruzzone Family cannot propose any

5
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 general plan-compliant project, because any development will be inconsistent with the General

2 Plan and zoning "Study" designations.

3 22. The Town Council's denial of the General Plan Amendment to replace the "Study
4 Area" designation with a new, proper designation allowing for an identified use/development of
5 the Property further violates its own General Plan and zoning ordinance, which set forth specific
6 procedure to take the Bruzzone Property out of the "temporary" Study designation.

7 23. In addition, the Town's failure to complete and certify the EIR clearly breaches the

8 EIR Contract entered into by the Bruzzone Family and the Town.

2 Costa.

STATEMENT OF FACTS 3

4 40. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 39, above, are hereby incorporated by

5 reference as though set forth in full.

6 41. On November 13, 1974, the Town of Moraga incorporated. When the Town
7 incorporated, the Town from 1974 -1979 utilized the County General Plan for the land use
8 designation for the Bruzzone Property, which was R-15 (a "residential" designation, allowing for

9 15,000 sq. ft. residential lots) as a basis for the Town's land use decision making. Such
10 designation would have allowed approximately 540 homes on the 186-acre Property.

11 42. On March 21, 1979, the Town adopted its first general plan ("1979 Moraga General
12 Plan"). The 1979 Moraga General Plan did not designate the Bruzzone Property for "Residential"
9€07-L0976 BIUJO;IBO 'pUeINEO jootd urz .Kempeoje bitL d77 ueag 8 *pelg 'uesoy 'jepuem 13 or any land use designation as required by statute. Instead, the 1979 Moraga General Plan
14 designated the Bruzzone Property as "Study Area" - a designation that does not, in and of itself -
15 permit any development. Such designation remains today, 40 years later:

16 43. In 1980, the Town adopted its first zoning ordinance ("1980 Zoning Ordinance.")
17 The Town's Zoning Ordinance also designated the Bruzzone Property as "Study." The stated
18 purpose for the "Study" designation was/is for "temporary control of development in the area."

19 The purpose of this [Study] district is to permit temporary control of the development in an area while the planning agency conducts 20 detailed studies. (1980 Zoning Ordinance, adopted October 8, 1980, at Sec. 8-4001.) (Emphasis added.) 21

22 44. The Moraga Zoning ordinance remains in effect today (Chapter 8.60 (Study
23 District)), contains precisely the same language as its 1980 predecessor - stating that the "Study"
24 district is merely "temporary."
25 The purpose of this [Study] district is to permit temporary control of the development in an area while the planning agency conducts 26 detailed studies. Until the studies are complete, the policies and procedures governing development set forth in planning commission 27 Resolution 5-79 apply. (citing prior code Sec. 8-4001). (Emphasis
28 added.)

9
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The Town has repeatedly indicated that the sole purpose of the "Study" district is to permit
2 only "temporary control" while the "planning agency" (the Town) conducts detailed studies. Yet,
3 after 40 years, after detailed studies have been submitted by the Bruzzone Family, and a full EIR

5 has been drafted, the Town has not approved any development proposals, nor removed the

6 "Study" designation thereby prohibiting all development for 40 years in what was purported to be

7 a "temporary" control measure. After 40 years, the "temporary" control on the Bruzzone Property
has, as a practical matter, become permanent.

45. On June 4, 2002, the Town adopted an updated general plan (that remains in place)
that contained all current policies and regulations applicable to the Bruzzone Property until the
10 Town took action on November 14, 2018 to deny the Project Applications and apply new Hillside

11

12 Regulations, while leaving the Bruzzone Property subject to the "Study Area" designation.

46.
1111 Broadway, 241h Floor •f d11 ueag g yoelg 'uasoy 'lepuam Oakland, California 94607-4036 By statute, all cities are required to prepare and adopt a comprehensive long-term
13 "general plan" for the development of the city. (Gov. Code § 65300 et seq.) A city's general plan

14 is mandatory, and serves as the "constitution" for the city. (Lesher Communications, Inc. V. City
15 of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal. 3d. 531, 540.) The California Supreme Court has confirmed the
16 general plan to be the "single most important planning document." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
17 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d. 553, 570-571.)

18 47. The general plan is required to have eight mandatory elements: land use,
19 circulation, housing, conservation, open space, noise, safety and environmental justice. (Gov.
20 Code 65302) The land use element "serves as the central framework for the entire plan ... its
21 goals, policies, programs, diagrams and maps relate directly to the other elements." (Talbert &

22

23 Gray, California Land Use & Planning Law, 36th Ed. (2018), at p. 12., citing Gov. Code
co 65302.)

24 48. The land use element "must identify the proposed general distribution and general
25 location and extent of the uses of the land for'housing business, industry, open space ...' (Gov.
26 Code § 65302(a).) Thus, general plans set forth land use designations and corresponding uses of

2 plans set forth the extent, or intensity of such uses, for example: "Residential, low density, 1-3
3  residential dwelling units per acre."

4 49. The Moraga General Plan contains a Land Use clement, as required by statute. The
5 Land Use Element designates lands within the Town as "Residential," "Commercial,"
6 "Institutional," "Agricultural," etc. However, the Moraga General Plan continues to designate a
7 large area (principally consisting of the Bruzzone Property) as "Study Area, and fails to
8  reference the use, or intensity of use, of the Bruzzone Property as required by Government Code
9  section 65302.

10 50. The Moraga General Plan provides for the Bruzzone Family's submission of
11 applications to the Town as occurred in 2003, in order to replace the "Study" designation and
9 12 develop the Property. The General Plan states as follows:
9807-209%6 ejuJQjlIed 'puejjeo J0014 g7Z *Kempeorg sll; Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean 05 13 GOAL: Consideration of development of this area is subject to completion of a detailed study and preparation of an area plan by the 14 property owner for the Town's review and approval to guide

16 LU6.1 Bollinger Canyon Study Area. Due to the special character of the Bollinger Canyon area, its unique development issues, and its
17 status as one of the few remaining areas development potential in the Town, the Bollinger Canyon Area will be the subject of a
18 "special study" conducted by area property owners to document the site's opportunities and constraints and define a conceptual plan of
19 development consistent with the goals and policies of the Town's General Plan. This study will focus on that area identified on the

27 scheduled to be completed by "December 2004" and was the responsibility of the property
28 owners, the Town's planning staff and the Town Council.

52. The Bruzzone Family, at its own cost (including over $800,000 for the EIR alone),
2 submitted all of the analysis and applications required by the General Plan. The Town, however,
3 denied all such analysis and applications, and retained the Bruzzone Property as "Study Area"

4 despite the fact a that a study had been prepared and that the designation was to be "temporary." In
5 so doing, the Town ensured that no development can take place on the Bruzzone Property.

6 53. The Moraga General Plan expressly requires the Town to coordinate with the
7 Bruzzone Family to support their efforts in bringing forth the required analysis and applications.

1111 Broadway, 24** Floor Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean LLP. 08 980+-L0976 equJoujeo 'puelxeo The Moraga General Plan specifically requires the Town to "coordinate with the
13 property owners" to "support their effort" in preparing a special study. To the contrary, the Town
14 did not coordinate with the Bruzzone Family, and did not support the Bruzzone Family's efforts in
15 preparing a special study. Instead, the Town did the exact opposite: it used all of its efforts to
16 delay, prevent and deny the Project Applications, including adopting new Hillside Regulations to
17 further restrict development. Ultimately, the Town refused to certify the Project EIR and
18 summarily denied all of the Project Applications, leaving the Bruzzone Property's "temporary"
19 land use designation as "Study Area" in violation of its own General Plan. (See, e.g., Avenida San
20| Juan Partnership v. City of San Clemente 201 Cal. App. 4th 1256 (2011), wherein trial court found
21 evidence that city acted in bad faith and never gave consideration to the owner's applications for a

7 56. On November 28, 2003, the Bruzzone Family submitted the following Project
8 Applications as part of the special study referenced in the General Plan: (i) a General Plan

9 Amendment ("GPA") to replace the "Study" designation with residential use; (ii) a change of
10 Zoning request to concurrently remove the Property from "Study" ("Rezone"); and (iii) a
11 Conceptual Development and Conservation Plan ("CDCP"). The Bruzzone Family further

14 57. The Bruzzone Family further agreed as part of the "special study" to the
15 preparation of a full EIR for the Project and Project Applications. The EIR was/is the backbone of
16 the special study, analyzing the environmental impacts of the Project along with six, less dense
17 alternatives.

18 58. On June 7, 2006, the Bruzzone Family entered into a contract with the City
19 regarding the EIR ("EIR Contract"). Under the EIR Contract, the Bruzzone Family agreed to pay
20 significant, identified sums of money to the Town, and, in return, the Town agreed to (i) prepare;

21 and (ii) certify the EIR for the Project. The EIR Contract specifically provides that in return for
22 monies paid by the Bruzzone Family, the Town would prepare and certify the EIR as follows:

23 A. Applicant [the Bruzzone Family] and its related entities have submitted a detailed project description and supporting 24 documentation for long-term use of the 186-acre Bollinger Valley Property (the "Proposed Project") which requests that the Town 25 prepare and certify a project-level environmental impact report ("EIR") ... (EIR Contract at RECITAL A, p. 1)... 26

13
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The EIR Contract is supported by numerous written correspondence between the Town
2 and Bruzzone confirming the parties' intent that the EIR Contract provides for the Bruzzone's

3

4 timely payments for the EIR, in return for the Town's preparation and certification of the EIR.

59.

5 The Town, after accepting over $800,000 from the Bruzzone Family under the EIR

6 Contract, failed to prepare and certify the FEIR as specifically required by the EIR Contract.

60.

7 The Bruzzone Family spent millions of dollars to process the Project Applications

8 in direct reliance on the EIR Contract, and fulfilled all of its obligations under the EIR Contract.
The Town accepted the monies paid by the Bruzzone Family, but failed to complete and certify
9 the EIR.

10 61. In rejecting the Project, the Town alleged that "CEQA does not apply," and denied

12

6g 1111 Broadway, 24t* Floor 'uasoy 'lapuaM yOel8 ueeg LLP 11 that the Town had any obligation to prepare and certify the EIR. The Town's statements in this

9807-20976 BJUJOHIBO Oakland, regard do not withstand scrutiny. First, the Town had (and has) an obligation under the General
13 Plan text to prepare and certify the EIR in order to take the Bruzzone Property out of the
14 | "temporary" Study Area designation after the 40-year "delay." Second, the Town ignored its
15 separate contractual obligations. In Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition LLC v. Town of Mammoth
16 Lakes (2010) 191 Cal. App. 4th 435, 442), a the appellate court upheld a $30 million damage award
17 against the Town of Mammoth Lakes for that town's anticipatory breach of a development
18 agreement. The court based its analysis on contract law (not on land use law) to justify the jury's

19 award. Note that in Mammoth, the Town of Mammoth attempted to assert a defense of "good
20 faith interpretation" of the contract. Such defense was summarily rejected by the court on the
21 basis that "the town officials, in denying the applications, were actively working .. to terminate
22 the Developer's rights under the [contract]." (191 Cal Ap. 4th at 468.) Here, the Town of Moraga,
23 after entering into the EIR Contract, actively worked to deny the Project and to terminate the
24 Bruzzone Family's rights under the EIR Contract.

25 62. Beginning in 2013, and while the Project Applications were being processed, the
26 Town directed Staff to initiate new hillside and ridgeline regulations ("Hillside and Ridgeline
27 Regulations") that would prevent development on the Property.

28

021333.0003\5358149.2 14
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

63. Staff proposed that the Hillside and Ridgeline Regulations be applied directly to the

2 Project in order to ensure that the Project could not be developed. By letter/report dated February

3 8, 2017, the Bruzzone Family provided substantial evidence to the Town that such application of

4 new Hillside Regulations would take all reasonable use of the Property, and would be improper
5 given the Town's decades-long processing of the Project Applications.

6 64. On April 18, 2018, the Town, over objection at public hearings by the Bruzzone
Family, adopted the Hillside Regulations.' As part of such adoption, the Town purported to
8 temporarily "exempt" the Project Applications from the new Hillside Regulations. However, there 7

was no such exemption because the exemption would "disappear" once the Project Applications

10 were denied. The Town's "exemption" language states as follows:
11 [O]nce any nding development project application has been acted upon by the final reviewing body ..., this exemption shall no longer od d11 ueag 8 ypel9 'uasoy 'lapuaM 12 apply to any such application.
9007-L0976 ejUJ0;BO *pue¡eo 10012 mtz 'Kempeojg l •13 65. By confirming that the exemption "shall no longer apply" (i.e., it "disappears") as
14 soon as the Town Council denies the Project Applications, the Council implemented the following
15 pre-ordained procedure: (i) the Council would deny the Project; (ii) the Council would not certify
16 the EIR as required by the EIR Contract; and (iii) the Council would ensure that any new project
17 would be subject to the Hillside Regulations. In such manner, the Town Council ensured that the
18 Bruzzone Property would remain as "Study" (and be prevented from being be developed) for 40
19 years and counting.

20 66. By letter dated January 18, 2017, the Bruzzone Family's attorneys warned the

21 Town against such an approach:

22 The Bruzzone Family, and Dick Loewke's office, are of course
appalled at the Town's statements to the effect that the Town may 23 simply "deny" the Bollinger Valley Project, including refusal to act on establishment of a replacement (permanent) land use designation and zoning to accommodate a feasible housing development, based 24

25 In response to the Town's adoption of the Hillside Regulations, the Bruzzone family filed an 26 action in the Superior Court, Contra Costa County, against the Town of Moraga, based on the Town's failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report for such adoption as required by the 27 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). (Bruzzone v. Town of Moraga, et al. [Contra

4 alternatives: "No Project (Alt 8 #1), 8 DU (Alt #2); 37 (DU) ("Alt #3); 100 DU ("Alt #4); and 121

5 DU ("Alt #6). After meetings with Staff, the Bruzzone Family on June 16, 2017 submitted an

6 additional "Reduced Density Alternative ("RDA") (Alt #6), consisting of only 85 units. After
7 further meetings with Staff, the Bruzzone Family further submitted extensive information to the
8 Town showing that the RDA substantially reduced impacts in comparison to other alternatives,

9 and that the RDA was the smallest of all potentially feasible alternatives which could provide
10 access and utilities necessary for emergency services and avoidance of significant risks to human
11 life as documented in the Draft EIR.

14 Town's denial of the Project would constitute an "action" under CEQA requiring environmental
15 review since the Town's denial of the Project would result in a discretionary action, i.e., the
16 imposition of the Hillside Regulations to the Bruzzone Property thereby prohibiting any
17 development of the Property, without any CEQA review.
18 69. At the end of the public hearing, the Planning Commission recommended denial of
19 the Project to the Town Council, as follows:

20 Denial of the GPA, rezoning, and Conceptual Plan, including all of the alternatives to the original Project; 21 and

• No certification of the EIR. 22

23 70. The Bruzzone Family filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision, and
24  raised the same issues to the Town Council as it had to the Planning Commission. After the

25 Council held a public hearing, it also denied the Project. It summarily stated that given its denial
26  of the Project, no CEQA review is required. The Council further stated it had no obligations under

27 the EIR Contract, and that the Town would simply "keep" all monies submitted by the Bruzzone
28 Family under the EIR Contract. The Council indicated that it was not required under CEQA to

finalize, consider, or certify the EIR.

2 71. On November 14, 2018, by Resolution No. 66-2018 ("Council Resolution of

3 Denial"), the Council denied the Project, as follows:

4 Denial of the GPA;

5 Denial of the Rezoning;

6 Denial of the Conceptual Development Plan,
Denial of all six of the Project Alternatives, including the applicant-sponsored 85-lot Reduced Scale Alternative; and 8
No certification of the EIR. 9

10 72.• The Town Council's denial of the GPA and all Project Alternatives kept the
11 Bruzzone Property as "Study Area" and no closer to being allowed for development as it has been
LLP ueag 12 for the past 40 years.

13 73. ed EMpeOJS BELL 24** Floor The Town Council directed Staff to determine the estimated cost of preparing a Black 'uesoy 'lapuem 9€07-L0976 ejujojeo 'pueryeo 14 general plan amendment and rezone of the Bruzzone Property from "Study" to reflect the
•15 residential density consistent with the guiding principles, goals and standards of the General Plan
16 and to return to the Council with funding recommendations. (11/14/18 Council Minutes.) The
17 Town Council's direction to staff on November 18, 2018 ("Council Direction to Staff') is
18 inconsistent with the existing General Plan text, which requires that a special study be performed,
19 the Bruzzone Family submit applications for development, and thereafter that the Property be
20 taken out of the "temporary" Study designation. The Council's Direction to Staff (i) is not

21 authorized or referenced in the General Plan; (ii) effectively results in the Property remaining as
22 "Study" for 40 years and counting; and ignores the fact that adjacent property is zoned at densities is
23 of one unit per acre. The Council was also aware that any new project would be subject to the
24 recently adopted Hillside Regulations which effectively prevent any development on the Bruzzone
25 Property.

26 74. The Council's Direction to Staff is directly inconsistent with the Council's refusal
27 to certify (or revise and certify) the EIR and its denial of the Project and all six Project
28 Alternatives. The Council's Direction to Staff is to determine the cost of moving forward with

17
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F general plan amendment and rezone of the Bruzzone Property from "Study" to reflect the

2 residential density consistent with the guiding principles, goals and standards of the General Plan.

3 This is essentially a proposal to re-designate the Property as Open Space (a designation that could
4 accommodate between 5 and one unit per 20 acres). However, the Council's earlier one per

5 decision was to refuse to certify the EIR and to deny all six Project Alternatives, including
6 Alternative No. 3 which identified one unit per five acres. In taking this earlier action, the Town

7 found that none of the Alternatives could be approved.

8 75. The Council's Direction to Staff is a transparent and invalid attempt to avoid a
9 clear "taking" of all reasonable use of the Property despite the Town keeping its designation as
10 "Study Area." The Council's Direction to Staff is a purported attempt to save face and indicate

11 that, after 40 years, the Town is finally taking action, however minimal, toward "considering"
e 12 removing the Property from "Study." Nothing could be further from the truth. The Council's

c8 J0013 .7Z Kempeoug bebl Wendel, Rosen, )3e18 Dean 4807-4036 ejuJogueo *pueneo 13 Direction to Staff does nothing to take the Property from its "Study" designation. The Council is
14 well aware that its decision of November 14, 2018 leaves the Property as "Study" (for 40 years
15 and counting), and that the Council has effectively "taken" all use of the Bruzzone Property.
16 76. The Town claims that denying the Bruzzone Project "does not mean that
17 development within the Bollinger Valley is prohibited from future consideration." (11/14/18 Staff
18 Report, at p. 46.) This statement is absolutely and unequivocally false. It is indisputable that
19 under the General Plan designation of "Study" - the Bruzzone Property cannot be developed in
20 any way, shape or form. It is indisputable that the Council's decision maintains the Bruzzone
21 Property as "Study," for 40 years and counting. Staff and the Town are in effect saying: "The
22 Bruzzone Family can submit another application." However, the Town, after 16 years of review
23 and processing summarily denied the Project Applications, including six different alternatives
24 including one with only eight homes. It has taken the Bruzzone Family 16 years and millions of
25 dollars to prepare and process the Project Applications. Given the Town's denial of all the Project
26 Applications, along with all the alternatives studied in the EIR that the Town refused to certify,
27 and the Town's track record of a 16-year processing time, it would be absolutely futile for the

28

18
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

1 Bruzzone Family to simply "submit another application" and expect that it would be approved, let

2 alone fairly considered, by the Town.

3 77.

4 Prior to the Town's denial of the Project Applications, the Bruzzone Family,

5 through its attorneys and consultant Richard Loewke, AICP, submitted numerous correspondence

6 and extensive documentation in support of the Applications ("Bruzzone Family Correspondence").
The Bruzzone Family Correspondence includes expert evaluation of the Project Applications and
7 evaluations of the Town's concerns and issues raised by the EIR

8 78.

9 The Town, in denying the Project, and all six of the alternatives contained in the
EIR, failed to respond to, or even reference, the Bruzzone Family Correspondence. The Town
10 further failed to address the conclusions contained in the EIR supporting the Project and the

11

4 feasible alternatives identified in the EIR. Instead, the Town circumvented the EIR (and all

Jo0ld utz "Kempeoug betL 'lapuem Rosen, Black & Dean 0f Oakland, California €0+-2096 12 significant documents submitted in support of the Project) and purported to find that the Project,

13 and all of its feasible alternatives, violate specific policies of the General Plan. Such findings
14 ignored the General Plan text requiring the Town to coordinate with the landowners on their
15 applications, and the zoning text stating that the "Study" designation is only a "temporary"
16 designation. The Town, in desiring to keep the Property as open space, never

17 considered the

merits of the Applications, including, but not limited to, the smaller applicant-sponsored 85-home

18 Reduced Scale Alternative.

19 79. This type of approach was severely criticized and invalidated in Avenida San Juan
20| Partnership v. City of San Clemente, referenced above. In Avenida, the appellate court noted that

21 evidence at the trial showed:

22 Even though Plaintiff [landowner] asked for a general plan

23 amendment and zoning amendment, the denials [by the city] were

24 all illogically "based" on the fact that the applications did not comply with the general plan and zoning ordinances."

25 The appellate court concluded:

26 In essence, the City never gave any serious consideration to the

27 owner's applications. (201 Cal. App. 4th at 1264.)

28

021333.0003\5358149.2 19
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The evidence in the instant case is even more compelling than in Avenida. In this case, the
2 Moraga General Plan text requires (i) applications to be submitted by the landowner; (ii)
3 coordination on such applications by the Town; and (iii) only a "temporary" designation of Study.
4 The Bruzzone Family fully complied with the General Plan text and submitted all Project
Applications to take the Property out of the Study designation. In response, the Town rejected all
6 the Applications, the Project, and all of its feasible alternatives as identified in the EIR, and left the
7 Property in Study. It is indisputable that leaving the Property as "Study" for 40 years and
8| counting is longer than a "temporary" designation, and violates the General Plan policies
specifically pertaining to the Bruzzone Property.

10 80. The Council Resolution of Denial stated that the GPA, Rezone, and CDCP were all

11 "inconsistent" with the General Plan. Primarily, the Town referenced the following General Plan

20 81. The Council, repeatedly referenced the above Guiding Principal 1 of the General

21 Plan - to preserve the Town's "natural setting," "undeveloped ridgelines" and "open space" - as
22 the first and foremost reason for denying the Project and each of the feasible alternatives identified

24 preserve the Town's natural setting, ridgelines and/or open space. Stated another away, such

Guiding Principle 1, as applied by the Town, takes all use and development rights of all private

3 82. The Council's Resolution of Denial sets forth additoinal findings of inconsistency
4 regarding the Project and the General Plan. By letter dated November 13, 2018, and attachments,
5 submitted prior to the hearing on November 14, 2018, the Bruzzone Family's counsel (Wendel

$6 Rosen) and land use consultant (Richard Loewke, AICP) address these then-proposed findings of
7 inconsistency. (Wendel Rosen Letter).

8 83. The Wendel Rosen Letter includes the following comments to the Council for the
9 November 14, 2018 hearing:

10 [With Regard to Results of Towns Actions]

Resolution is passed? The results are clear: d11 ueag g ypeja uesoy 'lepuam 12
All aspects of the entire Project, including the GPA, 9E07-209#6 California puBIEO J00ld utz 'Kempeojs LALL 13 Rezoning, and Conceptual Plan, are denied.
14 The Property remains, after 40 years, designated as
"Study" in both the General Plan and zoning ordinance. 15

• No use of the Property or development is possible. 16
Any new development, even if proposed, will be subject 17 to the new Hillside Regulations.
18 The EIR is not certified, denying the landowner any
19 further use of the EIR for any applications. (Wendel Rosen Letter at pp. 12-13).
20
The Bruzzone family will have lost: (i) all monies paid to 21 the City in direct reliance on the contract; (ii) all monies paid to consultants for the "study" mandated by the 22 General Plan in 2002; (iii) all monies paid to consultants for processing the applications; (iv) all monies paid to the 23 Town in reliance on the General Plan and [the EIR]
Contract, and (v) all reasonable use of their property, 24 over a 40 year period and into the future.
25 [With Regard To "Taking" All Reasonable Use Of Bruzzone Property] 26
Here, the Town's actions satisfy even the strictest tests for a 27 takings..... The Town has designated the Property as "Study" for 40
28 years. The Genera Plan has mandated that the Town work

21
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

with/coordinate with the Property owner on applications to remove the Study designation and allow for development. The Town and 2 Staff have continually refused to do so. The Town has refused to
follow its own General Plan - and has recommended that the 3 Property remain as "Study."
4 We can think of no clearer case for takings, and we can find no
5 appellate law that allows a Town to "keep" a Property in "Study" for 40 years - with no end in sight.
6 Please note that under the Town's interpretation of the law, any
7 city/county can designate large areas of land as "Study" in the General Plan and zoning ordinances. Such city/county can leave
8 such areas in "Study" for decades/generations, and thereby "take" all economic use of such areas. If/when a property owner requests a 9 General Plan or zoning amendment necessary to develop a project - the city/county can simply (i) deny such request; and (ii) fail to 10 certify or recognize any environment review for the request. In such manner, the city/county ensures the property can never be 11 developed, and remains in perpetuity as open space. (Wendel Rosen Letter at p. 14.) 12

As stated, the Town entered into a separate contract with the 14 Bruzzone Family in 2006, entitled "Reimbursement Agreement"
15 (hereinäfter "Contract"). The Contract provides that the Bruzzone
Family has submitted applications (as required by the General Plan)
16 a for a General Plan, Rezoning, and Conceptual Plan. The Contract provides that such applications request that the Town: (i) prepare; 17 and (ii) certify project level environmental review report for such applications. (See Contract at Recital A.) 18
The Contract requires that the Bruzzone Family must pay specific 19 costs, at certain rates. In return, the Town promised to accomplish certain tasks, including preparing and certifying the EIR . 20
The Contract provides that the Town will prepare and certify the 21 FEIR, in exchange for certain payments and certain rates paid by
22 Bruzzone. As stated, the Bruzzone Family has paid over $700,000 for the EIR, primarily in direct reliance on the Contract- and such
23 monies have been accepted by the Town; together with hundreds of thousands of additional dollars for processing. (Wendel Rosen 24 Letter at pp. 14-15.)

25 [With Regard to Town's Stated Reasons For Deniall

26 As stated, the Staff Report (and Planning Commission recommendation based on the earlier Staff Report) performs an "end 27 run" around CEQA. The Staff Report and proposed findings are in many respects inconsistent with the analysis/findings in the EIR. 28 Whether or not the EIR is certified, Staff and the Town are

22
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

responsible for placing substantial evidence in the record supporting the Town's findings for denial of the Project. If the Town's 2 proposed findings for denial differ significantly from the analysis/findings of the Town's consultants as set forth in the EIR - 3 then the Town is responsible for explaining such differences [and has not done so]. 4
We noted that all general plans set forth goals and policies that 5 "compete" with one another. For example, the housing element
6 goals and policies provide for needed housing; while the open space element goals and policies provide for preservation of open space.
7 As stated, the Staff Report does not balance these goals and policies but rather references only the goals and policies preventing 8 development, while overlooking goals and policies in support of the Project [and the infrastructure needed to safely accommodate it]. 9 (Wendel Rosen Letter at p. 16.)
10 84. The Wendel Rosen Letter references an attachment prepared by Richard Loewke,
11 AICP, entitled "False Findings Prepared by Staff for Town Council Consideration on 11/14/18 for
12

o8 Jooid wtz 'Kempeoug berl d11 ueeg ypeia 'uesoy 'lepuam Bollinger Family Review ("Loewke Findings Letter"). The Loewke Findings Letter sets forth a
€07-40976 EjuJqjleo 'puereo 13 detailed response to the Town's proposed findings for denial of the Bruzzone Project.
14 85. For example, the Council Resolution of Denial, in referencing certain parts of the
15 General Plan for purposes of showing that the Project is inconsistent therewith, fails to address
16 the General Plan's Housing Element. The Loewke Findings Letter states:
17 Moraga has failed to meet its RHNA [Regional Housing Needs Allocation] obligation ever since the performance review cycle 18 program was established. Despite affirmative language in its General Plan Land Use and Housing Elements, and the stated 19 purposes of the MCSP [Moraga Center Specific Plan], Moraga has
20 accommodated 0% of its Low and Moderate-Income housing needs since 1988, and a total of just 13% of its overall fair share housing
21 obligation over the past 30 years . . . (Emphasis in original). (Loewke Findings Letter at p.3)
22

23 86. For further example the Council's Resolution of Denial states that the Project is
24 inconsistent with Public Safety policies providing for response driving times not in excess of 3
25 minutes and/or a travel distance of more than 1.5 miles from the closest fire station. The Loewke
26 findings letter shows conclusively that (i) such policies were intended to provide guidance for the
27 Town to work with the Moraga-Orinda Fire District (MOFD) to plan for the location of new fire
28 stations in Moraga to improve response times throughout the community; (ii) such policies

23
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

1 acknowledge that half of the entire developed Town of Moraga (including for example the St.

2 Mary's College Campus and the developed Sanders Ranch neighborhood) is currently more than
1.5 driving miles from the two existing stations; and (iii) the Property is 2.8 driving miles from
4 MOFD Station 41 and 2.5 driving miles from MOFD Station 42, and therefore both stations are 3

5 within the 3-mile MOFD adequacy of service standard. (See Loewke Findings Letter ât pp. 10-

6 11.)

7 87. As stated in the Wendel Rosen and Loewke Findings Letters, the Town's decision

8 on November 14, 2018, to deny the Project does not reference the Housing Element or other
elements of the General Plan. The Town's decision references only broad General Plan and
10 related policies that may limit development. All general plans have policies regarding
11 development (in land use and building sections) and policies regarding preservation of open space
12 (in open space and conservation sections). The Town decision ignores the Housing Element and 94607-4036 ejuojlleo *puemeo 3001s wtz 'Kempeol 1111 B a8 d11 ueag g yoela 'uesoy 'lapueM 13 | other sections in the General Plan that support development - and references only those policies in
14 support of conservation/open space. No project can ever be approved under such standards.

15 88. The Council Resolution of Denial does not address the extensive correspondence
16 submitted on behalf of the Bruzzone Family's attorneys and consultants.

17 89. The Council Resolution of Denial is wholly inconsistent with the findings set forth
18 in the EIR prepared (but not certified) for the Project and its feasible alternatives.

90. The record evidence clearly shows: (i) the Town's actions in leaving the Property
20 for 40 years (and counting) as "Study" result in a temporary and permanent taking of the Property 19

21 (see Kavanau v. Santa Monica Rent Control Brd. (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 761); and (ii) the Town's
22 | actions in failing to prepare and certify the EIR constitute a breach of the EIR Contract resulting in
23 damages (see Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition, LLC v. Town of Mammoth Lakes (2010) 191 Cal.
24 App. 4th 433).

92. The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states:

2 "por shall private property taken for public use, without just compensation .. (Fifth Amendment, U.S. Constitution,
3 incorporated into the California Constitution at Art. I, §19.)
93. In reliance on the Town's conduct, Bruzzone proceeded in good faith in funding

5 and assisting with the preparation of a study to consider appropriate, feasible and reasonable
6 development of the Bruzzone Property. The study, together with the Project Applications,

7 analyzed a range of potential development for the Bruzzone Property, from eight to 126. The
8 Bruzzone Family also indicated the amount of development within this range that would be
9 financially feasible. However, the Town refused to approve the study and rejected not only the
10 Project, but also every alternative to the Project ranging from the development of eight to 126
11 homes with attached secondary units, including the potentially feasible and applicant-sponsored
Wendel, Rosen, Black & Dean LLP 68 12 85-home Reduced Scale Alternative or "RSA." In doing so, the Town refused to change the land
9€07-20976 BjUJOHIED *puejxeo 1001a wPZ 'Kempeoug lbLL 13 use or zoning designation of the Bruzzone Property, maintaining the "Study" designation that has
14 been in place for over 40 ycars. The "Study" designation does not permit any development, rather
15 any development is contingent on the Town completing a study and approving: development plan
16 for the Bruzzone Property. The Town has refused and/or failed to complete a study or approve
17 any development plan, or otherwise take necessary steps to permit development of any kind on the
18 Bruzzone Property.

19 94. The Town, including the Town Council, Planning Commission and Town staff
20 caused unreasonable delays, unlawful impediments and other interruptions in the Bruzzone
21 Family's attempts to have the "Study" designation removed and replaced with a designation that
22 permits reasonable development as required under the 2002 General Plan. The Town's actions

23 and inactions, and its refusal to allow the Bruzzone Family to proceed with any development of
24 the Bruzzone Property at any level for over 40 years is not a normal delay in the development
25 process. Rather it is the result of the Town's infringement and violation of its own General Plan
26 policies requiring it to complete a study and apply appropriate land use and zoning designation,
27 and violates the Bruzzone Family's federal and state constitutional rights by taking all reasonable
28 use of the Bruzzone property without providing just compensation.

25
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

95. The Town's actions in denying the Project maintained the designation of the
2 Bruzzone Property as "Study" - now for 40 years and counting. No development can take place

3 on the Property pending a designation for a use other than "Study."

4 96. The Town's actions take all reasonable and economic use of the Property, resulting
in a temporary and/or permanent "taking" of the Property for which compensation is required.

97. The Town's actions have prevented the Bruzzone Family from proceeding with
their, or any, development of the Property. The Town's wrongful rejection of the study and failure
to amend the General Plan land use designation and zoning thereby prohibiting any and all
development has resulted in an economic impact on the Bruzzone Family that unreasonably
10 impairs the value and/or use of the Property, and interferes with the Bruzzone Family's distinct
11• investment-backed expectations. The character of the Town's rejection of the study and rejection
12 of the Project, along with each and every one of its alternatives analyzed in the study, was
807-209P6 eguJoHleO 'puerec J001 wtZ KempeoJg beb' Wendel, Rosen;' oo d17 ueeg 8 yoel8 13 unlawful, unreasonable, arbitrary, not in furtherance of any legitimate governmental objective, and
14 for no other purpose-than to further delay, prevent or preclude any development on the Property.
15 (Lockaway Storage v. County of Alameda (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 161 (review denied); see also
16 Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City (1978) 438 U.S. 104.)

17 98. The Bruzzone Family has been deprived of their Property since 1979 to the present
18 and are barred from pursuing any development by the Town's actions. The Town's rejection of
19 the Project and the full range of alternatives - especially considering that the Town's refused to
20  propose additional alternatives that would allow reasonable and feasible development, denied the
21 Bruzzones all reasonable use of the Property without being compensated in violation of the
22 California and United States Constitutions.

23 99. a As a result, the Town's rejection of the study, the Project, and the Project
24 alternatives, along with its failure to follow its General Plan and amend the Bruzzone Property's
25 land use designation and zoning, and its decision to keep the Bruzzone Property as "study" in
26  order to continue to prohibit any reasonable development constitutes a temporary and/or
27  permanent taking of property, i.e., inverse condemnation, requiring compensation in an amount to

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 4

(Complaint for Breach of Contract) 5

6 1.00. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 99, above, are hereby incorporated by
7 reference as though set forth in full.

8 101. The Town and the Bruzzone Family entered into the legally binding EIR Contract

9

10 102. The EIR Contract provides that the Bruzzone Family agrees to pay certain sums of on June 7, 2006.

12 Project. Such certification of the EIR would allow the Town to take the Property out of the 11 money to the Town, and, in return, the Town would both prepare and certify the EIR for the

0ö d77 ueag yoei9 'uesod 'lapuaM 9CO7-LOSP6 EjUJOHIBO 'puereo 100l9 wtz 'KampeoJg tiLL 13 "Study" designation, and re-designate the Property for a certain use a and intensity as required by
14 state law.

15 103. In reliance on, and as consideration for, the Town's promise to prepare and certify
16 the EIR, the Bruzzone Family paid the required monies to the Town under the EIR Contract and
17 fully performed all of its obligations under the EIR Contract. On or about November 14, 2018, the
18- Town breached the Contract by not certifying the EIR before considering the Project as stated and
19 required under the EIR Contract.

20 104. Pursuant to the Government Claims Act (Gov. Code §§ 900 et seq.), the Bruzzone
21 Family notified the Town of the breach and submitted a written claim pursuant to the Act on
22 February 5, 2019. To date, the Town has not responded, but based on the fact that the Bruzzone

23 Family's informed the Town during the administrative process on the Project that the EIR
24 Contract required the Town to prepare and certify the EIR, and the fact that the Town disputed this
25 obligation and then failed to certify the EIR, the Bruzzone Family is informed and believes that
26 the Town will reject the written claim made pursuant to the Government Claims Act.

27 105. The Property now remains in the "Study" designation and no development can take

28 place.

27

106. The Town has breached the EIR Contract by failing to certify the EIR that

2 constituted the backbone of the study required by the Town's General Plan, costing the Bruzzone

3 Family millions of dollars in damages as set forth herein. The Town's breach of the EIR Contract

4 was and is the proximate cause of such damages.

5 107. As a result of the Town's breach of the EIR Contract, the Property remains as

6 "Study." No new project application can be submitted without an amendment to the General Plan
7 and zoning ordinance, and no special study has been certified by the Town.

8 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for judgment as herein set forth.

16 General Plan, by denying the Project, and all alternatives to the Project that were analyzed in the

24 population density and building intensity for all property covered by the general plan. (Gov.

26 111. The Town's "Study" designation does not provide for any type of permitted use, or 25 Code § 65302.)

27 density or intensity of such use, instead, it illegally defers such a designation to an unspecified
28 date. Despite the Town purporting that such designation would be "temporary" pending

28
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

preparation of a study, the Town has for over 40 years - failed to approve and certify such a

2 study and has failed to apply an actual land use designation to the Property. As a result, the
Bruzzone Family is unable to proposc any development that would be deemed consistent with the
4 Town's General Plan or zoning designation, thereby denying the Bruzzone Family the opportunity 3

6 Code section 65589.5 and 65915 that facilitate such consistent development proposals. 5 to rely on several Planning and Zoning law statutes, including, but not limited to, Government

7 112. Furthermore, the Town's actions described herein, including its refusal to certify

8 the EIR, its rejection of the Project and the alternatives, and its application of the Hillside
Regulations to the Bruzzone Property, are designed to frustrate and prohibit development of the
10 Bruzzone Property in violation of the Town's Housing Element - which recognized the Bruzzone
Property as a housing resource location and that the Town would facilitate analysis of
9 12 development options and selection of a feasible plan - and in violation of Government Code 11

113. These actions represent a de facto moratorium on development that has been in
15 place for 40 years and counting. In violation of the law, the Town has never made findings, either 14

16 when it designated the Property as "Study" in its General Plan and zoning, or when it denied the

17 Project Applications to change that designation, that would support a development moratorium as

18 required by Government Code section 65858. Section 65858 provide a procedure by which a city a
may in order to "protect the public safety, health and welfare" adopt as an "urgency" measure a
20 short-term interim ordinance to prohibit uses that may be in conflict with a contemplated general 19

22 department is considering or studying or intends to study within a reasonable time. (Gov. Code

24 adoption and may only remain in place for 45 days from the date of adoption, subject to a 23 § 65858(a).) Such an urgency measure requires a four-fifth vote of the legislative body for

25 maximum of two extensions that can extend the time to two years. Such an ordinance must be
26 supported by legislative findings that there is a "current and immediate threat to the public health,

27 safety, or welfare" and that approval of a development application would endanger public health,
28 safety, or welfare. (Gov. Code § 65858(c).)

29
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

114. The Town did not follow these required procedures and has not adopted an interim
2 ordinance as an urgency measure. Instead, the Town has perpetuated an illegal development
3 moratorium on the Bruzzone Property.

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for judgment as herein set forth.

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA)

7 115. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 114, above, are hereby incorporated by

8 reference as though set forth in full.

9 116. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decisionmakers to document and
10 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made. (Pub.

11 Resources Code §§ 21000, 21001.) This fundamental purpose of CEQA is implemented primarily
12 by the requirement that agencies must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) whenever the

o8 Wendel, Rosen, Black Dean d77 9€07-20976 BjUJOHIEO *puejxeo J0019 .PZ 'Kempeoug bEL; 13 approval of a proposed project may cause significant adverse effects on the environment. (Pub.
14 Resources Code § 21100.)

15 117. The EIR is the "heart of CEQA." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15003(a); Sierra Club v.
16 State Board of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215,1229.) Its purpose "is to identify the significant
17 effects on the environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the
18 manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided." (Pub. Resources Code,

19 21002.1(a).) In carrying out this purpose, the EIR informs the public and its responsible
20 officials of the environmental consequences of the project before they occur. An EIR is an
21 "informational document" (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15121), which serves as "an environmental
22 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental
23 changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."(Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal.4th at

24 1229; County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810.) Thus, the EIR "protects not only
25 the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
26 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

27 118. Following preliminary review of a project, lead agencies are required by CEQA to
28 prepare an Initial Study for non-exempt projects to determine whether such projects may have a

30
021333.0003\5358149.2 VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- significant effect on the environment, and if found to do so, to require preparation of an EIR. The

2 Initial Study must consider all phases of project planning, implementation and operation, and
3 preparation of a Negative Declaration for a project is proper under CEQA only if there is no

4 substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may, either individually or cumulatively,

5 cause a significant direct or indirect adverse effect on the environment. (14 Cal.Code Regs.,

6 §§ 15063(a)(1), (b)(1), (2).) The Town failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it

7 decided to not complete and certify the Town-prepared EIR but decided to apply the Hillside
8 Regulations to the Project Site without conducting any environmental analysis.

9 119. If the lead agency is presented with a "fair argument," based on substantial
10  evidence in the record, that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead
11 | agency is required to prepare an EIR even though it may also be presented with other substantial
9 12
ueea xpeja 'uesoy 'lapuem evidence that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency is

28 • 1111 Broadway, 24" Floor 807-20976 BjUJOHIBo Oakland, 13 required to prepare an EIR even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence
14 that the project will not have a significant effect. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15064(g)(1); Friends of
15 "B" Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002; No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los
16 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68,75.) CEQA Guidelines Section 15371 identifies the "fair argument"
17 test as the appropriate basis for determining whether significant impacts may occur and an EIR
18 must be prepared. Here, the Bruzzone Family presented information that provides substantial
19 evidence of such fair arguments stemming from the application of the Hillside Regulations to the
20 Property.

21 120. As set forth above, the Town and COUNCIL actions constituted an abuse of

22 discretion in (a) failing to prepare and certify an EIR, or any CEQA document, in connection with
23 its decision to apply the Hillside Regulations to the Bruzzone Property in light of substantial
24 evidence of a fair argument that the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Bruzzone

25 Property may have a significant effect on the environment; (b) failing to consider the application
26 of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site in combination with previous projects and their
27 EIRs; (c) failing to consider cumulative effects and mitigation; (d) failing to comply with

3 the environment; (f) failing to consider GHIG impacts; (g) improperly deferring analysis of impacts

4 on the Moraga Center Specific Plan; (h) failing to include a planned or foreseeable projects from

9 existing zoning, plans and applicable land use controls; (I) failing to consult with and provide
10 notice to other public agencies; (m) failing to find that the application of the Hillside Regulations

(r) failing to weigh the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site's perceived

EIR in light of application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site's
21 irretrievable commitment to non-housing resources; (u) improper piecemealing of environmental 20 failing to prepare an

23 impacts on traffic, air quality, GHG, noise, safety, housing displacement and related impacts,
24  including, but not limited to, the effect of the application of the Hillside Regulations to the
25 Bruzzone Property on implementation of the MCSP, and on implementation of the 2015 Moraga
26 Housing Element.

28 denial of the Project and all of the feasible alternatives, including alternatives which would serve 27 121. As set forth above, the Town violated CEQA by not studying the consequences of

substantial 4 122. Under CEQA, a lead agency must prepare an EIR if there is any

10 adverse effect on the environment, an EIR must be prepared. (No Oil. Inc. V. City of Los Angeles

12 §§ 15064(a)(1), (f)(1).) Moreover, if there is any substantial evidence to support a fair argument 11 (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100, 21151; 14 Cal. Code Regs.,
e
9807-40976 California 'puemeo 10012 .mtZ 'KempeoJs sell ueag 8 yoejg 'uesoy 'lapuem 13 that the project may have an adverse environmental impact, an EIR must be prepared, even if there
is also substantial evidence in the record to the contrary. (Friends of "B" Street v. City of
15 Hayward, supra 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1001.) In other words, if the agency is so. much as 14

16 presented with substantial evidence in the record to support a "fair argument" that the project may

17 have a significant effect on the environment, then it must prepare an EIR. (14 Cal. Code Regs.,
18 § 15064(f)(1); No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at 75.)

19 123. This "fair argument" standard creates a very "low threshold" for requiring
20 preparation of an EIR. (Citizens Action to Serve All Students v. Thomley (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
21 748, 754; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 310, quoting No Oil,
22 supra, 13 Cal.3d at 75.) An ency may only rely on a negative declaration when "[t]he initial

23 study shows that there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record…that the project may
a 24 have a significant effect on the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15070(a).) § The project
25 "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" of
26 significant impact. (No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at 83, n.16.) Because substantial evidence to support
a fair argument that the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site may have a
28 significant adverse environmental impact was presented to the Town by Petitioners, and is 27

33
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

otherwise present in the record of proceedings for the Project, the Town's refusal to prepare an

2 EIR, or any CEQA document whatsoever, is a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

124. "Substantial evidence" includes, "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon
4 facts, and expert opinions supported by facts." (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); 14 3

6 potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected 5 Cal Code, Regs., § 15384(b).) A "significant effect on the environment" is a "substantial, or

7 by the project....' (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be
8 "momentous" or even "important" to be considered significant under CEQA. The term

9 "significant" covers a broad range that includes "momentous" and "important," but also includes
10  "appreciable" and "not trivial." (No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at 83.) Although there is no "ironclad"
11 definition of what constitutes a significant effect under CEQA, the agency must consider the direct
e 12 physical changes in the environment caused by the project, and the reasonably foresecable indirect
J00td g7Z* EMpROIS bIBL ad ueag g yoela 'uasod 'lapuaM 980p-20976 eluiojje *pueieo 13 physical changes that may result from the project. (14 Cal. Code Regs., §§ 15064(b)-(c).)
14 Additionally, the effects of a project may be significant if the impact is individually limited, but
15 cumulatively considerable, when viewed in connection with the effects of past, current, and
16 probable future projects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15065(c).)
17 125. In cases where it is not clear whether there is substantial evidence to support a fair
18 argument that a project may cause significant environmental impacts, CEQA requires a lead
agency to err on the side of caution, requiring a full evaluation of environmental effects and the
20 preparation of an EIR. The CEQA Guidelines require that if there are differing expert opinions, 19

21 each supported by facts, regarding whether there may be a significant effect on the environment,
22 the agency, "shall treat the effect as significant and shall prepare an EIR." (14 Cal. Code Regs.,
15064(g), emph. added.) Moreover, if any aspect of the project may result in a significant
24 adverse impact on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR even if the overall effect of 23

25 the project is considered beneficial. (14 Cal. § Code Regs., § 15063(b)(1).)

26 126. Notwithstanding the Town's failure to adopt any CEQA document whatsoever,
27 Petitioners introduced ample expert opinion testimony and other evidence to the contrary in this
28 record and, consequently, an EIR, or other appropriate CEQA document must be prepared,

34
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

F complete and considered before the Town may apply the Hillside Regulations to the certified as

2 Project Site. The Town prejudicially abused its discretion by refusing to prepare and certify or

3 adopt any CEQA document because there is substantial evidence in this record to support a fair
4 argument that the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site may have both direct
5 and indirect physical impacts on the environment.

6 127. The Town ignored substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of significant
7 environmental impacts on people and critical public services. It is certainly foresecable that
8 redirecting over 100 residential units of development, as Town's application of the Hillside
9 Regulations to the Project Site will do, may cause physical changes to the environment in the areas
10  to which the new housing is redirected. Increased traffic congestion, noise, GHG, and increased
11 impacts on utilities, law enforcement, emergency response times and the ability to provide

J001H aUZ "KEMpROjg bELL 0d d17 ueaa  yoejg 'uesoy 'jepuam 12 sufficient municipal services, are reasonably foreseeable direct physical consequences to the
Oakland, California 94607-4036 13. environment resulting from a shift of residential development. It is also reasonably foreseeable
14 that increased air pollution may result from people being forced to commute longer distances
15 because there are no longer enough housing units available in Moraga, not to mention the other
16 physical changes the displaced residential development will cause.

17 128. The Town chose to ignore evidence of significant environmental impacts in
18 refusing to complete and certify an EIR. None of these potentially significant environmental

19 impacts were addressed by the Town in any approved CEQA document prior to the application of
20 the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site. CEQA is intended to provide decisionmakers and the
21 public with detailed information about how the application of the Hillside Regulations to the

22 Project Site will impact the physical environment, the Town, and its residents, and the extent of
23 that impact. When a project may have significant effects, an EIR must be prepared in order to

24 provide sufficient analysis to support informed decisionmaking. The Town's failure to prepare and
25 adopt/certify such analysis means that the Town failed to consider whether the application of the
26 Hillside Regulations to the Project Site will have any significant environmental impacts especially
27 when its intended effect is to severely restrict or, at a minimum, significantly relocate residential
28 development.

35
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

129. The Town decided to further ignore its continuing and growing obligations under
state law to accommodate its assigned fair share of the regional housing need. In order to meet

3 Town's regional fair share of affordable housing, residential development will have to occur
somewhere other than where it was previously planned under the 2015 Housing Element, 2002
General Plan and 2010 MCSP, prior to adoption of the Project. Even assuming the Town is able to

6 redirect development to another part of the Town, this does not relieve it of its duty to identify,
analyze, and mitigate the adverse environmental effects of so doing. The Town's failure to
8 consider whether there will be any significant environmental effects on housing by virtue of the
application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site means that the Town did not base its
10 | decision on substantial evidence of no significant environmental effects. (City of Livermore v. 9

The Town cannot simply assume that the prohibition of development on hillsides of 11 LAFCO (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 531, 541.)

130. S
13 the Project Site will have no environmental impact simply because it will lessen the intensity of 12

og 9807-L09P6 EjuJOjlIBO *puepeo joold utz "Kempeolg lblb, Dean ypejg 'uasoy 'lepueM 14 development in those areas. In order to support a ncgative declaration (which the Town did not
15 even prepare), CEQA requires the agency to prove, not assume, that significant impacts will not
16 occur. (Sundstrom, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at 311-314.) The Town has the burden of investigating
the potential impacts of the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site. If any
18 aspect of the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Project Site may result in a significant 17

impact on the environment, the lead agency must prepare an EIR, even if the overall effect of the
20| project is considered beneficial. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15063(b)(l).) The Town must prepare and 19

21 certify an EIR, even if it considers the overall effect of the application of the Hillside Regulations

22 to the Project Site to be beneficial (including the Town's goal of creating more open space, and
23 leaving its hillside areas in an undeveloped and visually unobstructed state), So that it can address
24 any significant environmental effects that may result from the application of the Hillside
25 Regulations to the Project Site on shifting development to other areas.

26 131. The Town decided to ignore the environmental impacts of applying the Hillside
27 Regulations to the Property. The application of the Hillside Regulations to the Bruzzone Property
28 has been improperly segmented from the proposed Moraga Center Specific Plan update in

36
VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 021333.0003\5358149.2

violation of CEQA, CEQA is intended to protect the right to "informed self-government."
2 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1988) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) Accordingly,
3 California's Supreme Court has held that any "reasonably foreseeable consequence" of a future
action relating to a project must be analyzed in an EIR. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.

5 Regents of the Univ. of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.) A public agency may not divide a
6 single project into smaller individual subprojects to avoid responsibility for considering the
7 environmental impact of the project as a whole. (Orinda Assn. v. Bd. of Supervisors (1986) 182

8 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.) CEQA cannot be avoided by "chopping up proposed projects into bite-
sized pieces which, individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the

10 environment...." (Plan For Arcadia. Inc. v. City Council (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.) This is

11 precisely what Town decided to do by ignoring the impacts of the appliçation of the Hillside
12 Regulations to the Property.

13 132. 05 Wendel, Rosen, Black d11 ueag 9807-L096 etusqjlieo 'puepeo J0013 w7Z 'KeMpeoug bLLL The Town chose to ignore its responsibility not to segment consideration of all

14 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts by refusing to complete and certify an EIR as the basis for
15 understanding the full consequences of its actions. The application of the Hillside Regulations to
16 the Property is not a "stand-alone" project. Rather, it is part of a larger comprehensive planning
17 and zoning overhaul and paradigm shift in which the Town is currently engaged, and which
18 includes the MCSP update and related changes to the General Plan Housing Element. The
19 proposed application of the Hillside Regulations to the Property was a "reasonably foreseeable,"
20 consequence of the Town's decision to reject the Project and each of its feasible alternatives.
21 Consequently, an EIR, or other appropriate CEQA document, must be prepared and
22 adopted/certified to identify, analyze and mitigate, where feasible, the potential significant adverse

23 environmental consequences of the whole project. The Town's failure to conduct such analysis in
24 an approved CEQA document was a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it "precludes informed
25 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Barthelemy, supra, 38 Cal.App.4th at 1617.)

26 133. The Town chose to ignore the significant and unavoidable effects of applying the

27 Hillside Regulations to the Property. Even as segmented, the application of the Hillside
28 Regulations to the Property clearly may have, and is, in fact, intended to have, dramatic effects on

37

F the Town's land use patterns, and to result in physical changes (when compared to CEQA's legal

2 standard for an environmental baseline) to the hillside, residential, and MCSP environments, in
3 addition to those of Bollinger Valley. These effects must be identified, analyzed and, where
4 feasible, mitigated. When viewed in light of the "whole action," the potential for adverse
5 environmental impacts is greatly enhanced and the threshold triggering the need for an EIR is

6 clearly met. The Town has clearly violated CEQA, and has prejudicially abused its discretion by
7 failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and by failing to support its findings and
8 decisions with any substantial evidence, and failing to prepare and approve any CEQA document
9 whatsoever in connection with the application of the Hillside Regulations to the Property.
10 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for judgment as herein set forth.
