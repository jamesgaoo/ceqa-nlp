NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

To the Attorney General of the State of California:

W PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 and Code of Civil
Procedure $388, that on November 4, 2018 Petitioner Frank Solinsky filed a Petition for writ of
mandate against the City of Chico, et al., in the Butte County Superior Court. The Petition alleges
that the Respondents City of Chico, City Council of the City of Chico, and Director of Planning and
Community Development violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) by denying

8 the appeal of approval of a land use entitlement --an "OPDI" or Official Planning Director's

9 Determination-for the establishment of a 46 occupant homeless shelter development project, that

10 occurred without any environmental review at the OPDI level, followed by a post-hoc unlawful

11 exemption for an "emergency" at the Council level, all in avoidance of the lawful requirements for

12 review under CEQA. A copy of the Petition is attached to the Notice sent to the Attorney General.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

-Nmtno INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner/Plaintiff FRANK SOLINSKY seeks relief from this Court to redress a flagrant
example of unlawful conduct and abuse of discretion by the City of Chico (hereafter "City") in
promoting a favored project, at the expense of those who don't have special influence in City Hall.
In direct contravention of State law, and without any evidence, the City created out of thin air a land
use entitlement approval for a large multi-unit development of rental "sleeping cabins" for the poor
and homeless, referred to as "Simplicity Village." The City's action violates the applicable land use
laws while disregarding the housing/construction statutes that protect the health and safety of human

9 inhabitants. These violations cause further damage to the Petitioner on the adjacent land, to others

10 nearby who also protested the City's actions, and to the surrounding environment, from the long

11 term impacts of an unlawful substandard and congested rental cabin "village." In doing this the City

12 unlawfully evaded environment review under CEQA. As alleged herein, the law requires that the

13 City's sham land use entitlement must be rescinded, honest environmental review must be required

14 for any project to go forward, and the City should be held to account for the harm caused to

15 Petitioner.

PARTIES 16

17 2. Petitioner/Plaintiff FRANK SOLINSKY (hereafter "Petitioner") owns real property and

18 business interests on Notre Dame Blvd, in Chico, both across the street from and abutting the parcel

19 for the proposed "Simplicity Village." Petitioner's parcel across the street is APN 040-030-037, and

20 it is the location for the Payless Building Supply business. Petitioner's abutting parcel is APN 040-

21 a 030-030, with a small office and business -Wood-Ply Forest Products--located there.

22 3. Respondent/Defendant CITY OF CHICO ("City") is a lawful and duly organized City

23 within the State of California, with all of the "police powers" granted under Article XI§7 of the

24 California Constitution, including the authority and power to make and enforce within its limits all

25 local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations, in particular land use regulations,

26 provided they are not in conflict with the superceding general laws of the State of California.

27 4. Respondent BRENDAN VIEG is, and at all times mentioned herein was, an individual

28 employee of the City of Chico in the position of Planning and Community Development Director.

2

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

P Respondent Vieg is named as Respondent in his official capacity as the "director" referenced in

2 Chico Municipal Code Chapter 19.02 who is vested with discretion to: decide on behalf of the City
co JaüA0 the interpretation of the City's land use regulations, consider the facts pertaining to a particular land
use to determine the appropriate classification of the land use, and to apply the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") for environmental review.
5. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF CHICO is the duly elected legislative body of the City.
Respondent CITY COUNCIL is named as a party in this action in its official capacity as the final
decision-making body of the City for appeals of land use entitlement determinations, which is vested

9 with discretion to consider and make the final decisions for the City as to: the interpretation of the

10 City's land use regulations, the facts pertaining to a particular land use to determine the appropriate

11 classification of the land use, and to apply the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
12 Act ("CEQA") for environmental review.

13 6. Real Party in Interest Chico Housing Action Team, Inc. ("CHAT") is, and at all times
14 mentioned herein was, a non-profit corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of

15 California. CHAT is the applicant for the proposed Simplicity Village project, which would be

16 located on land along Notre Dame Blvd. on APN 040-030-028. CHAT was and is the beneficiary of

17 the City's interpretation of the land use regulations so as to create a new type of land use entitlement

18 applicable to land in any zone of the City and in particular the zone for APN 040-030-028. CHAT

19 has a beneficial interest in APN 040-030-028 by virtue of a lease from the BALL FAMILY TRUST

20 specifically for this project, with an initial term of 2 years, coupled with 4 options to extend of 4
21 years duration each.

22 7. Real Party in Interest THE BALL FAMILY LIVING TRUST (hereafter "Ball Trust") is,

23 and at all times herein mentioned was, a duly formed living trust under California law, acting by and

24 through its trustees Ted Ball and Justine Ball. The Ball Trust was and is the beneficiary of the City's

25 interpretation of the land use regulations so as to create a new type of land use entitlement applicable

26 to land in any zone of the City and in particular the zone for APN 040-030-028. The Ball Trust is the

27 owner of legal title to APN 040-030-028 and the Lessor of a portion of that property to CHAT as the

28 Lessee. The unlawful land use interpretation by the City, as alleged herein, provides a substantial

3

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

benefit to the Ball Trust by supporting the long term lease to CHAT with a 2 year initial term and 4

ü P options to extend of 4 years each. Because the land use interpretation requested from the City by
CHAT was made for the proposed project on APN 040-030-028, that newly created land use
entitlement runs with the land owned by the Ball Trust.
8. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the Respondents sued herein as
Does 1-50, inclusive, and therefore sues such Respondents by these fictitious names. Petitioner will
amend this Petition to allege such Doe Respondents true names and capacities when ascertained.

9 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of the fictitiously-named

10 Respondents is responsible in some manner for each of the acts and/or omissions alleged herein.

11 9. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the Real Parties in Interest sued

12 herein as Roes 1-50, inclusive, and therefore sues such Real Parties in Interest by these fictitious

13 names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege such Real Party in Interests' true names and

14 capacities when ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believe, and thereon alleges, that each of the

15 fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest have a substantial interest in the subject matter of the

16 litigation, such that their interests should not be adjudicated by the Court without opportunity for
them to defend or advocate their interest in the matter.

17

18 10. At all times herein mentioned, each of the Respondents and/or Real Parties in Interest

19 were the agents and/or employees of each of the remaining Respondents and/or Real Parties in

20 Interest and, in doing the things hereinafter alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such

agency.

21 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

22

23 11. This court has jurisdiction over the matter alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil

24 Procedures §1085 and §1094.5, g1060, and the rights and privileges guaranteed under the
Constitution of the State of California.

25

26 12. Venue is proper in Butte County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil

27 Procedure §395 because the City of Chico, Staff, and CHAT maintain their principle administrative

28 offices in Butte County, City of Chico; and the real property which is the subject of this action is
located in the City of Chico, Butte County.

4

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

STANDING - N0 TO 13. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they are
beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure §1086. Petitioner has a
direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon the approval of the
Simplicity Village and related projects. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by
the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to
7 the interests of the Petitioner.

8 14. Petitioner actively participated in the 2019 Simplicity Village approval process, including
9 seeking administrative appeal and review in an attempt to ensure that Respondent complied with all

10 relevant Building Codes and other applicable laws.
11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 15. Petitioner has performed and will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this
13 Petition, and have actively participated in the administrative review process prior to the date of final
14 denial of appeals by the City Council, and thus has exhausted all administrative remedies to the

15 extent required by law.

16 By this verified Petition, Petitioner alleges as follows:

17 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

18 16. On or about September 27, 2018, CHAT issued a proposal for a transitional housing
19 development called "Simplicity Village," consisting of 33 "sleeping cabins" on the southerly 2.6

20 acre portion of the 4.74 acre parcel located on Notre Dame Blvd., south of Morrow Lane, and
21 designated APN 040-030-028 (the "Real Property"). Such Real Property is illustrated (highlighted in
22 pink) on the Assessor's Parcel Map attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by
23 reference. The 33 sleeping cabins would be intended to provide shelter for 46 people; with 20 cabins
24 at a size of 8'x12' floor space (96 sq. ft.) designed for single occupancy, and 13 cabins at a size of

25 8'x16' (128 sq. ft.) designed for double occupancy.

26 17. Attached as Exhibit "B," and incorporated by reference herein, is a copy of a Site Plan
27 submitted to the City by CHAT for Simplicity Village. The Site Plan illustrates locations for the

28 aforementioned sleeping cabins as well as various communal buildings, etc. at the Real Property.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

18. Attached as Exhibit "C,' and incorporated by reference herein, is a more detailed color
brochure created by CHAT to illustrate the proposed development. The locations of the 33 sleeping
m t o cabins (erroneously labeled here as "Tiny Homes") are clearly depicted. Also depicted is the
extensive area developed for driveway, parking, and access to the sleeping cabins; along with a
number of large buildings and structures designated as - Multi-Purpose Community Building,
Meeting Rooms, Gate Monitor House/ADA Restroom & Shower, Bathrooms/Laundry/Kitchen

7 Building, Workshops, 3 Storage Units/Shipping Containers, Covered Outdoor Dining Area, Bike
8 Racks, and other improvement details. The site will have secure perimeter fencing all around,

9 irrigated landscaping, and a garden. The Business Plan submitted by CHAT to the City for
10 Simplicity Village estimates that the first year capital investment snf operational expense to put in
11 these improvements will be about "$702,416 plus in-kind donations" (CHAT Business Plan, at

12 Section 4).

13 19. The 2.6 acre area for the Simplicity Village site -as located on the 4.74 acre legal parcel-
14 is defined in the binding long term lease agreement between CHAT and Real Party Ball Family
15 Living Trust. A true copy of the lease agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit "D" and incorporated
16 by reference herein. The initial lease term is for two years, followed by four options to extend the

17 lease for four years each. The lease term is to commence within 30 days after the Lessee/CHAT

18 obtains entitlements/approval from the City to proceed with the project; as alleged herein, infra, the
19 City's entitlement approval was given on June 14, 2019. According to the lease agreement CHAT
20 was to give Real Party Ball Family Living Trust an initial payment of $3,000.00 as consideration for
21 the lease, followed by monthly payments of $1,200.00 in the first year, and $1,700.00 per month
22 thereafter with increases based on the CPI.

23 20. CHAT has been quite open about the long-term nature of it's Simplicity Village project,
24 stating in its Business Plan dated 5/17/2019 (see "Executive Summary") that:
25 "CHAT will coordinate the construction of 33 tiny homes on 2.6 acres of privately owned
26 property that is currently subject to a binding letter of intent (LOI), subject to final City approval of the project. The LOI provides for a total lease term of 18 years, in two year increments at
27 Chat's election. CHAT would report to the City the progress of SV after the initial two year term and before the expiration of each succeeding two year term, or as agreed, so that City can
28 regularly appraise the project and its progress in meeting its goals. CHAT is the lessee with a private landlord and will require the collaboration with the City to enable the project to fall

6

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

a u A u - N within the terms of the State Shelter Crisis Statute. The property will be improved with Cal Water, City sewer, and electricity and is within a third of a mile of a B-line bus route." CHAT's statement that it's purely private project on land leased from a "private landlord" (rather
than the City) requires further "collaboration" from the City, is a revelatory admission that without
the City doing more Simplicity Village would not satisfy the necessary requirements of the Shelter
Crisis Statute. In fact, as alleged further herein, the City never did more to "collaborate" by taking

7 any role of ownership, control or direct participation in Simplicity Village - thus leaving CHAT in

8 violation of both State law and Chico's municipal code.

9 21. The Real Property where Simplicity Village would be located is surrounded by a lumber

10 yard, construction yards, a saw mill, maintenance yard, distributions operations, a church and school

11 as well as commercial office spaces. About one block to the east of the Real Property there are

12 developed neighborhoods of low density residential and suburban residential homes. None of the

13 surrounding land uses are either similar or compatible with the proposed relatively high density

14 multi-unit rental use for Simplicity Village. Moreover, Simplicity Village is intended by CHAT to

15 be much more than just a place for people to have a safe place to sleep. Because the occupants are

16 "disadvantaged" in various ways, CHAT plans to partner with the County Departments of

17 Behavioral Health, Social Services, Employment, and Public Health to provide "on-site wraparound

18 services." (See the Simplicity Village Business Plan, §1.) There would be a constant flow of

19 caseworkers and social service support personnel. CHAT envisions daily group activities such as

20 "vocational and social skill building," "workshops (such as money management)," "peer to peer

21 support groups,' "Alcoholics Anonymous groups, a Narcotics Anonymous group, Nonviolent

22 Communication training, art groups, and many other daytime programs." The high density of

23 residents, the robust daily programs of activities, the services that bring : high flow of personnel and

24 visitors other than residents, the vehicular as well as higher than usual pedestrian traffic, will all

25 generate significant impacts on the surrounding properties, the natural environment, and the

26 neighbors. Furthermore, there deserves to be consideration for the impacts of the existing industrial

27 uses of surrounding properties/businesses on the persons brought to stay in the Simplicity Village

28 sleeping cabins. For example, the adjacent Payless Lumber Supply starts business at 5:30 a.m. with
bright lights, forklifts and trucks that are noisy and that generate dust. The residents in a Simplicity

7

2 Village will be significantly impacted by the surrounding work activities in an industrial zone. At a

au D w minimum there must be environmental review of this project (which has never occurred), and the
obvious significant impacts require preparation of an Environmental Impact Report.
22. Petitioner's property is shown on is Exhibit "A" as APN 040-030-037 and APN 040-030-
030 (highlighted in yellow) -- which is among the properties adjacent and closest to the proposed

N Simplicity Village. Petitioner is directly impacted by the disputed approval of land use entitlement

8 for Simplicity Village, Petitioner will be directly harmed by the City's derogation of it's mandatory

9 legal duties, and Petitioner is directly and beneficially interested in the relief sought by this
proceeding.

10

11 23. The subject Real Property proposed for Simplicity Village is zoned as light

12 manufacturing/industrial, "ML". The Chico Municipal Code 19.46.010A describes the the ML zone as: purpose of

13

14 "The ML zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for light assembly and manufacturing, wholesaling, warehousing and distribution, agricultural and industrial processing within structures,

15 and support commercial services. The ML zoning district is primarily intended to implement the

use; however, provisions in other sections/chapters may apply as well.

UP Conditional use, use permit required. 19.24
Temporary use. 19.22
"Use not allowed. (See Section 19.02.020(E) regarding • uses not listed.)

24. Notice that for "ML" under "RESIDENTIAL USES" the use described as "Emergency
Shelters" requires "UP" - that is a Use Permit. Also under "RESIDENTIAL USES" the use
co described as "Temporary Emergency Shelters" requires "P" - that is a "permitted use" under the

9 requirements of chapter 19.22 "Temporary Uses." The reference in the Table 4-8 to "Temporary

10 events" falls under the heading of "RECREATION, EDUCATION & PUBLIC ASSEMBLY

11 USES," which requires a Use Permit in any event if Simplicity Village were to be viewed as a sort

12 of "public assembly" use.]

13 25. Petitioner contends and herein alleges that Simplicity Village -a project requiring

14 extensive construction at a capital investment over $700,000 and expected to operate over a long

15 term up to 18 years-is a development project of "Emergency shelters" requiring a Use Permit.

16 Common sense allows no other conclusion.

17 26. However, the City claims that Simplicity Village is a "temporary use." Petitioner disputes

18 that contention, but if there were any conceivable or rational categorization of Simplicity Village as
19 a sort of "temporary use," then instead of the "Emergency Shelters" category the only theoretical

20 category for these shelters would be "Temporary Emergency Shelters" as listed above in Table 4-8.

21 Because "Temporary Emergency Shelters" is referenced to chapter 19.22 "Temporary Uses," the

22 applicable definition found at §19.22.020 "Temporary Uses, allowed by right" is:

23 D. Emergency Shelters. Temporary emergency shelters shall be permitted in any zoning district for a maximum of
24 27 days in any 90-day period, provided that the facilities are approved by the City Building Official and Fire Marshal prior to use, and provided that no other emergency shelter is operated within 500 feet during the same 90-day period.
25 Thus if "temporary emergency shelters" are located in the ML Zone, they are allowed as a matter of
26 right but only "for a maximum of 27 days in any 90 day period."
27 27. Even with this restriction on "temporary emergency shelters" Petitioner steadfastly
28 maintains that Simplicity Village is not "temporary" in any factual or legal sense whatsoever.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- Chapter 19.22 of the Chico Municipal Code governing "Temporary Uses" states that all such:
N mt00Ao Temporary uses are short-term activities that might not meet the normal development or use standards of the applicable zoning district, but are acceptable because of their temporary nature.
There follows a list of described "temporary uses" noteworthy for their short-term nature the
absence of any lasting alteration of the land. Typical examples are: "Car Washes" by charitable
organizations limited to two days per month; "Construction Yards" on the premises of approved
construction projects; "Arts and Crafts" exhibits on non-residential properties limited to 10 days;
"Seasonal Sales Lots" for things like Christmas trees, limited to three months; "Farmers Markets"
allowed no more than two times per week. And a critical condition of all "temporary uses" is:
9

10 19.22.050 Condition of site.

11 Each site occupied by a temporary use shall be cleaned of debris, litter, or any other evidence of the temporary use upon completion or removal of the use, and shall thereafter be used in compliance with these Regulations.

12 (Ord. 2185, Ord. 2494, §10)

13 In other words, the temporary use must be wiped away to leave no trace, so that the normally
14 permitted uses of the zone may resume.

15 27. Petitioner contends and alleges that it is impossible to give the proposed Simplicity
16 Village - a $700,000+ investment that permanently alters the land and is planned to last up to 18
17 years-- the same categorization as "car washes" and "garage sales" and "farmers markets." The
18 interpretive rule
19 of ejusdem generis does not allow it. The longest temporary use listed in chapter 19.22 is one year
20 for a temporary office in the first phase of a development project ($19.22.020.G) and all the others
21 are dramatically shorter.

22 28. The only factual contention made by the City that Simplicity Village is "temporary" is that
23 the City's earlier Declaration of a "Shelter Crisis" -- confirming a serious shortage of housing
24 causing a significant number of people to be unable to find shelter---is due to expire on June 30,
25 2021, two years after the City approved Simplicity Village. Even then the City could and would only
26 renew the Shelter Crisis Declaration. Even if unlikely one could theoretically hope that the housing
27 shortage and "Shelter Crisis" would be fully solved and over within two years, but it is fatuous to
28 characterize June 30, 2021 as a hard limit on the shelter crisis much less a termination date on the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

-Nm tno A existence of Simplicity Village.
29. No temporary use is allowed to exceed one year under any circumstances, pursuant to the
California Building Code definition of "temporary" (California Building Code ["CBC"] Title 24,
Part 2, vol. 1, Chapter 2- Definitions, Page 90). It wouldn't matter if Simplicity Village lasts for 2
years or 18 years, it is impossible to define it as "temporary." Simplicity Village cannot be
developed where it is planned in the ML Zone without obtaining a Use Permit.
30. The primary significance of the City's Declaration of a Shelter Crisis is that it allows the

8 City to invoke the provisions of Gov. Code provisions (Gov. Code §§8698, 8698.1) that aid the

9 construction of shelter for the homeless population. Under the terms of a Shelter Crisis Declaration,

10 standard building codes may be suspended under defined conditions, and alternative codes may be
11 substituted, provided they are applied to "Public Facilities" and meet minimum health and safety

12 requirements. Specifically, in order for relaxed construction standards to be applied to homeless

13 shelter units like the 33 "sleeping cabins" to be built at Simplicity Village, the Simplicity Village
14 development itself must be part of a "Public Facility" that is "owned, operated, leased, or

15 maintained, or any combination thereof, by the political subdivision" (§8698(c)) and part of a

16 housing community "located on property leased or owned by a political subdivision." (§8698(e))

17 Despite CHAT's requests for "collaboration" from the City on this very issue, the City has eschewed
18 any involvement in Simplicity Village that would satisfy the "Public Facility" requirement.
19 31. On or about October 2, 2018, the City declared a Shelter Crisis for the purpose of availing

20 the City of HEAP funding, a program that requires the declaration of a Crisis under Gov. Code

was to meet 21 §8698 as a pre-condition for eligibility. The Staff report makes it clear that the purpose

23 that the discretion granted under the statute was limited to "Public Facilities". This understanding

24 was confirmed to CHAT in an email from Assistant City Manager Chris Constantin of April 2, 2019.

25 A true copy of the staff report and opinion of the City Attorney is attached hereto as Exhibit "E" and

26 incorporated by reference herein. A true copy of the official Shelter Crisis Declaration is attached

27 hereto as Exhibit "F" and incorporated by reference herein. And the email from Chris Constantin is

-NmTAOD 32. The constraints and requirements of State law relating to a Shelter Crisis and the use of a
"Public Facility" to create homeless shelter under relaxed construction standards is recognized
explicitly in the City's own Shelter Crisis Declaration - Ex. F, p. 2, 13. No such "Public Facility"
has been created for Simplicity Village (or anywhere in the City of Chico), and the City has no legal
authority to waive the California Building Code Standards for homeless shelter construction.
33. The City's own Shelter Crisis Declaration - Ex. F, p. 2, 14 -further explicitly
acknowledges that State law requires that any waiver of the California Building Code Standards for

8 homeless shelter construction necessitates an express finding that the Standards may only be relaxed
9 "to the extent that strict compliance would in any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the
10 effect of the shelter crisis." (See also Gov. Code §8698.1(a)) No such finding has been made in

11 relation to Simplicity Village, and it is not possible to make such a finding as this project has been in

12 formative planning stages for two years with no "delay" connected with the type of building
13 standards required. Here again, the City has no legal authority to waive the California Building

14 Code Standards for homeless shelter construction, in particular the Simplicity Village "sleeping

15 cabins."

16 34. In earlier discussions between the City and CHAT, as indicated in a November 20, 2018

17 Council meeting, the City had directed staff to (a) work with CHAT to implement Simplicity
18 Village; and (b) approve Simplicity Village to be located on the Real Property, and open discussions
19 with property owners. This direction was founded upon the premise that this would be a City project

20 by designating the Real Property a "Public Facility" through lease arrangements by the City. On or

21 about January 30, 2019, Chris Constantin summarized the City's strategy in a letter to CHAT; this

22 letter was consistent with the previous recommendations of City Manager Mark Orme on November

23 20, 2018. Again, on or about February 10, 2019, Chris Constantine sent an internal memorandum to

24 Mark Orme, City Manager, updating and outlining the objectives of Staff as (a) leasing the property

25 from the Ball Family Trust, acquiring necessary easements from adjacent property owners; and (b)
26 entering into a lease with the Ball Family Trust to "secure the location as a public facility" and to

27 draft a "Development and Operating Agreement with CHAT" to "...build and operate Simplicity

28 Village." However, these early cooperative plans between the City and CHAT foundered upon the

12

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- City's realization, and concerns by CHAT, that City involvement through Public Facility would

2 require payment of "prevailing wage" on the Simplicity Village project, and the expense of that
U F 1n00 00 would be prohibitive.
35. The April 2, 2019 email from Mr. Constantin to CHAT principals was in response to a
letter from CHAT questioning the legality of compliance of the current plan with the Shelter Crisis
for "sleeping cabins." The Assistant City Manager mysteriously describes new "...win-win strategy
to get SV going." In this letter he states that the "shelter crisis supports Brendan's assessment..."
and "For the shelter crisis to apply explicitly, we would have to go down the original path which

9 raised concerns for CHAT related to prevailing wage..." and "more legal involvement for the City

10 which could lead to more delays." The letter makes no mention of the Temporary Use ordinance,

11 and none of this information was made public. The documents were obtained by way of a Public

12 Records Act request made by the Petitioner only after Petitioner learned that the City had, without

13 any public notice, given a land use entitlement approval to Simplicity Village.

14 36. On or about May 7, 2019, the City adopted for future use the construction standards

15 promulgated by the Department of Housing and Community Development, known as Appendix N
16 and Appendix X, to be used as consistent construction standards for shelter housing if a local

17 jurisdiction is to follow the prescribed Public Facility approach under State law. A true copy of the
18 City staff report, Ordinance and the Appendices is attached hereto as Exhibit "H" and incorporated
19 by reference herein.

20 37. On or about June 14, 2019, Petitioner discovered through unofficial channels and without
21 prior notice, that Simplicity Village had been approved by the City under CMC $19.22.020.C. Had

22 this not been discovered, the Petitioner would have remained unaware of the approval until

23 construction began after the appeal periods had lapsed.

24 38. Shortly afterwards, after notifying the City of his status as an Interested Party, Petitioner

25 received : copy of the Official Planning Director Interpretation, OPDI 19-01, indicating that

26 Simplicity Village had been approved as a "Temporary Emergency Facility" under CMC

27 §19.22.020.C. and that the appeal period had commenced. A true copy of OPDI 19-01 is attached

28 hereto as Exhibit "I" and incorporated by reference herein.

13

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

39. Subsequent to learning of the approval, a PRA request was issued for correspondence
N mtn to/from City Staff or CHAT regarding Simplicity Village. Through that request it was discovered
that the Assistant City Manager had been working closely with CHAT on an alternative method of
approval, under the direction of Brendan Vieg, in order to avoid the difficulties of developing the
complex contract needed to make the City a party to the lease of the property and to avoid the
0A prospect of having "prevailing wage" requirements imposed upon the project. There was no public
notice or other public announcement that the City would not be a party to the planned development,

8 pursuant to the Council decision of November 20, 2018.

9 40. Because of the terms of the Temporary Use Ordinance, and findings of the OPDI that held

10 the proposal to be a "use by right", no public hearings were held regarding the proposal, nor were

11 surrounding residents notified of the approval or right to file a timely appeal. Nonetheless, the only

12 remaining recourse was to appeal to the decision to the Planning Commission, and if denied, to the
13 City Council.

14 41. Title 24, Chapter 1, Division 1 §1.1.3, known as the California Building Code ("Code")

15 establishes the scope and mandatory duty to apply the Code throughout the State of California:

16 "The provisions of this Code shall apply to the construction, alteration, movement, enlargement,
17 replacement, repair, equipment, use and occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition
18 of every building or structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or

19 structures throughout the State of California.
42. The sole option for suspending standard Codes is by an express declaration and 20

21 substitution of alternative codes which meet basic Health and Safety Codes, pursuant to Gov. Code

22 §8698 by the declaring jurisdiction.

23 43. The State enacted, and the City adopted, Appendices N/X as part of the Code expressly for

24 the purpose of establishing requirements for various types of emergency housing, with express

25 jurisdiction over "Sleeping Cabins", the type of dwelling unit proposed for Simplicity Village.

26 44. Emergency Housing, defined by Appendix N, §N102.1, is permitted only during a Shelter

27 Crisis. §N103.1 provides that "Emergency Sleeping Cabins ..shall be occupied only during...a

28 shelter crisis. and only "buildings and structures constructed in accordance with the California

14

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- N m tnnoI Building Standards Code, used as emergency housing, shall be permitted to be permanently
occupied."
45. Because the Real Property is not "Public Facility", the Codes cannot be suspended for a
private45development. Only if standard Codes are suspended under Gov. Code §8698.1(b) can

Appendix N be invoked as substitute Codes. Thus, the Code establishes mandatory duty that
standard Codes shall be applied in the absence of a suspension of those Codes pursuant to Gov.
Code §8698, which jurisdiction is restricted to "Public Facilities", not private development. If Gov.
co Code §8698 does not have jurisdiction over this project, then Appendix N cannot be invoked, and

9 standard Codes must be applied. The City failed to do so, despite express mandates of the Code.
10 46. In order to avoid the issues raised by Chris Constantine in his letter of April 2, 1019,

11 Planning and the City secretly resorted to a local Temporary Use Ordinance in an attempt to bypass

12 the duty to apply Calif. Building Codes, or the Appendices to the Code which may be applied only
13 to "Public Facilities" during a Shelter Crisis, and the due process and equal protections incorporated

14 with all similar development proposals.

15 47. Because of the "Temporary" nature of the proposal, administrative discrction was

16 exercised to waive all Development Impact Fees, further advancing the City policy to specifically

17 facilitate this particular project by CHAT.
18 48. To further justify this set of findings, the OPDI also falsely and arbitrarily found that: the
19 proposal met the objectives of the General Plan; that Appendix N would be voluntarily followed by
20 CHAT; that Simplicity Village is a use by right that requires no use permit (or other permits); no

21 public hearings were necessary; and the brief non-binding promises of the Simplicity Village

22 "business plan" were somehow "similar" to a use permit and therefore excused obtaining a real use

23 permit; and that all development impact fees could be waived.

24 49. Despite the provisions of CMC §19.16.060 the City did not conduct an environmental

25 assessment of the Simplicity Village project in approving the project under the OPDI, nor was there

26 any determination in conjunction with the OPDI of whether the project would be considered a

27 "project" under 14 CCR §15378 or otherwise exempt from the California Environmental Quality

28 Act (CEQA). This is consistent with the City's bizarre treatment of the Simplicity Village

15

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

pJaüDU N- development as falling into the same category as a "Garage Sale" or a "Car Wash" or a "Farmer's
Market" stand which literally require nothing in the way of review, regulation or permits from the
City.
50. On or about June 24, 2019, Frank Solinsky, and several others filed a timely appeal with
the Planning Commission. On or about August 1, 2019 the appeal was heard by the Planning
Commission. The appeal was denied on a vote of 6-0-1.
51. On or about August 12, 2019, Frank Solinsky filed a timely appeal with the City Council.

9 On or about September 24, 2019, the appeal was heard by the City Council and was denied on a vote

10 of 5-1-1. At the time of filing this Petition, all administrative remedies have been exhausted.

11 52. This action is brought by Petitioner not just in his private capacity but also in the public

12 interest, to vindicate important public rights, and the relief sought by Petitioner would be impossible

to

13 measure fully in money damages such that there is no economic benefit to Petitioner to justify the

14 cost of litigation for purely economic return. Upon successful conclusion of this legal proceeding,

15 a Petitioner will request a full award of attorneys' fees and costs on the "private attorney general

16 statute" of CCP §1021.5, or any other such grounds as the law supports and the court deems
appropriate.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19

20 (Writ of Mandate- CCP §1085 et seq.)

21 53. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-52 of
this Petition as if set forth fully herein.

22

23 54. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy in the course of law.

24 55. Petitioner has beneficial interest in the proceedings as an owner of real property in the

25 City of Chico, and as a owner of a business interest, all of which will be directly impacted by the

26 unlawful conduct of Respondent City. Additionally, Petitioner, as a public member, has a right to

27 address the government to ensure that all laws are faithfully and fully complied with by the City of
Chico and its elected officers and staff.

28 56. Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury if the writ is not granted, as Simplicity Village will

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 16

be allowed to proceed in violation of the mandatory duties of the City of Chico Municipal Code, the

2 California Building Code, and other laws of the State of California as alleged herein.

3 57. The issues presented within this Writ are of great public importance to City of Chico and
7100 co its inhabitants and must be resolved quickly and without undue delay.
58. The Respondents proceeded arbitrarily and capriciously, without and in excess of
jurisdiction, failed to provide a fair trial of the facts and law, and exercised a prejudicial abuse of
discretion by failing to proceed in a manner required by law.
59. Title 24, et seq. (CBC Chapter 1, Division I, Section 1.1.3).establishes that the California

9 Building Code "shall" be applied to the entire scope and purpose of the Code "throughout the State

10 of California." The language of the enactment, by use of the term "shall" is obligatory, and explicit.

11 While some administrative discretion is vested in the authority of the Planning Director, that

12 authority is not sufficient to waive the duty or duties mandated by this enactment.

13 60. The enactment is applicable to the Public entity, as mandated by §1.1.3.1 (supra) which
14 requires that ...the following standards in the California Code of Regulations, title 24, Parts 2,2.5,

15 3,4,5,6,9,10 and 11 shall apply to all occupancies and applications not regulated by a state

16 agency". All allegations in this complaint are for applications not regulated by the State, and within

17 the jurisdiction of the City of Chico.

18 61. The Petitioner/Plaintiff hereby specifically pleads that a local ordinance does not have

19 statutory authority to waive the mandatory duties of Title 24, et seq. and that Title 24 et seq.

20 establishes mandatory duties with regard to the applicability of Title 24 to the Simplicity Village

21 Proposal. Neither Title 24, nor Appendices N/X of the Code were invoked or otherwise applied to

22 the ultimate findings of the OPDI 19-01 that the proposed project was a use by right not requiring a

23 permit, and to be exempt from these mandatory enactments.
24 62. Respondent City has disregarded and violated the mandatory duties of:

25 (a) the California Building Code Standards and Title 24, et seq., by deliberately approving and

26 allowing substandard construction of housing shelters and dwellings in the Simplicity Village

27 project, to the harm and detriment of the public, Petitioner, and especially the prospective occupants

28 of such substandard construction; and

17

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

2 (b) Gov. Code $8698(c) in approving Simplicity Village without the required "Public Facility"

A required to allow such development as proposed; and

un (c) Gov. Code §8698(e) in approving Simplicity Village and the emergency sleeping cabins

6 incorporated in that project, without requiring that the development be "located on property leased
or owned by a political subdivision"; and

7

8 (d) Gov. Code §8698.1(b) by suspending compliance with the state and local regulatory statutes,

o regulations, and ordinances prescribing standards of housing, health, or safety; and

10 (e) Gov. Code §8698.1(b) by failing and refusing to consider or make a finding that the suspension

11 of health and safety regulations is necessary because "strict compliance would in any way prevent,

12 hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the shelter crisis"; and

13 (f) Gov. Code §8698.1(b) by suspending compliance with the state and local regulatory statutes,

14 regulations, and ordinances prescribing standards of housing, health, or safety without applying the

15 requirement of this section that such action may only be taken for "public facilities open to the
homeless pursuant to this chapter"; and

16

17 (f) Chico Resolution No. 82-18, the Declaration of a "Shelter Crisis" which incorporates all of the

18 same duties of Gov. Code §8698 and §8698.1 to the same effect as a local regulation; and

19 (g) CMC §19.46.020 regulating the ML Zone and requiring a Use Permit for "Emergency Shelters"

20 and cumulatively the "zoning clearance" required for any purported "temporary emergency
shelters"; and

21

22 (h) the entirety of the provisions of CMC 19.22 pertaining to "Temporary Uses" and Respondent

23 City's: application thereof to Simplicity Village as if it is "temporary"; the approval of Simplicity

24 Village thereunder as a "use by right" as if it were the same as a residential "Car Wash" or a

25 "Garage Sale"; the failure to apply the one year limitation of "temporary" under the definition of

26 "temporary" in Title 24, Part 2, vol.1, Chapter 2-Definitions, page 90 which is applicable to all new

27 construction such as Simplicity Village; the failure to apply the requirement of §19.22.050 to

28 Simplicity Village to clean and remove from the land all "evidence of the temporary use upon
completion" of the temporary period; the failure to enforce, as or if applicable, the condition of
§19.22.020.D that temporary emergency shelters shall be permitted only for a maximum of 27 days

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 18

- in any 90 day period; the misapplication of §19.22.020.N&C to determine contrary to their terms
that the Simplicity Village "sleeping cabins" are similar temporary uses to emergency facilities
rather than "shelters" as otherwise specifically described.
63. Petitioner, and each and every other individual who opposed Simplicity Village have been

N treated differently from other appellants and citizens of the City of Chico, and have been subjected

8 to deliberately biased, inconsistent, erroneous and unfair enforcement of the Chico Municipal Code,

9 State law, the laws regarding the Shelter Crisis Declaration and Appendices "N" and "X", and the

10 California Building Code. This violates Government code §65852, which requires just, uniform, fair
and reasonable enforcement of ordinances and local laws.

11
12 64. Petitioner herein requests an immediate stay of the project known as Simplicity Village,
and that no building or grading permit be issued, nor any work performed to advance the

13 construction of Simplicity Village on and at the Real Property.

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays judgment as hereinafter set forth.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 ((Writ of Mandate- CCP $1094.5 et seq.)

18

19 65. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-64 of
this Petition as if set forth fully herein.

20

21 66. In the course of applying the review procedures of the CMC arbitrarily selected by

22 Respondent City to reach a desired result in favor of approval of Simplicity City rather than apply

23 the law, the City failed to provide a fair trial of the facts and law; the City exercised a prejudicial

24 abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in a manner required by law; and the decisions and

25 interpretation are not supported by the findings, and the findings are not supported by the evidence.

26 67. The decisions of the City upon the matters alleged herein have no foundation in fact or

27 anywhere in the record; have denied Petitioner due process and the right to actual consideration of
the facts and evidence; and have worked miscarriage of justice that renders the decisions of the
City void and unenforceable.

28 68. Respondent' actions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record, nor did

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 19

2 Respondent make findings of fact to support the conclusions reached. Specifically, but without

A W limitation, there was no substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion by respondent
City that Simplicity Village was a "Temporary Emergency Facility", that it could proceed solely

5 under the jurisdiction of a local ordinance standing apart from State and Federal laws, that it is a

6 temporary use, that it is supported by the Shelter Crisis Declaration without that statute being

7 expressly invoked, that it was subject to Appendix N/X in the absence of suspension of the

8 California Building Codes under the terms if Gov. Code §8698 et seq., that it was similar and

9 equivalent to other allowed listed uses in the ML zone, that it was consistent with the goals and

10 objectives of the General Plan, and there is no evidence in the record that justifies Simplicity Village

11 proceeding in violation of the mandated duties imposed by the Building Codes, or that the OPDI was

12 supported by true and correct findings based on facts and evidence in the record.

13 69. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies available to Petitioner and

14 have no other plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law, other than the relief sought by this Petition
and Complaint.

15

16 70. Petitioner herein requests an immediate stay of the project known as Simplicity Village,

17 and that no building or grading permit be issued, nor any work performed to advance the
construction of Simplicity Village on and at the Real Property.

18

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners prays judgment as hereinafter set forth.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21

22 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief; CCP §1060)

23 71. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-70 of
this Petition as if set forth fully herein.

24

25 72. A dispute and public controversy exists between Plaintiff and Defendants as to the legal

26 duties and obligations of the City under State law and the Chico Municipal Code as hereinbefore

27 alleged. Plaintiff contends that the State laws and the Chico Municipal Code prohibit the approval of

28 Simplicity Village as presented on these facts and the law. Defendant City, however, contends that
it's interpretation of these laws and the facts supports approval of Simplicity Village.

20

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

O üAW N 73. A court determination is required to settle and resolve the present dispute and controversy
that exists between these parties. No form of monetary relief is adequate to address these issues.
Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to obtain equitable relief by way of a declaratory
judgment of the relative rights and duties of the parties under the law and the controversy described
herein, including injunctive relief required to enforce the rights of Plaintiff and the duties of

Defendant under the law.

7

8 74. Plaintiff and the public will be irreparably harmed if Defendants and each of them are not

9 enjoined during the pendency of this action from constructing and developing Simplicity Village.

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays judgment as hereinafter set forth.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12

13 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act; Pub. R. §21000 et seq.)

14 75. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1-71 of
this Petition as if set forth fully herein.
15

16 76. Public Resources Code §21080 applies the requirements of the California Environmental

17 Quality Act (CEQA) to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public

18 agencies." The City of Chico and its duly appointed officers exercised and applied their discretion in
the approval given to Simplicity Village.

19

20 77. Under the CEQA "Guidelines" found in Title 14, Div. 6, Chapter 3 "Guidelines For

21 Implementation Of the California Environmental quality Act" at §15378, the term "project" means

22 "the whole of an action which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the

23 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." The

24 Simplicity Village development was issued an approval for entitlement to proceed by the City

25 through the Director's explicit approval given in OPDI No. 19-01. In addition, the City subsidized

26 the Simplicity Village development by waiving all development fees associated with the project.

27 And the OPDI No. 19-01 was itself a form of zoning approval affecting both the specific property

28 and as potential precedent for zoning decisions throughout the City on any similar projects. Under
Guidelines §15378(a) the Simplicity Village approval was a "project" requiring environmental

21

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 scrutiny under CEQA.

2 78. Further, under CMC §19.16.060 of the Chico Environmental Review Guidelines, and as
mt000 indicated n Table 4-8 for the ML Zone under procedures required for a zoning clearance, even a
theoretical use by right requires an "environmental assessment" by the Director so that it obtains
CEQA review.
79. In the present matter there was no environmental assessment or any CEQA review of any
kind given on the OPDI No. 19-01. This in itself is a violation of CEQA that requires reversal of the

8 decision on the OPDI for review and an environmental assessment and further action under CEQA.

9 80. The substantive decision of the OPDI No. 19-01 was based on the alleged applicability of

10 the City's Declaration of Shelter Crisis to the Simplicity Village project. As hereinbefore alleged,
11 Petitioner disputes that the Simplicity Village project qualifies for consideration under the Shelter

12 Crisis Declaration because the project did not meet the foundational requirements of a "Public
13 Facility" under Gov. Code §8698 & §8698.1, nor was the project on "land leased or owned by a

14 political subdivision"(§8698(e)), nor did the City make a finding that the substandard construction of

15 sleeping cabins proposed for Simplicity Village was necessary because "strict compliance would in

16 any way prevent, hinder, or delay the mitigation of the effects of the shelter crisis." (Gov. Code

17 §8698.1(b).) The Shelter Crisis declaration cannot be deemed applicable to the Simplicity Village

18 project either substantively or for purposes of determining in any way the applicability or potential

19 extent of CEQA review. Simplicity Village has no statutory shield from environmental review as a

20 crisis mitigation measure.

21 81. Only after the Planning Commission and City Council denied Petitioner's appeal of the

22 approval of Simplicity City did the City assert in its resolution denying the appeal that this

23 development project is "exempt" from CEQA review as an "emergency" mitigation measure under
24 Guidelines §15269(c). The City's application of the "exemption" (in addition to being untimely)

25 was inaccurate on two grounds. (1) The failure of Simplicity Village to meet the requirements for
26 the Shelter Crisis declaration deprives of any characterization or qualification for coverage under the
27 Shelter Crisis laws. (2) The term "emergency" has an explicit definition under CEQA quite different

28 from the general conditions for a shelter crisis. Guidelines §14 CCR 15359 define an "emergency"

22

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

as follows:

2 "Emergency" means a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or

4 damage to life, health, property, or essential public services. Emergency includes

ut such occurrences as fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or geologic movements, as well as such occurrences as riot, accident, or sabotage.

6 Whereas, per Gov. Code §8698 (d), a "shelter crisis" is the "existence of a situation in which a

7 significant number of persons are without the ability to obtain shelter, resulting in a threat to their

8 health and safety." The distinction is the immediacy, imminent danger and exigency of an

9 "emergency" under CEQA required to qualify for exemption. In contrast, the housing shortage

10 coupled with poverty, potential substance abuse, and potential mental health issues are the slow

11 if moving even if admittedly dire circumstances behind the "shelter crisis." CEQA demands that if

12 is there is time to do so, the importance and priority of protecting the environment requires that CEQA

13 review be carried out. In this matter there is not a CEQ "emergency" a that provides an exemption to

14 environmental review for Simplicity Village.

15 82. The scope and magnitude of Simplicity Village clearly poses a "significant impact" on the

16 environment that necessitates an environmental impact report. The record reflecting a $700,000+

17 development project, with high density residential concentration, intensive social services activities,

18 in a Zone that is not compatible with the proposed use, over a span of up to 18 years, demonstrates

19 significant impacts that warrant an EIR.

20 83. Irreparable harm will be sufferec by the environment, Petitioner, and the public if the

21 project is not enjoined pending a final determination in this proceeding and ultimately the

22 preparation and completion of an EIR.

23 84. Respondents/Defendants abused their discretion and violated CEQA in approving the

24 Simplicity Village project without environmental review, such that mandamus and related injunctive

25 and/or equitable relief is appropriate under CCP §1085 and Public Resources Code §21168.

26 85. Petitioner has complied with all conditions precedent required for filing and maintaining

27 this action.

28 86. WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays judgment as hereinafter set forth.

23

- N PRAYER FOR RELIEF

U Petitioner respectfully prays judgment against Respondents/Defendants, as follows:
(1) For issuance of a writ of mandate, for injunctive relief, and/or other extraordinary relief
directing and commanding the Respondent to vacate and set aside their invalid denial of Petitioner's
appeals;
(2) That the court adjudicate, determine and declare that the Respondent's application and
interpretation of the local and state laws is invalid, arbitrary, and does not serve a legitimate public
purpose as applied to this particular project;

10 (3) For an award of general damages, special damages, and consequential damages against

11 Petitioner, for the damages suffered by Petitioner as a result of Respondent's unlawful conduct

s pursuant to Civ. Proc. Code, § 1095;

13 (4) For a writ of mandate setting aside the decisions, approvals and determinations by

14 Respondents avoiding environmental review, and further ordering and directing Respondents to

15 carry out CEQA review through preparation of an environmental impact report;

17 attorney's fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation costs incurred herein, in an amount according
to proof; and

CITE 9IKO City Council Agenda Report Meeting Date: 10/02/18

TO: Honorable Mayor and City Council

FROM: Vincent C. Ewing, City Attorney

RE: Declaration of Shelter Crisis and Homeless Emergency Aid Program ("HEAP")

REPORT IN BRIEF:

The Homeless Emergency Aid Program (HEAP) makes $500 million in one-time funding available to Continuums of Care (CoCs) and large citiès (population over 330,000) in the State of California. This funding is intended to provide immediate emergency assistance 1o those jurisdictions that are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness. The Butte Countywide Homeless Continuum of Care ("local CoC") is eligible for 4.9 million in HEAP funding.

Pursuant to Government Code Sections 8698 et.seq., the City may declare a shelter crisis via resoltuion
of the City Council upon a finding that a significant number of persons within the City are without the
ability to obtain shelter, resulting in a threat to their health and safety. Said declaration of shelter crisis is being considered by the City Council since the State requires a shelter crisis declaration in order for local jurisdictions, and service providers with those jurisdictions, to be eligible for HEAP funds through their local CoC.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the City Council adopt Resolution No. XX, which declares a Shelter Crisis in the
City of Chico. (Exhibit "B").

FISCAL IMPACT:

The fiscal impact associated with this action, includes the staff time incurred in preparing this report and
if approved the staff time associated with implementation of HEAP funds.

DISCUSSION:

Homeless Emergency Aid Program (HEAP) Funding
In June 2018, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill ("SB") 850 and related budget trailer bills into law that launched the Homeless Emergency Aid Program (HEAP) and made $500 million in one-time funding available to Continuums of Care (CoCs) and large cities (population over 330,000). The purpose

Re: Declaration of Shelter Crisis and Homeless Emergency Aid Program ("HEAP")
Meeting Date: 10/02/18
Page of 4

of this one-time funding is to provide immediate emergency assistance to those jurisdictions that are experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness.
CoCs are regional or local planning bodies that coordinate housing and services funding for homeless families and individuals. They were first created in 1995 when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) began to require communities to submit a single application for homeless assistance grants in order to streamline the funding application process. CoCs develop community plans to organize and deliver housing and services to meet the specific needs of people who are homeless as they move to stable housing and maximize self-sufficiency.
The local CoC is identified by the State as the Chico, Paradise/Butle County Continuum of Care and is known locally as the Butte Countywide Homeless Continuum of Care ("local CoC"). HEAP funding will flow through the local CoC's Administrative is Entity, which is the Community Action Agency of Butte County, Inc. (CAA), unless one of the general purpose local governments (Butte County or a City/Town) fulfilis the role as Administrative Entity for purposes of HEAP funding. The County has offered to serve as the Administrative Entity for HEAP funds.
Within the incorporated and unicorporated arcas of Butte County, the State identified 1,195 individuals out of the local CoC's 2017 Homeless Point in Time Census and Survey Report that meet the State's definition for homeless. Based on that number, the local CoC is eligible for approximatcly $4.9 million in HEAP funding, if the CoC meets all State requirements, including at least one local jurisdiction declaring a shelter crisis. The local CoC may then award the funding to local agencics and organizations, including cities and the County, that meet State guidelines.
Eligible uses for HEAP funding include, but are not limited to:

0 Scrvices: street outreach, health and safety education, criminal justice diversion programs, prevention services, navigation services, and operating support for short-term or comprehensive
homeless services.

Rental Assistance or Subsidies: housing vouchers, rapid re-housing programs, and eviction
prevention strategies.
Capital Improvements: emergency shelters, transitional housing, drop-in centers, permanent
supportive housing, small/tiny houses, improvements to current structures that serve homeless invididuals and families, and handwashing stations or public toilet and shower facilities. Plcase
note that any capital improvements would require compliance with applicable building, zoning,
and health and safety codes.
At least 5% of HEAP funds must be used to establish or expand services meeting the needs of homeless youth or youth at risk of homelessness.
Shelter Crisis Decluration
Pursuant to Government Code section 8698 et seq., the City may declare a shelter crisis upon a finding that a significant number of persons within the City are without the ability to obtain shelter, resulting in a threat to their health and safety.

Rc: Declaration of Shelter Crisis and Homeless Emergency Aid Program ("HEAP")
Mccting Date: 10/02/18
Page 3 of 4

The California Homeless Coordinating and Financing Council identified 433 unsheltered homeless persons, from the 2017 Homeless Point in Time Census and Survey Report, located in the City. The
number of homeless individuals located in the City is significant, and the health and safety of
unsheltered persons in the City is threatened by lack of shelter.
A declaration of a shelter crisis provides the City with the following options, but does not require any of
them to be utilized:

• Per Government Code section 8698(c), any vacant or underutilized facility or property currently owned, leased, operated, or maintained by the City, through money derived by taxation or assessment, may be designated a public facility (*City Designated Facility") for purposes of emergency sheltering during the declaration.

0 Per Government Code section 8698.1(b), the City may suspend the provision of any state or local law or regulations prescribing standards of housing, health, or safety to the extent that strict
compliance would prevent, hinder, or delay the provision of emergency shelter(s) in or on City
Designated Facilties. Federal laws and regulations will still apply.
Per Government Code section 8698.1(b), the City may enact, in place of the housing standards
referenced above, health and safety standards effective only during the declaration, to ensure
minimal public health and safety.
Per Government Code section 8698.2(b), the City may allow persons unable to obtain housing to occupy, from time to time, City Designated Facilities during the duration of the declaration.
Per Government Code section 8698.1(a), the City is immune from liability for ordinary negligence in the provision of emergency housing to unsheltered persons during the declaration, limited to conditions, acts, or omissions directly related to, and which would not occur but for, the provision of emergency
housing.
In addition to the above, the State requires a shelter crisis declaration in order for local jurisdictions, and service providers with those jurisdictions, to be eligible for $4.9 million in HEAP funds through the
local CoC. Exhibit A, attached, illustrates the options related to shelter crisis declarations and HEAP
funding, depending on whether the City declares a shelter crisis. The Board of Supervisors of Butte County declared a shelter crisis in the County via resolution on September 25, 2018 .
The proposed resolution declaring a shelter crisis would allow the following:

o The City to apply to the CoC for funding to provide services in jurisdiction;
The City to apply to the CoC for funding for capital improvements and rental subsidies
within jurisdiction;
The City to authorize use of appropiate City Designated Facilities for sheltering
purposes in the City.

Use Of City Designated Facilities
If the City Council chooscs to declare a shelter crisis, it does not automatically authorize the it use of any specific property or facility for use as emergency shelter, it only allows the City Council the option to do so.
if the City Council would like to consider use of any particular property, staff recommends that the City Council direct the City Manager, or designee, to request proposals from interested organizations providing homeless shelter services, with the City Manager bringing any viable proposals to the City Council for consideration. If the City Council approves a proposal, it will also authorize the appropriate facility to be a City Designated Facility and direct the City Manager to enter into an agreement with the organization to operate an emergency shelter at the City Facility no longer than the duration of the crisis.
Options Regarding A Shelter Crisis Declaration
1. Adopt the resolution declaring a shelter crisis.
If a shelter crisis declaration is adopted by the City Council, the HEAP funding becomes
available for:
The City to provide HEAP-funded services in the City (i.e., mental health services, public
health services, employment and social services, substance abuse services);

0 The City and service providers to use HEAP funding for capital improvements and rental
subsidies in the City (capital improvements must meet all applicable building, zoning,
and health and safety laws and regulations);
In addition, the shelter crisis declaration allows the City Council to designate vacant or underutilized City properties and facilities for temporary sheltering purposes.
2. Do not adopt the resolution declaring a shelter crisis.
If a shelter crisis declaration is not adopted by the City Council, HEAP funding will not be available to the City for provision of additional citywide services, or to fund capital improvements or providing rental subsidies in the City.
In addition, the City Council will not have the ability to designate vacant or underutilized City properties or facilities in any jurisdiction for use as emergency sheltering.

Charles,

The shelter crisis supports Brendan's assessment on the allowable use on the property. For the
shelter crisis to apply explicitly, we would have to go back down the original path which raised
concerns for CHAT related to prevalling wage and it would also require far more legal involvement
from the City which could lead to more delay.

think the current approach we have is a win-win to get SV going. I'm not sure of the circumstances
of Yuba County and Andrew can speak to that If necessary, but our City does have a declared shelter
crisis. My concern is if CHAT continues to change on the approaches towards getting to the finish
line, it will only continue to delay this worthwhile project. My recommendation Is to continue down
the current path to at least get the project going. Our staff worked on a variety of alternate options
after the prevailing wage Issue came up, and it was difficult to find a path that complied with code.

RE: Ordinance Amending Section 16R.02.010 and 16R 12.010 of the Cily of Chico Municipal Code Relating to Emergency Housing
REPORT IN BRIEF:
The City Council declared a homeless shelter crisis and requested staff investigate the feasibilily of allernalive housing models such as lhe Simplicity Village projeci to provide transilional housing to many of our homeless community members. In April 2018, Ihe Callfomnia Building Code (CBC) and Calífornia Residential Code (CRC) were amended to add voluntary appendices containing building standards applicable to emergency housing. For the appendices to be applicable in Chico, lhey must be adopled by the City through an ordinance.
Staff is requesting the City Council adopt an ordinance to amend Section 16R.02.010 and 16R.12.010 of the City of Chico Municipal Code lo add CBC Appendix N and CRC Appendix X relating lo emergency housing.
Appendices N and X would only be effective during a declared "Stale of Emergency, Local Emergency or Sheller Crisis® and for the duration of the declared housing crisis, the Cily can issue building permits for emergency housing slruciures (sleeping cabins, transporlable housing units, tents, and support facilities) that otherwise would nol meet
the minimum state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances.

Recommendation:

The Interim Building Official recommends Council introduce the following amending Tille 16R of the City of Chico
Code relaling to Building Regulations • Emergency Housing, by reading of title only:
AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF CHICO, CALIFORNIA, AMENDING TITLE 16R.02 010 & 16R.12.010 OF THE CHICO MUNICIPAL CODE RELATING TO INCLUDE ADOPTION OF CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE APPENDIX N'AND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CODE APPENDIX X REGARDING EMERGENCY HOUSING

FISCAL IMPACT:

Not applicable

DISCUSSION:

By amending Section 16R.02.010 and 16R.12.010 of the City of Chico Municipal Code to add CBC Appendix N and CRC Appendix X relating to emergency housing, housing unils constructed to address basic shelter needs could be constructed to statewide standard during a declared "Slale of Emergency, Local Emergency or Shelter Crisis" and for the duration of the declared housing crisis. Building permils would be issued and inspections made for emergency housing structures (sleeping cabins, transportable housing units, tents, and support facililies) under the new stalewde requirements. Adoption of Appendix N and the 2016 CRC Appendi X will promote safety by adopting the stalewide
requirements for temporary structures to help address the declared emergency sheller crisis
These Appendices provide a number of lesser restrictive requirements such as reduced ceiling heights, reduced net openings for windows, loft size reduction, establishment of minimum floor area, and only electrical hookup for sleeping cabins. Appendix N and Appendix X also allow for existing compliani structures to be used for emergency housing facilities The Department of Housing and Community Development developed these regulations to facilitale

the provision of emergency housing facilties and maintain unifled standards for the increased preservation of public heallh and safely in the construction and use of such structures In response to a severe shortage of shelter beds and homeless housing projects. on Oclober 2, 2018, Council voted to declare a homeless shelter crisis Council has also instructed staff to work with proponents of the Simplicily Village project towards promoting their potential solution for emergency housing facility conslruction Adoption of these Appendices will assist in the construction of such housing unit construction and development.

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS:

The proposed ordinance is exempl from the provisions of the California Environmental Qualily Act (CEQA) under Public Resources Code section 21080 (b)(4) for specific actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency. The proposed ordinance is also exempt under Public Resources Code section 21065 and CEQA Guidelines sections 15060 (c)(2) and 15378(a) because it does not have the potential for resulting in a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment since there would be no langible physical change to the environment that is perceptible to the senses. Finally, the proposed ordinance is exempt under CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the aclivity in queslion may have a significant effect on the environment.

PUBLIC CONTACT:

City and Simplicity Village staff have mel and corresponded on several occasions to address the issues regarding creating of the proposed form of housing

OPDI No. 19-01

CITY OF CHICO
OFFICIAL PLANNING DIRECTOR
CITY OF CHICO INC (872 INTERPRETATION

Applicant: Chico Housing Action Team (CHAT)
Location: Simplicity Village (2.6 acre parcel located on Notre Dame Blvd., south of Morrow
Lane; APN# 040-030-028)

Authority: Chico Municipal Code Sections 19.02.020 (Rules of interpretation), 19.02.020.E. (Allowable Uses of Land), and 19.02.030 (Procedures for interpretations)
Applicable Code Section(s): Sections 19.22.020 (Temporary uses, allowed by right), 19.22.020 C (Emergency Facilities)
Discussion; Applicant proposes to use the parcel on Notre Dame Blvd. for a project known as"Simplicity Village" - a tiny home complex with 33 housing units and 2 supporting portable units providing offices, bathrooms, showers, washers and dryers, and a community kitchen (Attachment A - Site Plan). The project will provide housing to approximately 46 homeless, or at risk of being homeless, senior singles and couples. The site is located in the ML (Light Manufacturing/Industrial) zoning district. Emergency Facilities are permitted by right within the ML district (CMC Section 19.22.020 & 19.46.020)
As a threshold question for analysis of this matter, the Director must determine whether the use presented is similar to an Emergency Facility as defined under the CMC. Based upon information provided by the applicant intending to operate the facility, and as discussed below, the Director has determined that the use is within what would be considered an "Emergency Facility" and therefore constitutes an allowed temporary use pursuant to Section 19.22.020.C under the category "Emergency Facilities. Emergency public health and safety needs/land use activities."

Facts supporting this determination include:

1. The site on Notre Dame Blvd., south of Morrow Lane (APN# 040-030-028) is located in
the ML (Light Manufacturing/Industrial) zoning district;
2. Emergency Facilities are permitted by right within the ML district (CMC Section 19.22.020);
3. Applicant has provided the attached Simplicity Village Business Plan (Attachment B), Management Plan (Attachment C), and Village Manual (Attachment D) which provide

information highlighting the manner in which the facility will operate, and includes specifics that address a number of compatibility and safety considerations, including a security plan, safety plan, fencing of the site, participant vetting process, residency rules and governance, alcohol/drug policy, and site supervision; and
4. Temporary uses are short-term activities that might not meet the normal development or
use standards of the applicable zoning district, but are acceptable because of their
temporary nature;
5. Applicant intends to utilize this facility through the duration of the Housing Shelter Crisis set to sunset on June 30, 2021 (see Reso. 82-18, October 2, 2018);
6. The City's declaration a of a Shelter Crisis included a finding that a significant number of
persons within the City are without the ability to obtain housing, resulting in a threat to their health and safety. The proposed temporary use will address this emergency need;
7. The use is temporary and will be allowed for a duration consistent with the City's Declaration of a Shelter Crisis which ends on June 30, 2021;
8. Development of the project site will be consistent with the State of California's Building Code Appendix N (Emergency Housing), developed by the State to be applicable to emergency housing and emergency housing facilities under the Shelter Crisis Declaration, and, adopted by the City of Chico to address construction of Emergency Housing All building at the project site will be by permit, reviewed and approved by the City's Building Official and Fire Marshall; and
9. Applicant shall comply with all other State and local Code provisions, including, but not limited to, those of the Building Division, Public Works Department, and Fire Department. Applicant is responsible for contacting these offices to verify the need for permits.
hereby make the following findings in support of this interpretation as to similar uses allowed, as required pursuant to CMC 19.02.020.E. "Allowable Uses of Land":
a. The characteristics of, and activities associated with, the proposed use are equivalent to those of one or more of the uses listed in the zoning district as allowable, and will not
involve a higher level of activity or density and/or intensity than the uses listed in the
district.

Finding: The current zoning of the property on Notre Dame Blvd. (south of Morrow Lane) is ML (Light Manufacturing/Industrial). The ML zoning district primarily consists of areas where light assembly and manufacturing, wholesaling, warehousing and distribution, agricultural and industrial processing within structures, and support commercial services are allowed. Additionally, Emergency Facilities are permitted by right within the ML district (CMC Section 19.22.020). Emergency Facilities are defined as, "Emergency public health and safety needs/land use activities."
"Temporary emergency shelters" are permitted by right in the ML zoning district for up to 27 days in any 90 day period, and permanent "Emergency shelters" are allowed with approval of a use permit. Emergency shelters are defined in CMC Section 19.04 as "[a] facility which provides emergency shelter to homeless individuals and/or groups or others in need of shelter. Such accommodations include lodging and may in addition include
meals, facilities, bathing, counseling, and other basic support services."

The proposed temporary proposed tiny home temporary emergency facilities includes activities that are generally compatible to other uses allowed in the ML zoning district. Such use is not incompatible with the other uses of the ML zoning district of manufacturing, agricultural, and industrial processing, general services and distribution
uses, including uses with outdoor equipment and outdoor storage.
The proposed use is further acceptable due to its temporary nature, the operational characteristics proposed by the applicant, and given the urgency of the need to provide emergency public health and safety needs to the community's significant number of homeless, which is documented by the State's and City's Shelter Crisis Declaration, and
has more recently been exacerbated by a significant influx of Camp Fire survivors.
b. The proposed use will meet the purpose/intent of the zoning district that is applied to the
site.

Finding: Permanent emergency shelters are allowed in the ML zoning district with approval of a use permit. The proposed use however is not permanent in nature and is associated with the limited duration of the shelter crisis declaration. The proposed tiny home facilities represents a use that has operating characteristics generally consistent with an allowed use in the Municipal Code, albeit with a use permit. The operational characteristics of the proposed use are similar to conditions typically found in a use permit. Given the temporary nature of the proposed use, it is consistent with the purpose and intent of the ML zoning district.
The proposed use of emergency housing for a duration through the shelter crisis is equivalent to an emergency facility allowed by right within the ML zoning district.

C. The proposed use will be consistent with the goals, policies, and actions of the Chico 2030 General Plan, as well as the City's HUD Consolidaled Plan.
The following General Plan goals, policies, and actions are applicable to this determination:

Goal H.3 Promote construction of a wide range of housing types.
Policy H.3.3 Promote a mix of dwelling types and sizes throughout the City.
Action 3.3.3 Support emerging cost efficient and green housing models, such as "micro-housing" and live/work lofts.
Goal H.4 Encourage the creation of housing for persons with special needs
Policy H.4.6 Encourage the development of housing for homeless and extremely
low-income persons.

The following HUD Consolidated Plan (2015-2019) goal is applicable to this determination:

Goal 1 Create Low Income affordable housing opportunities for residents, with a
priority on: Small units tiny houses, micro-units, single room occupancies, studios,
one-bedrooms

a Supportive services for - substance abuse, mental illness, child care, seniors, veterans, persons with disabilities
9 Accessibility
0 Extremely Low Income Households and person at risk of homelessness

Pursuant to Section 19.02.020.A of the Municipal Code, I have determined that in light of the State's and City's Declaration of a Shelter Crisis, compounded by the significant influx of Camp Fire evacuees, that the proposed tiny home temporary emergency facilities use on Notre Dame Blvd., south of Morrow Lane (APN# 040-030-028) represents an allowed temporary use as an "Emergency Facilities" use provided in Section 19.22.020.C of Chapter 19.22 (Temporary Uses) of the Chico Municipal Code.
This Official Interpretation is effective immediately.
