Petitioner Granite
24 Bay Preservation Society ("Petitioner") petitions this Court for a Writ of

25 Mandate, directed to Respondents Placer County and the Placer County Board of Supervisors

26 ("County" or "Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' March 12, 2019, adoption of the

27 Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of PLN17-00316: the Chabad of Roseville Minor Use

28 Permit for a two-building, 23,300 square foot house of worship and community center with accessory
uses including an elementary and preschool and Variances to reduce front setbacks along Douglas

Boulevard and Woodgrove Way and to reduce the western side setback; and an Administrative
2 Approval to allow for the building to exceed the maximum building height for the community center
3 building (**Project"). Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals for the Project violate the
4 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").
Also, the Project is inconsistent with the Granite Bay Community Plan and the zoning ordinance
6 contrary to the State Planning Laws. (Government Code § 65300 et seq.) Petitioner alleges as
7 follows:

8 PARTIES

9 The Granite Bay Preservation Society ("GBPS") is an unincorporated association with
10 members who live within the immediate vicinity of the Project. GBPS is dedicated to preventing
11 environmental degradation and to the improvement of the environmental quality in the
12 neighborhoods in Granite Bay. GBPS and its members participated in the administrative process
13 leading up to the County's approval of the Project, objecting to the Project and warning the County of
14

15 the illegalities defined in this lawsuit. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

16 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from environmental harms alleged herein

17 and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures required under the law in approving

18 development projects like the one at issue here. GBPS is beneficially interested in this matter

19 because it has a direct interest in ensuring that Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA,

20 State law, and the County's own ordinances. GBPS has an interest in preserving and protecting, for

21 the general public, the environment and character of Granite Bay.

22 2. Respondent Placer County is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body

23 corporate and politic exercising local government power. Placer County is the CEQA "lead agency"

24 for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Placer County is responsible for preparation of an

25 environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates
26 mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.
27 The County also has principal responsibility for determining whether projects within its jurisdiction
28

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

p are consistent with the County general plans, community or specific plans, applicable land use
2 ordinances, and other applicable laws.
3 3. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly authorized under
4 the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on behalf of the County of
5 Placer. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors is responsible for regulating and controlling
6
land use within the County including, but not limited to, implementing and complying with the 7

8 provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 California Code of Regulations, title 14,

9 section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable land use ordinances and other laws. As the

10 elected representatives of the people of the County, the Board of Supervisors establishes overall

11 County priorities and sets policy. The Board of Supervisors is the governing body of the County and

12 is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project.

13 4. Real Party in Interest Jewish Community Center - Chabad of Roseville ("Chabad of

14 Roseville") is a nonprofit corporation formed pursuant to the laws of the State of California with its
15 principal place of business in Roseville, California. Chabad of Roseville is the Project applicant.

16 5. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES: through 20 and 21 through

17 40, inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents and Real Parties in Interest respectively, by their
18 fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that fictitiously

19 named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest also are responsible for all acts and omissions
20 described above. When the true identities and capacities of Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
21 have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to include
22 such identities and capacities.
23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
24 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the
26

27 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public

Resources Code section 21168.
28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and for
2 the County of Placer pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
3 BACKGROUND FACTS
4 8. The Project site is located on the south side of Douglas Boulevard (4410 Douglas Boulevard)
5 in Granite Bay, at the corner of Douglas Boulevard and Woodgrove Way, approximately .40 miles
6
east of Sierra College Boulevard, Assessor's Parcel Number 462-010-030-000.
7
9.
8 The Project would include a new worship space, assembly space, classrooms, ritual bath area,

9 kitchen, library, offices, conference room, sleeping guest suites, a multipurpose room, and child play

10 areas in two, two-story buildings totaling 23,300 square feet on the 1.3-acre property at 4410 Douglas

11 Boulevard in Granite Bay. The proposed new buildings would replace an existing 4,600 square foot

12 community center building (a renovated former fire station) on the property

13 10. The proposed project site is designated Rural Low Density Residential, 0.9 to 2.3-acre

14 minimum parcel size in the Granite Bay Community Plan and is zoned RS-AG-B-100 PD = 1

15 (Residential Single Family, combining Agricultural, minimum Building Site of 100,000 square feet,

16 combining Planned Residential Development of 1 unit per acre) and RS-AG-B-100 PD = 0.44

17 (Residential Single Family, combining Agricultural, minimum Building Site of 100,000 square feet,

18 combining Planned Residential Development of.44 units per acre).
19 11. The Project proposes the following entitlements: Minor Use Permit for a House of
20 Worship/Community Center in the RS zoning district; Design Review; allowance of a 37'4" building
21 height for the main building where 36 feet is normally allowed; and significant setback variances.
22 12. The setbacks required for the Project by the applicable Community Plan are 50 feet from the
23 edge of the right-of-way along Douglas Boulevard and Woodgrove Way, and the Project proposes
24 variances for reduction to 12.5 feet and 21 feet, respectively. A variance is also proposed for the
25
line to reduce the setback from the required 30 feet to 10 feet. 26 western property

13.
27 Access to the Project site is proposed from Woodgrove Way (full access). Access utilizing

28 the existing Douglas Boulevard entrance would be discontinued and the entryway would be gated to
allow for emergency vehicle use only. As a future phase, and when the right turn lane is extended

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 westerly, access from Douglas Boulevard would be provided, right-in only. Parking for only 48 cars
2 is provided, despite the fact that 92 spaces are required under the County's parking analysis.
3 14. The Project will include a 16,700 square foot, two-story community center at the northeast 4 corner of the property, with a height of 26'8" at the top of the parapet wall on the second floor and a 5 height of 37'4" for the façade facing Douglas Boulevard (shifted to be side-facing on the Project site 6

7 at the time of approval by the Board of Supervisors). An additional 6,600 square foot religious

8 education building would also be constructed on the western portion of the Project site. The

9 education building would have two floors and a height of 27'5" to the top of the parapet wall on the

10 second floor.

11 15. Days and times of operations vary, and range from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., 7 days per week.

12 The Project would also accommodate overnight guests.

13 16. The Project would include an outdoor play area on the southeast corner of the roof of the first

14 floor of the community center building.

15 17. In 2009, a Minor Use Permit was approved to the allow for the operation of a House of
16 Worship, a Variance to allow for reduced parking requirements, and a Minor Boundary Line
17 Adjustment to create one parcel on the site, which was at the time two separate parcels. The project
18 included interior and exterior modifications to the former South Placer Fire Station. The renovated
19 fire station building exists on the site and would be demolished to make way for the proposed
20 community center building.
21 18. The Initial Study checklist and Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") for the Project
22 was released for public review on September 21, 2018, and various comments were received, 23 including comments from the Granite Bay Community Association ("GBCA"). 24 19. On October 17, 2018, the GBCA sent a comment letter raising, among other things, the 25

26 following issues: (1) the Project design is inconsistent with the Douglas Corridor - Design Elements

27 and Landscaping Goals found in the Granite Bay Community Plan; (2) aesthetic impacts; (3) land use

28 compatibility; (4) parking impacts; and (5) inadequate parking.

5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 20. On November 8, 2018, the Placer County Planning Commission considered the Project and
2 approved the Minor Use Permit, Variance, and Administrative Approval, and adopted the IS/MND
3 and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan.
4 21.
5 On November 16, 2018, the GBCA appealed the Planning Commission's approval on the
following grounds:
6
a.
7 Variances for setbacks along Douglas Boulevard are prohibited by the Granite Bay
Community Plan. The Granite Bay Community Plan imposes stricter setbacks along
Douglas Boulevard than the Zoning Ordinance, and a variance cannot be granted for

10 the setback established in the Community Plan.

11 b. No variances can be granted since there are no special circumstances applicable to the

12 property.

13 C A full EIR is required for the Project and the County failed to adequately analyze
14 impacts to aesthetics, traffic, parking, noise and land use.

15 d. The Project's design is inconsistent with the Community Plan.
16 e. The Project violates the Zoning Ordinance.
17 22. On March 8, 2019, Petitioner submitted a detailed comment letter supporting the GBCA
18 appeal, and describing the Project's violation of applicable land use plans and the MND's failure to
19 comply with CEQA.
20 23. On March 12, 2018, the Placer County Board of Supervisors held a hearing, denied the
21 appeal, approved the Project with a modification turning the over-height façade toward the side of the
22 parcel rather than facing Douglas Boulevard, and adopted the MND.
23 24.
24 On March 12, 2018, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk of

25 Placer County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

27 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

28 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 25. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and has
2 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
3 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section 21167.5 by
4 mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written notice and proof of 5 service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.
6
27.
7 Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a

g request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.
28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this

10 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the

11 Project and adoption of the Negative Declaration. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents'

12 approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

13 29. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of Determination as

14 required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

15 STANDING

16 30. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner's
17 aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondents'
18 adoption of the MND and approval of the Project.
19 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS
20 31. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code section 800, and
21 other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency
22 decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in question.
23

27 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

28 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

32. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every allegation
2 contained in paragraphs 1 through 31.
3 33. CEQA is designed to ensure that the government agencies incorporate the goal of long-term
4 protection of the environment into decisions that may affect the environment. CEQA applies to any
5 discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause reasonably foreseeable change in the
6
environment.
7
34.
8 CEQA requires that an agency prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial evidence in

9 the record supports a fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment.

10 The EIR is the cornerstone of the CEQA process and discloses a project's potential adverse

11 environmental and human impacts. The EIR also informs decisionmakers, responsible agencies, and

12 the public of alternatives, mitigation measures, project elements, or project designs that would lessen

13 or avoid the project's environmental impacts.

14 35. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures

15 that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If substantial

16 evidence in the record supports a fair argument that any of the project's significant environmental

17 impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, an agency may not rely on a mitigated
18 negative declaration and must instead prepare an EIR.
19 36. The County's approval of the Project constitutes a discretionary act that triggers it obligation
20 to comply with CEQA.
21 37. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required under
22 CEQA with respect to the Project because they have failed to adequately analyze the Project's
23 environmental impacts and failed to identify necessary and feasible mitigation measures. Moreover,
24 substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that the Respondents'
25

26 approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment.

I.
27 A Full Environmental Impact Report is Required for the Project

28 38. Substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that the
Respondents' approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment, and a full

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

Ha

2 EIR is required. In each of the following areas of impact analysis, the IS/MND fails to comply with

CEQA:
3 A. Aesthetics:
4 39.
5 The record reveals that the Project will have significant aesthetic impacts that were not

6 adequately addressed in the IS/MND. Placer County has designated Douglas Boulevard as a "Scenic

7 Roadway," and it is travelled by more than 40,000 cars per day. The Project site currently contains
single-story building set back at least 50 feet from Douglas Boulevard. The Project proposes to a

8
replace the only slightly visible building with a 37'4" building set back just 12.5 feet from Douglas

10 Boulevard. The Project is incompatible with the Granite Bay Community Plan and the adopted

11 Douglas Corridor Design Guidelines.

12 B. Traffic and Parking:

13 40.

14 The record reveals that the Project will have significant traffic impacts that were not

15 adequately addressed in the IS/MND. Also, the cumulative traffic impact was not considered with

16 other projects proposed for Douglas Boulevard. The Traffic Impact Analysis ("TIA") for the Project

17 failed to analyze impacts at the intersection of Douglas Boulevard and Sierra College Drive, nor did it

18 address traffic concerns raised by the City of Roseville. Under the County's own analysis, the

19 Project requires 92 (some documents in the record indicate 99 would be required) parking spaces, and
the Project as approved has only 48.
20 41.
21 The record reveals many and significant flaws in the traffic analysis for the Project. The TIA

22 indicates that the characteristics of the Project are "unique" and so the "traffic forecasting did not

23 utilize recognized national sources such as the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) trip

24 generation publication. An alternative approach was taken to estimate project trip generation based

25 on observation of current activity. Because of the late start of the Chabad's school day (e.g. 9:00a.m.

26 preschool, 9:30a.m. elementary school/middle school), most of the school trips occur after the typical

27 a.m. peak hour." This "unique" approach of "observation of current activity" is without a sound basis

28 in the facts, nor is there any evidence in the record supporting the notion that this comes close to
meeting any industry standards for traffic analysis. There are no binding conditions for the proposed

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

Project that would insure that the "observed current activity" will continue unchanged into the future.
2 This means that as a worst case scenario the addition of 100 students to the facility has the potential
3 to become a considerable amount of traffic on the existing roadways and intersections; as much as
4 400 trips per day. It is a fair assumption that as the Project grows in size and popularity, along with
5 older age groups, school will be forced to begin earlier in order to accommodate after school
6

7 activities. Unless binding conditions are included in the Project approval to preserve the "observed

8 current activity," the worst case scenario must be analyzed.

42.
9 The TIA fails to analyze impacts to roadway segments and reveal the outcome of that to the

10 public and the decision makers. This flaw in the TIA is material because the intensity of use was

11 greatly expanded with the school and a religious event center and therefore not evaluated by

12 previous CEQA documents as the County attests. The expansion of the school alone has the potential

13 to add as much as 400 daily trips to the already unacceptable roadway segment of Douglas

14 Blvd between Sierra College Boulevard and Seeno Avenue, in addition to many other deficient

15 segments. The TIA did not evaluate the impacts on the roadway segments, and this is exacerbated by

16 the fact that future, planned projects such as Whitehawk I & II will trigger a mitigation requirement

17 of widening Douglas Boulevard to 6 lanes from Sierra College Boulevard to Cavitt Stallman Road.

18 This segment is currently operating at LOS F. The roadway segments need to be accounted for in a
19 full EIR to assess the extent of the Project's impacts.
20 C. Noise:
21 43. The record reveals that the Project will have significant noise impacts that were not
22 adequately addressed in the IS/MND. The IS/MND fails to address the noise of the construction
23 phase of the Project. The noise from traffic to and from the Project site and the outdoor uses on the
24 site were also not adequately addressed in the IS/MND.
25
D. Land Use Impacts:
26
44.
27 The IS/MND checklist indicates "less than significant" impact to Land Use and Planning and

28 states that the Project will not conflict with any adopted plans. The narrative portion of the IS/MND
provides a brief analysis but fails to discuss the Project's violation of the setback requirements of the

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

-

2 Community Plan and inconsistency with the applicable Design Guidelines. The Project does, in fact,

3 conflict with the Community Plan.

45.
4 The record reveals that the Project is entirely too large to fit on the Project site without

5 violation of the Community Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, not to mention creating traffic and safety

6 hazards for neighbors, and resulting in tremendous aesthetic impacts in violation of the applicable

7 Design Guidelines.

III.
8 Other CEQA violations:

9 46. Respondents inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary investigations, studies or

10 inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and provided no performance

11 standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies used to develop mitigation

12 measures.

13 47.

14 The IS/MND fails to provide substantial evidence to support Respondents' conclusions that

15 the Project will not have a significant effect on the environment and the CEQA findings are

insufficient.

16 48.

17 Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed according to law in that they failed

18 to require the preparation of an EIR for the project, despite the existence of a "fair argument" based

19 on substantial evidence in the record, that the project may have a significant effect on the

environment.

20 49.
21 As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by CEQA and the

22 CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering Respondents to set aside the

23 environmental findings and the related decision, and directing Respondents to comply with the

24 procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines before acting on any development

25 proposal under the Project.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq-;

28 Code of Civil Procedure 1085

50. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 49.

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief
Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 51. Government Code Section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to adopt a
2 general plan (and provides for associated specific and community plans) for the physical
3 development of the county. The general plan is often called a "constitution" for future development
4 to which all other land use decisions must conform. Accordingly, any decision of the County
5 affecting land use and development, including approving use permits, must be consistent with the
6

7 general plans. See Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176,

9 52. The Project violates the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et

10 seq. because the Project is not consistent with, and does not comply with, mandatory requirements of

11 the Granite Bay Community Plan regarding setbacks and design guidelines.

12 53. Respondent' approval of a Project that is inconsistent with mandatory provisions of the

13 applicable land use plan was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and a failure to proceed

14 according to law.

15 54. The Project site zoning requires a 50-foot setback from Douglas Boulevard and Woodgrove

16 way, and the Granite Bay Community Plan imposes even stricter setback requirements. Douglas
17 Boulevard has been designated a "Scenic Roadway," and the Community Plan provides that "homes
18 and buildings along Scenic Roadways are usually set back from the roadway a distance substantially
19 greater than the minimum dictated by the Zoning Ordinance." Finally, no setback can be granted for
20 the setback from Douglas Boulevard established by the Granite Bay Community Plan.
21 55. With respect to the setback from Woodgrove Way and the western side of the Project site, the
22 variance requested by the Project cannot be granted unless there are "special circumstances
23 applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location and surroundings, and because
24

25 of such circumstances, the strict application of this chapter would deprive the property of privileges

26 enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under the identical zoning classification." The County

27 has previously indicated that no special circumstances are present at the Project site, and nothing has

28 changed since that time. There is no substantial evidence to support a finding of special

circumstances.

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive Relief Granite Bay Preservation Society v. County of Placer, et al., Placer County Superior Court

1 56. The Douglas Corridor Design Guidelines preserve the rural character of Granite Bay, and
2 Respondents' approval of the Project with its urban, industrial gothic design violates these
3 Guidelines.
4 57. The Respondents' administrative approval of a height increase for the Project violates the
5 Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Ordinance allows some latitude for houses of worship in terms of 6

7 height, an increase is allowed only if "all required setbacks are increased by one foot for each one

8 foot of height that the building exceeds the normal height established by the zone." In this case, the

9 Project received approval of the height increase as well as dramatic decreases of the setback

10 requirements.

11 58. Because the Project is inconsistent with the Granite Bay Community Plan and the Zoning

12 Ordinance, Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and must

13 be set aside.

14 59. Respondents' conculsory findings of plan consistency, moreover, are inadequate as a matter

15 of law and are not supported by substantial evidence. The findings consist of simple checkboxes and
16 conclusory statements that the Project is consistent, without any discussion, failing to demonstrate
17 how the Project's large-scale development on a small parcel is consistent with the Community Plan
18 and Zoning Ordinance. Additionally, the County failed to articulate the connection between its
19 findings and the evidence in the record in contravention of the California Supreme Court's decision
20 in Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506.
21 60. Because (1) Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, (2) their decision as
22 arbitrary and capricious, and (3) their decision was not supported by substantial evidence, the
23 County's approval of the Project should be set aside as set forth in the Prayer below.
