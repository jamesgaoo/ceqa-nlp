1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of Riverside ("City" or

5 2. The City violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code

6 21000, et seq., in several respects. Among other things, the City failed to adequately consider the
7 environmental impacts associated with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required

8 environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation. The Project also

9 violates and is inconsistent with the City's Municipal Code, Proposition R, Measure C, the Western
10 Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat and Conservation Plan, and the State Subdivision Map Act.
11 3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals
12 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

Writ Petition Page 3

1 16. The City prepared the MND regarding the Project. The MND was circulated for public

2 comment between March 22 and April 18, 2019. The MND concluded that there would not be any

3 significant impact associated with approval and implementation of the Project. Comment letters were

4 submitted objecting to the MND.

5 17. Comment letters submitted objecting to the MND and the Project prior to the April 18,

6 2019 City Planning Commission hearing raised numerous concerns about the Project's impacts.

7 Comments noted concerns with the Project's impacts on traffic and the appropriateness of the proposed

8 businesses at the Project site. Comments also noted the Project's violations of the City's Zoning Code

9 provisions, including, among others, Section 19.475.040A. relating to development standards for

10 drive-thru businesses.

11 18. Comments also noted concerns about the inadequate notice and information provide for the

12 Project's environmental review. Comments also noted the failure to consult with responsible agencies.

13 19. Comment letters, including comments submitted by Petitioner, also noted concerns about

14 the Project's environmental impacts. Comments noted concerns about impacts on a nearby wildlife

15 corridor and impacts from the proposed 24-hour daily operation of the attendant businesses at the
16 Project site resulting from increased traffic and light pollution. Comments also raised about the

17 Project's inconsistencies with the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation

18 Plan ("MSHCP"). Comments detailed the Project's inconsistencies with the MSHCP including,

19 among other things, the Project's impacts to Proposed Constrained Linkage 7 ("Constrained Linkage 7

20 7") resulting from light pollution, nighttime operation, hazardous materials, and impacted wildlife

21 movement through the corridor provide by Constrained Linkage 7.

22 20. Comment letters, including comments submitted by Petitioner, also noted concerns about

23 the Project's violations of voter-approved Proposition R and Measure C. Proposition R was adopted

24 by voters due concerns that, among other things, the City's "hills, ridgelines, arroyos, and watersheds

25 are being bulldozed." Measure C was adopted by voters to preserve, among other things, Riverside's

26 scenic hills because the City had "failed to implement the minimum requirements of Riverside's 1979

27 initiative, Proposition R." Comments noted that, among other things, the Project's amendment of the

28 Project site's zoning designation to a CG Zone was a violation of the requirements of Proposition R

Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside
Writ Petition Page 4

and Measure C that seek to protect the City's hill. Comments also noted that the proper zoning

2 designation for the Project site is Residential Conservation ("RC*).

3 21. On April 18, 2019, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the Project

4 and MND. Numerous comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the Project and

5 MND, including comments from Petitioner. Comments noted concerns with impacts to views related

6 to elevation and lighting, traffic impacts, public safety, light pollution, and potential impacts to

7 property values in the surrounding community. Comments also noted that, among other things, the

8 Project would have significant impact on the already poor traffic in the surrounding area.

9 22. Comments also noted that the Project was inconsistent with the City's Zoning Code and
10 development standards for drive-thru businesses and the City's General Plan, including the Circulation

11 and Community Mobility Element.

12 23. Comments also noted that the Project would lead to environmental impacts, including
13 among others, impacts to the nearby wildlife corridor under MSHCP. The City acknowledged not

14 knowing the exact conditions of the wildlife corridor, Constrained Linkage 7, but stated that the
15 Project would not change these unknown conditions.

16 24. In discussion, the Planning Commission noted concerns about not having complete and

17 accurate information regarding traffic incidents in the area of the Project. After receiving public

18 testimony, the Planning Commission voted to deny the MND and Project.

19 25. Real Parties in Interest, Eugene Marini and KA Enterprises, subsequently appealed the

20 Planning Commission's denial of the MND and Project to City Council.

21 26. Comment letters submitted objecting to the MND and Project were submitted prior to the

22 June 11, 2019 City Council hearing on the appeal of the Planning Commission's denial. Comments

23 noted several problems with the City's analysis. Comments also noted a fair argument of significant

24 impacts and the City' failure to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").

25 27. Comments noted a failure to analyze the Project's impacts on the wildlife corridor under
26 MSHCP. Comments noted concerns about, among other things, the unstudied impacts on the wildlife

27 corridor resulting from the light, noise, and traffic generated by the Project's 24-hour business

28 operations. In addition, comment letters, including comments submitted by Petitioner, noted that the

Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside Page :
Writ Petition

1 Project is inconsistent with the MSHCP and the approval of the Project would impact the yet to be

2 designated area for Constrained Linkage 7, the only wildlife corridor between Sycamore Canyon Park

3 and Box Springs Reserve. Petitioner also noted concerns about the Project's potentially significant

4 impacts on Constrained Linkage 7 due to light pollution, noise impacts, alcohol sales near the wildlife

5 corridor and parkland, hazardous materials, edge effects, and impacts to views in the surrounding area.

6 28. Comments also noted the failure to analyze and adopt feasible mitigation measures and
7 alternatives.

8 29. Comment letters, including comments submitted by Petitioner, noted concerns about the

9 Project's significant impacts to aesthetics, traffic, public safety, light pollution, noise, and to the

10 surrounding environment.

11 30. Comments also noted the failure to adequately analyze traffic impacts. Comments also

12 noted concerns over the inaccurate and inadequate information relied upon to analyze the Project's

13 traffic impacts for the MND. Among other things, comments noted that the traffic impact study

14 prepared for the MND failed to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project. Comments
15 noted the MND erroneously determined there would be no significant traffic impacts based on
16 inconsistent data for the level of service at the Sycamore Boulevard/Central Avenue intersection.

17 31. Comments also noted the Project's inconsistencies with the City's Zoning Code, including

18 among other things, the Project's violations of the Municipal Code Section 19.475.040A concerning

19 drive-thru businesses, and Section 19.450.030A. concerning off-sale of alcohol.

20 32. Comments also noted concerns about the failure to analyze potential impacts related to the
21 Project's import and export of soil, and offsite grading. Comments also noted an inadequate project

22 description.

23 33. Comments also noted concerns about the Project's violations of the City's Grading Code

24 related to the Project's required zoning designation and excavation and grading on the attendant slope.

25 Comments noted the Project's inconsistencies with the required process under the City's Grading Code

26 for conditional exceptions, and the incompatibility of the Project site's rezoning to a CG designation.

27 //

28 //

Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside Writ Petition Page 6

1 34. Comments also noted the Project's violation of Proposition R and Measure C including

2 violations of, among other things, the required zoning designation for the Project site and permissible

3 use on the attendant slope.

4 35. Comments also noted the failure to adequately analyze noise impacts.

5 36. On June 11, 2019 City Council held a hearing on the appeal of the Planning Commission's

6 denial of approval for the MND and Project. Numerous comments were received, orally and in

7 writing, in opposition to the Project and the MND, including comment from Petitioner's

8 representatives. Comments received at the hearing noted concerns with the inadequate analysis of the

9 Project's traffic impacts, and concerns over the Project's impacts to views, light pollution, and public

10 safety related to the introduction of alcohol sales in the area.

11 37. Comments also noted concerns about the Project's impacts to the nearby wildlife corridor

12 under the MSHCP.

13 38. Comments at the hearing noted that due to the Project's potential for significant impacts an

14 EIR was required.

15 39. After receiving testimony, despite these numerous concerns the City Council voted to

16 uphold the appeal of the Planning Commission's decision, and approve the MND and Project.
17 Approvals included the approval of the Zoning Code Map Amendment P18-0028, Tentative Parcel

18 Map P18-0034 ("TPM 37591"), CUP P18-0031, CUP P18-0032, and Design Review P18-0033.

19 40. A Notice of Determination was filed by the City on June 12, 2019.

20 41. On July 2, 2019, the City Council subsequently enacted the zoning ordinance designating
21 the Project site under the CG Zone.

22 42. Comments submitted by, among other, Petitioner, opposed the enactment of the July 2,

23 2019 zoning ordinance for the Project site. Comments noted concerns over the Project and ordinance's

24 violations of Proposition R and Measure C relating to, among other things, the City's failure to

25 consider and release for public review the average natural slope of the Project site in furtherance of the

26 both voter-initiative's intended protection of Riverside's hills and natural environment.
