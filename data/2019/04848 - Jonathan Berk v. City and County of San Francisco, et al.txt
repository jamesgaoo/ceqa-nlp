1 INTRODUCTION

2 With this lawsuit, Petitioner JONATHAN BERK (Petitioner), a San Francisco resident,
3 challenges the September 25 and December 12, 2018 final actions by Respondents CITY AND

4 COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, and

5 SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING DEPARTMENT (collectively "the City") certifying : final

6 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and approving the "Central SoMa Plan" (Plan), a set of

7 amendments to the City and County of San Francisco General Plan, Zoning Code, and

8 Administrative Code authorizing future development in a 230-acre area bounded by Market

9 Street, Townsend Street, 2nd Street, and 6th Street.

10 The Plan essentially creates a second Financial District in an economically and culturally

11 diverse - but rapidly gentrifying neighborhood of the City. The Plan would generate 63,600
12 new jobs, mostly in the office/tech/business services sector, but only 14,500 new housing units.
13 It would triple the resident population of the area from a current population of 12,000 to
14 37,5003 - an increase of 25,500 additional residents, while more than doubling employment in
15 the area from current level of 45,600 jobs to 109,200. In other words, the Plan creates 50,000
16 more jobs than housing units, exacerbating the City's already critical jobs-housing imbalance,
17 resulting in still higher housing prices, more displacement, and more gentrification.

18 The Plan will also cause a large number of serious and substantial adverse impacts on
19 traffic and air quality, the inevitable consequence of introducing a massive new population of
20 commuting workers and new residents into a dense, tightly congested area already suffering
21 from nearly constant workday traffic jams that have only worsened with the proliferation of
22 ride-sharing platforms like Uber and Lyft an impact that the City's EIR absolutely failed to
23 consider. Meanwhile, air pollutant emissions from all these new vehicle trips, in particular toxic
24 diesel exhaust, will only further degrade air quality in a neighborhood whose residents already
25 experience ambient air pollution-related health risks far exceeding levels deemed safe buy the
26 State of California. On top of this, Plan will also cause significant impacts on a variety of other
27 aspects of the public realm, including visual resources, parking, public transit, public services,

1 pedestrian safety, parks, and even biological resources, none of which were adequately disclosed,
2 evaluated, or mitigated in the EIR.

3 Petitioner accordingly contends the City's legislative and administrative actions approving
4 the Plan violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resource Code
5 Section 21000 et seq. As certified by the City, the Project's EIR fails to identify, evaluate, and/or

6 require mitigation for all direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts the Project will
7 foreseeably cause. As a result, there is no substantial evidence in the administrative record of the

8 City's actions to support the City's findings that nearly all the Project's environmental impacts
9 will be less than significant after mitigation. Instead, substantial evidence in the record shows the
10 Project will have several significant unmitigated environmental effects that the EIR either failed
11 to identify, failed to evaluate adequately, or failed to mitigate where feasible. Petitioner further
12 that the City's approval actions violated the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code
13 section 65000 et seq., because the Plan is substantially and materially inconsistent and
14 incompatible with the programs, goals, and policies of the City's General Plan.
15 Petitioner therefore seeks a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
16 sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168 and/or 21168.5,
17 commanding the City to set aside its certification of the EIR and approval of the Plan.
18 a Petitioner further seeks a stay of the effect of the approvals during the pendency of these
19 proceedings. Finally, Petitioner seeks an award of costs and attorneys fees under Code of Civil
20 Procedure section 1021.5, together with any other relief the Court deems necessary and proper.

12 Francisco Superior Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 395.

13 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
14 Project Description

15 10. Situated in Supervisorial District 6, the Plan area consists of the rectangle
16 bounded by Market Street, Townsend Street, 2nd Street, and 6th Street in the South of Market

17 neighborhood. It comprises roughly 230 acres and 17 city blocks. According to City, the Plan
18 would enable the development of up to 32,500 new jobs, but only 8,550 housing units.
19 11. The Plan includes street network changes, including specific designs within, and
20 1n some cases beyond, the Plan Area for the following streets: Howard, Folsom, Harrison,

21 Bryant, Brannan, Third, and Fourth Streets. In addition, open space improvements would occur
22 within and outside of the Plan Area.

23 12. As described in the City's Notice of Determination, the Plan addresses a wide
24 range of topics that include land use; transportation infrastructure; parks, open space, and
25 recreation facilities; ecological sustainability; historic preservation; urban design and urban form;
26 and financial programs and implementation mechanisms to fund public improvements. It: (1)
27 removes land use restrictions to support a greater mix of uses than currently exist, with :
28 particular emphasis on new high-rise office uses; (2) amending height and bulk districts to allow

t for significantly taller buildings; (3) modifying the system of streets and circulation within and
2 adjacent to the Plan; and (4) creating new and/or improving existing open spaces. The Plan also
3 includes financial programs to support its public improvements through the implementation of

4 new fees, in addition to taxes or assessments on subsequent development projects. Finally, the

5 Plan purports to include the creation of a Housing Sustainability District within the Plan Area in

6 accordance with Assembly Bill 73.

7 Procedural History

8 13. The City initiated the planning process in 2011 and the CEQA process in 2013. It
9 released an initial study in February 2014 and released a proposed Plan and draft EIR for public

10 review and comment in August and December 2016 respectively.
11 14. Various agencies, organizations, and individuals, including Petitioner, submitted

12 comments on the draft EIR prior to the close of the public comment period, arguing that the
13 draft EIR had failed to adequately identify, evaluate, and mitigate all potentially significant
14 impacts on the environment, and that the Plan was inconsistent with applicable provisions of
15 the City's General Plan.
16 15. In March 2018, the City released a Response to Comment document (RTC)

17 which, together with the draft EIR, comprises the final EIR for the Plan.

18 16. On May 10, 2018 the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on the

19 final EIR and the Plan. Various individuals and organizations, including Petitioner, submitted

20 additional written and/or oral objections to the proposed certification of the Final EIR and

21 approval of the Project.

22 17. After closing the public hearing, the Planning Commission certified the final EIR,
23 adopted findings under CEQA regarding environmental impacts, mitigation measures, project
24 alternatives, adopted a statement of overriding considerations, and adopted a mitigation
25 monitoring and reporting program. The Planning Commission further voted to recommend that
26 the Board of Supervisors approve the legislative actions comprising the Pan.
27 18. Specifically, the approval actions taken by the City's Planning Commission
28 included the following Resolutions:

7 19. On June 8, 2018 two organizations of which Petitioner was a member, Central
8 SoMa Neighbors and SFBlu, appealed the Planning Commission's actions to the Board of
9 Supervisors.
10 20. On September 25, 2018 the Board of Supervisors held a' public hearing on the
11 appeals. Again, various individuals and organizations, including Petitioner, submitted oral
12 and/or written objections to the Plan and final EIR, including further evidence and testimony
13 that the EIR had failed to adequately identify, evaluate, and mitigate all potentially significant
14 impacts on the environment, and that the Plan was inconsistent with applicable provisions of
15 the City's General Plan.
16 21. After closing the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted to deny the
17 appeals and to uphold and affirm the Planning Commission's certification of the final EIR and
18 its findings under CEQA.
19 22. On October 2018, the City's Transportation Authority released a report titled
20 TNCs and Congestion ("Report") that addressed city-wide traffic congestion and roadway system
21 impacts caused by the proliferation of transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Uber
22 and Lyft. The report documented how TNCs are responsible for over half of the traffic delays
23 in San Francisco, with District 6 (which includes the Central SoMa planning area) the most
24 severely impacted. Specifically, the report showed how these services have added nearly 6,000
25 hours of daily delay in District 6 alone, accounting for 45 percent of the total increased delay
26 between 2010 and 2016, and have also increased vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in District 6 by
27 41 percent in this same period.

- 23. On October 23, 2018 Petitioner sent a letter to the Board of Supervisors and

2 Planning Report explaining that in light of statements in the final EIR that TNC impacts were

3 "too speculative for evaluation" due to insufficient data from which to draw conclusions, the

4 Report constituted "significant new information" requiring either recirculation of a revised draft

5 EIR or release of a subsequent EIR under CEQA.

6 24. On November 8, 2018 the Planning Department responded to Petitioner's letter

7 arguing that the Report did not constitute "significant new information" triggering these duties

8 under CEQA.

9 25. On November 12, 2018 the Board's Land Use and Transportation Committee

10 met and voted to recommend approval of the Plan to the full Board of Supervisors.
11 26. On November 26, 2018 Petitioner sent another letter to the Board of Supervisors

12 and Planning Department responding to the Planning Department's November 8 letter.

13 Petitioner's letter attached written testimony from a credentialed traffic engineer showing how

14 the Report directly contradicted the final EIR's conclusions that TNC trips from future

15 employees of office uses authorized under the Plan would not cause a significant increase in
16 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and showed how the Plan would have significant unmitigated

17 impacts related to increase TNC usage that were not disclosed in the final EIR.

18 27. On November 27 and December 4, 2018 the Board of Supervisors met and voted

19 to adopt the Plan in final form. Specifically, the legislative actions comprising approval of the

20 Plan include:

21 Board File No. 180490: General Plan Amendments
22 Board File No. 180184: Planning Code & Administrative Code Amendments

23 Board File No. 180185: Zoning Map Amendments

1 28. Petitioner is informed and believes that the Mayor signed the various pieces of
2 legislation between December 4 and December 12, 2018.

3 29. The City filed and posted a Notice of Determination in accordance with Pubic

4 Resources Code section 21152 on December 17, 2018.

5 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

6 (Violations of CEQA - Inadequate EIR)
7 30. Petitioner here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
8 31. At all times relevant to this action the City was the "Lead Agency" responsible for
9 the review and approval of the Project under Public Resources Code section 21067.
10 32. CEQA requires public agencies to first identify the environmental effects of its
11 project or program, and then to mitigate those adverse environmental effects through the
12 imposition of feasible mitigation measures or the analysis and selection of feasible alternatives.
13 Public Resources Code, § 21002. CEQA requires a lead agency to establish that either: (1)
14 impacts will not have a significant effect on the environment or (2) the agency has adopted
15 findings that all significant environmental effects have been avoided or mitigated to the extent
16 feasible, and any remaining effects found to be unavoidable are acceptable due to specific
17 overriding economic, social, technological, or other benefits.

18 33. An EIR must include a finite, stable, accurate and meaningful project description.
19 14 C.C.R., § 15124. An EIR must include an accurate description of the environmental
20 "baseline," meaning physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project as they
21 existed at the time the notice of preparation is published, with particular focus on the regional
22 setting. 14 C.C.R., § 15125. An EIR must then identify and evaluate the direct, indirect, and
23 cumulative environmental impacts of all phases of a project. 14 C.C.R., § 15126. The discussion
24 must include relevant specifics of the area, the resources involved, physical changes, alterations
25 to ecological systems, and changes induced in population distribution, population concentration,
26 the human use of the land (including commercial and residential development), health and safety
27 problems caused by the physical changes, and other aspects of the resource base such as water,

1 historical resources, scenic quality, transportation infrastructure, and public services. 14 C.C.R., §
2 15126.2.

3 34. An EIR must also describe and evaluate feasible measures for minimizing or

4 avoiding a project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment. Public
5 Resources Code, § 21100(b)(3); 14 C.C.R., S 15126.4. A lead agency may not improperly defer

6 the formulation of mitigation measures until a future time. 14 C.C.R., § 15126.4.

7 35. An EIR must identify all significant effects on the environment caused by a

8 proposed project that cannot be avoided. Public Resources Code, § 21100(b)(2)(A). An EIR
9 must also provide information in the record to justify rejecting mitigation measures as infeasible

10 based on economic, social, or housing reasons. 14 C.C.R., § 15131(c).
11 36. An EIR must describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the
12 location of the project, that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but
13 would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and must
14 evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives. 14 C.C.R., § 15126.6. An EIR must also
15 include sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis,

16 and comparison with the proposed project. Id.
17 37. An EIR is required to contain a statement briefly indicating the reasons for

18 determining that various effects on the environment were not significant and consequently were

19 not discussed in detail in the EIR. Public Resources Code, § 21100(c).

20 38. A lead agency must provide good faith, reasoned analysis in response to
21 comments it receives on a draft EIR. 14 C.C.R., § 15088(c). The Final EIR must address
22 recommendations and objections raised in comments in detail, giving reasons why they were not

23 accepted. Id. Specific responses are required to comments raising specific questions about
24 significant issues.

25 39. A lead agency may not approve a project for which an EIR identifies a significant
26 environmental impact unless the impact has been mitigated or avoided by changes in the
27 project, or unless the agency specifically finds that overriding benefits outweigh the significant
28 effects on the environment. Public Resources Code, $ 21081.

1 Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Significant Impacts

2 40. As certified by the City, the Plan's EIR fails to evaluate adequately all of the Plan's
3 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, including impacts on: aesthetics, agricultural

4 resources, air quality, human health, global climate change, biological resources, geology and
5 soils, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning,
6 mineral resources, noise, population and housing, public services, recreation, transportation and
7 traffic, utilities, and urban decay. There accordingly is no substantial evidence to support the

8 City's factual findings regarding the significance of the Plan's impacts on the environment.
9 41. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
10 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not
11 supported by the evidence.
12 Failure To Require All Feasible Mitigation Measures

13 42. An EIR must describe, evaluate, and require feasible measures for minimizing or
14 avoiding a project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment. 14 C.C.R. §
15 15126.4. If an agency approves a project based on a finding that one or more mitigation
16 measures are infeasible, the agency must "describe the specific reasons for rejecting identified
17 mitigation measures." 14 C.C.R. § 15091(c).

18 43. The EIR for this Project fails to describe, evaluate, and require all reasonable,

19 feasible mitigation measures for the Plan's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts, including
20 impacts on aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, human health, global climate change,
21 biological resources, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water
22 quality, land use and planning, mineral resources, noise, population and housing, public services,
23 recreation, transportation and traffic, utilities, and urban decay.
24 44. The EIR further failed to adequately consider feasible mitigation measures that
25 members of the public commenting on the draft EIR had brought to the City's attention, and
26 the City failed to describe the specific reasons for rejecting such identified mitigation measures.
27 45. There accordingly is no substantial evidence to support the City's factual findings
28 regarding the significance of the Plan's impacts on the environment after mitigation.

1 46. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by

2 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not

3 supported by the evidence.
4 Failure To Respond Adequately To Comments On Draft EIR

5 47. A lead agency must evaluate comments on environmental issues received from

6 persons who reviewed a Draft EIR during the public comment period, and must prepare a
7 written response. 14 C.C.R. § 15088(a). The written response must describe the disposition of

8 significant environmental issues raised. Id. at subd. (c). In particular, the major environmental
9 issues raised when the lead agency's position is at variance with recommendations and
10 objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail, giving reasons why specific
11 comments and suggestions were not accepted. Id. There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in

12 response; conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. Id.
13 48. The City here failed to provide detailed, written, good faith, reasoned analysis in
14 response to comments received on the draft EIR during the public comment period from
15 individuals and responsible agencies, and failed to give adequate reasons why specific comments
16 and suggestions were not accepted. Instead, the City merely gave conclusory statements
17 unsupported by factual information.
18 49. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by

19 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.
20 Unsupported Findings And Statement Of Overriding Considerations
21 50. Under Public Resources Code section 21081(b), an agency may not approve

22 project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it finds, based on substantial evidence, that

23 specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project
24 outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
25 51. The EIR for the Plan identifies impacts as unavoidably significant, but the City
26 found these impacts acceptable and adopted a statement of overriding considerations.

1 52. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support the statement of
2 overriding considerations, and the statement itself is inadequately supported by findings. There

3 is substantial evidence in the record that disproves the statement.

4 53. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by
5 failing to proceed in the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not
6 supported by the evidence.

7 SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

8 (Violations of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate Revised Draft EIR)
9 54. Petitioner here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
10 55. CEQA required a lead agency to recirculate a revised draft EIR for public review
11 and comment whenever "significant new information is added to the EIR after public notice is
12 given of the availability of the draft EIR for public review under Section 15087 but before

13 certification [of the Final EIR]." 14 C.R.R. § 15088.5.
14 56. New information added to an EIR is significant if it shows any of the following:
15 (1) new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from new

16 mitigation measure proposed to be implemented; (2) a substantial increase in the severity of an
17 environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the
18 a impact to a level of insignificance; (3) a feasible project alternative or mitigation measure
19 considerably different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the environmental
20 impacts of the project, but the project's proponents decline to adopt it; or (4) the draft EIR was
21 SO fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public
22 review and comment were precluded. 14 C.C.R. § 1088.5(a); Mountain Lion Coalition V. Fish and

23 Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.

24 57. The Transportation Agency's October 2018 Report TNCs and Congestion shows

25 that the Plan will have new significant impacts on traffic that were not analyzed in the draft or
26 final EIR, that there will be an increase in severity of traffic impacts over the level analyzed in
27 the EIR, and that the EIR is so fundamentally and basically inadequate conclusory in nature that
28 meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

San Francisco, CA v. 94102 Jonathan Berk v. City & County of San Francisco, et al. (415) 369-9400 Case No.
12 -

1 58. The City declined to recitculate a revised draft a EIR notwithstanding the new
2 information contained in the Transportation Agency's Report.

3 59. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the

4 manner required by CEQA.

5 THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF

6 (Violations of CEQA - Failure to Prepare Subsequent EIR)

7 60. Petitioner here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

8 61. Public Resources Code section 21166 requires a lead agency to prepare a
9 subsequent or supplemental EIR where one or more of the following events occurs: (a)
10 substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the
11 environmental impact report; (b) substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances

12 under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the
13 environmental impact report; or (c) new information, which was not known and could not have
14 been known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes
15 available. See also CEQA Guidelines, 15 C.C.R. S$ 15162, 15163.
16 62. The administrative record contains new information that was not known and

17 could not have been known at the time the EIR was certified showing that the Project will have

18 new and/or more significant impacts in areas including but not limited to cumulative traffic and

19 circulation in the Plan area. This new information had become available prior to the City's

20 actions approving the Project.
21 63. There is substantial evidence in the administrative record before the City that
22 substantial changes have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the Plan is

23 being undertaken, including but not limited to circumstances pertaining to cumulative traffic
24 volumes and in the Plan area, which will require major revisions to the EIR.
25 64. The City declined to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR for the Plan

26 notwithstanding the avalability of the new information. The City therefore violated a mandatory
27 duty under Public Resources Code Section 21166 and sections 15162 and 15163 of the CEQA
28 Guidelines to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR before approving the Project.

13 -

1 65. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the

2 manner required by CEQA.
FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF
4 (Violations of State Planning & Zoning Law)
5 66. Petitioner here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
6 67. Under the State Planning and Zoning law, Government Code SS 65000 et seq., a
7 local public agency may approve land use entitlements only if the entitled development is
8 consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives contained in a valid, current, internally

9 consistent General Plan, including any applicable subsidiary plans.
10 68. The Plan is inconsistent with Policy 1.3 of the City's General Plan, which requires
11 the City to give priority to public transit and other alternatives to the private automobile as the
12 means of meeting the City's transportation needs, particularly those of commuters.
13 69. The Plan is also inconsistent with Policy 3.5 of the City's General Plan, which
14 requires the City to ensure that growth will not outpace improvements to transit of the
15 circulation system. The EIR itself acknowledges the Plan would "result in substantial delays to a

16 number of MUNI routes serving the area," and that "Development under the Plan .. would
17 result in a substantial increase in transit demand that would not be accommodated by local transit
18 capacity, and would cause a substantial increase in delays resulting in adverse impacts on local
19 and regional transit routes."

20 70. The Plan is also inconsistent with the Urban Design Element of the General Plan,
21 which requires the City to "Ir]elate the height of buildings to important attributes of the city
22 pattern and to the height and character of existing development," and to "[r]elate the bulk of
23 buildings to the prevailing scale of development to avoid an overwhelming or dominating
24 appearance in new construction."

25 71. The Plan is also inconsistent with the Recreation and Open Space Element of the
26 General Plan, which requires the City to "[p]reserve sunlight in public open spaces. The EIR
27 itself acknowledges that the Plan will create new shadow on several parks under the jurisdiction

14 -

1 of the Recreation and Park Department, including South Park, Victoria Manalo Draves Park and

2 Gene Friend Recreation Center, as well as several public open spaces.
3 72. The Plan is also inconsistent with the General Plan's Objective 9, which requires

4 the City to "[r]educe transportation-related noise," and Policy 11.1, which requires the City to

5 "[d]iscourage new uses in areas in which the noise level exceeds the noise compatibility guidelines

6 for that use." The EIR acknowledges that "Development under the Plan, including the proposed

7 street network changes, would generate noise that would result in exposure of persons to noise in

8 excess of standards in the San Francisco General Plan or Noise Ordinance (Article 29 of the
9 Police Code), and would result in a substantial permanent increase in ambient noise above

10 existing levels."

11 73. The Plan is also inconsistent with the Western SoMa Plan, which requires the City
12 to "[p]rohibit housing outside of designated Residential Enclave Districts (RED) south of

13 Harrison Street."

14 74. The Plan is also inconsistent and incompatible with other governing goals, policies,
15 and programs of the City's General Plan, including Policy SUS-6.1 (Greenhouse Gas Reduction
16 Efforts), Policy SUS-6.2 (Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Climate Action Plan) and its
17 component Actions, and Policy SUS-6.3 (Greenhouse Gas Emissions and CEQA). The Project is

18 also inconsistent with the goals and policies of the City's Climate Action Plan incorporated by

19 reference into the General Plan.

20 75. Despite these inconsistencies, the City approved the Plan based on erroncous
21 findings that the Plan was fully consistent with the General Plan and applicable subsidiary plans.
22 76. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the Project
23 notwithstanding these General Plan inconsistencies and incompatibilities, and by adopting
24 findings of consistency that are clearly erroneous and not supported by substantial evidence.
25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 77. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Public Resources Code
27 section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Petitioner in his individual capacity
28 and/or as a member of an organization objected to the City's approval of the Plan orally or in

15 -

1 writing during the public comment period provided by CEQA, and/or prior to the close of the

2 public hearing on the Plan before the issuance of the Notice of Determination. Petitioner,

3 and/or other agencies, organizations and individuals raised or affirmed each of the legal

4 deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the public comment provided by
5 CEQA, or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the

6 Notice of Determination.

7 78. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by

8 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 in serving notice of
9 the commencement of this action January 16, 2019.
10 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

11 79. Petitioner declares that he has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
12 ordinary course of law for the improper action of the City.

13 NEWLY PRODUCED EVIDENCE

14 80. In accord with Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(e), Petitioner may, prior to
15 Of during the hearing on this petition, offer additional relevant evidence that could not, in the
16 exercise of reasonable diligence, have been produced at the administrative hearing.
17 ATTORNEYS FEES

18 81. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided under Code of Civil

19 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds that a significant
20 benefit has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the
21 necessity and burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

22 PRAYER

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for entry of judgment as follows:
24 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City:

25 (a) to set aside its final actions taken on or around September 25, 2018 certifying a

26 final EIR for the Project under CFQA;
27 (b) to set aside its various actions taken on or before December 12, 2019 approving

28 the Plan, specifically including:
