VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 INTRODUCTION

2

3 1. In this petition, petitioners challenge the failure of respondent Department of Water
Resources ("DWR") to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA,"

5 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.) when it certified its Final Environmental Impact Report
("FEIR") and rendered final approval as state lead agency of the project ("contract])
extension" or "project"). Petitioners seek to set aside DWR's certification of the Final EIR

8 for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project on November 13, 2018, and final project
approval recorded in DWR's Notice of Determination filed in the State Clearinghouse on
December 11, 2018.
10

11 2. The FEIR challenged in this action is designated as the Water Supply Contract
12 Extension Project Final Environmental Impact Report. This action challenges DWR's
13| compliance with state law in its EIR certification and the final project decision as CEQA
14 lead agency recorded in its Notice of Determination. Subject to legal requirements and
15 limitations, including the Burns-Porter Act (Wat. Code, § 12930, et seq.), passed by the
16 Legislature in 1959 and approved by California's voters in 1960, DWR operates and
17 maintains California's State Water Resources Development System, more commonly

18 known as the State Water Project ("SWP"). The SWP's storage and conveyance facilities

19 provide water meant to serve the people and resources of California through deliveries to

20 29 local state water contractors spanning the state from Plumas County in the north to San

21 Diego County in the south. Without contract amendments, the 75-year terms of the long-

22 term water supply contracts DWR entered into with these local contractors during 1960s
the are scheduled to expire between 2035 and 2042. In the EIR certification and final
23 project decision challenged in this petition, DWR seeks to extend the terms of the SWP
24 contracts through December 31, 2085 and make major changes in their governing
25 provisions without complying with CEQA.
26

27 3. Although DWR's proposed project seeks to extend the length of SWP water supply
28| contracts for up to a half-century beyond their originally scheduled expiration dates, the

2
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

contract "extension" project also would change far more than simply extending their length.

2 Instead, the project also includes other transformative changes that rank among the most
3| significant and consequential amendments proposed during nearly six decades of SWP
history. As detailed further below, the contract amendments included in the project would

5 remove existing SWP contract limitations on the facilities eligible for revenue bonds,
including those issued under the Central Valley Project Act (Wat. Code, § 11000, et seq).
Without the contract amendments proposed in the project, limitations on covered facilities

8 in the current State Water Project contracts would prevent an expansion of revenue bond
debt to cover new facilities not in existence prior to January 1, 1987, including DWR's

10 multi-billion dollar Delta tunnels project. (See, e.g., articles 1(cc) and 1(hh) of State Water
Project contracts). DWR's Delta tunnels project, earlier referenced as the Bay-Delta
11 Conservation Plan (BDCP), is known in its most recent iteration as California WaterFix.
12

13 4. DWR's EIR and project decision challenged in this action are founded on the faulty
14 premise that the contract extension amendments are "separate" and "independent" from
15 California WaterFix, and of independent utility to address problems of debt compression
16 facing the State Water Project. Those premises are fundamentally false. In proceeding to
17 final certification and approval of the project, DWR avoided major criticisms on these

18 issues made in public comments on the 2016 Draft EIR, and developed significantly further

19 in commentary and California legislative proceedings on DWR's proposed contract

20 extension during 2018. Comments and testimony, including a concession of DWR Director

21 Karla Nemeth at a September 11, 2018 hearing of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee,

22 confirmed commenters' concerns that the contract extension project will facilitate the

23 California WaterFix Project, and potentially other risky infrastructure projects proposed by

24 major SWP contractors despite public opposition, by removing obstacles that could
otherwise prevent debt coverage for revenue bonds designed to cover financing of the
25 proposed Delta tunnels. Moreover, commentary and proceedings during 2018 thoroughly
26 discredited DWR's "debt compression" rationale for the project. Far from responsibly
27 addressing debt compression problems, as could already be addressed under the Evergreen
28

3
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 Cause in article 4 of the existing State Water Project, DWR's project seeks to bundle major

2 new risks into the SWP by removing existing timing and facilities limitations.

3

4 5. The contract extension project would remove timing obstacles to revenue bond

5 financing, and thereby help facilitate implementation of, and billions in new debt for, the

6 Delta tunnels project, one of the most costly and risky water infrastructure projects in

7 California's history. The California WaterFix project proposes construction of two massive
tunnels to facilitate the diversion of large additional quantities of freshwater from the San
Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary for export south of the Delta. Despite monumental cost and
complexity, California WaterFix creates no new water supply. It would entrench and likely
10 compound reliance on unsustainable water exports, to the detriment of communities and
11 water users within and upstream of the Delta. California WaterFix would divert resources
12 needed for investments in long-term water reliability, water quality, reuse, storage, drought
13 and flood protection, and ecosystem improvements. It would also frustrate efforts in the
14 northern Sacramento Valley and elsewhere to fulfill legislative duties on regional self-
15 reliance and the sustainable management of groundwater. If built and approved for
16 operation, California WaterFix's new intakes in the northern Delta may divert up to a third

17 of the flow of the Sacramento River, increasing the potential for reverse flows on the

18 Sacramento River, harmful diversions of water out of the Sacramento Valley and the Delta,

19 and further degradation of water quality.

20

21 6. In certifying the FEIR and approving the contract extension project, DWR failed to

22 heed major criticism from the petitioner organizations, counties, communities, public

23 agencies, and expert reviewers discrediting the project's environmental, economic and legal
foundations. DWR also failed to heed major project criticisms made during 2018, including
24 those presented by the petitioners, identifying still-unaddressed changed circumstancesl
25 since project comments closed in October 2016 that necessitated circulation and review of :
26 new EIR. These criticisms also underscored the clear need under CEQA to avoid
27 piecemealing, and to provide a still-unmade integrated assessment of the project in
28 connection with DWR's separate set of proposed Water Supply Contract Amendments (on

4
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ETAL.

which a 2018 Draft EIR is presently pending), as well as the WaterFix project itself. In
2| rushing forward to final approval, DWR flouted commenters' concerns that DWR had

3 failed to meet the Water Code's prerequisites to final approval of the proposed contract
4| extension. DWR avoided analysis and mitigation of major project impacts, and failed to

5 analyze alternatives that would address debt compression problems without bundling major

6 new risks into the State Water Project. DWR also failed in its historic opportunity to
address systemic problems in the SWP prior to extending the long-term contracts, such as

8 addressing "paper water" problems with SWP Table A deliveries and the failure to protect
Delta resources.

10 7. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure sections

11 1085, 1094.5, or both, directing DWR to vacate its EIR certification and approval of the
12 project, and to revise its findings to conform with the law.

13 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14
8.
15 Petitioner Planning and Conservation League (PCL), a nonprofit advocacy

16 organization whose headquarters in is Sacramento, California, is empowered to protect and

17 restore California's natural environment and to promote and defend the public health and
safety of the people of California, through legislative, administrative, and judicial action.
18 PCL was founded in 1965 and since then has advocated in all branches of Californial
19 government for a body of laws that remains at the forefront of environmental policy in the
20| United States. PCL's staff undertakes extensive research and works closely with legislators
21 to promote laws that protect and improve California's environment.
22

23 9. One of the PCL's 's earliest accomplishments was the enactment in 1970 of the
24 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), which PCL helped draft and has
25 continually supported over the years, and which lies at the heart of this action. As a party

26 and an amicus curiae, PCL-in behalf of its twenty-seven institutional members and

27 thousands of individual members--has contributed to some of the leading cases interpreting

28 CEQA's provisions. PCL has also submitted detailed comments addressing environmental

5
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 review issues in numerous proceedings before public agencies, including those culminating

2 in the final agency decisions challenged here. Beyond agency proceedings and the
3 courtroom, PCL has published and updated The Community Guide to CEQA and has

4 sponsored CEQA workshops throughout the state. These workshops advise interested

5 individuals, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and locally elected and

6 appointed officials about CEQA's two-fold purpose of environmental protection and
informed self-government. PCL members reside and own property throughout California as

8 well as those areas to be served by the Project, and use the waters and lands affected by the
proposed Project.

10 10. PCL was one of the prevailing petitioners in Planning and Conservation League V.
11 Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, which set aside the 1995
12 environmental review of the Monterey Amendments prepared by the wrong lead agency,
13 Central Coast Water Authority (CCWA), rather than DWR. The Court found also found
14 that the EIR's "no project" assessment and project alternatives analysis failed to properly
15 analyze the consequences of implementing the State Water Project contracts' long-term
16 shortage provision, article 18(b), prior to its elimination in the Monterey Amendments. In

17 its ruling requiring DWR as lead agency to prepare a new EIR for the Monterey

18 Amendments, this Court described the EIR as the "heart and soul of CEQA" and observed

19 that "CEQA compels process. It is a meticulous process designed to ensure that the

20| environment is protected." (Id. at 911.)

21
11.
22 Petitioner California Water Impact Network ("C-WIN") is a California non-profit

23 public benefit organization with its principal place of business in Santa Barbara, California.
C-WIN's organization purpose is the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife
24 resources, scenery, water quality, recreational opportunities, agricultural uses, and other
25 natural environmental resources and uses of the rivers and streams of California, including|
26 the Bay-Delta, its watershed and its underlying groundwater resources. C-WIN has
27 members who reside in, use, and enjoy the Bay-Delta and inhabit and use its watershed.
28

6
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 They use the rivers of the Central Valley and the Bay-Delta for nature study, recreation,

2 and aesthetic enjoyment.

3
12. Petitioner AquAlliance ("AquAlliance"), whose headquarters is in Chico, California,

5 is a California public benefit corporation. Its mission is to defend northern California
waters and the ecosystems these waters support and to challenge threats to the hydrologic
health of the Sacramento River watershed. This includes escalating attempts to divert and

8 withdraw more water from the hydrologic region. AquAlliance's members include farmers,
scientists, businesses, educators, and residents all of whom have significant financial,

10 recreational, scientific, aesthetic, educational, and conservation interests in the aquatic and
terrestrial environments that rely on waters of the Sacramento River Watershed and Bay-
11 Delta estuary. This hydrologic system provides water for orchards, homes, gardens,
12 businesses, wetlands, streams, rivers, terrestrial habitat, and myriad species, which in turn
13 allows AquAlliance members to live, fish, hunt, cycle, photograph, camp, swim, and invest
14 in northern California.

15

16 13. Petitioner California Sportfishing Protection Alliance ("CSPA") is a California non-
17 profit public benefit organization established in 1983 with its principal place of business in
18 Stockton, California. CSPA's organizational purpose is the protection, preservation, and

19 enhancement of the public trust, fisheries and associated aquatic and riparian ecosystems of

20 California's waterways. This mission is implemented through active participation in federal,

21 state and local agency processes, education and organization of the fishing community,|

22 restoration efforts, and vigorous enforcement of environmental laws enacted to protect

23 fisheries, habitat and water quality. Members of CSPA reside along the Central Valley|
watershed and in the Bay-Delta where they view, enjoy, and routinely use the ecosystem
24 for boating, fishing, and wildlife viewing. CSPA's members derive significant and ongoing
25 use and enjoyment from the aesthetic, recreational, and conservation benefits of
26 California's rivers.

VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 14. Respondent and Defendant California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") is a

2 California public agency, established by the California Legislature in 1956. Under state

3 law, DWR is principally responsible for operation and management of the State Water
Project. DWR served as the CEQA lead agency for the project. DWR issued the November

5 13, 2018 EIR certification and December 11, 2018 Notice of Determination recording its

6 approval of the project, both challenged in this action. The Final EIR prepared by DWR as
CEQA lead agency must also serve as a legally adequate decision-making document for

8 any discretionary determinations of responsible and trustee agencies subject to the
requirements of CEQA.
9
10 15. Real Party in Interest State Water Contractors, Inc. (SWC) is a non-profit association
11 of 27 California public agencies, organized under California law, that purchase water under
12 contract from the State Water Project. Member agencies of SWC include each of the state
13| water contractor agencies that were signatories to the Agreement in Principle (AIP) that
14 formed the basis for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project.
15

16 16. Does H through 50, inclusive, may have an interest or claim to the project whose
17| specific details are not presently known to the petitioners and plaintiffs. Their true names

18 and capacities, whether in individual, corporate, associate, governmental, or other

19 designations, are not presently known to plaintiffs and petitioners, and are therefore

20 referenced here by fictitious names. Should their true names and capacities later be

21 ascertained, petitioners and plaintiffs will seek to amend this petition and complaint to

22 identify their true names and capacities.

23 17. DWR's December 11, 2018 Notice of Determination for the project did not identify
24 any real parties in interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, and
25 petitioners are not aware of any parties that meet the statutory definition of real parties in
26 interest. Nonetheless, because SWC's membership includes the signatories to the AIP
27| relating to the review of DWR's project, and without conceding that SWC or any of its
28

8
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

members meet the statutory definition of real parties in interest, petitioners have in an
2 abundance of caution named SWC herein as a real party in interest.

18. This civil action is brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, and 1094.5; and

5 CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.

7 19. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394 and 395, venue for this action

8 is appropriate in Sacramento County Superior Court. DWR is a state agency whose
principal office is located in the City of Sacramento, within Sacramento County.
Sacramento County is the most convenient venue for this action, which addresses matters
10 of statewide import. The affirmative acts of DWR recorded in its notice of determination
11 resulted in wrongs that were felt, at least in large part, in Sacramento County.
12

13 20. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written
14| comments during several stages of the project approval and EIR processes preceding
15 DWR's certification of the EIR and approval of the project. All issues raised in this petition
16 and complaint were raised by petitioners, or by other public entities, members of the public,

17 or both, prior to DWR's final decision on the project recorded in the Notice of

18 Determination.

19

20 20. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior

21 service of a notice upon DWR indicating their intent to file this petition.

22
21. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
23 Civil Procedure section 388 by serving a copy of this petition on the Attorney General. 24 Petitioners bring this action on behalf of its members and members of the public, to enforcel
25 important rights affecting the public interest.

6 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

7
23.
8 In 2013, DWR initiated a public negotiation process for extension of SWP contracts.

9 Contract extensions achieved through this process would be for another 50 years, through
the end of 2085. The initial phase of the process reached an "Agreement in Principle
10 Concerning Extension of the State Water Project Water Supply Contracts" (AIP). The AIP
11 is included as Appendix A of DWR's 2016 Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR).
12 Signatories to the AIP included most, but not all, of the State Water Contractors.
13

14 24. DWR issued its Notice of Preparation (NOP) of its Environmental Impact Report for
15 the Water Supply Contract Extension Project on September 12, 2014. Petitioners were
16 among the signatories to a scoping comment letter addressing the NOP. In other scoping|
17| comments, Santa Barbara County's Flood Control and Water Conservation District raised
18 questions, still left unaddressed when DWR ultimately certified and approved the project,

19 about the proposed project's financial consequences and implications for taxpayers and

20 ratepayers. A consistent theme in public comments involved the contract extension

21 amendments' role in facilitating DWR's Delta tunnels project, then known as BDCP.

22
25.
23 DWR sought delay in addressing financing for DWR's proposed Delta tunnels
project (then known as BDCP) financing until a subsequent contract amendment process
24 could be undertaken after Plumas County Flood Control and Water Conservation District
25 and Butte County raised concerns about costs from BDCP-related matters in the contractl
26 extension scope. DWR responded that this subject would be better addressed in a separate
27 a negotiation for a BDCP amendment. A separate SWP contract amendments process begun
28

10
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ETAL.

in December 2014 for the proposed BDCP (now California WaterFix) was suspended in
2 February 2015.

3

4 26. DWR's separately proposed and reviewed Delta water tunnels cannot be deemed

5 part of the State Water Project in the absence of amendments to the State Water Project
contracts. (See, e.g., Articles 1(cc) and 1(hh)(8) of State Water Project contracts.) These
provisions, as amended, place limitations on the water system facilities eligible for Central

8 Valley Project revenue bonds. For reasons reinforced in the defeat by voters of Proposition
9 in 1982, water system facilities as referenced in the project contracts did not include a
peripheral canal or permutations of that proposed conveyance. 10

11 27. In August 2016, DWR published its Draft EIR for the contract extension project,
12 failing to address the significant concerns about the project raised during scoping review.
13| During the public comment period that closed in October 2016, petitioners and other
14 commenters raised major additional concerns about the project, which DWR failed to
15 address as required by CEQA when it certified the EIR on November 13, 2018 and when it
16 rendered its final project approval on December 11, 2018. DWR also failed to address
17 major changed circumstances necessitating preparation of a new Draft EIR, addressed in

18 additional comments submitted by petitioners and other organizations on September 25,

19 2018.

20

21 28. In portraying the project as "separate" and independent" from DWR's Delta tunnels

22 project in its final decision-making, DWR avoided evidence discrediting these premises
introduced during 2016 public comment on the Draft EIR, such as the following: 23 An October 2011 Legislative Analyst Office (LAO) Report, Potential Funding|
24 Alternatives for the Bay Delta Conservation Plan Planning Process, stated that "[f]unding
25 BDCP implementation" would "require amendment of long-term water supply contracts
26 between DWR, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the contractors in order to provide the
27 funding mechanism." (Id. at 5.) This report also listed revenue bonds as one of the
28

11
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 "currently infeasible" funding mechanisms, because revenue bonds "require a clearly|
2 defined funding source before they can be sold." (Id. at 8.)

3 When discussing revenue bonds in connection with BDCP, DWR's bond counsel

4 concluded that without contract amendments, BDCP was "not on the list of approved

5 projects that are eligible for funding, including through bond financing." (Letter from Jake
Campos, STIFEL, to Mary Lou Cotton, SWPCA at 4 (March 19, 2014; see also MWD
PRA Document 00000484-SWC Financing DHCCP 9-7-12.)

8 In September 2014, staff at the Metropolitan Water District acknowledged that
proposed SWP contract amendments are a necessary step in financing BDCP. See MWD,
Special Committee on Bay-Delta Presentation Re Review Status of BDCP Cost Allocation
10| Discussions (September 23, 2014). In a September 23, 2013 report, Kern County Water
11 Agency also referenced the need for a contract amendment to finance BDCP.
12 In March 2014, a Morgan Stanley report concluded that "Clearly, in order to finance
13 the substantial costs associated with CM1 in the BDCP, the extension of these contracts is
14 essential to allow for the amortization of financing payments over a long period of time.' a
15 Like BDCP, California WaterFix cannot obtain financing through revenue bonds without a
16 contract amendment. November 23, 2013 and April 1, 2014 briefings of State Waterl

17 Contractors to DHCCP's SWP Cost Allocation Working Group, for example, concluded

18 that California WaterFix financing options would require contract amendments.

19

20| 29. As highlighted in earlier project criticism, 2018 legislative testimony and

21 correspondence, and in a December 11, 2018 letter to DWR from Roger Moore (Moore

22 letter), which DWR failed to address before proceeding to final approval of the project,
DWR's claim that the contract extension amendments are independent of California
23 WaterFix and DWR's Water Supply Contract Amendments are misleading and
24 demonstrably wrong. For example:
25 DWR has long been aware that revenue bonds could not be issued covering|
26 expenditures for the Delta tunnels without enacting specific contract revisions addressed in
27 the "extension" amendments. That is partly because financing for this multibillion-dollar
28 tunnels project could not realistically fit within the current expiration dates of 2035 to 2042.

12
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ETAL.

Beyond the time frame for repayment, facilities limitations in the existing SWP contracts
would otherwise prevent the coverage of the Delta tunnels project, including California

3 WaterFix or earlier variants such as BDCP. That existing contractual limitation on covered
4 facilities, included in article 1(hh)(8) of the SWP contracts, is specifically proposed for
LO removal in DWR's contract extension amendments.
Through the "extension" amendments, DWR proposes new authorization for "SWP

7 revenue bonds to be issued to: (1) finance repairs, additions, and betterments to mosti

8 facilities of the SWP without regard to whether the facilities were in existence prior to
January 1, 1987, which is the current Contract requirement in Article 1(hh)(8); and (2)
finance other capital projects (not already in the list in Article 1(hh) for which revenue 10 bonds could be sold) when mutually agreed to by DWR and at least 80 percent of the
11 affected Contractors."
12 Hearings before the Senate Natural Resources and Water Committee (SNRWC) on
13 July 3, 2018 and the Joint Legislative and Budget Committee (JLBC) on September 11,
14 2018 bear directly on DWR's improper piecemealing from the contract extension
15 amendment and WaterFix reviews. 2 This includes the foundational issue of the extension
16 project's relationship to the Delta Tunnels and the Water Supply Contract Amendments.'

13
VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

1 Testimony at the September 11, 2018 JLBC hearing undermined the premise of

2 independence from WaterFix upon which DWR's separate Contract Extension Final EIR

3 was founded. That includes the testimony of DWR director Karla Nemeth, following
questioning from Senator Richard Pan, that DWR plans to "use these amendments to

5 finance WaterFix," and the testimony of Rachel Ehlers of the Legislative Accounting
Office that the contract extension amendments would "affect and facilitate" WaterFix.
Facilitation of WaterFix through the contract extension amendments is also addressed in the

8 testimony of Congressman McNerney and of Roger Moore at the same hearing.
2018 comments not addressed DWR's Contract Extension Final EIR and final
project approval underscore the critical importance of integrated rather than fragmented
10 review. Public agency critics throughout California, from Plumas County and the Delta
11 Counties Coalition to San Diego County, criticized DWR's efforts to finalize the contract
12 extension without integrated review of all DWR's proposed amendments related to the
13| Delta Tunnels, including the Water Supply Contract Amendments still awaiting public
14| comment and completion of review. (Moore letter, Exhibit 3.)
15 The Legislative Delta Caucus observed that the "poorly defined" contract extension
16 amendments would have "potential adverse impacts far beyond their apparent scope. There
17 is much that remains unknown regarding the extensive changes to the SWP contracts that

18 are being proposed and how the changes will impact property taxes, water rates, the fiscal

20 Following the 2018 legislative hearings, more a than a dozen organizations identified

21 numerous changed circumstances requiring additional environmental review since public

22 comment closed in October 2016, only to have DWR, in its November 13, 2018
certification memo, respond with the non-sequitur that general issue areas were discussed

VERIFIED PETITION OF PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE, ET AL.

Commentary in major newspapers criticized the defective process and lack of
2 transparency surrounding the contract extension, as well as DWR's attempts to leverage
WaterFix indebtedness without adequate review and debate (Moore letter, Exhibit 6).
The 2018 legislative proceedings helped verify that DWR's certification and project

5 approval sidestepped environmental analysis of a major project component of the Contract
Extension Amendments, stemming from removal of the existing limitations on covered
"facilities" under article 1(hh)(8) of current SWP contracts that would otherwise render

8 WaterFix ineligible for revenue bond financing.
DWR's assurance that projects facilitated by the contract extension will be covered
by separate CEQA review (e.g., Contract Extension FEIR 2-10, 134) ring hollow. DWR's 10 Delta Tunnels EIR and project approval neither admitted nor analyzed dependence on a
11 subsequent SWP contract amendment. CEQA review of later-approved projects would
12 come too late to address the consequences of redefining covered "facilities," because the
13| current contract language would already be eliminated with the first of DWR's two sets of
14| proposed amendments.
15 The Contract Extension FEIR undermines its premise that the contract extension
16 amendments proposed by DWR have independent utility as a "separate, independent
17| project" addressing debt compression problems. (Contract Extension FEIR, 2-9.) Debt
18 compression is based on the comparatively short maturity dates of existing SWP contracts.

19 (id.) The Contract Extension Final EIR recognized that the Evergreen Clause in Article 4 of

20 the SWP contracts already provides a way to extend these dates. (E.g., Contract Extension

21 FEIR, 2-3 to 2-5, 2-33.)

22 The Evergreen Clause in section 4 of the SWP contracts would empower contractors
to request the cleaner "opt out" provision some have requested since the inception of 23 negotiations on project contracts-one which would allow terms to be extended without
24 bearing any of the WaterFix costs facilitated by either set of proposed contract amendments,
25 DWR has never shown its version of the extension amendments, including the proposed
26 facilities redefinition, to be necessary to ensure continued water deliveries or responsibly
27| address operation and maintenance needs. By facilitating the issuance of billions of dollars

2 to construct the Delta Tunnels project, and perhaps other projects not currently eligible,
DWR

3 may under the guise of risk reduction force a risky escalation of indebtedness.
As addressed in the written testimony of Roger Moore and the comments of the

5 Delta Counties Coalition (Moore letter, Exhibits 2, 3), Water Code prerequisites for
proceeding to finality on the extension amendments (Wat. Code, §§ 147, 147.5) still have

6 not been met. Put another way, by enabling the financing and addition of new SWP
facilities not meeting this earlier facilities limitation, the contract extension amendments

8 would tangibly facilitate addition of the Delta tunnels to the SWP, and also make it easier
for DWR and the most powerful SWP contractors to add further debt to finance other costly

10 new facilities of their choosing. The Contract Extension Amendments need an integrated

11 analysis that also includes DWR's proposed Water Supply Contract Amendments, and

12 WaterFix itself, in a single cohesive environmental analysis.
