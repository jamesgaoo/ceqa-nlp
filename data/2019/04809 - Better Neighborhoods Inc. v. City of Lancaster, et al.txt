VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Plaintiff and Petitioner, Better Neighborhoods, Inc., a California corporation (*Petitioner")

2 alleges against the City of Lancaster ("Lancaster"), and the City Council of the City of Lancaster
(the "City Council"), Lancaster and the City Council being collectively referred to as "Respondents"

4 or the "City", as follows:

INTRODUCTION

6 1. This action challenges the decisions by the City in connection with the approvals for
the construction and operation of a medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility, located
at 43511 70th Street East in the city of Lancaster, Los Angeles County, California.
2. The Project site is comprised of approximately 15 acres, and it is currently developed
10 as a produce packing facility. The project, to be developed in phases, includes Phase I, II, and III.

11 Phase I consist of the renovation of 27,781 square feet of the existing produce packing building for
12 the cultivation of medical cannabis. Phase II consist of the construction of an approximately 54,600

13 square feet greenhouse type building for the cultivation of medical cannabis. Phase III consist of the

14 renovation of the remaining 40,490 square feet of the existing produce packing for the cultivation of

15 medical cannabis. When completed, the project would include a total of 122,871 square feet of

16 renovations and new development predominantly for the cultivation of medical cannabis (the

17 "Project").

18 3. Petitioner challenges the City's actions in adopting a Resolution approving

19 Conditional Use Permit No. 18-05 to allow for the construction and operation of a 122,871 square-
20 foot medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility, and the adoption of the Mitigated
21 Negative Declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act and the CEQA Guidelines (all

22 of the foregoing, the "Project Approvals")

23 4. Petitioner alleges that the City's actions in giving the Project Approvals violate the

24 provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000, et

25 seq. ("CEQA").

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 PARTIES

2 5. Petitioner is a California corporation established to help people present their

3 objections and help them shape local developments in pending municipal planning decisions, so that

4 such community members will be heard equally to that of the city staff and the developer. Petitioner

5 also encourages smart growth and real planning that is consistent with the needs of the residents of

6 the community, to protect the natural environment, to support affordable housing, and to balance the

7 needs for growth while preserving the elements of livability in our cities.

8 6. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in

9 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and
10 the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner will be substantially and adversely affected by
11 impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals described in this petition, and Petitioner is
12 aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of the City as alleged in this petition. Petitioner is

13 suing on its own behalf and on the behalf of others who will be affected in the City of Coachella and
14 surrounding areas, as well as on behalf of the citizens of the City of Coachella.

15 7. Respondent, The City of Lancaster, is a charter city, duly organized under the laws of
16 the State of California. The City of Lancaster and/or the Planning Commission of the City of
17 Lancaster is the lead agency under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Project.
18 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent, City
19 Council of the City of Lancaster, is the elected governing body of Coachella and is the body
20 responsible for promulgating municipal ordinances, resolutions and policies.

21 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Real Party in
22 Interest, Tradecraft Ventures, LLC, a California limited liability company ("Applicant" or
23 "Developer"), is the proposed developer of the Project, and is an entity to whom the City purported
24 to grant Project Approvals. Developer is named as a real party pursuant to the requirements of Public
25 Resources Code Section 21167.6.5, subdivision (a).

26 10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Real Party in
27 Interest, K70, LLC, a California limited liability company (*Project Site Owner"), is the current
28 owner of the Project site that is the subject of Project approvals as described in this case, and would
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

be beneficially interested, directly or indirectly, in the Project approvals. Project Site Owner is
named as a real party pursuant to the requirements of public resources Code Section 21167.6.5,
subdivision (a).

4 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of real parties sued herein as ROES 1 through
10, inclusive, and therefore sues said real parties by those fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

6 petition to allege their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is
informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that each of these factiously named real parties is
in some manner responsible for the wrongful conduct alleged in this petition. Petitioner is informed

9 and believes, and based thereon alleges, that these factiously named real parties were, at all times

10 mentioned in this petition, the supervisors, agents, servants, and/or employees of their co-real parties
11 and were acting within their authority as such with the consent and permission of their co-real

12 parties.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 12. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the CEQA claims under Public Resources
15 Code section 21168.5. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate pursuant to Code of

16 Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

17 13. The Respondent, City of Lancaster, is located in Los Angeles County. Venue is
18 proper in the County of Los Angeles pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 394,

19 subdivision (a).

20 14. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the granting of this writ of mandate,
21 as well as the requested injunctive relief. Petitioner has appeared at the public hearings held in
22 connection with granting the Approvals, and Petitioner has objected to the approval of the Project
23 prior to the City's adoption of the Approvals.

24 15. The City and City Council made various land use and CEQA approvals, including the
25 Project Approvals.

26 16. Petitioner made written comments on the Project Approvals and raised each of the
27 legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

28

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 17. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondent, the

2 City, by objecting to the approval of the Project, as required by the provisions of Public Resources

3 Code Section 21177.

4 18. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this

5 petition, including without limitation complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code

6 Section 21167.5 by mailing (and sending by email) on January 29, 2019 a notice to the City that this

7 action would be filed. A copy of the Intent to Sue letter is attached to this Petition as Exhibit "A."
8 19. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as

9 required by law.

10 20. Petitioner hereby notifies Respondent, the City, to prepare the complete record of
11 Respondents' proceedings relating to this action, subject to all rights and procedures for Petitioner to
12 elect to prepare, itself, the administrative record in this matter after Petitioner receives and reviews

13 Respondents' Preliminary Notification and cost estimate. A copy of the Petitioner's notice of
14 election to prepare the record is filed concurrently with this Petition.
15 21. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ
16 of mandate and thereby orders the City to set aside the Approvals of the Project. In the absence of
17 such remedy, (a) the Project Approvals will remain in effect, in violation of State environmental

18 laws and planning laws; (b) the Project, lacking adequate environmental review, will be in violation
19 of CEQA; and (c) Petitioners and members of the public in the community in which the Project
20 would be developed will suffer irreparable harm.

21 22. There is a significant probability that Petitioners will prevail on the merits in this

22 matter. The Court should issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent
23 injunction ordering Respondents to suspend all activities implementing the Project (including
24 without limitation processing or granting any permits for development of the Project) until the Court,
25 by way of return writ, adjudicates that the City has fully complied with all requirements of the
26 California Environmental Quality Act.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

FACTS

2 23. Applicant applied for issuance of a conditional use permit (the "CUP") that would
allow the development of the proposed project on the subject property.

4 24. The CUP is required for the proposed project, pursuant to Lancaster Municipal Code
(the "LMC"), Section 17.43 (adopted in February 2017) to allow for the development of cannabis

6 cultivation facilities. In addition, to the CUP required for the proposed project, the proposed project
7 would also be required to obtain a site plan approval pursuant to LMC Section 17.16.120 for
development within an industrial zone. However, the site plan approval does not require a public

9 hearing process. Accordingly, Petitioner raised all of its CEQA claims during the public hearing

10 process for the CUP application by Developer.

11 25. The proposed project for cannabis cultivation facility will be developed in Phase I,

12 Phase II and II Phase III. Phase I (renovation of 27,781 square feet) and Phase III (renovation of

13 40,490 square feet) consist of tenant improvements to the existing produce packing facility, paving

14 of the driveway and parking lot, and the replacement of the existing chain-link fence with a 6-foot

15 block wall. Phase II of the Project consists of the construction of an approximately 54,600 square

16 feet greenhouse type building for cannabis cultivation. When completed, the proposed project would

17 include a total of 122,871 square feet of renovations and new development (the "Project").

18 26. On or about September 13, 2018, Petitioner submitted written comments to the City

19 Planner for the Project via e-mail, to be included in the discussion at the Planning Commission
20 hearing scheduled for September 17, 2018. In this comment letter, Petitioner raised all of the CEQA

21 issues included in this petition. However, on September 17, 2018, the Planning Commission heard

22 the proposed project, and had concerns regarding the existing building's compliance with

23 Architectural and Design Guidelines, and compliance of the proposed structure with Building and

24 Fire Codes. As such, the hearing was continued to October 15, 2018, in order to allow the applicant
25 to address these matters.

26 27. On October 15, 2018, the Planning Commission of the City held a public hearing to
27 consider the Project and adopted a resolution approving Conditional Use Permit No. 18-05 and

28 adopting mitigated negative declaration (the "MND").
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

28. On October 25, 2018, Petitioner filed an appeal to the City Council of the Planning

2 Commission's approval of the project.

3 29. The City Council hearing for Petitioner's appeal was scheduled to be heard on

4 January 22, 2019.

5 30. On January 18, 2019, Attorney for Petitioner received a letter via e-mail which

6 included the staff report prepared by the City Staff to be presented to the City Council on January
7 22, 2019.

8 31. The staff report for the City Council concluded that "[t]he appellant [Petitioner] did

9 not provide any further evidence that would identify additional environmental impacts or concerns
10 that would require further investigation." Accordingly, the staff concluded that the MND was
11 adequate. The staff report included Attachment B that summarized Petitioner's identified significant
12 environmental impacts, and purported to explain why each impact was not significant.
13 32. In response to the staff report, on January 22, 2019, Attorney for Petitioner submitted

14 a letter to the City Council on behalf of Petitioner, filled with substantial evidence of several

15 significant impacts under CEQA that the Project would cause, which were either not considered in
16 the MND or were not properly mitigated by the mitigation measures in the MND. These identified

17 impacts included the following: (i) several goals and policies of the City's general plan with which
18 the Project stands in direct conflict; (ii) production of massive amounts of polluted wastewater; (iii)
19 excessive water demands; (iv) significant increases in local crime and pressure on police resources;
20 (v) negative effects on public health, putting significant strain on local medical facilities; and (vi)
21 contamination of air quality.

22 33. At the City Council's January 22, 2019 hearing, in light of the extensive and
23 substantial evidence presented by Petitioner, the City Council denied Petitioner's appeal, approved
24 the Project and certified the MND.

25 34. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this action;
26 include complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 by mailing
27 notice to the City that this action would be filed. (See, Exhibit A).

28

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 35. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as

2 required by law.

3 36. Petitioner has substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in
4 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and

5 the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner and members of the public will be adversely

6 affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals, and Petitioner and such

7 members of the public are aggrieved by the acts, decisions, and omissions of the City as alleged in

8 this petition and complaint. Petitioner brings this action on its behalf, and on behalf of others who

q will be affected in the City of Lancaster, as well as citizens of the City of Lancaster.
10 37. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of
11 law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner and the public generally will suffer
12 irreparable harm if this court does not issue a writ to compel the City to comply with CEQA and to
13 vacate and set aside the above-described approvals related to the Project.
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; MND Does Not Comply with CEQA)
16 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs
17 through 32 inclusive in this Petition.

18 34. CEQA requires a lead agency for project to prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration
19 that complies with the requirements of CEQA. The lead agency must provide for public review and

20 comment on the project and related environmental documentation. A Mitigated Negative
21 Declaration must provide sufficient environmental analysis so that decision makers can intelligently
22 consider environmental impacts that a proposed project may create.

23 35. The City's actions in approving the Project constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
24 because the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and the City failed to support its
25 decision to grant the approvals with substantial evidence. Among other failings by the City, the
26 City:

27

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a) Should have prepared, circulated for review and comment and adopted an updated

2 MND or environmental impact report that analyzed and mitigated all of the significant
environmental impacts raised by Petitioner;

4 b) Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the significant environmental impacts that
will result from the development of the Project, including but not limited to the environmental

6 impacts from the following: (i) several goals and policies of the City's general plan with which the

7 Project stands in direct conflict; (ii) production of massive amounts of polluted wastewater; (iii)
excessive water demands; (iv) significant increases in local crime and pressure on police resources;
(v) negative effects on public health, putting significant strain on local medical facilities; and (vi)
10 contamination of air quality. In addition, City did not study any cumulative impacts, and Petitioner

11 alleges that if an environmental impact report is required, there will also be several cumulatively

12 considerable impacts by the Project on all of the above identified environmental impacts.

13 c) Improperly deferred the analysis of impacts and the definition of and implementation

14 of mitigation measures;

15 d) Failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and failed to adequately mitigate

16 environmental impacts from the development of the Project; and

17 e) Failed to adopt legally adequate findings as required by law with regard to the

18 approvals.

19 36. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in

20 response to comments received on a mitigated negative declaration, to address (in detail)

21 recommendations and objections raised by comments submitted to the lead agency, and to explain

22 why specific comments and objections, especially those of experts, were not accepted by the lead
23 agency. The City failed to respond adequately to comments made by Petitioner. Moreover, the City
24 Council in denying the appeal failed entirely to consider the substantial evidence of significant

25 impacts presented by Petitioner in its September 13, 2018 and January 22, 2019 letters.

26 37. All of the letters of Petitioner constitute a fair argument that there is a reasonable
27 probability that the Project will create several significant environmental impacts that should be

28 studied and, if possible, mitigated.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 38. As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner and the public have been

2 harmed, because, prior to the City's approval of the Project, Petitioner and other members of the

3 public were not fully informed about the significant environmental impacts that could occur from the

4 development of the Project.

5 39. Petitioner and members of the public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested

6 in this Petition is not granted by this Court, and the Project is constructed in the absence of an
7 environmental impact report for the Project that complies with the applicable provisions of CEQA

8 and other applicable laws.

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; Inadequate Findings)

11 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs
12 through 39 inclusive in this Petition.

13 41. CEQA requires that the findings made by a lead agency in connection with the
14 approval of a project must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA
15 further requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports
16 the conclusions it has made.

17 42. The City violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law,

18 because the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not
19 limited to the following:

20 (a) The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or
21 that the adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's effects on the environment;

22 (b) The determination that the Project is not in conflict with the City's general
23 plan; and

24 (c) The proposed mitigation measures would reduce all identified significant

25 impacts to a level that is less than significant.

26 43. As a result of the defects described above, the City prejudicially abused its discretion
27 by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. Therefore, the City also

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 prejudicially abused its discretion by granting approvals for the Project based upon defective and

2 inadequate findings. Accordingly, the City's approval of the Project must be set aside.
3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment against the Respondents, and each

5 of them, as follows:

6 1. a For a peremptory writ of mandamus directing Respondents, the City and the City
7 Council, to vacate and set aside the approval of the Project, the actions adopting the MND, and all

8 related approvals.

9 2. That this court issue a writ of mandate suspending the authority of Respondents, the
10 City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions and other

11 subdivisions, to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project (including without
12 limitation to any of the Real Party in Interest) until after the City requires Developer to prepare a full
13 environmental impact report to fully analyze all significant environmental impacts from the Project,
14 consistent with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and all other applicable laws, and
15 until a full set of legally adequate findings are made by the City as required by law.

16 3. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction
17 enjoining Respondents, the City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards,
18 commissions and other subdivisions, as well as the Real Party in Interest, from undertaking any
19 activities, demolition, grading or construction pursuant to the City's approvals as described herein,
20 prior to the City's full compliance with CEQA, the City's municipal code, and other applicable laws.
21 4. For attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5.

22 5. For costs of suit; and

23 6. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
