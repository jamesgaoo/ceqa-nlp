PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 1

1 Petitioners Mission Peak Conservancy and Kelly Abreau ("Petitioners") allege through
2 this Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

3 ("Petition") as follows:

4 I. THE PROJECT AND THE CHALLENGED PERMIT

5 l. This action challenges the legality of the permit issued by Respondent California

6 State Water Resources Control Board (the "Water Board") to Real Parties in Interest Christopher
7 and Teresa George ("RPI") on or about April 5, 2019, identified as Registration D032864,
8 Certificate D1193, for the right to divert water from an unnamed Stream for storage into an
9 illegally created lake and dam located at 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, in a rural and
10 unincorporated part of Alameda County near Fremont, California (the "Property") for alleged
11 small domestic use appropriation (the "domestic use permit") without any environmental review
12 in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act under California Public Resources Code
13 §§ 21000 et seq., and title 14 of California Code of Regulations §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA").
14 2. The domestic use permit and the application for the same, however, are the wrongl
15 type of permit and application for RPI's actual water diversion, and the Water Board knew or
16 should have known it, but they approved it anyway in violation of CEQA. A domestic use
17 permit generally does not require CEQA review, as they are considered "small" projects by
18 name, which is why RPI chose to apply for it instead of the correct water appropriations permit
19 ("water permit"), which does require CEQA.

20 3. In order to "qualify" for the domestic use permit, and thus eliminate CEQA
21 review, RPI provided false information on their application regarding their project, including, but
22 not limited to, storage of less than the statutorily limited 10 acre-feet, recreational use, and the
23 flat-out lie that aerial photos show the "pond" has been there since before 1948, and thus
.?4.... implying that they had.not.constructed or altered it themselves.--The-reality is that RPI-massively
25 expanded the "pond" from a small seasonal stock pond to its current size of approximately 18
26 acre-feet, dammed up the stream from which they are diverting to virtually zero flow, and are
27 also using it for irrigation of vineyards.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2

1 4. The Water Board knew or should have known that the information RPI provided
2
• on the domestic use registration application regarding their "project" was not correct because
3 they conducted a site inspection of the Property on September 15, 2017, a year and a half before a
4 they issued the domestic use permit. The Water Board inspected the dam and the lake, and

5 reviewed aerial photos from 1948 and 1958 during the site inspection. The aerial photos show,
6 however, the surface area of the "pond" in 1948 and 1958 was dramatically smaller than the
7 surface area on the date of the inspection. In 1948 and 1958, it is barely-there cattle pond. How
8 the Water Board came to conclude these photos were "evidence" of the current pond's pre-1948

9 extent and configuration so to condone RPI's lies about their project and their extensive
10 alteration to the watercourse is baffling, unreasonable, and not based on substantial evidence.
11 Aerial photos from 2007 to the present day serve to debunk RPI's false statements that they
12 merely "drained and cleared" the pond in 2007. The aerial photos document the progressive
13 phases of extensive grading and earth-moving that expanded the dam and lake, and were readily
14 available for the Water Board to view, if they had not done so already.
15 5. The Water Board should have alerted to the dam construction by that site
16 inspection and by reviewing the aerial photos. It should have alerted that the "project" RPI
17 proposed on the domestic use application for diversion rights only to a 10 acre-feet pond without
18 construction, excavation or grading was not, in fact, the project, and was largely fictional. But
19 | instead, they approved it.

20 6. The actual "project" for RPI's diversion and storage of water is a major project
21 with significant potential for environmental harm that involved the damming of the stream flow
22 entirely, expansion of the pond to 18 acre-feet, and storage and use of the diverted water for
23 || irrigation of vineyards (the "Project"). RPI failed to mention any of this on the domestic use
.24 permit.application.so they could qualify-for it and divert waters of-the-State-without-the-CEQA--
25 process.

26 7. The Water Board knew or should have known that the Project required CEQA,
27 and that the correct application and permit RPI required in order to divert and store water under
28 the circumstances for the Project is a water appropriation application and permit, which require

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

CEQA, even if the project was already complete. The CEQA requirement for a water
appropriation permit does not cease to exist because a project has been completed. The Water
Board should have rejected RPI's domestic use application for a permit, when it knew or should
4 have known the Project required CEQA.

S 8. The Water Board's issuance of the domestic use permit involved a discretionary
6 decision with the exercise of substantial personal judgment. The Water Board conducted a site
7 inspection, and prepared a report on their findings before issuing the domestic use permit on
8 April 5, 2019. The level of discretion actually exercised and authorized by the Water Board in
9 determining the approval of the domestic use permit and any conditions attached thereto meet the
10 definition of discretionary approvals under CEQA.
11 9. Where the Water Board has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a
12 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the Water Board to exercise discretion
13 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,
14 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair. Failure to exercise
15 discretion is itself an abuse of discretion. (Ashburn v. AIG Financial Advisors, Inc. (2015) 234
16 Cal.App. 4th 79, 97.)

17 10. In issuing the domestic use permit, the Water Board abused said discretion. It
18 completely ignored RPI's dam construction, lake expansion, and the capacity of the lake in
19 excess of the 10 acre-feet limit in its evaluation of whether to issue the domestic use permit, even
20 though the Water Board inspected the Property itself and saw photos of the pond and stream
21 before RPI expanded and dammed them, respectively. A small domestic use permit, by its very
22 name, is meant for small projects. This is the wrong permit for the large extent of the
23 construction, diversion and storage that has occurred and will continue to occur at the Property.
24 But despite overwhelming and obvious evidence that the Project requires-CEQA-and-dees not.--
25 qualify for small domestic use registration, but requires a permit a to appropriate water, which
26 requires CEQA, the Water Board abused its discretion and issued the water permit in violation of
27 CEQA. The Water Board knew that a discretionary decision would al so be required had RPI
28 submitted the proper appropriative water permit application for their Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 11. Respondent did not hold any public hearings, or post any public notices, regarding

2 the domestic use permit and/or the Project in any aspect, including CEQA.

3 12. Petitioners seek a Court Order revoking the domestic use permit and mandating

4 Respondent comply with CEQA with respect to the issuance of any further water rights to RPI,
5 including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project (CCR § 15060), an

6 evaluation of whether Project qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), § an initial
7 study of the Project (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an environmental impact report

8 or a negative declaration of the Project.

9 13. The terms and conditions of RPI's domestic use permit requires RPI to conform
10 its actual water diversion and use to those outlined in its application, including, but not limited
11 to, that "water appropriated shall be limited to the quantity which can be beneficially used and
12 shall not exceed 10 acre-feet per year [t]he capacity of the reservoir shall not exceed 10 acre-

13 feet"; and "[n]o water shall be diverted or used under this right, and no construction related to
14 such diversion shall commence, unless the right holder has obtained and is in compliance with all
15 necessary permits or other approvals required by other agencies."
16 14. RPI have not complied with these terms and conditions, are not complying with
17 these terms and conditions, and the Water Board knew or should have known of the violations

18 based on complaints made by Petitioners to the Water Board in recent months after they learned
19 the domestic use permit had been issued. RPI has and is continuing to misappropriate water in
20 violation of the domestic use permit and the California Water Code and the Water Board knows
21 it but they continue to do nothing about it.

22 15. The Water Board has also abused its discretion derived under California Water

23 Code §1228.6 by failing to investigate RPI's violations of the domestic use permit and/or enforcel
24. the laws and-regulations-with-regard to-misappropriation of-water-by-RPI, which---
25 misappropriation is ongoing. Substantial evidence demonstrates that the discretion the Water
26 Board possesses to enforce the laws and regulations with respect to RPI's illegal water diversion
27 and use contrary to RPI's application and the domestic use permit must be exercised, and the
28 Water Board has failed to exercise that discretion, and/or has abused that discretion by failing to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -

1 investigate and/or enforce RPI's illegal water diversion and use, and that such decisions lacked

2 evidentiary support and are arbitrary and capricious.

3 16. To illustrate the Water Board's exercise of discretion related to misappropriation

4 of water, and in direct contrast with its actions with respect to RPI, is the Water Board's recent

5 investigation into Rhys Winery, LLC, located in Mendocino County, California. Like RPI, Rhys

6 Winery created a large reservoir after it purchased the property (without authorization or permits
7 from the Water Board), which already had several smaller ponds. Rhys Winery, like RPI, did

8 not have appropriative water rights to divert water from the stream to its new large reservoir. In

9 total, Rhys Winery had 22 acre-feet of reservoirs, similar to RPI's 18 acre-feet. Rhys Winery
10 created a 14-acre vineyard, similar to the size of RPI's. The Water Board, however, enforced the
11 laws and regulations related to water rights with respect to Rhys Winery, stating in an
12 | announcement that "the illegal and permanent loss of wetlands and streams caused by the
13 vineyard construction was an egregious violation of state and federal law." The Water Board

14 reached a $3.76 million settlement with Rhys Winery, but it closed its investigation into RPI,
15 issued the domestic use permit, and fails to act on evidence warranting further investigation
16 and/or enforcement.

17 II. PARTIES

18 17. Petitioner MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY is a neighborhood political
19 advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of the environment, protection and
20 enhancement of park access, and the construction of a network of bicycle and pedestrian trails in
21 southern Alameda County near Fremont, California, including the area in which the Project and
22 is located in Vargas Plateau.

23 18. Petitioner KELLY ABREAU is an individual and is now, and at all times
24 mentioned in this Petition was a resident of Fremont in Alameda-County,
25 19. Respondent California State Water Resources Control Board is a government
26 entity located in the State of California and has permit authority over the Project, and issued the
27 domestic use permit on or about April 5, 2019.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

1 20. Petitioners are persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts,

2 decisions, and omissions of Respondent as alleged in this Petition. Petitioners have fundamental

3 vested rights and interests which are adversely affected by the acts, decisions, and omissions of

4 Respondent. Unmitigated, significant and damaging environmental effects associated with the
5 Project, and the effects will adversely impact the Petitioners as well as the public generally.

6 21. Respondent is charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law
7 including CEQA. Respondent is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things, that all
8 applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and implemented. The
9 Respondent has failed to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project and the issuance of the
10 domestic use permit.

11 22. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and
12 the owners of the Properties and are the proponents of the Project and the water right holder
13 under the domestic use permit.

14 23. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein
15 as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 20 through
16 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues these Respondents and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious
17 names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend the Petition, if necessary, to allege the true names
18 and capacities when ascertained.

19 24. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material
20 hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the
21 other Respondent herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and
22 scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondent.
23 II. JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION

24 OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES --

25 25. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1085 of the California
26 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7

1 26. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and 305 of the California Code

2 of Civil Procedure as the county in which the real properties in dispute are located and as a

3 county in which Respondent and RPI reside.

4 27. Petitioners haves complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

5 Code section 21167.5 by sending a Notice of Commencement ("Notice") of this action to

6 Respondent prior to filing the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about September 30,

7 2019. A true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated

8 herein by this reference.

9 28. Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA as described herein constitute
10 prejudicial abuses of discretion. As alleged in this Petition, Respondent failed to proceed in the
11 manner required by law, failed to exercise discretion when discretion was required, and/or
12 abused its discretion by making determinations and approvals not supported by substantial
13 evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along with members of
14 the public, will a suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondent's violations of CEQA.
15 29. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources
16 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing copy of
17 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about October 1, 2019 to the State Attorney
18 General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the Petition for Writ of Mandate and Notice
19 of Commencement of Action on the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit B, and
20 incorporated herein by this reference.

21 30. California Public Resources Code § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies
22 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain a CEQA action does not apply to
23 Petitioners in accordance with subsection (e), which states, "This section does not apply to any
24 alleged grounds for-noncompliance-with-this division for-which there was no-publie-hearing or
25 other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to
26 the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."
27 (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21777(e).) Respondent has held no public hearings or issued any
28 public notice regarding CEQA review of the Project or of the domestic use permit.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 IV. STANDING

2 31. Petitioners have standing as parties beneficially interested in the issuance of the
3 requested writ of mandate because the Project as alleged herein will have significant adverse

4 environmental impacts affecting the individuals named herein as well as the general public.

5 32. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all their legal
6 duties as alleged in this Petition. Further, issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will
7 confer significant benefits on the general public by requiring Respondent to carry out their duties
8 under CEQA. Issuance of the relief requested will also result in the enforcement of important
9 rights affecting the public interest by compelling the County to engage in a fair, objective, and
10 legally adequate analysis of the Project, and ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity
11 to review and comment on the impacts of the same.

12 33. The significant adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to,
13 habitat and waterway destruction and the effects therefrom, and the exploitation of, and harm to,
14 groundwater resources.

15 V. CEQA REQUIREMENTS

16 34. Respondent is subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
17 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The Project is a "project," as that term is
18 defined by CEQA, such that it is "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in
19 the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment". and
20 which is "[a]n activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license,
21 certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies." (California Public
22 Resources Code § 21065.)

23 35. CEQA requires Respondent to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of
24  projects, and to.seek feasible means-to reduce-or-avoid significant-environmental-damage that -
25 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
26 significant adverse environmental impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen
27 such impacts.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9

1 36. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions to
2 CEQA apply to the Project.

3 VI. CEQA STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

4 37. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

5 21167(a) and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112 as it was filed within

6 180 days of the Water Board's approval of the domestic use permit on or about April 5, 2019
7 where no public hearing was held.

8 VII. CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST RESPONDENT

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Writ of Mandate - CEQA Violations

11 (Against Respondent)

12 38. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
13 paragraphs - through 37 as though fully stated herein.

14 39. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental analysis of
15 the Project before it issued the domestic use permit when they knew that the Project required the
16 CEQA process.

17 40. Respondent also violated CEQA by approving the discretionary permit for
18 domestic use without the CEQA process based on false claims made in the application of the
19 same that they knew or should have known were false, and contrary to substantial evidence, in an
20 effort to avoid the required CEQA process.

21 41. Where the Water Board has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a
22 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the Water Board to exercise discretion
23 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,
2 4. entirely lacking in evidentiary-support, unlawful, or-procedurally unfair . E EEEE
25 42. The Water Board abused its discretion when it approved the domestic use permit
26 without the required CEQA process, because the approval was entirely lacking in evidentiary
27 support as described herein.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10

1 43. The Water Board abused its discretion when it failed to conduct any review or
2 reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with respect to the Project
3 when it knew or should have known that the CEQA process was required for the Project, and that
4 a discretionary approval was required.

5 44. The Water Board abused its discretion when it determined that the domestic use

6 permit was a ministerial decision and thus exempted from CEQA.
7 45. Petitioners seek a Court Order revoking the domestic use permit and mandating
8 Respondent comply with CEQA with respect to the issuance of any further water rights to RPI,
9 including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project (CCR § 15060), an
10 evaluation of whether Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR co.
11 15061), an initial study of the Project (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an
12 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project.
13 46. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
14 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
15 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
16 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.
17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Writ of Mandate - Abuse of Discretion for Failure to Enforce Illegal Water Diversion
19 (Against Respondent)
20 47. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
21 paragraphs 1 through 44 as though fully stated herein.
22 48. The Water Board has a discretionary duty, including, but not limited to, that
23 discretionary duty arising under Water Code §1228.6(c), "to enforce the terms and conditions of
24  permits and licenses to appropriate water, and to prevent-the unlawful diversion-of water,
25 including, but not limited to, provisions regarding cease and desist orders and the revocation of
26 permits and licenses, shall be applicable to appropriations initiated or perfected pursuant to this
27 article."

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11

1 49. The terms and conditions of RPI's domestic use permit requires RPI to conform
2 its actual water diversion and use to those outlined in its application, including, but not limited
3 to, that "water appropriated shall be limited to the quantity which can be beneficially used and
4 shall not exceed 10 acre-feet per year . . .; [t]he capacity of the reservoir shall not exceed 10 acre-
5 feet"; and "[n]o water shall be diverted or used under this right, and no construction related to
6 such diversion shall commence, unless the right holder has obtained and is in compliance with all
7 necessary permits or other approvals required by other agencies."
8 50. RPI have not complied with these terms and conditions, are not complying with
9 these terms and conditions, and the Water Board knew or should have known of the violations
10 based on complaints made by Petitioners to the Water Board in recent months after they learned
11 the domestic use permit had been issued. RPI has and is continuing to misappropriate water in
12 violation of the domestic use permit and the California Water Code and the Water Board knows
13 but they continue to do nothing about it.

14 51. Where the Water Board has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a
15 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the Water Board to exercise discretion
16 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,
17 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair. Failure to exercise
18 discretion is itself an abuse of discretion. (Ashburn v. AIG Financial Advisors, Inc. (2015) 234
19 Cal.App.4th 79, 97.)

20 52. The Water Board has abused its discretion and/or failed to exercise its discretion
21 by failing to investigate and/or enforce RPI's misappropriation of water in violation of the
22 domestic use permit and the California Water Code when the decision(s) to do so are entirely
23 lacking in evidentiary support. To the contrary, all substantial evidence leads to the conclusion
24 that the Water Roard must exercise their discretion and conduct an investigation-and/or----*-
25 enforcement, and the decision(s) not to do so are arbitrary and capricious.
26 53. Although the Water Board investigated RPI in or about September 15, 2017 to the
27 date it issued its April 3, 2018 Report, that investigation did not investigate the violations of the
28 domestic use permit as alleged herein, since the domestic use permit had not been issued.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

Moreover, that investigation and report failed to take into account the pond expansion and the
2 dam (although it should have). Violations of the domestic use permit create a statutorily a defined
3 basis on which the Water Board has the discretionary authority to investigate and enforce.
4 54. Petitioners seek an order mandating the Water Board to either (a) exercise its
5 discretionary authority if it has not done so and determine whether an investigation of RPI's
6 violations of the domestic use permit shall be conducted and/or enforcement of the terms and

7 conditions of the domestic use permit that include the damming of the stream and the expansion
8 of the pond; or (b) exercise its discretionary authority when it can only be exercised in one way
