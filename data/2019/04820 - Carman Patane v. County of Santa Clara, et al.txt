H 1. By this action, Petitioner Carmen Patane challenges Respondents County of Santa
2 Clara and Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors' April 9, 2019 certification of the Final
00 t Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Shamrock Seeds Project ("Project"), the required
findings under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code,
section 21000 et seq., and the approval of the Project.

PARTIES

2. Petitioner Carman Patane is a resident of Santa Clara County and resides at 6650
8 Holsclaw Road, Gilroy, California, which is adjacent to the Project. Petitioner Carman Patane

9 has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with the
10 laws relating to environmental protection, particularly CEQA. Petitioner is affected by
11 Respondents' failure to prepare a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for
12 the Project.
13 3. Respondent County of Santa Clara is a political subdivision of the State of
14 California and a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. County of Santal
15 Clara is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, County of
16 Santa Clara is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the

17 Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to
18 lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.

23 to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14

24 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines").
25 5. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as
26 Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does/
27 1-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the
28 Project with respect to the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. When

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

1 the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will,
2 with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.
00t 6. Real Party in Interest Shamrock Seeds Company is a California corporation.
Shamrock Seeds Company's address is 3 Harris Place, Salinas, California 93901. Shamrock
Seeds Company is the party identified in the County's Notice of Determination as carrying out
the Project.

7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
8 identified as Does 21-100. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
9 Respondents Does 21-100, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests -
10 affected by the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. When the true
11 identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner will,
12 with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.
13 BACKGROUND FACTS
14 A. THE PROJECT LOCATION

15 8. The Project is located at 6640 Holsclaw Road on two legal parcels under a single
16 assessor's parcel number (841-49-002) in an unincorporated area of Santa Clara County near the
17 City of Gilroy. The two project parcels (Parcel and Parcel 2) are irregularly shaped and
18 aggregate to approximately 22-acres in size, with the proposed project site occupying a 3.5-acre
19 portion of the larger parcel (Parcel 1), immediately adjacent to and northwest of Parcel 2, and
20 fronting Holsclaw Road. The project site currently contains four existing greenhouse structures,
21 as well as several hoop houses and temporary pollination cage structures, a modular office, a
22 barn, and an equipment shed. The remainder of the site is under active agricultural cultivation.
23 B. THE PROJECT

24 9. The Project consists of demolishing the existing greenhouse structures and
25 construction of a new 10,000 square foot agricultural research building, parking lot, and two
26 new greenhouse structures.

27 10. The agricultural research building includes offices, laboratory area, and conference
28 rooms to support the agricultural research use. The 20-foot tall structure will have metal walls

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

and a metal roof, and will front Holsclaw Road. A 31-space parking lot with covered trash

2 enclosure will be located along the front and east side of the agricultural research building. The
0 Project also includes parking lot lighting and building lighting.

11. Two new sets of greenhouse structures (measuring approximately 100 feet by 130 1o 0 feet, and 85 feet by 300 feet) would also be constructed at the project site. These two sets of
greenhouse structures will be up to 22 feet tall, and composed of a translucent material, to allow
sunlight to enter during daylight hours. The greenhouses will house drip irrigation growing
cg systems and will be internally illuminated during a portion of non-daylight hours. The Project
9 also includes the construction of a 90-squarefoot electrical utility building and on-site fire
10 protection system, including a 40,000-gallon, aboveground water tank.
11 12. The agricultural research building will operate between 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.,
12 with occasional work conducted outside of regular business hours by limited staff on an as-
13 needed basis. The two greenhouses will be illuminated at varying times of day, for an average
14 of 8 hours per day depending on the season, in order to provide 16 continuous hours of light
15 each day (one photoperiodic plant cycle).
16 13. The Project will be constructed in two phases; with site preparation and the
17 agricultural research building being constructed in the first year, and the greenhouses being
18 constructed in the second year. Phase I will take approximately nine to 12 months to complete,
19 and Phase II will take approximately six months to complete.
20 C. THE COUNTY'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS

21 14. On January 4, 2016, Shamrock Seeds submitted an application for Architecture
22 and Site Approval ("ASA") and grading pre-application for prospective expansion of the
23 existing agriculture research facility.
24 15. On June 23, 2016 Shamrock Seeds applied for ASA, a grading permit, and a
25 Williamson Act Compatible Use Determination for proposed expansion.
26 16. On September 16, 2016, the County deemed the application complete. On
27 December 1, 2016, the ASA Committee granted the ASA and grading permit and issued a

28 CEQA exemption for facility expansion..

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17. On December 16, 2016, Petitioner appealed the County's approval of the Project
Nmv.0 on the grounds that the Project did not qualify for a CEQA exemption.

18. On February 17, 2017, the County released a proposed Negative Declaration for
the Project. On May 17, 2017, the County released an amended Negative Declaration.

19. On March 23, 2017, the Santa Clara County Planning Commission conducted a
hearing on Petitioner's appeal. The Planning Commission partially denied the appeal and
approved the Project with additional conditions of approval.

20. On April 7, 2017, Petitioner appealed the Planning Commission's approval of the
9 Project.

10 21. In response to Petitioner's appeal, on August 10, 2017, the County released for
11 public review and comment a revised Negative Declaration, which the County subsequently
12 revised and recirculated as a Mitigated Negative Declaration.
13 22. On December 12, 2017, the Board of Supervisors initially heard Petitioner's
14 appeal. At that hearing, the Planning Department requested that the Board of Supervisors
15 continue the hearing on Petitioner's appeal to a date uncertain based upon information that
16 Petitioner had submitted to the County regarding the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
17 23. On February 7, 2018, the County commenced preparation of a draft EIR for the
18 Shamrock Seeds Project.

19 24. On April 10, 2018, the County published and circulated a Notice of Preparation of
20 the Shamrock Seeds EIR.

21 25. October 30, 2018, the County released the Shamrock Seeds Project Draft EIR for a
22 45-day public review and comment period.
23 26. Petitioner timely submitted comments on the Draft EIR.

24 27. On February 15, 2019, the County released the Shamrock Seeds Project Final EIR.
25 28. On February 26, 2019, the Board of Supervisors heard Petitioner's appeal that had
26 been continued from December 12, 2017. At that hearing, the Board took the following
27 actions: 1) declared its intent to certify the Environmental Impact Report and adopt the
28 Mitigation, Monitoring and Reporting Program; 2) denied Petitioner's appeal of the decision of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

-

2

D 0 1 u A 0 the Planning Commission to deny an appeal and approve Architecture and Site Approval and
Grading Approval for an Agricultural Research facility; 3) and referred the matter to County
Counsel for preparation of findings.

29. On April 9, 2019, the Board adopted a Resolution certifying the Final EIR;
adopting mitigation monitoring and reporting program; and granting Architecture and Site
Approval and a grading permit for the Shamrock Seeds Facility.

30.

9 On April 9, 2019, the County filed the Notice of Determination pursuant to Public
Resources Code, section 21152.

10 31. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11

12 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

13 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168. In the

14 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and
Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

32.

15

16 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a), venue is proper in this Court
because the Project is located within the County of Santa Clara.

17

18 33. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

19

20 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant

21 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by

law.

34.

22

23 Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

24 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written

35.

25 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

26 Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.

27 36.

28 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require respondents to set aside their

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -

6

- approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, the
2 Respondents approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.
00 71 0 37. This action has been brought within 30 days of the County of Santa Clara filing of
the Notice of Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

STANDING

38. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because
Petitioner's aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by the
o Respondents' approval of the Project.

9 CAUSES OF ACTION
10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
11 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
12 39. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 38
13 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

14 40. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

15 a manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA

16 for disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.

17 41. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate

18 the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. The Findings of Fact are not supported by

19 substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)

20 42. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

21 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts as required by

22 law, and its conclusions regarding the Project's environmental impacts are not supported by

23 substantial evidence.

24 a. Aesthetics (Light and Glare): The Final EIR failed to adequately address

25 the Project's impacts to aesthetics. The Final EIR failed to adequately disclose and discuss the

26 Project's impacts to aesthetics as a result of the night lighting for the greenhouses. Additionally,|

27 the record demonstrates that the Project will result in significant impacts associated with the

28 lighting of the greenhouses and the Final EIR failed to provide adequate and proper mitigation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

h

2 of those impacts. As part of the Final EIR's failure to address lighting and glare impacts, the -
EIR fails to adequately disclose, discuss and mitigate the Project's impacts associated with sky -
glow.

b.

6 Historic Resources: The EIR fails to adequately address and mitigate the
project's impacts to historic resources and contains insufficient information regarding the

7 baseline for the Edwin Willson Ranch. Under CEQA, a substantial adverse change in a historic

8 resource is treated as significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines, §

9 15064.5(b).) A substantial change means demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of

10 the resources or its immediate surroundings resulting in the significance of the resource being

11 materially impaired. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15064.5(b)(1) [emphasis added].) The significance

12 of a resource is materially impaired when the physical characteristics that convey its historical

13 significance and that justify its designation as a historical resource are demolished or materially

14 altered in an adverse manner. (Id., § 15064.5(b)(2); Taxpayers for Accountable School Bond

15 Spending v. San Diego Unified School District (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1043.) CEQA

16 also requires that the lead agency must identify potentially feasible mitigation measures

17 mitigate significant adverse changes to the significance of a historical resource. (CEQA to

18 Guidelines, § 15604.5(b)(4).)

43.

19 Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under

20 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving

21 the Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set

22 aside the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

1.

25 That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:

a.

26 vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR on the grounds that it

27 violates the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et

seq.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

RNmt b. suspend approval of any and all contracts for construction of the Project
until the Respondents are in compliance with CEQA;

C. suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the
physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be necessary to bring

o their determination, findings or decision regarding the Project into compliance with CEQA;

2. For Petitioner's costs associated with this action;

3. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
8 section 1021.5; and
For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. - 9 4.
