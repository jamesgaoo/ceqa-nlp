21 Plaintiff and Petitioner California Construction and Industrial Materials Association
22 ("CalCIMA", or "Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandamus, and declaratory and injunctive relief,
-
23 against Defendant and Respondent County of Ventura ("County"), and alleges as follows:
24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. The County has unlawfully rezoned more than 13,000 acres of land containing
26 mineral resource deposits (aggregate) previously classified and designated by the State of
27 California as having significant importance to the region, without any consideration of how the
28 action will affect the future extraction of those mineral resources. Such consideration is mandated

65177698v8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

r by state law and necessary to protect these valuable mineral resources from incompatible land uses
2 and to ensure these resources are available for use in future housing projects, road construction
3 and repairs, and public infrastructure projects.

4 2. The unlawful action occurred in March 2019 in conjunction with the County's
5 rezoning of approximately 500,000+ acres of land (including the 13,000+ acres of classified and
6 designated mineral resources located therein), without undertaking any environmental review in
7 accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.,
8 "CEQA"), or complying with mineral resources protection requirements under the Surface Mining
9 and Reclamation Act (Pub. Res. Code §§ 2710 et seq., "SMARA").
10 3. The County carried out these actions in conjunction with its approval of the
11 "Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridor" Project ("Project"). The purpose of the Project is to Butler & Mitchell LIP spoBuew Jayef 12 "discourage" development within the approximately 500,000-acre overlay zone, so that mountain
13 lions can roam more freely throughout the County. To accomplish this objective, the County

WENT 14 seeks to implement complicated new framework of land-use regulations that preclude and/or
15 constrain use and development of private lands.

16 4. Instead of undertaking environmental review, the County approved the Project
17 based on CEQA exemptions, asserting that, "it can be seen with certainty that there is no
18 possibility the project may cause a significant effect on the environment." However, the County's
19 approval of the Project violates CEQA and constitutes an unreasonable attempt to expand the

20 CEQA exemption process.

21 5. In approving the Project, the County paid no mind to the State of California
22 Mineral Resources Program and gave no consideration as to how its action-i.e., an
23 approximately 500,000-acre overlay zone intended to prevent disturbance to mountain lions and
24 their habitat by discouraging and restricting development thereon, including land disturbances-
25 will affect the ability to access and extract the 13,000+ acres of classified and designated mineral
26 resources located therein. The Project's implications are significant and will require future land
27 disturbances within the Project area (e.g., mining) to disturb, excavate, and, in some instances,
28 destroy this newly designated habitat.

2 65177698v8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

6. Nor did the County consider how the Project's new habitat overlay zone will affect
2 and conflict with the County's longstanding Mineral Resources Protection overlay zone, which the

3 County enacted to protect, among other things, the 13,000+ acres of State-classified and
4 designated mineral resources now encumbered by the new habitat overlay zone. Thus, the
5 County's approval of the Project failed to consider the interplay between the two overlay zones.

6 However, CEQA precludes lead agencies from undertaking legislative actions without first
7 preparing an environmental impact report to consider how an action of this magnitude will affect

8 all 21 categories of resources protected by CEQA (including mineral resources).
7. Furthermore, due the unique nature of mineral resources, SMARA explicitly

10 requires lead agencies with jurisdiction over mineral resources to comply with certain processes,

er & Mitchell LLP 11 independent from and in addition to any CEQA requirements, prior to approving a project that

NEIND 12 could threaten the potential to extract minerals in that area.

13 8. Mineral resources exist and occur naturally in a fixed location as a result of
14 geologic events that occur over hundreds of thousands of years. Thus, mineral resources cannot

15 simply be replaced or developed at another location. Accordingly, if a regionally significant

16 source of mineral resources is negatively impacted, that region may need to import such resources
17 from more distant locations in other jurisdictions, increasing haulage distances and thereby

18 causing unnecessary environmental impacts in the form of longer truck trips, increased greenhouse
19 gas emissions, and ozone precursors that contribute to global warming. This concept is sometimes
20 referred to as "Distance Matters" and is even discussed in the County's General Plan.

21 9. In order to prevent cities and counties from approving short-sighted land-use
22 actions of this nature, the State of California operates a comprehensive Mineral Resources
23 Program that identifies, classifies, and designates significant mineral resource deposits throughout
24 California. The State's findings are depicted on "Map Sheet 52", which is periodically updated to
25 reflect the sustainability of the State's mineral reserves. (Ex. A.)

26 10. The State also requires that lead agencies considering projects with the potential to

27 threaten the extraction of State-classified minerals to prepare and transmit a statement specifying

28 the reasons (referred to as a "Statement of Reasons") for permitting the proposed project to the

65177698v8 3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

State Geologist and State Mining and Geology Board ("SMGB"), prior to permitting a use which
2 would threaten the potential to extract minerals in that area. (Pub. Res. Code § 2762(d)(1).)

3 11. In addition, if state-designated mineral resources (as opposed to state-classified) are
4|| also proposed for inclusion in a project, as is the case here, the lead agency must include in its
5 Statement of Reasons an analysis balancing mineral values against alternative land uses that

6 considers the importance of these minerals to their market region. (Pub. Res. Code § 2763(a).)
12. Here, the County was required by law to comply with these duties because of the
8 Project's inclusion of more than 13,000 acres of valuable mineral resources that (i) have been
9 classified by the California Division of Mines and Geology (renamed the California Geological
10 Survey in 2006), and (ii) subsequently designated as "regionally significant" by SMGB.
11 13. In January 2019, the State Geologist sent a letter reminding the County of its 9 Butler & Mitchell sje8uew Joyaf 12 obligations under SMARA, including the required preparation and transmittal of a Statement of
13 Reasons prior to any final action on the Project. (Ex. B.) The County responded, asserting that it
WENr 14 was not obligated to comply with SMARA. The State Geologist then sent a second letter to the
15 County, restating that SMARA compliance was in fact required. (Ex. C.) However, the County
16 rejected its obligations and nevertheless approved the Project in violation of SMARA, including
17 sections 2762(d)(1) and 2763(a).

18 14. Although the classification and designation process took the State years to
19 complete, and included the preparation of an environmental impact report in accordance with
20 CEQA, the County contends that it can sweep 13,000 acres of valuable mineral resources into a
21 restrictive overlay zone, without considering the impacts to those resources or complying with
22 SMARA, or making any attempt to balance those potential impacts against the Project's intended
23 benefits of potential habitat.

24 15. However, it was unreasonable and arbitrary for the County to limit its presentation
25 of the Project to only habitat, without considering the "bigger picture." In so doing, the County
26 has disregarded the potential consequences of its actions, such as how the implementation of a
27 restrictive 500,000+ acre overlay zone will impede and affect the extraction of important mineral
28 resources that have been classified and designated by the State of California in accordance with

4 65177698v8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

2 SMARA and CEQA, and the environmental impacts related thereto. The Project's inclusion of

3 13,000+ acres of State-classified and -designated mineral resources presents an unusual

4 circumstance that precludes the County from approving the Project without undertaking
environmental review, based on a CEQA exemption.

16. The Project implements new land-use regulations that preclude and/or constrain use
and development of private lands, including regulations intended to avoid disturbance to the newly

8 designated habitat. Compliance with these new regulations will force certain land development
activities (e.g., mining) to apply for authorization to disturb, excavate, and, in some instances,
9 destroy this newly designated habitat, all of which will, among other things, (i) require redesigned
10 projects with smaller footprints, thereby reducing the amount of mineral resources available for

11
9
Butler & Mitchel Jeffer Mangels extraction, (ii) increase permitting costs, which can jeopardize the economic viability of such
12 development, (iii) cause increased public opposition to the destruction of this newly designated

13

WENT habitat, and (iv) render such activities inconsistent with the new overlay zones imposed through
14 the Project, even though these activities are presently consistent with the existing Mineral

15 Resources Protection overlay zone. The Project's new regulations will thus impede, hamper,
16 preclude, and interfere with access to and extraction of mineral resources, including the 13,000+
17 acres of State-classified and -designated mineral resources located within the Project, which
18 constitutes a significant environmental impact under CEQA and violates the mineral resources
19 protection requirements of SMARA. The Project will also cause additional significant

20

21 environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following: air quality, transportation,
greenhouse gas emissions, land-use planning, and wildfires, including cumulative impacts related

22 thereto.

23 17. The County's approval of the Project was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of
24 multiple procedural and substantive laws, including SMARA and CEQA, and in contravention of
25 the County's "Goals, Policies and Programs" for Mineral Resources. The County's approval is
26 also in excess of the County's local police powers and land use authority, and in conflict with
27 applicable state law.

PARTIES

2 18. California Construction and Industrial Materials Association, or "CalCIMA", is a
3 non-profit organization and trade association for the construction and industrial material industries
4 in California, which include aggregate, industrial minerals, and ready mixed concrete producers.

5 These producers provide people and businesses with cement, concrete, and other materials used to
6 build and repair California's homes, schools, roads, airports, bridges and other public
7- infrastructure. CalCIMA serves its members and the public by providing information on
8 aggregates, industrial minerals, and ready mixed concrete; supplying safety, technical, and
compliance training; and addressing legislative, regulatory, and judicial matters that affect the
10 building materials industry.

11 19.
9 CalCIMA and its members, including those members who operate mines in the
Butler & Mitchell Jeffer Mangels INENS 12 County and hold title to valuable mining properties and rights in the County, have beneficial,
13 operational, environmental, educational, and scientific interests in the Project area and the mineral
14 resources located therein. These interests are germane to CalCIMA's purpose and will be directly
15 and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth herein and
16 which would cause irreversible harm to the natural environment, including mineral resources.
17 CalCIMA and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with
18 SMARA, CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines (14 CCR § 15000 et seq., "Guidelines"), and the County's
19 "Goals, Policies and Programs" for Mineral Resources. Further, the maintenance and prosecution
20 of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the
21 environmental and other harms alleged herein.

22 20. The County is a political subdivision of the State of California, is responsible for
23 regulating and controlling land use in the territory of the County, including implementing and
24 complying with the provisions of CEQA. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of
25 Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducing environmental
26 review of the proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws,
27 including SMARA.

7 JURISDICTION

8 22. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside the County's
decision to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 1085, and
10 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

11 23. Venue for this action properly lies in the Ventura County Superior Court because Mangels Pppkl7, WEN 12 the Project area is located within the County. Many of the significant environmental impacts of the
13 Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would occur in Ventura County, and the Project would
14 impact the interests of Ventura County residents.
15 24. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
16 21167.5 by serving written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on the County
17 on April 25, 2019. A copy of the written notice and proof of service are attached hereto as

2 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

3 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the County to set aside its
approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in
4 effect in violation of state law.

28. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

7 STATUTORY AND LEGAL BACKGROUND

8 29. The California Geological Survey ("CGS", formerly the California Division of
Mines and Geology) and State Mining and Geology Board ("SMGB") are separate divisions of the
10 California Department of Conservation ("DOC") that implement and enforce the State's Mineral

dT |jeypaIW g Jepng r Jeffer Mangels 11 Resources Program that identifies, classifies, and designates significant mineral resource deposits
12 throughout California.

13 30.

JMBM: The Mineral Resources Program includes the identification, classification,
14 designation, and protection of strategically important mineral resources to ensure that

15 necessary

local and regional mineral reserves remain accessible for future development activities, such as
16 homebuilding, road construction and maintenance, and public infrastructure projects, and are not
17 encumbered with land uses that could interfere with the extraction of those resources.

18 31. SMARA requires local agencies with land use jurisdiction over State-classified and
19 -designated mineral resources to prepare and transmit a "Statement of Reasons" for permitting the
20 proposed project to the State Geologist and SMGB, prior to permitting a use which would threaten

21

22 the potential to extract minerals in that area. (Pub. Res. Code § 2762(d)(1).)

32. In addition, if the proposed use includes designated mineral resources (as opposed
23 to only classified resources), the local agency must include in its Statement of Reasons an analysis
24  balancing mineral values against alternative land uses that considers the importance of these
25| minerals to their market region as a whole and not just their importance to the lead agency's area
26 of jurisdiction. (Pub. Res. § Code § 2763(a).)

27 33.

28 decided not to These obligations exist independently and irrespectively of whether an agency has

prepare an environmental document in accordance with CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code

65177698v8 8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

, 2762(d)(1).)

2 34. Furthermore, CEQA protects mineral resources and explicitly requires that a

3 project's impacts to mineral resources be analyzed and considered. Accordingly, Appendix G of

4 the CEQA Guidelines requires local agencies to consider whether a project would:

5 1) Result in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource that would be of value to the region and the residents of the state? 6
2)
7 Result in the loss of availability of a locally-important mineral resources
recovery site delineated on local general plan, specific plan, or other land use plan?
8

9 (Guidelines, App. G, § XII(a)-(b) [Mineral Resources].)
10 35. In an effort to afford additional protection to mineral resources, the County

11
9 previously created its own Thresholds of Significance for mineral resources, modeled after those
Butler & Mitchell spBuey soyal NEINL 12 set forth in the CEQA Guidelines, shown above. The County's Thresholds of Significance for

13 mineral resources are set forth in its Initial Study Assessment Guidelines and provide as follows:
14 1) Any land use or project activity which is proposed to be located on or
15 immediately adjacent to land zoned Mineral Resources Protection (MRP) overlay zone, or adjacent to a principal access road to an existing aggregate
16 Conditional Use Permit (CUP), and which has the potential to hamper or preclude extraction of or access to the aggregate resources, shall be
17 considered to have a significant adverse impact on the environment.

18 2) A project would have a cumulative impact on aggregate resources if when considered with other pending and recently approved projects in the area, hampers or precludes extraction or access to identified resources. 19

20 (Initial Study Assessment Guidelines, p. 21, § D(1)-(2) [Threshold of Significance Criteria].)
21 36. The County also included "Goals, Policies and Programs" for Mineral Resources in
22 its General Plan, including policies that require CEQA review in certain circumstances that are
23 present here. For example, General Plan $ 1.4 mandates that, "All General Plan amendments,
24 zone changes, and discretionary developments shall be evaluated for their individual and
25 cumulative impacts on access to and extraction of recognized mineral resources, in compliance
26 with [CEQA]." (Gen. Plan, p. 17, § 1.4 [Mineral Resources].)

1 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

2 A. The Project

3 37. The purpose of the Project is to "protect biological resources by discouraging"

4 development. (Notice of Exemption ("NOE"), p. 3, § D.1) In order to "discourage" development,

5 the Project will "requir[e] additional environmental review regarding certain development that

6 could impair wildlife movement." (Ibid.) Thus, the County wants to use the Project as a means to
7 make the permitting of certain activities in certain locations more difficult.

8 38. The Project includes the following overlay zones: (i) Habitat Connectivity and
9 Wildlife Corridor ("HCWC"); and (ii) three Critical Wildlife Passage Areas ("CWPAs"). (Ex. F,
10 p. 1, § A.) The three CWPAs are: (i) Oak View; (ii) Simi Hills; and (iii) Tierra Rejada. (Ibid.)
11 The three CWPAs are located within the HCWC. Maps depicting the HCWC and the three Butler & Mitchell LLP speBuew Jayaf 12 CWPAs is attached as Exhibit "G".

13 39. The Project implements land-use regulations applicable to the 500,000+ acres of

WaWL 14 land located within the Project. The regulations will be implemented through amendments to the
15 County's General Plan and Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 18 of the Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance
16 ("NCZO"). (Ex. F, p. 1, § A.)

17 B. Approval of the Project

18 40. The Project was approved in part by a 3-2 vote of the County Board of Supervisors
19 on March 12, 2019, with additional approvals occurring on March 19, 2019. The NOE was filed

20 on March 22, 2019.

21 41. The three Supervisors who voted to approve the Project decided to reject the
22 recommendations of the Planning Commission intended to reduce the scope and severity of the
23 Project's land-use regulations discussed below.

24 42. Although the County acknowledged the Project was subject to CEQA, it
25 nevertheless concluded the Project was exempt from the environmental review requirements of
26 CEQA. The County based its conclusion on the following three exemptions:

27

28
A true and correct copy of the NOE is attached as Exhibit "F". is

65177698v8 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 The "common sense" exemption (CEQA § Guidelines § 15061(b)(3));
2 Actions by Regulatory Agencies to Protect Natural Resources (CEQA Guidelines § 15307); and 3

4 Actions by Regulatory Agencies to Protect the Environment (CEQA Guidelines § 15308).

5 43. The County concluded the Project fit within the common sense exemption at
6 CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) because, "it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility

7 the project may cause a significant effect on the environment." (Ex. F, p. 3, § D.) The County
8 added that, "Here, to the extent the project affects the environmental, the effect is expected to be
9 beneficial since the proposed project will protect biological resources by discouraging and
10 requiring additional environmental review regarding certain development that could impair

Butler & Mitchell uP 11 wildlife movement." (Ibid.)
3o WEINL 12 44. The County also concluded the Project fit within the exemptions for Actions by
13 Regulatory Agencies at CEQA Guidelines §§ 15307 and 15308 because, "the project consists of
14 regulations to benefit the environment"-i.e., mountain lions. (Ex. F, p. 3, § D.)
15 C. Land-Use Regulations Imposed by the Project
16 45. The County approved the NCZO amendments through Ordinances 4537 and 4539.
17 (Ex. F, p. 1, § A.) True and correct copies of Ordinances 4537 and 4539 are attached as Exhibit
18 "H" and are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Ordinance".
19 46. Article 5 on pages 5-6 of the Ordinance includes a chart depicting "Permitted
20 Uses". As depicted on the chart, the Ordinance restricts a landowners' ability to install walls and
21 "wildlife impermeable fencing". The restrictions are intended to ensure wildlife access to property
22 within the HCWC, even if that property is private property inhabited and used by County
23 residents.

24 47. The chart on pages 5-6 of the Ordinance also depicts new restrictions on a
25| landowners' ability to modify vegetation, including the removal or relocation of trees and native
26 vegetation. The restrictions are intended to establish a vegetated network of corridors for
27 mountain lions to travel throughout the County. As discussed below, proposed vegetation
28 modification will now require a permit from the County.

65177698v8 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

48.

3 The Ordinance also imposes lighting restrictions. The lighting restrictions are
2 discussed in Section 8109-4.8.2 on pages 7-13 of the Ordinance. The lighting restrictions
intended to prohibit lights that would discourage mountain lions from accessing and traversing the
4 property located within the 500,000-acre HCWC, including private property. are

49.

6 In addition, the Ordinance restricts a landowners' ability to perform any

8 "development" within 200 feet of a "Surface Water Feature". A Surface Water Feature is "[1] an

9 area containing a stream (including intermittent and ephemeral), creek, river, wetland, seep,
pond, [2] the riparian habitat area associated with the feature, as well as [3] a development buffer
area that is 200 feet measured from the farthest extent of the surface water feature and its or

9 11

Butler & Mitchell Jeffer Mangels 10 associated riparian area." (Ex. H, p. 2.) "Development" subject to the 200 foot "development

13 buffer area" includes any structures and wildlife impermeable fencing proposed for location within
12 a Surface Water Feature. (Id.,

50. 13, § 8109-4.8.3.1.a.)

JMBM& 14 To summarize, owners of property located within the HCWC will be subject to
lighting restrictions and will need to obtain permits to "develop" property located within the
15 Project, including the installation of fencing or walls or the modification of vegetation, and will be
16 subject to additional restrictions on activities located within the 200 foot "development buffer
17 area" of a "Surface Water Feature".

18 D.

19 51.

20 The New Discretionary Permitting Process and "Development Guidelines"
As previously stated, the purpose of the Project is to "protect biological resources
by discouraging" development. (Ex. F, p. 3, § D.) In order to "discourage" development, the
21 Project will "requir[e] additional environmental review regarding certain development that could
22 impair wildlife movement." (Ibid.)

23 52.

24 discussed in Section 8109-4.8.3.8 on page 22 of the Ordinance.
25 53. The "additional environmental review" and new discretionary permitting process is

Section 8109-4.8.3.8.a requires an applicant to submit information, including
26 environmental and technical studies, that analyze a project's impacts on wildlife habitat and may
27 also require, "Additional information and study
28 Act or other applicable law." (Ex. H, § 8109-4.8.3.8.a.)

65177698v8 under the California Environmental Quality

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 54. In addition, the applicant must also comply with the "development guidelines"
2 listed in 8109-4.8.3.8.b, which requires the following:

3 (1) "Development should be sited and conducted outside the applicable setback

4 areas set forth in Sections 8109-4.8.3.4 and 8109-4.8.3.5 [(including Surface Water Features)] to

5 the extent feasible;

6 (2) Development should be sited and conducted to minimize the removal and
7 disturbance of biological resources, landscape features and undeveloped areas that have the
8 potential to support functional connectivity and wildlife movement;

9 (3) Development should be sited and conducted to provide the largest possible
10 contiguous undeveloped portion of land; and

11 (4) Wildlife impermeable fencing should be sited and designed to minimize dm Ipypuw g epng spßuew Jayaf INEINÍ 12 I potential impacts to wildlife movement."

13 (Ex. H, § 8109-4.8.3.8.b.)

14 55. Thus, Section 8109-4.8.3.8 and the "development guidelines" imposed therein
15 require development to be sited and conducted in a manner that avoids wildlife habitat and
16 disturbance thereto, including land located within a surface water feature, and requires the
17 County's decisionmakers to exercise their discretion whether to grant or deny a permit in
18 compliance with those requirements.

19 E. The Project's Inclusion of Approximately 13,000 Acres of Classified and
20 Designated Mineral Resources

21 56. In 1981, multiple areas of the County were classified as "MRZ-2" areas by the
22 California Division of Mines and Geology (renamed the California Geological Survey in 2006).
23 MRZ-2 areas are areas of land in which known economic mineral deposits are located.
24 57. In 1982, 10 "sectors" of the County's MRZ-2 areas (Sectors A-J) were designated
25 as "regionally significant" mineral resource areas by the SMGB, which led to the preparation of
26 maps depicting the locations of these areas. An EIR was certified in conjunction with the
27 designation of these 10 sectors.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

58. The Project will include approximately 13,000 acres of MRZ-2 areas. This
2 amounts to approximately 41% of the County's supply of MRZ-2 areas.

3 59. The Project will also include portions of these MRZ-2 areas that have been
4 designated as regionally significant mineral resource sectors (i.e., Sectors A-J).

5 60. In addition, the Project will include multiple mining properties, including existing
6 operations.

7 61. In January 2019, the State Geologist sent a letter reminding the County of its
8 obligations under SMARA, including the required preparation and transmittal of a Statement of
9 Reasons prior to any final action on the Project. (Ex. A.) The County responded, asserting that it
10 was not obligated to comply with SMARA. Then, the State Geologist sent a second letter to the
11
Butler & Mitchell LIP County, stating that SMARA compliance was in fact required. (Ex. B.) However, the County
sje8uew Jayaf 12 rejected its obligations and nevertheless approved the Project in violation sections 2762(d)(1)
13 and 2763(a) of SMARA.

14 F. The Second Mountain Lion Corridor and County General Plan Update WENS 15 62. The Project has caused significant controversy and has left many landowners and
16 interested parties wondering why a legislative action of this magnitude was not subjected to
17 environmental review in conjunction with the County's ongoing General Plan update, which will
18  be analyzed in a full environmental impact report.
19 63. In addition, the County is separately presently processing a second mountain lion
20 corridor in the coastal area of the County. As previously discussed, the Project necessitated an
21 amendment to its Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance; but, the Project does not include the coastal 1
22 lands within the County, which are regulated under the County's Coastal Zoning Ordinance.
23 Thus, instead of processing one mountain lion corridor, the County has broken the corridor into
24 multiple pieces.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

65177698v8 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

65. SMARA requires local agencies with land use jurisdiction over State-classified and
2 -designated mineral resources to prepare and transmit a Statement of Reasons specifying its

3 reasons for permitting the proposed project to the State Geologist and SMGB, prior to permitting a

4 use which would threaten the potential to extract minerals in that area. (Pub. Res. Code

5 § 2762(d)(1).) In addition, if the proposed use includes designated mineral resources (as opposed
analysis 6 to only classified resources), the local agency must include in its Statement of Reasons an
7 balancing mineral values against alternative land uses that considers the importance of these
8 minerals to their market region as a whole and not just their importance to the lead agency's area
9 of jurisdiction. (Pub. Res. Code § 2763(a).)
10 66. Despite the Project's inclusion of approximately 13,000 acres of classified and

m IlaypuW g Jepna 11 designated mineral resources, and two letters from the State Geologist reminding the County of its
Jeffer Mangels 12 affirmative obligations under SMARA, including the preparation and transmittal of a Statement of
13 Reasons, the County rejected its duties and nevertheless approved the Project.
14 67. The County's approval of the Project without complying with its duties under WENE 15 SMARA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for which there is no other
16 adequate remedy at law available to Petitioner.
17 68. Further, to the extent the County concluded that the Project would not threaten the
18 potential to extract some of all of the 13,000+ acres of classified and designated mineral resources
19 included therein, that conclusion constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for
20 which there is no other adequate remedy at law available to Petitioner.
21 69. If the County is not enjoined from implementing the Project, Petitioner and the
22 public will suffer irreparable harm.

23 70. Petitioner desires a judicial declaration and determination of the parties' respective
24 rights and duties in respect to the Project and the Ordinance. A judicial declaration is necessary
25 and appropriate at this time to eliminate uncertainties and controversies regarding the matters
26 alleged herein.

72. "County .. . zoning ordinances shall be consistent with the general plan". (Gov.

6 Code § 65860(a).) "A zoning ordinance shall be consistent with a . .. general plan only if ... [t]he
various land uses authorized by the ordinance are compatible with the objectives, policies, general

14 Spring Valley at 101 (citing Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange (2005) 131 WENL 15 Cal.App.4th 777, 782).

16 74. The County's General Plan includes "Goals, Policies and Programs" for Mineral
17 Resources, including policies that require CEQA review in certain circumstances that are present
18 here. For example, General Plan § 1.4 mandates that, "All General Plan amendments, zone

19 changes, and discretionary developments shall be evaluated for their individual and cumulative
20 impacts on access to and extraction of recognized mineral resources, in compliance with
21 [CEQA]." (Gen. Plan, p. 17, § 1.4 [Mineral Resources].)

23 General Plan amendment. Thus, General Plan 1.4 mandates that the Project's impacts to access 22 75. The Project is a discretionary action that included a (i) zone change, and (ii)

24 and extraction of recognized mineral resources be evaluated in accordance with CEQA. The
25 County's failure to perform the required evaluation prior to approval constitutes a violation of a
65860(a). 26 mandatory policy in violation of Government Code section

3  to analyze the Project's individual and cumulative impacts on access to and extraction of

4 recognized mineral resources in accordance with CEQA, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process

6 77. Further, to the extent the County concluded that the Project would not threaten the

7 access and extraction of some or all of the 13,000+ acres of classified and designated mineral

19 80. Paragraphs 1-79 are hereby incorporated by reference.
20 81. A lead agency can only invoke the common sense exemption when it can be seen
21 "with certainty" there is "no possibility" a project may cause a significant effect on the
22 environment. (Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).)

23 82. Categorical exemptions shall be narrowly construed and not unreasonably
24 expanded. (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190.) The applicability of a categorical

83. The County has failed to demonstrate that the common sense exemption
2 (Guidelines § 15061(b)(3)), and the Class 7 and 8 categorical exemptions (Guidelines §§ 15307,
3 15308), apply to the Project. The County's approval of the Project--i.e., a 500,000+ acre overlay
4 zone-based on a CEQA exemption is unprecedented and far exceeds the scope and intent of
5 these exemptions.

6 84. Further, in approving the Project, the County ignored applicable provisions of the
7 General Plan and Initial Study Assessment Guidelines prescribing that projects of certain types are
8 presumed to cause significant environmental impacts.
9 85. In addition, the Project will cause significant environmental impacts and therefore,
10 does not qualify for any of these categorical exemptions. The categories of significant

Butler & Mitchell uLP 11 environmental impacts that will be caused by the Project include but are not limited to the
sjaBuey) Joyal 12 following: mineral resources, air quality, transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, land-use
13 planning, and wildfires, including cumulative impacts related thereto.
14 86. The County's approval of the Project based on these exemptions constitutes a WENL 15 prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for which there is no other adequate remedy at law

20 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief - CCP §§ 1060, 1085, 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code § 21168 - Violations of CEQA (Piecemealing)) 21

22 88. Paragraphs 1-87 are hereby incorporated by reference.

23 89. "Environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large
24 project into many little ones- each with minimal potential impact on the environment-which
25 cumulatively may have disastrous consequences". (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents

90. The County is separately processing a second mountain lion corridor in the coastal
2 area of the County. That corridor, and the Project, should have been processed as one "project",
3 and subjected to environmental review, rather than split into pieces. The County's division of the
4 corridor into multiple, smaller sections violates CEQA's prohibition of "piecemealing".
91. The County's approval of the Project, when it was concurrently processing, or knew

6 it would be processing, a second corridor, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of process and discretion
7 for which there is no other adequate remedy at law available to Petitioner.
92. If the County is not enjoined from implementing the Project, Petitioner and the

10 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief - CCP §§ 1060, 1085, 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code § Mangels lefte argebnel ue WENL 21168 - Violations of CEQA (Guidelines §§ 15300.2(b), 15300.2(c)) 12

13 93. Paragraphs 1-92 are hereby incorporated by reference.
14 94. The applicability of a CEQA exemption is subject to the exceptions set forth in
15 Guidelines section 15300.2. (Guidelines § 15061(b)(2).)
16 95. The "Significant Effect" exception at Guidelines section 15300.2(b) precludes the
17 use of a CEQA exemption as follows: "A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
18 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
19 I environment due to unusual circumstances." (Guidelines § 15300.2(c).)
20 96. The "Cumulative Impact" exception at Guidelines section 15300.2(b) precludes the
21 use of a CEQA exemption as follows: "All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
22 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
23 I significant". (Guidelines § 15300.2(b).)

24 97. The Project's inclusion of 13,000+ acres of classified and designated mineral
25 resources presents an unusual circumstance that precludes the County from approving the Project
26 without undertaking environmental review, based on a CEQA exemption. Furthermore, the
27 Project will cause significant environmental impacts as a result of these unusual circumstances,
28 including but not limited to the following: mineral resources, air quality, transportation,

98.

3 Further, these impacts will be rendered cumulatively significant due to the County's

99. The County's approval of the Project based on a CEQA exemption constitutes a

6 prejudicial abuse of process and discretion for which there is no other adequate remedy at law

Re: Ventura County Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridor Project PL16-0127

Dear Ms. Batinica:
As the acting California State Geologist with the California Geological Survey, I submit this letter in response to the County of Ventura's (County) proposal to amend its General Plan and its Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance, which would establish a Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors Overlay Zone and a Critical Wildlife Passage Areas Overlay Zone, both hereinafter
referred to as the "Project." If the Project is approved, additional permitting restrictions would
apply to certain proposed development projects within the Project's Overlay Zones.
Because the Project's Overlay Zones include areas that have been both classified by the California Geological Survey (CGS) and designated by the State Mining and Geology Board (SMGB) as containing mineral deposits having "regional or statewide significance" under Public Resources Code section 2761, subdivision (b)(2) (also referred to as "MRZ-2 Zones"), CGS is concerned that the additional permitting restrictions do not appear to protect and conserve
mineral resources but may threaten the potential to extract minerals in the Project's Overlay
Zones.
Before a lead agency permits a use that would threaten the potential to extract minerals in a classified MRZ-2 Zone, a lead agency is required to provide "a statement specifying its reasons for permitting the proposed use, and shall forward a copy to the State Geologist and the board for review." However, CGS has not received any statement or notice from the County regarding the Project. In addition, CGS has inquired with the SMGB to determine if the SMGB has received any statement or notice regarding the approval of the Project as concerns those areas designated by the SMGB as an MRZ-2 Zone, and they indicate they have not.
It is the recommendation of CGS that prior to the approval of the Project, the County consider the impacts of the proposed Project on the County's Minerals Management Policies and provide the appropriate statement of reasons for approval pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 2762 and 2763 in light of the Project's impacts affecting those areas within the Project that have been classified and designated as MRZ-2 Zones.

A. Project Description: ByF. Ocampo , Deputy

The project, Ventura County Planning Division Case No. PL16-0127, consists of amendments to the Ventura County General Plan (General Plan) and Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 18 of the Ventura County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance (NCZO) to establish a Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors (HCWC) overlay zone and a Critical Wildlife Passage Areas (CWPA) overlay zone and to adopt regulations therein as approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on March 19, 2019.
Ordinance/Resolution Numbers: The project consists of Ventura County Ordinance No. 4537 (amending Articles 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 of the NCZO), Ordinance No. 4539 (amending Article 18 of the NCZO), and Resolution Nos. 19-15 and 19-16 (amending General Plan)

(1) Minimize habitat fragmentation;
(2) Maintain corridor widths or enhance corridor "chokepoints" to facilitate species movement between natural areas. (A chokepoint is defined as a narrow, impacted, or otherwise tenuous wildlife movement corridor or
linkage);

(3) Minimize physical barriers to wildlife movement (e.g., roads, fences, etc.);
and

(4) Minimize indirect barriers to wildlife movement (e.g., lighting, domestic animals, human presence, etc.).

The project consists of the following legislative actions:
(1) Amending the General Plan, Resources Appendix, to add background information related to habitat connectivity and wildlife corridors that are identified in four maps consisting of the HCWC map and three CWPA maps;
(2) Updating the background information on biological resources (Section 1.5 of the General Plan Goals, Policies, and Programs [GPPJ]) as it relates to habitat connectivity and wildlife corridors;
(3) Updating the Goals and Policies in Section 1.5 of the General Plan (GPP -
Biological Resources);
(4) Updating the General Plan's GPP Glossary to include terms necessary to improve clarity and consistency;

(5) Amending the NCZO (Articles 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9) to add regulatory standards and new permitting requirements to address a range of potential development within the HCWC and CWPA overlay zones; and
(6) Amending the NCZO (Article 18) to rezone lots for inclusion in the HCWC and, for some of these parcels, inclusion in the CWPA overlay zone.

Notice of Exemption
Case No. PL16-0127
Page 3 of 3

D. Explanation for Exemption: The project is exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3), because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility the project may cause a significant effect on the environment. "Significant effect on the environment" is defined by the California Public Resources Code as "a substantial, potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Cal. Pub. Resources Code, § 21068 [emphasis added].) Here, to the extent the project affects the environment, the effect is expected to be beneficial since the proposed project will protect biological resources by discouraging and requiring additional environmental review regarding certain development that could impair wildlife movement.
Because the project consists of regulations to benefit the environment, it is also exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15307 and 15308, Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of Natural Resources and Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment, respectively. These two classes of exemptions consist of actions taken by regulatory agencies to assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource or the
environment. The project meets these criteria as explained abové.
The project is not excepted from the above-stated categorical CEQA exemptions on the basis of unusual circumstances or any other exception set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2. In particular: (1) no substantial evidence supports a finding that the project presents unusual circumstances that differ from the general circumstances of other categorically exempt actions by regulatory agencies for the protection of the environment and natural resources; and (2) no substantial evidence
exists creating a reasonable possibility that the project would have a significant effect on the environment due to such unusual circumstances. In addition, no substantial evidence exists establishing that the project would have a significant effect on the environment.

ORDINANCE TO REGULATE DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE HABITAT
CONNECTIVITY AND WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND THE CRITICAL WILDLIFE
PASSAGE AREAS OVERLAY ZONES

The Board of Supervisors of the County of Ventura ("County") ordains as follows:

Section 1
Article 2:
DEFINITIONS

Article 2, Section 8102-0 - Application of Definitions, of the Ventura County Ordinance Code is hereby amended to add the following definitions in appropriate alphabetical order:

Agricultural Water Impoundment - A human-made surface water source used for
livestock watering or other agriculturaLpurposes.(e.g.,agricultural reservoir), also referred to as farm pond or livestock pond, in which water supply is primarily fed by
sources other than natural processes such as groundwater seep or precipitation.
Conservation Organization - A public conservation organization is a federal, state or local agency responsible for protecting and managing natural resources and includes
but is not limited to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Quality Control Board,
California Department of Parks and Recreation, National Park Service and Ventura
County Watershed Protection District. A private conservation organization is one
operating under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with the primary purpose of preserving and protecting land in its natural, scenic, historical, recreational or open space condition.
Fuel Modification - A method of modifying fuel load by reducing the amount of non-fire resistive vegetation or altering the type of vegetation to reduce the fuel load. Fire resistive vegetation is that which does not readily ignite from a flame or other ignition
source.

Functional Connectivity - The degree to which a physical setting (i.e., natural landscape and built environment) facilitates or impedes the movement of organisms. Functional
connectivity is a product of both the features of the physical setting (e.g., vegetation, physical development) and the behavioral response of plants and animals to these physical features.

Invasive Plant - Any species of plant included on the California Invasive Plant Council Invasive Plant Checklist for California Landscaping, as may be amended (http://www.cal-lpc.org/plants/inventory/).

Restoration Project - A project that involves the manipulation of the physical, chemical,
or biological characteristics of a site to re-establish the site's natural or historic habitat, species, or ecological functions. It may include the re-establishment of habitat at sites where ecological function was wholly or partially lost or degraded.
Riparian/Riparian Area/Riparian Habitat Area - The bank of a stream, creek or river.
Riparian habitat is the aquatic and terrestrial habitats that occur along streams, creeks
and rivers.

Surface Water Feature - An area containing a stream (including intermittent and
ephemeral), creek, river, wetland, seep, or pond, the riparian habitat area associated
with the feature, as well as a development buffer area that is 200 feet as measured from
the farthest extent of the surface water feature and its associated riparian area. The data used to designate the areas are obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Dataset. Areas designated as surface water features are shown on the "Surface Water Feature Buffer" map within the Planning GIS Wildlife Corridor layer of the County of Ventura - County View Geographic Information System (GIS), as may be amended by the Planning Director. The term surface water feature does not include ponds, lakes, marshes, wetlands or agricultural water impoundments or associated riparian habitat areas that are legally established and human-made.
Vegetation - Native and nonnative trees and plant communities such as grassland,
coastal scrub, riparian vegetation, and chaparral, including invasive plants. The term vegetation does not include human-planted landscaping associated with legally established development or commercial agricultural products.

Vegetation Modification - Human-caused alteration of vegetation through direct actions including, but not limited to, complete removal, mowing, thinning, or chaining.
Wildlife Crossing Structure - A structure such as a culvert, bridge or underpass
containing features that enhance its suitability for use by wildlife to safely cross human- made barriers such as roadways and highways. Examples of such features include the presence of vegetation providing cover or habitat near the entrances and/or natural light
visible at the opposite entrance. The locations of the wildlife crossing structures are
shown on the "Wildlife Crossing Structures" map within the Planning GIS Wildlife
Corridor layer of the County of Ventura, County View Geographic Information System
(GIS), as may be amended by the Planning Director. The term wildlife crossing
structures does not include cattle guards.

Wildlife Impermeable Fencing - A fence or a wall, other than a retaining wall, that
prevents various species of wildlife including amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds, from freely passing through with little or no interference. Except for gates and

2

associated gate support components, a fence that includes one or more of the following design features is considered wildlife impermeable fencing:
(1) Any fence that is higher than 60 inches above grade, inclusive of any wire
strands placed above a top rail of a fence.
(2) Any electric fence comprised of any material or number of electrified strands.
(3) Any fence that is constructed of wrought iron, plastic mesh, woven wire, razor wire, or chain link or that consists entirely of a solid surface, such as cinderblock.

Article 4:
PURPOSES OF ZONES

Article 4, Section 8104-7 - Overlay Zones, of the Ventura County Ordinance Code is
hereby amended by adding a new Section 8104-7.7 - Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors Overlay Zone, and a new Section 8104-7.8 - Critical Wildlife Passage Areas Overlay Zone, to read as follows:

3

Section 8104-7.7 - Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors Overlay
Zone
The general purposes of the Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors overlay zone
are to preserve functional connectivity for wildlife and vegetation throughout the
overlay zone by minimizing direct and indirect barriers, minimizing loss of vegetation
and habitat fragmentation and minimizing impacts to those areas that are narrow, impacted or otherwise tenuous with respect to wildlife movement. More specifically,
the purposes of the Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors overlay zone include
the following:

a. Minimize the indirect impacts to wildlife created by outdoor lighting, such
as disorientation of nocturnal species and the disruption of mating,
feeding, migrating, and the predator-prey balance.

b. Preserve the functional connectivity and habitat quality of surface water features, due to the vital role they play in providing refuge and resources for wildlife.

C. Protect and enhance wildlife crossing structures to help facilitate safe wildlife passage.

d. Minimize the introduction of invasive plants, which can increase fire risk,
reduce water availability, accelerate erosion and flooding, and diminish
biodiversity within an ecosystem.

e. Minimize wildlife impermeable fencing, which can create barriers to food
and water, shelter, and breeding access to unrelated members of the
same species needed to maintain genetic diversity.

Section 8104-7.8 - Critical Wildlife Passage Areas Overlay Zone
There are three critical wildlife passage areas that are located entirely within the boundaries of the larger Habitat Connectivity and Wildlife Corridors overlay zone. These areas are particularly critical for facilitating wildlife movement due to any of the following: (1) the existence of intact native habitat or other habitat with important
beneficial values for wildlife; 2) proximity to water bodies or ridgelines; 3) proximity to critical roadway crossings; 4) likelihood of encroachment by future development which could easily disturb wildlife movement and plant dispersal; or 5) presence of non-urbanized or undeveloped lands within a geographic location that connects core
a habitats at a regional scale.

Section 8109-4.8.3.6 - Wildlife Impermeable Fencing - Permitting
Requirements
a. Unless otherwise exempt pursuant to Sec. 8109-4.8.3.7, this Sec. 8109- 4.8.3.6 applies to the installation of new or replacement wildlife impermeable fencing that forms an enclosed area on lots zoned Open Space (OS) or Agricultural Exclusive (AE), including installation of wildlife
impermeable fencing to facilitate livestock grazing. The standards and
requirements of Sec. 8106-8.1 (Fences, Walls and Hedges), as may be

19

amended, also apply to wildlife impermeable fencing subject to this Sec.
8109-4.8.3.6.

b. Installation of wildlife impermeable fencing subject to this Sec. 8109- 4.8.3.6 requires a Zoning Clearance issued pursuant to Sec. 8111-1.1 if the wildlife impermeable fencing forms an enclosed area that does not exceed the following limits:
(1) For lots with no wildlife impermeable fencing forming an enclosed area installed as of [ordinance effective date], the cumulative area enclosed by the proposed wildlife impermeable fencing does not exceed 10 percent of the gross lot area; or
(2) For lots with existing wildlife impermeable fencing forming an enclosed area installed as of [ordinance effective date], the cumulative area
enclosed by the proposed wildlife impermeable fencing does not exceed 10 percent of the lot area net of the area enclosed by existing wildlife impermeable fencing. For example, if a 10-acre lot includes wildlife impermeable fencing that existed prior to [the ordinance effective date] and encloses a total area of one acre, the cumulative
area enclosed by any new wildlife impermeable fencing proposed to be installed after [the ordinance effective date] may not exceed 0.9 acres,
or 10 percent of nine acres.
c. Installation of wildlife impermeable fencing subject to this Sec. 8109-4.8.3 requires a Planning Director-approved Planned Development Permit
pursuant to Sec. 8111-1.2 if the wildlife impermeable fencing forms an
enclosed area as follows:

(1) For lots with no wildlife impermeable fencing forming an enclosed area installed as of [ordinance effective date], the cumulative area enclosed by the proposed wildlife impermeable fencing is greater than 10 percent of the gross lot area; or
(2) For lots with existing wildlife impermeable fencing forming an enclosed area installed as of [ordinance effective date], the cumulative area
enclosed by the proposed wildlife impermeable fencing is greater than 10 percent of the lot area net of the area enclosed by existing wildlife impermeable fencing. For example, if a 10-acre lot includes wildlife impermeable fencing that existed prior to [the ordinance effective date] and encloses a total area of one acre, the cumulative area enclosed by any new wildlife impermeable fencing proposed to be installed after [the ordinance effective date] that exceeds 0.9 acres, or 10 percent of nine acres, would require a Planning Director-approved Planned
Development Permit.

This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the a case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check 1, the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper.

To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort
damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment.
The identification of case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action.
