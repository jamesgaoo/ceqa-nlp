Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page of 23

/1

Petitioner Buena Vista Water Storage District ("Buena Vista" or "Petitioner") brings this
2 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief (Petition) and

3 alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") [Cal. Pub. Res.
6 Code §g 21000, et seq.] and the Guidelines implementing the same [14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000,

7 et seq.], Buena Vista brings this action on behalf of itself and on behalf of the landowners and

8 water users within its boundaries. This Petition challenges the actions by Respondent Kern Water
9 Bank Authority (*Respondent" or "KWBA") approving and/or adopting the Final Environmental
10 Impact Report (FEIR) on the Kern Water Bank Authority Conservation and Storage Project
11 ("Project"), and its decision to implement the Project described therein.

12 2. The Project substantially and significantly changes historic Kern River operations,
13 practices and sharing. The Project will result in a change in ownership, place of use, and purpose

14 of use of a significant quantity of Kern River water. The Project will potentially deprive Buena
15 Vista and others of significant quantities of high quality, pristine Kern River water. At a minimum,
16| the Project will potentially result in a reduction to Buena Vista's Kern River water supply and
17 rights, a depletion of groundwater resources within Buena Vista's boundaries, an increased rate of
18 groundwater overdraft, increased pumping costs, decreased water quality and the loss of prime
19 agricultural lands. In short, the Project will have significant or potentially significant long-term
20 adverse impacts on Buena Vista, the groundwater basin, and the environment, which impacts have

21 yet to be identified, analyzed, evaluated, or even considered in a full, complete and adequate

22 environmental document in compliance with CEQA.

23 3. Buena Vista brings this action as a result of Respondent's failure to comply with
24 CEQA. Respondent's FEIR fails to meet CEQA requirements for the reasons stated in this
25 Complaint/Petition which include (i) failure to adequately describe the Project; (ii) failure to fully
26 identify, evaluate and disclose the reasonably foreseeable effects of the Project upon the
27| environment; (iii) failure to adequately describe the environmental or baseline conditions; (iv)
28 failure to adequately consider alternatives and mitigation measures; (v) failure to adequately

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 2 of 23

:

consider cumulative impacts; (vi) failure to adequately respond to comments; and (vii) failure to
2 revise and recirculate the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") when clearly required by
CEQA. In each of these respects, among others raised in this Petition, Respondent's certification
of the FEIR and approval of the Project results in a clear violation of CEQA. Respondent's
5 actions, taken without support of substantial evidence and over the strenuous objection of Buena
6 Vista and others, were arbitrary and capricious, violated the law, and constitute an abuse of

discretion.

8 4. Insofar as is material to this action, Buena Vista has continuously maintained public
9 projects for diversion, delivery, groundwater replenishment, storage and use of water for beneficial
10 use within its boundaries. Buena Vista stores and pumps groundwater existing in a common and
11 interconnected groundwater basin shared by Buena Vista and the KWB, for one or more of the
12 following purposes: irrigation, stock watering and other reasonable and beneficial uses. Buena
13 Vista is the owner of certain Kern River water rights, and Buena Vista has a 2nd priority right to use
14 the KWB for the recharge and/or recovery of water. Buena Vista is informed and believes, and
15 based thereon alleges, that the Project will substantially and significantly affect Buena Vista's pre-
16 existing water rights, and its ability to utilize its and priority rights in the KWB which will affect
17 groundwater levels underlying lands within the boundaries of Buena Vista and underlying other
18 public projects in which Buena Vista participates; the amount of groundwater available to and
19 recoverable by Buena Vista; the cost of such recovery; the quality of groundwater available to
20 Buena Vista; the historical hydraulic gradients within the Kern River alluvial fan area; and the
21| environment of the region. Buena Vista is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
22 Project will potentially deprive Buena Vista and its landowners and water users of significant
23| quantities of water, water recharge and recovery capacity, and will otherwise have significant or
24 potentially significant long-term adverse impacts upon the environment within the boundaries of

25 Buena Vista, the groundwater basin shared by Buena Vista and the KWB, and the environment,
26 none of which consequences were adequately evaluated in the FEIR, or in any other environmental
27 document in compliance with CEQA.

5. Buena Vista is beneficially interested in Respondent's compliance with its duties
2 and responsibilities under applicable laws, including CEQA. Buena Vista is beneficially interested
3 in Respondent's performance of its duties to apply all applicable laws and consider rationally and

4 in good faith all record evidence in deciding whether to approve public projects.

6. Through this action Buena Vista seeks a writ of mandate commanding Respondent
to set aside its certification of the FEIR for the Project, its approval of the Project based thereon, its
7 implementation of the Project in whole or in part, and related relief. Buena Vista, as well as its
8 landowners and water users, will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the Court does not grant

9| the requested relief. Buena Vista also seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction barring
10 Respondent from undertaking any activity with regard to the Project and any activity which could
11 potentially alter the physical and natural environment in Kern County, pending proper and
12| complete environmental review as required by CEQA.

13 7. This action involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
14 Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
15 without limitation landowners and water users within Buena Vista, and will result in the
16 enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with all legal
17 requirements applicable to the Project, including CEQA.

15 believes, and based thereon alleges, that insofar as is material to this action, KCWA is presently
16 and has been, at all times relevant hereto, a member and participant in the KWBA on behalf of
17 ID4.

18 17. Buena Vista is unaware of the true names and capacities of DOES through 100
19 and therefore sue such persons, entities and organizations by these fictitious names. Buena Vista is
20 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that those persons, entities and organizations
21 fictitiously-named herein have an interest in the matters alleged in this action. When the true
22| identities and capacities of said persons, entities and organizations have been determined, Buena
23| Vista will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and
24 capacities.

common and interconnected groundwater basin, and the environment, all located within the County

5 of Kern.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 20. Buena Vista has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions

8 precedent to the filing of this Petition, including compliance with Public Resources Code §21177,
and have fully exhausted all administrative remedies in that the determination by Respondent is
10 final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by state or local law. Buena

11 Vista and other members of the public presented their specific objections to the decisions of the
12 KWBA at the public meetings, hearings and/or through written comments submitted to
13 Respondent.

14 21. KWBA took final action with respect to its approval of the Project and, on
15 December 14, 2018, filed a Notice of Determination purportedly in compliance with CEQA. A
16 true and correct copy of the Notice of Determination is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and is
17 incorporated herein by this reference.

18 22. This action is brought within thirty (30) days of the filing of the Notice of

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 7 of 23

25. On January 14, 2019, Buena Vista furnished the Attorney General of the State of
2 California (Attorney General) with a copy of the Petition in accordance with the requirements of

3 CEQA, and more specifically, Public Resources Code §21167.7. A true and correct copy of the

4 form of the notice to the Attorney General (without attachment) is attached hereto as Exhibit "C"

5 and is incorporated herein by this reference.

6 26. Concurrent with the service of the Petition in this action, Buena Vista served on
Respondent a request for preparation of the administrative record relating to this action in
8 accordance with the requirements of CEQA, and more specifically, Public Resources Code
9 §21167.6.

10 ATTORNEYS' FEES

11 27. Buena Vista is entitled to recover attorneys' fees from Respondent pursuant to Code

12 of Civil Procedure $1021.5 because this action will, among other things, confer a significant
13 benefit on the general public and a large class of persons, and the necessity and burden of private
14 enforcement makes an award of fees appropriate.

15 FACTUAL HISTORY

16 [Kern River Water Rights]

17 28. The Kern River is a natural stream or watercourse originating in the Sierra Nevada
18 range in Central California and discharging its flows in the southern San Joaquin Valley. The Kern

19 River then flows to the southwest' through Bakersfield, California, to a point approximately 20
20 miles distant where in wet years it turns northwest and flows toward Tulare Lake.

21 29. Since the late 1800's and continuously until the present, virtually all natural flow of

22 the Kern River has been fully appropriated to reasonable and beneficial uses both north and south
23 of the Kern River channel.

24 30. Kern River water right holders and/or diverters generally fall into one of three
25 groups, to wit: "First Point Group" which consists of Kern Delta Water District, North Kern Water
26 Storage District, and the City of Bakersfield; "Second Point Group" which, through mesne
27| conveyances, has been consolidated into Buena Vista"; and "Lower River" or "Downstream
28 Group" which, through mesne conveyances, has been consolidated into the KCWA.

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 8 of 23

31. Buena Vista owns, holds and exercises Second Point Kern River water rights.

2 32. Since approximately 1924, Buena Vista has exercised its Kern River water rights on

3 a daily basis to provide water to landowners and water users within its boundaries. Buena Vista.
4 comprises approximately 50,000 acres lying nearly 16 miles west of the City of Bakersfield. The
5 lands within Buena Vista are made up largely of reclaimed swamp lands located in and along the
pre-development course of the lower Kern River which, after exiting the Southern Sierra Nevada
mountains near Bakersfield and flowing south and then southwest across the southern San Joaquin

8 Valley, runs through the topographic axis of the valley toward its ultimate terminus at a drainage
9 basin which was once Tulare Lake.

10 33. The Kern River was formally designated as a river with fully appropriated status by
11 the State Water Board in 1989 (Order 89-25) which cited State Water Rights Board Decision 1196
12 (D-1196), issued on October 29, 1964, concluding that the applicants had failed to show "that there
13 is unappropriated water available" in the Kern River watershed.

14 34. The First Point Kern River water rights owned, held and exercised by Kern Delta
15 Water District were recently adjudicated in North Kern Water Storage District v. Kern Delta Water
16 District (2007) 147 Cal.App.4™n 555. In that litigation it was determined that some rights, during
17 some months, had been underutilized resulting in partial forfeiture. As a result, the California State
18 Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) began proceedings to revisit the Kern River
19 fully appropriated stream status and in 2010, the State Water Board issued an order removing the
20 fully appropriated status for the Kern River.

21 35. In anticipation of that decision, the KWBA filed a water right application
22 (Application 31676) with the State Water Board to appropriate up to 500,000 acre-feet per year

23 (AFY) of high-flow water from the Kern River to the KWB.

24 [Kern Water Bank Second Priority Rights]

25 36. Respondent KWBA is a Joint Powers Authority made up of five public agencies and
26 one private mutual water company (which are also Real Parties in Interest). The KWBA owns,
27 operates and uses the KWB, a massive groundwater banking operation in Kern County. According
28 to the KWBA, the KWB is the largest direct-recharge water banking project in the world, the

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 9 of 23

primary purpose of which is to recharge, store, and recover water to improve the water supply for

2 its participants during periods of water shortages.

3 37. In 1994, the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and some of the
State Water Project Contractors ("Contractors") executed the Monterey Agreement, an agreement
5 which included provisions to modify the long-term water supply contracts and, in pertinent part, to
6 sell or lease the KWB property to designated Contractors.

38. The modifications were incorporated into the long-term water supply contracts in
what became known as the Monterey Amendment.
o| 39. As part of the Monterey Amendment, DWR was to transfer ownership of the KWB
10 property to the KCWA, which would, in turn, transfer said ownership to the KWBA.

11 40. In connection with the transfer of ownership of the KWB property, Respondent and
12| the KCWA entered into an agreement regarding the operation of the KWB entitled "Declaration of
13 Covenants Conditions and Restrictions" (KWB CC&R's) a copy a of which is attached as Exhibit
14 "D" and incorporated herein.

15 41. By the terms of the KWB CC&R's, Respondent agreed to operate the KWB in a
16 manner that would provide Buena Vista, among others, with use of the KWB facilities in certain
17 specified circumstances. The KWB CC&R's gave Buena Vista, and others, a second priority right
18 to use the KWB facilities for the recharge and/or recovery of water as it specifically provides in
19 Section 4.2:
20 To the extent there is recharge, storage and/or recovery capacity available in
21 the Project facilities beyond that needed for the first priority ("Excess Capacity), Agency Basic Contract Member Units, including Agency and its
22 improvement districts, shall have the second priority right to use the Project for the recharge and/or recovery of water for use in the boundaries of Agency 23 if they pay the Fair Compensation for such use or a lesser amount agreed to by KWBA.
24

25 42. On or about September 16, 2010, Buena Vista, along with three other local public
26 entities, filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Kern, a complaint against KWB
27 alleging breach of contract resulting from KWBA's refusal to permit second priority access to the
28 KWB pursuant to the KWB CC&R's (Kern Co. Superior Ct. Case No. S-1500-CV-271619) ("2nd

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 10 of 23

Priority Complaint").

2 43. The and Priority Complaint alleged that the plaintiffs made several demands; both
3 verbally and in writing, that KWBA perform its obligations under the KWB CC&R's, and permit
second priority right holders to use and exercise their second priority rights. Specifically, the 2nd
5 Priority Complaint alleged demands to use a second priority right in the KWB by way of letter

6 dated July 31, 2006, which were denied on or about September 18, 2006. The 2nd Priority
Complaint further alleged that the plaintiffs, including Buena Vista, have continued to attempt to

8 exercise their rights under the KWB CC&R's and KWBA continues to refuse to allow access and
use of its second priority rights and/or continues to place such restrictions upon such use so as to

10 render the right futile.

11 44. On or about September 21, 2012, the parties named in the 2nd Priority Complaint
12 entered into a Litigation Avoidance and Tolling Agreement whereby the action was dismissed
13| without prejudice subject to the terms therein.

14 45. Pursuant to the KWB CC&R's, Buena Vista has a second priority right to utilize the
15 recharge facilities of the KWB, and would, if so permitted, utilize that right to recharge high-flow

16 Kern River water that is the subject of the Project.

17 [KWBA Conservation and Storage Project]

18 46. On or about February 16, 2012, Respondent issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP")
19 for the Project to support its Application 31676 with the State Water Board. The NOP notified
20 Buena Vista of Respondent's intention to drastically alter historic practices by changing the place

21 of use, purpose of use and point of diversion of up to 500,000 AFY of Kern River water allegedly
22| available to Respondent.

23 47. Respondent prepared the DEIR and circulated the same for review and comment on

24 or about January 12, 2018. On February 23, 2018, Buena Vista, along with three other local water
25 districts, filed with the Respondent written comments to the DEIR pointing out various deficiencies.
26 therein including, without limitation, the following:

27 a. the DEIR failed to provide an accurate, stable and finite project description

28 because it "failed to take into account the existence and effect of 2nd priority rights in and to the use

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 11 of 23

1 of the KWBA recharge and recovery facilities existing in favor of certain Kern River water right

2 holders"; and

3 b. the DEIR failed to provide a detailed analysis of how the project is expected

4 to function without invasion of or detriment to existing and priority rights of Kern River water right

5 holders in the KWB; and

6 C. the DEIR failed to provide an adequate discussion of potential significant
environmental impacts, including but not limited to, impacts on agricultural resources, water

8 supply, and groundwater resources; and
d. The DEIR failed to adequately address areas of public controversy; and

10 e. The DEIR failed to provide an adequate discussion of alternatives; and

11 f. The DEIR failed to include relevant and necessary information sufficient to
12| inform the public and decision-makers as to the true environmental cost of the Project.

13 In conclusion, Buena Vista commented that the DEIR was insufficient in its
14 proposed form and did not satisfy the requirements of CEQA.

15 48. Respondent failed to adequately respond to these comments and the comments
16 made by other entities regarding the inadequacies of the DEIR. On or about November 28, 2018,
17 Buena Vista was notified that the proposed FEIR for the Project, which included Respondent's
18 responses to comments, was available for public review. Respondent's responses to Buena Vista's
19 comments were, essentially, a perfunctory dismissal. Respondent did not make necessary and
20 requested changes to the DEIR and the FEIR generally exacerbates and perpetuates the errors,

21 omissions and deficiencies in the DEIR.

22 49. On December 10, 2018, prior to the Respondent's certification of the FEIR, Buena
23 Vista submitted further written comments pointing out the inadequacies of the KWBA's responses
24 and corresponding deficiencies in the FEIR. Buena Vista also noted that recirculation of the DEIR
25| is required.

26 50. Notwithstanding Buena Vista's strenuous objections, Respondent certified the FEIR
27| on or about December 10, 2018. On or about December 14, 2018, Respondent filed a Notice of
28 Determination to proceed with the Project.

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 12 of 23

51. Respondent's actions in approving and adopting the FEIR, and any subsequent

2 action based thereon, including implementation of the Project, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

3 discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and/or its decision is

4 not supported by substantial evidence for the reasons alleged in this Petition/Complaint.

5 52. Buena Vista is entitled to a writ of mandate enjoining and ordering Respondent to
refrain from proceeding further with or implementing the Project unless and until Respondent
complies with CEQA and undertakes a proper and complete environmental review of the Project,
8| including preparation of a new, complete EIR. Buena Vista is additionally entitled to an order,
pursuant to Cal. Pub. Res. Code §21168.9, directing Respondent to reconsider or change the
10 Project pending proper environmental review; to take specific action to bring its determinations,
11 findings and decisions with regard to the Project into compliance with CEQA; to take corrective
12| action to cure the deficiencies in Respondent's approval of the Project and FEIR; and to take other
13 corrective and remedial action in accordance with Cal. Pub. Res. Code §21168.9.

14 53. Buena Vista does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
15 course of law because Buena Vista, the public, and the local region, will be irreparably harmed by
16 environmental damage resulting from Respondent's violations of CEQA and related laws.
17 Accordingly, Buena Vista seeks injunctive relief to prevent the irreparable harm that will result
18 from implementation of the Project without proper or sufficient environmental review.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 /Violation of California Environmental Quality Act]

21 54. Buena Vista incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 53 as though they

22 were set forth in full herein.

23 [Inadequate Project Description]

24 55. An EIR must contain an accurate and consistent project description. [14 Cal. Code
25 Regs. §15124]. An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

26 informative, legally adequate environmental document. [County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles
27 (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193].
28 ///

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
13 Page 13 of 23

56. The adequacy of a project description is closely linked to the adequacy of an
environmental document's analysis of environmental effects. [Laurel Heights Improvement Assn.

3 v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 398-399]. A complete project
4 description is required to ensure that all of the project's environmental impacts are considered.
5 [City of Santee V. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454-1455].

57. An inaccurate project description constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion
7| because it precludes meaningful evaluation of the environmental consequences of a proposed
8 project both by the public and the decision-makers. [Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7
9 Cal.4th 1215, 1236-1237]. An environmental document with an inaccurate and/or inconsistent
10 project description precludes meaningful evaluation of environmental consequences by failing to
11 provide a full disclosure of the information necessary to investigate and evaluate such
12 consequences. [San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27
13 Cal.App.4t 713, 724-729].

14 58. Integral parts of the Project include using the KWB facilities to recharge high-flow
15 Kern River water, that is water available after the needs, uses, or purposes of current Kern River
16 water right holders, including Buena Vista, have been met. The FEIR's project description must
17 therefore identify, consider, discuss and analyze the potential environmental effects of the Project
18 on Buena Vista's 2nd priority rights in and to the use of the KWBA recharge and recovery facilities
19 and Buena Vista's Kern River water rights.

20 59. Buena Vista advised Respondent that in a year of Kern River surplus, such as the
21 Project proposes, Buena Vista will use all available 2nd priority recharge capacity in the KWB

22 before water is offered to the Intertie, farmlands flooded, or water allowed to leave the County, a
23 condition precedent to the KWB gaining access to said proposed surplus "high-flow water". Thus,
24 Buena Vista would utilize all available recharge capacity in the KWB before "high flow water"

25 would become available to the KWB as proposed in the FEIR. Under such circumstances, there
26 would be no available recharge capacity in the KWB as described in the FEIR The FEIR fails to
27 acknowledge or describe this potential scenario.
28 ///

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 14 of 23

60. The FEIR fails to comply with CEQA requirements for an accurate, stable and finite
2 project description in that: (i) the FEIR ignores Buena Vista's right, title and interest in and to its
3 2nd priority right to use the KWB facilities; (ii) the source of water is subject to significant

4 limitations such that it cannot be relied upon a as a viable source of water for the Project; and (iii) the
source of water is unsettled and uncertain in terms of quantity and entitlement; and (iv) fails to
describe and discuss the proposed recovery and use of the up to 500,000 AFY of "high-flow" Kern
7 River water.

8 61. The deficiencies in the project description deprived the public, including Buena
9 Vista, of an opportunity to understand and meaningfully comment on the Project and its impacts,
10 and rendered the analyses in the EIR of the Project and its impacts inadequate.

11 [Inadequate Description of the Environmental Setting]

12 62. An EIR must describe the environmental setting for a proposed project, to establish
13 the "baseline" that a lead agency uses to determine whether project impacts are significant. [14
14 Cal. Code Regs. §15125]. Specifically, the EIR must describe "the physical environmental
15 conditions in the vicinity of the project." [Id.]. The description of physical and environmental
16 conditions must include both a local and regional a perspective. [Id.].

17 63. Establishment of the baseline is critical to a meaningful assessment of the
18 environmental impacts of a project because the significance of environmental impacts cannot be
19 determined without setting the baseline. [Save Our Peninsula Committee V. Monterey County
20 Board of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 119]. The description should place special
21 emphasis on environmental resources that are rare or unique to the region and that would be

22 affected by the project. [14 Cal. Code Regs. §15125(c); San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr.

23 V. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4U 713, 722].

24 64. The subject EIR failed to include an adequate description of the Project's
25 environmental setting in that it failed to adequately describe the physical conditions of the existing
26 2nd priority rights to use the KWB facilities.

27 65. Further, the FEIR failed to include an adequate description of the Project's
28 environmental setting in that, among other things:

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 15 of 23

a. the FEIR failed to adequately describe the physical conditions of
2| other existing, adjacent groundwater banking and recovery operations and projects which may be
affected by the Project; and

b. the FEIR failed to adequately describe the physical conditions on
5 and/or under nearby landowners' and water users' lands, including those within Buena Vista's
6 boundaries, which may be affected by the Project; and

7 C. the FEIR failed to provide necessary details with regard to current

8 use of "high-flow" proposed Project water, including the areas historically using such water, the
9 quantities used in each area, the timing of diversions or deliveries, and the consumptive use of such
10| water, - in short, an accurate picture of the entire current environmental setting.

11 66. These failures precluded the EIR from meaningfully analyzing the impacts of the
12| Project on the existing environmental setting, including those features of the existing environment
13 described above, and deprived the public, including Buena Vista and Buena Vista's landowners
14 and water users, of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on the Project and its impacts on the
15 existing environment.

16 67. Respondent's actions of certifying the FEIR and approving the Project constitutes a
17| prejudicial abuse of discretion because it failed to provide an accurate, complete and stable
18 description of existing environmental conditions, or the "baseline" conditions, against which to
19 identify and assess the impacts of the Project. Respondent therefore failed to proceed in a manner
20 required by law, and its actions are not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings

21 are not supported by substantial evidence.

22 [Inadequate Evaluation of Project Impacts]

23 68. Public Resources Code Section 21100(a) and 14 California Code of Regulations
24 Sections 15126(a) and 15126.2 provide that an EIR must identify and focus on the significant
25 environmental effects of a proposed project, giving due consideration to both short-term and long-
26 term effects. An EIR must contain a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers with

27 information which allows them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of the
28 environmental consequences. [14 Cal. Code Reg's. § 15151]. Drafting an EIR necessarily involves

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 16 of 23

some degree of forecasting, and an agency must use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that

2 it reasonably can. [14 Cal. Code Reg's. o 15144]. An EIR should, when looked at as a whole,

3 provide a reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis of the project's environmental impacts.
[Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,
5 392].

69. The FEIR fails to adequately consider and/or forecast the significant impacts of the
use and operation of the Project, including but not limited to the impacts identified in this
8 Petition/Complaint. These include, but are not limited to, the FEIR's failure to evaluate the
impacts resulting from the redistribution of "high-flow" Kern River water from its current place
10 and purpose of use to a new and different place and purpose of use, including the impacts to
11| current areas in which this "high-flow" water has been or could be used and impacts on nearby
12 groundwater recharge/recovery projects.

13 70. The failure to adequately describe the environmental impacts of the Project
14 necessarily resulted in an inadequate and/or incorrect analysis of the impacts of the Project on,
15 among other things, the level, supply, quality and use of groundwater and the effect on recharge
16 capacity in the KWB and/or the groundwater basin. For example, the Project will result in a
17| dramatic shift in the place of use, purpose of use and point of diversion of a substantial quantity of
18 "high-flow" Kern River water proposed in the Project. In contrast, the FEIR presents an
19 incomplete analysis of the Project's impacts by focusing only on the beneficial impacts of
20 increasing recharged groundwater in the KWB and a more sustainable water supply for its KWBA a
21 members. However, the FEIR fails to recognize that the regional benefits claimed in the FEIR
22 would be substantially the same if Buena Vista utilizes its 2nd priority right to recharge "high
23 flow" Kern River Water in the KWB, but the environmental impacts resulting from the ownership,
24 recovery, and use of that water would be substantially different. The FEIR summarily glossed over
25 the potentially significant environmental impacts resulting from the recovery and use of the water
26 identified in the Project. Based on this limited analysis, the FEIR concludes that the Project will
27| have a beneficial effect on groundwater levels in Kern County. This simple analysis is insufficient

28 and these inadequacies deprived the public, including Buena Vista and Buena Vista's landowners

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 17 of 23

and water users, of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on the Project and its impacts on the
2 existing environment. More importantly, these inadequacies deprived the decision-makers of

3 important information necessary to properly evaluate the environmental cost of the project,
possible mitigation measures, possible alternatives, and the like.

5 71. Respondent's action of certifying the FEIR and approving the Project constitutes a
6 prejudicial abuse of discretion and violation of CEQA because it failed to proceed in a manner
required by law, and its actions are not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings
8 are not supported by substantial evidence in that the FEIR fails to sufficiently and adequately
9 identify and assess the Project's impacts on the environment.

10 [Inadequate Analysis of Alternatives]

11 72. Public Resources Code Section 21100(b)(4) and 14 California Code of Regulations
12 Sections 15126(f) and 15126.6 require that an EIR must describe a range of alternatives to the
13 proposed project which could feasibly attain the project's basic objectivés, and evaluate the
14| comparative merits of the alternatives. CEQA further requires a lead agency to consider and adopt
15 feasible alternatives to substantially lessen significant adverse effects on the environment. [Cal.
16 Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21100(b)(4) and 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15126.6(a)]. Moreover, CEQA
17| establishes a duty for public agencies to avoid or minimize environmental damage where feasible
18 [Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21001, 21002.1 and 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15021(a)].

19 73. The EIR should explain how the project alternatives were selected for analysis, and
20 the EIR should identify alternatives rejected as infeasible and explain why they were rejected. [14
21 Cal. Code Regs. §15126.6(c)]. The discussion of alternatives should include sufficient information
22 about each alternative to allow evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project. [14
23 Cal. Code Regs. §15126.6(d)]. If a project proponent has rejected various alternatives, "an EIR
24 must explain why each suggested alternative either does not satisfy the goals of the proposed
25 project, does not offer substantial environmental advantages or cannot be accomplished." [San
26 Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 737].

27 74. In the FEIR only two project alternatives are presented, one being the no project
28 alternative. Each alternative is then analyzed with respect to its ability to meet Project goals and

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 18 of 23

objectives while minimizing environmental damage. However, the FEIR fails to consider an
2 obvious third alternative which may be environmentally superior. Namely, the FEIR fails to
3 consider a project whereby Kern River right holders utilize their 2nd priority right to recharge the

4 "high-flow" Kern River water in the KWB. Operating in a vacuum, the FEIR fails to truly evaluate
5 the merits of this (and possibly other) alternatives which could be of greater benefit to the
environment. The FEIR does not include a reasonable range of feasible alternatives to all or part of

7 the Project that, had they been studied and properly compared and contrasted to the Project, could
8 have benefited the environment and reduced potential impacts.

75. Respondent's action of certifying the FEIR and approving the Project constitutes a
10| prejudicial abuse of discretion and violation of CEQA because it failed to proceed in a manner

11 required by law, and its actions are not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and findings
12 are not supported by substantial evidence.

13 76. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent violated its duties under
14 CEQA, abused its discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the
15 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must

16 set aside Respondent's certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project.

17 [Failure to Address Areas of Controversy]

18 77. An EIR must identify and summarize "[a]reas of controversy known to the Lead
19 Agency including issues raised by agencies and the public." [14 Cal. Code Regs. §15123(b)(2)].

20 78. The FEIR's discussion of alleged areas of controversy is incomplete and inadequate.

21 Buena Vista noted in its comments on the DEIR that the simple bullet list of areas of controversy

22 was insufficient. The FEIR corrected this inadequacy as to certain controversies, but failed to

23 make the same corrections as to the objections relating to Buena Vista's and other Kern River

24 interests' 2nd priority rights to use the KWB facilities. The dispute over the use of the 2nd priority
25 right in the KWB has been ongoing for over 10 years, including the filing of the 2nd Priority
26 Complaint. The FEIR improperly fails to sufficiently identify, discuss or address those
27 controversies, and the ongoing dispute identified by Buena Vista.
28| ///

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 19 of 23

79. Even if Respondent disagrees with the objections and complaints about the and

2 priority rights, the environmental documentation must still summarize the main points of

3 disagreement between Buena Vista (and other parties) and Respondent, especially in light of the
fact that the Project would all but eliminate Buena Vista's (and others') second priority right to use

5 the KWB.

80. The FEIR's failure to adequately assess this area of controversy prevents Buena

7 Vista, the public, and the interested public agencies, from properly evaluating the Project, the
8| environmental setting, and the associated environmental impacts, mitigation measures and

alternatives.

10 81. Respondent's actions in certifying the FEIR and approving the Project constitute a
11 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondent failed to proceed in a
12 manner required by law, its actions are not supported by adequate findings, and its actions and
13| findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the FEIR fails to properly disclose and
14 discuss areas of controversy involving the Project.

15 [Inadequate Response to Comments on the DEIR]

16 82. Public agencies must provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in response to

17 comments received on the EIR and conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will
18 not suffice. Agencies must address recommendations and objections in detail and explain why
19 specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. [14 Cal. Code Regs. §15008(c)].

20 83. The EIR does not comply with CEQA because Respondent failed to adequately
21 respond to comments, suggestions, and recommendations made by Buena Vista and others with
22 regard to the Project's description, environmental setting, impacts, alternatives, areas of
23 controversy; and/or other matters, as alleged herein.

24 [Inadequate Consideration of Mitigation Measures]

25 84. Public Resources Code Section 21100(c) and 14 California Code of Regulations
26 Sections 15126(e) and 15126.4 require that EIRs contain adequate evaluations of measures to
27 mitigate adverse environmental impacts. In addition, 14 California Code of Regulations Section
28 15092(b) provides that a public agency shall not approve or a carry out a project which has one or

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 20 of 23

more significant environmental effects unless it has [e]liminated or substantially lessened all
2 significant effects on the environment where feasible.

3 85. The FEIR's discussion of mitigation measures is inadequate in numerous respects,
4 including but not limited to the fact the project description fails to adequately describe the Project

5 and potential impacts associated therewith, and the FEIR incorrectly concludes that no mitigation
6 measures for groundwater impacts are necessary.

86. Respondent's actions in certifying the FEIR and approving the Project constitutes a
8 prejudicial abuse of discretion and violation of CEQA because it failed to proceed in a manner
required by law; its actions are not supported by adequate findings; and its actions and findings are
10 not supported by substantial evidence in that the FEIR fails to consider any mitigation measures for
11 reasonably foreseeable significant adverse environmental impacts.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

13 [Declaratory Relief]

14 87. Buena Vista incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 86 as though 1 they
15 were set forth in full herein.

16 88. An actual controversy exists between the parties. Buena Vista contends that
17 Respondent and Real Parties in Interest have acted in violation of CEQA. Respondent and Real
18 Parties in Interest dispute this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is necessary and
19 appropriate.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 [Injunction]

22 89. Buena Vista incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 88 as though they

23 were set forth in full herein.

24 90. Buena Vista is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that unless Buena Vista
25 is granted injunctive relief, it will suffer irreparable harm in that the implementation of the Project

26 activities described herein will cause permanent harm to Buena Vista, its landowners and water
27 users, and will create the adverse environmental impacts described in this Petition/Complaint,
28 among others, to the detriment of Buena Vista, its landowners and water users.

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief
Page 21 of 23

91. Buena Vista is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Buena Vista has no

2 plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. No money damages or other legal

3 remedy could adequately compensate Buena Vista, its landowners and water users, for the harms

4 described herein.

5 PRAYER

6 WHEREFORE, Buena Vista prays as follows:

7 1. As to All Causes of Action herein, that this Court enter judgment determining and

8 declaring that the approval of Project activities described herein does not comply with applicable
9 law and therefore is null and void;
10 2. As to the First Cause of Action herein, that this Court enter judgment determining

11 and declaring that Respondent failed to comply with CEQA and therefore the approval of the
12 Project activities described herein was illegal and is null and void, and issue a writ of mandate
13 commanding Respondent to do the following:

14 (a) to vacate and set aside its approval of the Project activities described herein;

15 (b) to vacate and set aside certification of the FEIR as it relates to the Project

16 activities described herein;

17 (c) to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project activities

18 described herein;

19 (d) to suspend any and all activities described herein pursuant to Respondent's

20 approval of said activities that could result in an adverse change or alteration to the

21 environment as described in this Petition until Respondent has complied with all

22 requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances,

23 and regulations as are directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section

24 21168.9.

25 3. As to the Second Cause of Action, that this Court enter a declaratory judgment
26 consistent with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this 2 prayer.

27 4. As to the Third Cause of Action, that this Court enter a declaratory judgment in the
28 respects stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this prayer.

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION (Our File No.: BV-2.2.6)

To Whom It May Concern:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, that pursuant to Public Resources Code §21167.5, Buena Vista Water Storage District ("Petitioner") intends to file a Petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the Kern Water Bank Authority ("Respondent") as the lead agency certifying and/or adopting the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") on the Kern Water Bank Authority Conservation and Storage Project ("Project").

The purpose of this petition will be to challenge the adoption and certification of the FEIR on the Project and associated actions to implement such based on violation of CEQA in connection with the FEIR and Respondent's adoption of the Project.
The petition will seek, among other things, the following relief: (1) a writ of mandamus directing Respondent to cease and desist from implementing the Project and vacate and set aside certification of the FEIR as it relates to the Project until Respondent has complied with CEQA; (2) declaratory relief; and (3) costs of suit and attorneys' fees.

Sincerely,
