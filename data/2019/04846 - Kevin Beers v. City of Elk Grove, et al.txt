Californian. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause a
reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.
41. The City's approval of amendments to the COAs for a TSM constitutes :
discretionary act that triggers the City's obligation to comply with CEQA.
42. Petitioner submitted substantial evidence in support of fair argument that the
Project Amendments may result in potentially significant environmental impacts, including
health and safety impacts, as a result of emergency access issues.
43. Moreover, the City lacks substantial evidence to support its finding that no further
environmental review is required for the Project under CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
N 80∞5SCAUD=S Section 15162.

44. In addition, the City violated CEQA when it approved the Project Amendments

or all of these improvements and collect an in-lieu fee instead. The City was required to consider
whether changes to the COAs allowing an in-lieu fee would result in potentially significant
g environmental impacts, such as health and safety impacts.

45. For all of the above reasons, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed
to comply with the law.

25 46. Petitioner repeats and realleges the preceding paragraphs in their entirety, and
26 58 incorporates them herein by reference as though set forth in full.
47. Government Code Section 65300 requires the legislative body of each city to 28 adopt a general plan for the physical development within the city. The general plan is often

called a "constitution" for future development to which all other land use decisions must

approving development permits, must be consistent with the general plan. (See Neighborhood
Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1182-86.)

48. CMC Section 23.20.010 allows for amendments to project approvals only when
the approving authority makes all findings required for the original approval. This includes a
005 finding of consistency with the City's General Plan.
49. Despite this requirement, the Project as now approved with amended COA 35 is
inconsistent with multiple provisions of the City's General Plan. These inconsistencies include:
