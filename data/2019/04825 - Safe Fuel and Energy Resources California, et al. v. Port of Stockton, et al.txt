12 "Real Parties"), and by this Petition allege as follows:
13 INTRODUCTION

14 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge Respondents' April 15, 2019 decision to

15 certify a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR"), adopt Findings of Fact and Statement of

16 Overriding Considerations ("Findings and SOC"), a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program

17 (*MMRP"), an Authorization to File a Notice of Determination under CEQA, Ordinance #254, and
18 approve a 20-year lease agreement with Eco-Energy (a 10-year initial period, with two 5-year
19 options) for the Eco-Energy Liquid Bulk Receiving Terminal Project, State Clearinghouse ("SCH")
20 Number 2016112007 ("Project"). The Notice of Determination (*NOD") approving the Project was

21 issued by the Port on April 19, 2019. The FEIR and related approvals were prepared pursuant to
22 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC"), section

23 21000 et seq. and the California Code of Regulations, title 14, chapter 3, section 15000 et seq.
24 ("CEQA Guidelines").

25 2. Eco-Energy proposes to construct and operate a 10-acre liquid bulk receiving

26 terminal to receive 108-unit trains annually.' The terminal will serve as a transfer hub for liquid

27

28 Unit trains are those that carry a single commodity, here, ethanol. Each unit train is comprised of multiple, individual
rail cars. Manifest trains are trains that contain a variety of different products.
4641-003j - 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

bulk petroleum product shipments entering the Port of Stockton, including ethanol, gasoline,

2 naphtha, diesel, biofuels, and lubricants. The unit trains would primarily carry ethanol. The

3 ethanol would be transferred via new direct-loop fuel pipeline to the existing, adjacent liquid bulk

4 receiving terminal operated by NuStar. NuStar operates its facility under a lease from the Port.

5 Project construction is expected to last approximately 10 to 12 months. Once constructed, the

6 Project would operate 365 days/year.

7 3. The FEIR prepared by the Port was substantially deficient and failed to fulfill its
mandate under CEQA as an informational document in several ways. Most critically, the FEIR

9 failed to describe the whole of the Project, and failed to accurately disclose and mitigate the

10 Project's significant impacts on air quality and public health from the Project's criteria air pollutant
11 and toxic air contaminant (TAC") emissions. As a result, the FEIR failed to adequately disclose

12 and mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from the entire Project, as CEQA requires.

13 4. The FEIR failed to describe and analyze the Nustar Facility component of the

14 Project. NuStar currently receives ethanol by manifest rail, modified unit train, and truck at its

15 facility. NuStar does not have a permit from the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District

16 ("SJVAPCD") for this receipt and offload operation.

17 5. On or about March 22, 2018, NuStar submitted an application to the SJVAPCD

18 requesting an Authority to Construct ("ATC") for its terminal located at 2941 Navy Drive,

19 Stockton, CA facility number N-829 ("NuStar Facility"). The requested ATC would allow NuStar

20 to modify the NuStar Facility in order to receive, store, blend, and export by truck ethanol

21 received from the Eco-Energy Project. The purpose of the NuStar ATC is to modify the NuStar

22 Facility in order to receive (from the proposed Project), store, and truck out far more ethanol than

23 is possible under NuStar's current permit (*NuStar Project").

24 6. NuStar's ATC Application stated that CEQA environmental review was conducted

25 by relying on the Project EIR (SCH No. 2016112007). No additional, supplemental, or subsequent
26 environmental review was performed for the NuStar ATC. The SJVAPCD has received comments

27 on the ATC, but to date, has not issued a final decision on the ATC.

28
4641-003j - 4 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

7. The FEIR for the Project failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the impacts from the

2 NuStar Project. The FEIR failed to identify or describe the NuStar project as part of the FEIR's

3 Project description, failed to analyze impacts from the NuStar Project as part of the Project, and

4 failed to consider the NuStar Project's impacts in its cumulative impact analysis.

5 8. The Project is major new facility that will greatly expand operations at both the

6 NuStar Facility and Eco-Energy Project site. The Project would allow NuStar to receive at least an

7 additional 186,000,000 million gallon: of ethanol from the Eco-Energy terminal, per year. This

8 represents an increase of 105,500,00 million gals./yr. in ethanol export from NuStar's terminal at

9 the Port.

10 9. The FEIR also failed to accurately disclose and mitigate the Project's potentially

11 significant impacts from nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), a criteria air pollutant regulated by the

12 SJVAPCD.

13 10. The FEIR incorrectly concluded that the Project's NOx impacts would be

14 significant and unavoidable during Project construction.

15 11. Despite this major expansion of ethanol operations at the Port, the FEIR similarly
16 concluded that the Project's NOx emissions would only exceed operational threshold emissions for
17 2019, and that thereafter, emissions would decrease.

18 12. The FEIR also incorrectly concluded that the Project would not cause thresholds of

19 significance to be exceeded for any other criteria air pollutant or TAC regulated under Federal or
20 State law.

21 13. Petitioners' refinery and air quality expert Dr. Phyllis Fox, Ph.D, P.E., reviewed the

22 FEIR and submitted a written report explaining that the FEIR failed to disclose and mitigate

23 numerous Project impacts. Dr. Fox's analysis demonstrated that:

24 a. The Project's NOx emissions were significantly underestimated in the FEIR. Dr.

25 Fox explained that the Project would increase NOx emissions in the 2019-2040

26 period from truck emissions from 18.1 ton/yr in the baseline3 to 135 ton/yr or by

27 117 ton/yr, which exceeds the NOx significance threshold of 10 ton/yr by a factor of

28 12.

4641-003j - 5 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 b. The FEIR's Proposed NOx mitigation was not adequate to reduce Project and

2 cumulative NOx emissions to less than significant and are not enforceable on the

3 Applicant.

4 C. Air quality and public health impacts in adjacent Air Districts from truck and train

5 emissions were not evaluated in the FEIR and remained potentially significant.

6 d. The Project's Construction emissions analysis was not adequately supported, and

7 construction emissions were significantly underestimated, thus remaining

8 potentially significant after the mitigation proposed in the FEIR.

9 e. The FEIR concluded that cumulative operational NOx emissions were significant

10 but failed to require any mitigation, in violation of CEQA.
f.
11 The FEIR's health risk assessment ("HRA") of the Project's TAC emissions was
unsupported and incomplete.
12 14. In certifying the FEIR and issuing related Project approvals under CEQA, the Port
13 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation
14 of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The FEIR is legally defective due to the Port's: 1) failure to
15 describe the whole of the Project, by failing to describe, analyze, and mitigate, the impacts of the
16 related Project operations at the NuStar Facility ("piecemealing"); 2) failure to use the correct
17 baseline against which to measure the Project's emissions of air pollutants; 3) failure to account for
18 all air pollutant sources onsite; 4) failure to consider emission sources off-site, including emissions
19 outside of the SJVAPCD (the hosting Air District); 5) failure lessen or avoid potentially significant
20 impacts through specific and enforceable mitigation measures; and 6) failure to consider e
21 reasonable range of Project alternatives.
22 15. The Port also prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
23 required by adopting unsupported findings that the mitigation measures described would lessen or
24 avoid the significant and unavoidable impacts to air quality and that the benefits of the Project
25 outweigh its significant and unavoidable impacts. Because the manner in which the Port reviewed
26 and approved the Project violated CEQA, their approval of the Project must be set aside.

PARTIES
Petitioners and Plaintiffs
2 16. Petitioner and Plaintiff SAFE FUEL AND ENERGY RESOURCES

3 CALIFORNIA ("SAFER California") is an unincorporated association that advocates for

4 safe processes at California refineries and fuel transport and distribution facilities to protect

5 the health, safety, standard of life and economic interests of its members.

6 17. The members represented by the participants in SAFER California live,

7 work, recreate and raise their families in San Joaquin County, including in or near the Port

8 and City of Stockton. Accordingly, these members would be directly affected by the

9 Project's adverse environmental impacts. The members of SAFER California's

10 participating labor organizations may also work on the Project itself. They will, therefore,

11 be first in line to be exposed to any hazardous materials, air contaminants and other health

12 and safety hazards that exist onsite. SAFER California therefore has a direct interest in

13 enforcing environmental laws to minimize the adverse impacts of projects that would

14 otherwise degrade the environment. The individual members of SAFER California could

15 bring this lawsuit in their own right. However, neither the claims asserted herein nor the
relief that is requested requires their individual participation.
16 18. SAFER California and its members are beneficially interested in this
17 proceeding. SAFER California and its members' interests in air quality, public health and
18 safety, and climate change, among other interests, will be impacted by the Project. SAFER
19 California's members may suffer from adverse environmental impacts caused by the
20 Project. SAFER California has a strong interest in enforcing environmental laws, such as
21 CEQA, which require the disclosure of potential environmental impacts and ensure safe

22 operations and processes for California oil refineries. Failure to adequately address the
23 environmental impacts of fuel storage, transport and refining processes and distribution

24 facilities poses a substantial threat to the environment, worker health, surrounding

25 communities and the local economy. SAFER California and its members will be adversely

26 affected if the Project is allowed to proceed as approved by the Port without adequate and

27 proper environmental review under CEQA. The interests that SAFER California seeks to

28 protect in this proceeding are germane to its purposes.

4641-003j - 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

19. Refineries and fuel storage and distribution facilities are uniquely dangerous

2 and capable of generating significant fires and the emission of hazardous and toxic

3 substances that adversely impact air quality, water quality, biological resources and public

4 health and safety. Absent adequate disclosure and mitigation of hazardous materials and

5 processes, refinery workers and surrounding communities may be subject to chronic health

6 problems and the risk of bodily injury and death.

7 20. Poorly planned refinery and fuel products storage and distribution projects

8 also adversely affect the economic wellbeing of people who perform construction and

9 maintenance work in these facilities and the surrounding communities. Plant and terminal
shutdowns in the event of accidental release and infrastructure breakdown have caused
10 prolonged work stoppages.
11 Such nuisance conditions and catastrophic events impact local
communities and jeopardize future jobs by making it more difficult and more expensive for
12 businesses to locate and people to live in the area. The participants in SAFER California
13 are also concerned about projects that carry serious environmental risks and public service
14 infrastructure demands without providing countervailing employment and economic
15 benefits to local workers and communities.
16 21. The interests of SAFER CALIFORNIA and its participants in safe,
17 environmentally sound processes at California refineries and fuel storage and distribution
18 facilities will be directly, adversely and irreparably affected unless this Court provides the

19 relief requested in this Petition. SAFER California brings this action on its own behalf, on

20 behalf of its participating labor organizations, the members of SAFER California's
21 participating labor organizations and their families, and in the public interest.

22 22. SAFER California raised concerns during the Port's administrative review

23 process for the Project regarding the issues presented in this Petition. SAFER California

24 urged the Port to act in accordance with CEQA by preparing a revised EIR that adequately

25 describes the Project and discloses, analyzes, and mitigates the Project's potentially

26 significant impacts. Petitioner brings this action on its own behalf, on the behalf of its

27 members, and in the public interest.

10 STATEMENT OF FACTS

11 Factual Background

12 56.

13 On November 2, 2016, the Port released a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for
the Eco-Energy Liquid Bulk Receiving Terminal. The Draft EIR was released ànd

14 distributed on June 12, 2017 for a 45-day review period, which ended on July 26, 2017.

15 57. Eco-Energy proposes construct and operate a 10-acre liquid bulk receiving

16 terminal within the Port of Stockton's East Complex, at 2404 Port Road M in Stockton

17 California, to receive and export ethanol (E100), under a 20-year lease from the Port (an

18 initial 10-year lease term, with two, five-year options to renew) ("Project").

19 58. Northwest and adjacent to the proposed Project, NuStar currently operates

20 Facility No. N-829 (at 2941 and 3015 Navy Drive), also under a lease from the Port.

21 Facility No. N-829 is a liquid bulk terminal which receives, blends and exports fuels,

22 including ethanol.

59.
23 NuStar currently receives ethanol by way manifest rail and exports it from

24 the Port by truck. The manifest rail and truck operation is located adjacent to the Project

25 site at the NuStar facility. Title V of the federal Clean Air Act requires major sources of air

26 pollutants to obtain a permit to operate, and to operate in compliance with that permit.

27

28
4641-003j VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR - 16 -

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 60. Both facilities are within the jurisdiction of the SJVAPCD. The SJVAPCD is

2 the state agency authorized to administer Title V permits. A Title V permit is required to

3 receive and offload ethanol by rail cars and trucks.

4 61. NuStar does not hold a Title V permit to V receive and offload ethanol by rail

5 and truck. Therefore, the NuStar facility currently operates in violation of its Title V permit.

6 62. The Project proposes to replace NuStar's unpermitted manifest rail and truck

7 system with unit trains that would deliver ethanol to the Eco-Energy facility, and then

8 transfer that ethanol via a new 1,600 foot direct-loop fuel pipeline for storage, blending, and

9 export. The unit trains would consist of 108 railcars. At operation, 60 units trains per year

10 (five / mo.) would be received at the Eco-Energy terminal.

63. Project construction is estimated to last 10 to 12 months. Project
11 construction would include the demolition of an existing railcar repair building, grading,
12 railroad bed preparation and the construction of the following components:
13% a. new rails leads and switches;
14 b. rail offload yard to hold up to 108 railcars;
15 C. a 1;600 foot direct-loop pipeline to the NuStar facility;
16 d. a pump station to load the fuel into the pipeline; and
17 e. spill control infrastructure.
18 64. The Eco-Energy Project is a major new facility. The Project would increase

19 the amount of ethanol shipped to the NuStar Facility for further blending, storage and
20 export. Using NuStar's current operations as a baseline, the FEIR concluded that the Project

21 would allow NuStar to receive an additional 186,000,000 million gallons of ethanol from

22 Eco-Energy per year. This represents an increase of 105,500,00 million gallons per year in

23 ethanol export from NuStar's terminal at the Port. The Port contends that outbound trucks

24 carrying ethanol from the Port would increase from 19,000 trips to 32,500 trips.

25 65. The FEIR concluded that the Project will cause NOx thresholds to be

26 exceeded during Project construction, but thereafter operational emissions will decrease.

66.
27 The FEIR concluded that the Project and will not cause thresholds of

28 significance to be exceeded for other criterial air pollutants or TACs.

1 NuStar Project

2 67. On or about March 22, 2108, after the Eco-Energy Draft EIR had been

3 released, but prior to consideration by the Port, NuStar submitted an application package to

4 the SJVAPCD for an ATC under their Clean Air Act Title V permit ("NuStar V

5 Application").

6 68. As stated in the NuStar Application, the NuStar project would involve

7 receipt by pipeline from unit train delivery from Eco-Energy. The ethanol from the Eco-

8 Energy Project would be stored, blended, and trucked-out from the NuStar facility.
69.
9 Per the NuStar Application, in order to receive, blend, store and truck-out

10 the additional quantities of ethanol from Eco-Energy, the NuStar project would involve the
following actions:
11
a. installing a new, 12-inch aboveground pipeline from the incoming
12 custody meter to the NuStar facility, which would be welded with
13 flanges at connection points tat the custody meter and at the tank inlets
14 and would carry ethanol to Tank ("TK") 80001 and TK 80002;
15 b. installing a new geodesic dome roof on TK 80002;
16 c. inspecting and repairing TK 3302 and TK 80002 if necessary;
17 d. installing four new supply pumps in ethanol service, with a maximum
18 flow rate of 1,4000 gallons per minute (*gpm"), which would be
19 connected to the 11 existing loading arms at the North and South Truck

20 loading racks, and controlled by variable frequency drives that would

21 allow a loading rate of up to 5,5000 gpm;

22 e. installing new 24-inch ethanol lines connecting TK 80001 and TK

23 80002; and

24 f. replacing an existing 6-inch ethanol loading rack supply pipeline with a

25 new 10-inch ethanol loading rack supply pipeline.

26 70. a The NuStar Application proposed a more than two-fold throughput increase

27 for the affected tanks (from about 4 million gal/year to almost 9 million gal/year). Ethanol

28 throughput would increase by more than five-fold (from about 1.1 million gal/year to about

4641-003j 18 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6.1 million gal/year) and gasoline throughput would decrease slightly by 0.4% (or about

2 10,000 gal/year).

71. The NuStar Application included a Supplemental Application Form: CEQA

4 Information, completed by the applicant ("CEQA Information Form"). The CEQA

5 Information Form requires the applicant to state whether environmental review has been

6 performed for the project, and if so, to provide the lead agency's name, contact person, type

7 of review performed, and SCH Number.

8 72. The CEQA Information Form stated that CEQA environmental review for

9 the project was performed by the Port of Stockton, SCH No. 2016112007. SCH No.

10 2016112007 is the same SCH Number for the Eco-Energy Liquid Bulk Receiving Terminal
EIR.
11 73. To date, no further environmental review has been performed by the
12 SJVAPCD for the NuStar ATC.
13 74. The SJVAPCD received a comment letter on the NuStar Application from
14 the California Unions for Reliable Energy ("CURE") on January 4, 2019 ("CURE
15 Comment Letter"). Attached to the CURE Comment Letter was a report by refinery and air
16 quality expert Dr. Petra Pless, Ph.D, P.E. (*Pless Report").
17 75. The CURE Comment Letter and Pless Report provided substantial evidence
18 demonstrating that the NuStar Application was required to undergo CEQA review prior to

19 consideration and possible approval by the SJVAPCD. The CURE Comment Letter and
20 Pless Report detailed numerous deficiencies in the NuStar Application, demonstrating that

21 impacts would be significant and required CEQA review.

22 76. The CURE Comment Letter and Pless Report provided also substantial

23 evidence demonstrating that the NuStar Application substantially underestimated the extent

24 of the Project in the following ways:

25 a. Installation of New Piping to Tanks: The NuStar Application failed to

26 include in its project description or analyze the impacts resulting from

27 the installation of a new piping connection to existing storage tanks TK
3003 and TK 3304;
28
4641-003j - 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 b. Loading Arms: The NuStar Application failed to include in its project
description the installation the proposed construction two new loading

t arms;

L c. Throughput Increase from Debottlenecking Loading Racks: The NuStar

ün 0ON co Application failed to analyze the impacts that would result from
debottlenecking the loading racks at the NuStar facility as a at result of
upgrading its 6-inch ethanol loading rack supply pipeline to a 10-inch
pipeline, adding four new pumps in ethanol service, and the addition of
two new loading arms; and

10 d. Ethanol Delivery to Existing Tanks: NuStar currently operates two large

11 storage tanks at 3015 Navy Drive (TK 33007 and TK 30006) which are

12 permitted to store ethanol. The NuStar application does not address the

13 delivery of ethanol to these storage tanks.
77.
14 The CURE Comment Letter and Pless Report provided substantial evidence

15 demonstrating that the Eco-Energy EIR contained an inadequate analysis of the NuStar

16 ATC's impacts for the following reasons:

17 a. The Baseline Underestimated 2016 Truck Trips: The NuStar Application

18 relied on the 2016 baseline cited in the Eco-Energy DEIR to estimate

19 truck combustion emissions from fuel loadout at NuStar. This baseline

20 was incorrect. The Eco-Energy baseline underestimated the number of

21 truck trips that serviced the NuStar facility in 2016 by 32%. Therefore,
Dr. Pless concluded that the Eco-Energy EIR overestimated the number

22 of outbound truck trips under the baseline scenario and thus similarly

23 underestimated the increased number of outbound truck trips for the

24 Nustar Project and the instant Project overall.

25 b. Truck Emissions From Throughput Increases: The Eco-Energy EIR

26 failed to account for the increased throughout at the NuStar Facility as a

27 result of loading rack debottlenecking, which would increase throughput

28 by 389,880,166 gal./year.

4641-003j VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR - 20 -

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

c. Fugitive VOC Emissions Will Exceed Thresholds: Dr. Pless explained

2 that the Eco-Energy EIR failed to account for fugitive VOC emissions

3 from the NuStar Facility's loading racks, and thus cannot be relied upon
as adequate CEQA review for the NuStar Project. Dr. Pless demonstrated
a that a conservative increase of 300,000,000 gal/year of product load

6 would result in VOC emissions of 12 tons/year. This far exceeds the

7 SJVAPCD's threshold of 10 tons/year for this pollutant, resulting in a

8 significant impact that the Eco-Energy EIR failed to disclose.
d. Failure to Analyze Additional Emission Sources: Dr. Pless explained

10 that, in addition to failing to account for increased emissions from the

11 loading racks and trucks, the Eco-Energy EIR failed to account for
additional sources of emissions from the NuStar project including
12 construction emissions; pigging emissions from the cleanout of the
13 ethanol pipeline; increased fugitive emissions from the new pumps,
14 valves and fittings; increased emissions from storage tanks; increased
15 fugitive emissions from the loading racks; or increased combustion
16 emissions from a vapor recovery unit ("VCU").
17 78. The CURE Comment and Pless Report provided substantial evidence
18 demonstrating that the Eco-Energy EIR improperly piecemealed its review of the overall

19 Project by failing to disclose and mitigate the impacts of the NuStar Project's components.

20 79. Dr. Pless explained that substantial revisions to the Eco-Energy EIR were

21 required in order to analyze the NuStar Project.

22 80. To date, the SJVAPCD has not issued a final decision on the ATC.

23 81. The Port failed to rectify these errors and omissions in the FEIR.

24 Eco-Energy Final EIR

25 82. On April 12, 2019, the Port issued a notice that it would hold a hearing on

26 April 15, 2019 to consider the Eco-Energy FEIR and related Project approvals. Despite

27 being identified in the Agenda for the Port's April 15, 2019 hearing on the Project, the Port

28 failed to release the FEIR to the public until the morning of the hearing.

4641-003j - 21 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

83. Petitioners submitted written and oral comments on the FEIR to the Port at

2 the April 15, 2019 Project hearing.

3 84. Petitioners' written comments attached an expert report by refinery and air

4 quality expert Dr. Phyllis Fox, Ph.D, P.E. (*Fox Report"), the CURE Comment Letter, the

5 Pless Report, and the attachments to the Pless Report. SAFER California appeared at the

6 hearing to present these comments to the Board.

7 85. At the April 15, 2019 hearing, the Board received public comment and

8 approved the Project.

86. Petitioners commented on numerous deficiencies in the FEIR, including but
9

10 not limited to the following.
Piecemealing
11 87. The Fox Report clearly explained that the FEIR unlawfully piecemealed its
12 environmental review of the NuStar and Eco-Energy Projects. The NuStar and Eco-Energy
13 Projects are related projects, which will be physically connected to each other and
14 dependent on each other's operations. The NuStar and Eco-Energy Projects are therefore
15 components of a single Project which must undergo CEQA review in a single,
16 comprehensive CEQA document.

17 88. The project description in the FEIR disclosed that the two facilities will be
18 physically connected by closed-loop pipeline system. The common objective of both
19 Projects is to increase the quantity of fuel that can be received, blended, stored, and

20 trucked-out of the Port.

21 89. The NuStar Application stated that the Eco-Energy EIR constituted the

22 Port's CEQA review for the NuStar Project, and cited directly to the Eco-Energy EIR. Yet,

23 the NuStar project will have impacts that were not analyzed in the Eco-Energy EIR.

24 Likewise, the impacts of the Eco-Energy Project components were not analyzed in the

25 NuStar Application, and the NuStar Application has not undergone any further CEQA

26 review by either the Port or the SJVAPCD.

90.
27 The CURE Comment Letter and the Pless Report demonstrated that the

28 NuStar Project was relying on the Eco-Energy EIR to analyze the air quality impacts from

4641-003j - 22 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the NuStary Project. Dr. Pless' comments clearly explained that the Eco-Energy EIR was

2 wholly inadequate in this regard because it underestimated the baseline number truck trips;

3 did not account for truck emissions from throughput increases at NuStar; and failed to

4 account for other fugitive VOC emissions.

5 91. The Fox Report further explained that the FEIR failed to account for ROG

6 emissions from truck loading at the NuStar Facility. Specifically, the imported ethanol

7 would be loaded into trucks and transported to markets outside of California. The Project

8 includes 75,000 truck trips per year from the NuStar Facility. ROG emissions are released

9 during truck loading, from drips, hose disconnects and sumps that collect spills, and truck
exhaust. The FEIR failed to account for these emissions.
10
Emission Sources
11 92. Dr. Fox concluded that the EIR failed to account for all air pollutant
12 emission sources.
13 93. Emissions From Rail Car Unloading Onsite: The Fox Report explained that
14. Project would permit 60 unit trains to be received at the Eco-Energy, and each unit train
15 would be comprised of 108 rail cars. Yet, the FEIR omitted ROG emissions from rail car
16 unloading, including from fugitive components.
17 94. Emissions Sources Outside of the SJVAPCD: The FEIR incorrectly
18 analyzed only those Project activities which occur inside of the San Joaquin Valley Air
19 Basin, which is under the jurisdiction of the SJVAPCD, the hosting air district. However,
20 the Project will receive ethanol by train. The trains would originate from various facilities

21 located throughout the United States, offload at the Eco-Energy Terminal. The ethanol

22 would then be transferred to NuStar via the direct loop pipeline. Once the ethanol is

23 blended and processed, it would then be transported out of the Port to destinations all over

24 California.

25 95. The Fox Report described in detail the potential emissions and sources that

26 will come from trucks in transit (emitting NOx, ROG, PM10, PM2.5), trains in transit

27 (emitting criteria pollutants), locomotive emissions, and locomotive evaporative emissions.

28 Affected air districts, in addition to the hosting air district, include the Bay Area Air Quality

4641-003j - 23 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Management District (BAAQMD), the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management

2 District (SMAQMD), and the Mountain Counties Air Districts. Yet, the FEIR failed to

3 disclose, analyze, or mitigate emissions from these sources and impacts to other affected air

4 districts.

5 96. The Fox Report described in detail how locomotive emissions released

6 during transport from the California border to the project site can significantly impact

7 ambient air quality in air districts outside of the SJVAPCD's jurisdiction, and cause

were
8 thresholds to be exceeded, particularly for ozone and particulate matter. These impacts

9 not analyzed in the EIR.

Baseline
10
97. The FEIR incorrectly stated that any new fuel blending that occurs at NuStar
11 because of the Project is covered by NuStar's existing air quality permit limits, and thus
12 does not analyze impacts from fuel product blending.
13 98. Petitioners' comment letter explained that this approach violates CEQA and
14 thus, the FEIR was deficient. In selecting the baseline for CEQA analysis, CEQA requires
15 an agency to determine whether & project would change the existing environment by
16 increasing emissions as compared to actual existing emissions - not whether the project
17 will change the environment by exceeding hypothetical emissions allowed under permit
18 limits. Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality Management

19 District (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310 ("Communities for a Better Environment").

20 99. Furthermore, in using the NuStar Facility's air permit limits as a baseline,

21 the Eco-Energy EIR acknowledges that the projects are related, and thus must be analyzed

22 as one project, in a single, comprehensive EIR.

23 Mitigation Measures

24 100. The Fox Report demonstrated that the air quality mitigation measures

25 proposed to lessen or avoid construction and operational emissions are vague,

26 unenforceable, and deferred, and revisions in the FEIR fail to correct these deficiencies.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

101. The FEIR concluded that NOx emissions will be significant and exceed

2 thresholds during Project construction and for the first year of operation. Yet, the FEIR

3 failed to adequately mitigate these impacts.

4 102. Construction Mitigation, MM-AQ-01: MM-AQ-01 calls for the Port to adopt

5 a plan to reduce direct construction emissions. Petitioners and the California Air Resources

6 Board ("CARB") commented that MM-AQ-01 was an inadequate mitigation measure for

7 several reasons. MM-AQ-1 improperly deferred formulation of the measure to a future plan

8 without enforceable performance standards; the measure states that the plan would reduce

9 emissions compared to "the most recent CARB fleet average" but failed to describe what it

10 means by this; this target would not reduce impacts to less than significant levels;
construction emissions were calculated using the year 2018 as a baseline, although
11 construction will occur in the future, when average emissions are likely to be lower.
12 103. Furthermore, Petitioners' expert and CARB explained that emissions were
13, overall underestimated for the purpose of considering feasible mitigation measures, as the
14 Project fails to include impacts from the NuStar project.
15 104. Construction Mitigation, MM-AQ-02: MM-AQ-02 calls for the Port to limit
16 idling time to two minutes where available. Petitioners commented that this mitigation
17 is measure is vague and unenforceable.
18 105. Operational Mitigation Measures: The FEIR concluded that the operational
19 NOx emissions from 2019 would exceed thresholds, but failed to include any mitigation

20 measures. The FEIR justifies this omission, stating that the emissions are mainly the result

21 of trucks and main-line locomotives, which are regulated by the federal government. This is

22 false. First, the federal government does not regulate mobile emissions sources. Second,

23 because the trucks are operated by private parties, operating out of the NuStar facility, Dr.

24 Fox suggested a feasible mitigation measure of committing those private parties to a

25 voluntary emission reduction agreement ("VERA") to reduce NOx emissions.

26 Alternatives

106.
27 The FEIR only describes two alternatives: The No Project and the Reduced

28 Project alternative. The Reduced Project alternative would allow only 48 unit trains

4641-003j - 25 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

annually to be received at the terminal, as opposed to the Project, which would permit 60

2 unit trains, carrying 108 rail cars each.

3 107. The FEIR's alternatives analysis incorrectly failed to include the impacts of

4 the related NuStar Project, and thus was impermissibly narrow.

5 108. Petitioners and CARB submitted expert evidence demonstrating that, given

6 this impermissibly narrow scope, the FEIR's two proposed alternatives were not a

7 reasonable range of alternatives under CEQA.

8 Procedural Background

109.
9 On November 2, 2016, the Notice of Preparation ("NOP") was published for

10 the Eco-Energy Project and sent to the California State Clearinghouse for review.
110. The Draft EIR was released and distributed on June 12, 2017 for a 45-day
11 public review and comment period, which ended on July 26, 2017.
12 111. The Draft EIR concluded that the Project would have significant and
13 unavoidable impacts to air quality from NOx emissions during Project construction and for
14 the first year of Project operation (2019). The DEIR stated that all other impacts would be
15 less than significant or have no impact.
16 112. CARB submitted written comments on the Draft EIR explaining that the
17 Draft EIR's air quality analysis and proposed mitigation measures were inadequate in
18 several respects. CARB's comments were received by the Port on July 17, 2019.
19 113. On April 12, 2019, the Port issued its notice to the public that the Board

20 would hold a hearing on April 15, 2019 to consider the FEIR, Findings and SOC, MMRP,

21 Authorization to File a NOD under CEQA, Ordinance #254, and the 20-year lease

22 agreement with Eco-Energy.

23 114. On April 15, 2019, Petitioners timely submitted a written comment letter,

24 which included the Fox Report, the CURE Comment Letter, Pless Report, and attachments

25 to the Pless Report.

26 115. On April 15, 2019, the Board held a hearing. Petitioners attended the hearing

27 and presented their evidence to the Board.

28
4641-003j - 26 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

116. Despite the overwhelming evidence in the record that the Port was

2 improperly piecemealing the Project from the related NuStar Project, and had failed to

3 adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate impacts, and consider a reasonable range of

4 alternatives, the Board voted to certify the FEIR and related approvals.

5 117. On April 19, 2019, the Port issued a NOD approving the FEIR, Findings,

6 SOC and MMRP.

7 Legal Background

8 118. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

9 proposed actions in an EIR, except in very certain limited circumstances. See, e.g., PRC, § 21100.

10 119. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

11 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature

12 intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within

13 the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Communities for a Better Environment v. a Cal.

14 Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

15 120. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision

16 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. CEQA

17 Guidelines, § 15002(a)(1). "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

18 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR protects not

19 only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

20 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 ("Citizens of Goleta Valley"). The EIR has been described

21 as "an environmental alarm bell whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials

22 to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep

23 Jets Over the Bay V. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").

24 121. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

25 when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation

26 measures. 14 CCR § 15002(a)(2), (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 564. The

27 EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of

28

4641-003j - 27 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or

2 significantly reduced." CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2).

3 122. A lead agency may not approve a project if that will have significant effect on the

4 environment unless it has first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate or substantially

5 lessen all significant impacts of the Project. PRC, § 21002.1(a), (b).

6 123. If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may

7 approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant

8 effects on the environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the

9 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." PRC, § 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §

10 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).

11 124. CEQA forbids agencies from approving projects with significant adverse

12 impacts when feasible alternatives (or feasible mitigation measures) can substantially lessen

13 such impacts. Public Resources Code, section 21002.1(a) states, "[t]he purpose of an [EIR]

14 is to identify the significant effects of a project, to identify alternatives to the project, and to

15 indicate the manner in which those effects can be mitigated or avoided." An EIR must

16 consider an "rcasonable range" of alternatives, "which would feasibly attain most of the

17 basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant

18 effects of the project." CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a).

19 125. A "project" under CEQA means "the whole of an action," which has the potential to

20 result in a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

21 change in the environment. CEQA Guidelines, § 15378. CEQA mandates "that environmental

22 considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with

23 minimal potential impact on the environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous

24 consequences." Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-84. "Chopping up" projects in this

25 manner is piecemealing, a CEQA violation.

126.
26 CEQA requires an agency to determine whether a project would change the existing

27 environment by increasing emissions as compared to actual existing emissions - not whether the

28 project will change the environment by exceeding hypothetical emissions allowed under permit

4641-003j - 28 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

limits. Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Community Air District (2010) 48

2 Cal.4th 310.

127. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the
reviewing court is not to *uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project

5 proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no

6 judicial deference." Berkeley Jets, 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1355 (emphasis added), quoting, Laurel

7 Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12.

8 128. Claims of informational deficiency and procedural error in an EIR are reviewed de

9 novo under the independent review standard. Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th

10 502, 517. Under this standard, whether an EIR's description of an environmental impact is
11 insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the magnitude of the impact is "not a substantial

12 evidence question." Id. at p. 519.

13 Recirculation of EIR

14 129. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification is addressed in PRC section 21092.1,

15 and 14 CCR section 15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental

16 impact report after notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the

17 public agency shall give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to

18 Sections 21104 and 21153 before certifying the environmental impact report." PRC § 21092.1.

19 130. "Significant new information" includes:

20 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or
21 from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.
(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would
22 result…

23 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different
from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant
24 environmental impacts of the project… (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory
25 in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

26 14 CCR §15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.

131. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. V. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112

2 ("Laurel Heights II'), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation

3 prior to certification. The Court stated:

4 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. (See State Bar Rep., supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or
6 conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect meaningless triggers

7 recirculation under section 21092.1. (See, Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

9 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
10

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violations of CEQA

12 (CCP 1094.52, PRC §§ 21168, 21168.5, §§ 21000 et seq.) (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents and All Real Parties)
13

14 132. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the preceding paragraphs in

15 their entirety.

16 133. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all

17 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents failed to perform that duty. This

18 failure is arbitrary and capricious.

19 134. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that fails to comply with CEQA

20 and the CEQA Guidelines. The EIR fails to perform its function as an informational document that

21 it is "meant to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the

22 effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment" and "to list ways in which the

23 significant effects of such a project might be minimized." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

24 Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391.

25 135. CEQA requires the Court to establish whether an agency abused its discretion by
26 determining whether an agency failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and/or whether the

27 agency's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. PRC, § 21168. Based on these legal

28 Or in the alternative CCP §1085.
4641-003j - 30 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

standards, Respondents abused their discretion, exceeded their jurisdiction and proceeded in a

2 manner contrary to law without the support of substantial evidence in the record by committing the

3 following violations:

4 Failure to Describe the Whole of the Project (Piecemealing)

5 136. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

6 herein.

7 137. The EIR fails to meet CEQA's requirements for an adequate project description by

8 omitting from the analysis a description of the related NuStar Project.

9 138. The EIR fails to disclose the NuStar and Eco-Energy projects have a

10 common objective to import, blend, store, and export additional quantities of fuel than are

11 currently permitted under existing conditions.

12 139. The EIR fails to analyze impacts from the NuStar project which are

13 potentially significant sources of air quality emissions by underestimating the baseline truck

14 trips from the NuStar facility; failing to account for truck emissions from throughput

15 increases at NuStar; failing to account for other fugitive VOC emissions from NuStar's

16 operations; and failing to account for ROG emissions are released during loading, from

17 drips, hose disconnects and sumps that collect spills, and truck exhaust at the NuStar

18 facility.

140.
19 The EIR fails as an informational document. Rather than disclosing the Project

20 accurately and completely, the EIR deceives the public about the Project's scope and the Project's

21 significant impacts on the environment.

141.
22 By certifying an FEIR that fails to analyze and describe the whole project, the Port

23 violated the requirements of CEQA.

Failure to Accurately Describe the Baseline
24
142.
25 The EIR violates CEQA's requirement to accurately describe a project's baseline by

26 comparing the Project's impacts against hypothetical emissions allowed under permit limits.

27

28

4641-003j - 31 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

143. The FEIR stated that any new fuel blending that occurs at NuStar because of the

2 Project would be covered by NuStar's existing air quality permit limits, and thus failed to analyze

3 impacts from fuel product blending.

4 144. Substantial evidence in the record, including the Fox Report, demonstrated that, by

5 using hypothetical limits as a baseline, the FEIR failed to accurately quantify and disclose the

6 Project's impacts.

7 145. Furthermore, by using the NuStar Facility's air permit limits as a baseline, the F EIR
8 acknowledges that the two Projects are related, and thus must be analyzed as one Project in a

9 single, comprehensive EIR.

10 146. The Port's certification of an FEIR that fails to accurately describe the baseline, and

11 analyze impacts against that baseline, is an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in a manner

12 required by law.

13

14 Certifying the EIR Without Requiring Adequate Mitigation for Impacts to Air Quality During Project Construction and Operation
15 147. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully
16 set forth herein.
17 148. The FEIR violated CEQA's requirement to disclose and mitigate potentially
18 significant the Project's significant and unavoidable impacts to air quality during Project
19 construction and operation.
20 149. The FEIR acknowledged that construction impacts will result in significant and
21 unavoidable impacts during Project construction from NOx emissions. The FEIR acknowledged
22 that the Project will result in significant and avoidable impacts during the first year of Project
23 operation despite substantial evidence submitted by Petitioners, including the Fox Report, which
24 demonstrated that the Project's operational NOx emissions were underestimated.
25 150. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that MM-AQ-1
26 and MM-AQ-2, proposed to reduce construction NOx emissions, are vague, unenforceable, and
27 lack performance standards sufficient to lessen or avoid impacts.
28
4641-003j - 32 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

151. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that the Port

2 improperly rejected as infeasible mitigation measures to reduce or lessen emissions from trucks
and mainline locomotives.

4 152. The record reflects substantial evidence from the Fox Report that the Port

5 improperly failed to consider feasible mitigation measures to lessen or avoid such impacts,

6 including but not limited to, voluntary emission reduction agreements.

7 153. Dr. Fox also explained that the FEIR's HRA was severely inadequate for failing to

8 accurately disclose the Project's potentially significant health impacts from TAC emissions on

9 nearby sensitive receptors.

10 154. The Port's certification of an inadequate FEIR and MMRP that contains vague and
11 unenforceable mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy, and failure to consider feasible mitigation
12 measures, is an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
13 Failure to Disclose and Analyze Air Quality Impacts from All Emission Sources

14" 155. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully
15• set forth herein.

16 156. The FEIR concluded that operational air impacts will not exceed thresholds for NOx

17 after 2019, and thereafter, emissions will decrease, and will not cause thresholds of significance to

18 be exceeded for other criteria air pollutants or TACs.

19 157. The FEIR's conclusion violates CEQA's requirement to fully disclose and analyze
20 all sources of potentially significant impacts to air quality, from all emission sources.

21 158. The record reflects substantial evidence Dr. Fox demonstrating that the Project

22 would permit 60-unit train cars, of 108 rail cars each, to visit the site annually, but failed to

23 disclose ROG emissions from rail car unloading, including fugitive emissions.

24 159. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that the Project

25 failed to analyze emission sources from outside of the jurisdiction of the SJVAPCD, although the
26 unit trains would originate from various facilities located throughout the United States, transit

27

through other air districts, and once the ethanol is blended and processed, it will be transported out

2 of the Port to destinations all over California.

3 160. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that potential

4 Project emission sources will come from trucks in transit (emitting NOx, ROG, PM10, PM2.5),

5 trains in transit (emitting criteria pollutants), locomotive emissions, and locomotive evaporative

6 emissions.

7 161. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that affected

8 air districts, in addition to the hosting air district, include the Bay Area Air Quality Management

9 District, the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, and the Mountain

10 Counties Air Districts. Yet, the FEIR failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate emissions impacts to

11 these affected air districts.

12 162. The record reflects substantial evidence from Dr. Fox demonstrating that

13 locomotive emissions released during transport from the California border to the project site can

14 significantly impact ambient air quality in air districts outside of the SJVAPCD's jurisdiction, and
15 cause thresholds to be exceeded, particularly for ozone and particulate matter. These impacts were

16 not analyzed in the FEIR.

17 163. The Port's certification of a legally inadequate FEIR that failed to disclose and
18 analyze these emissions, while simultaneously concluding that the Project's operational air impacts

19 would not exceed thresholds for NOx after 2019, and thereafter, decrease resulting in insignificant

20 emissions that will not cause thresholds of significance to be exceeded for criteria air pollutants or

21 TACS, was an abuse of discretion and failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

22 Failure to Analyze a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

23 164. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if

24 fully set forth herein.

25 165. The FEIR failed to describe the whole of the Project because it omitted the

26 related NuStar project. Consequently, the FEIR only described two alternatives: No Project

27 and the Reduced Project alternative.

28
4641-003j - 34 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

166. Petitioners and CARB provided substantial expert evidence that this is not a is

2 reasonable range of alternatives given the artificially narrow scope of the Project.

3 167. The Port's certification of a legally inadequate FEIR that failed to analyze a

4 reasonable range of alternative is an abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in the manner
required by law.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (CCP 1094.53, PRC §§ 21168, 21168.5. Violations of CEQA; Inadequate Findings. (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents and All Real Parties)
8 168. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
9 forth herein.
10 169. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
11 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that lead
12 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
13 reached.
14 170. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
15 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited
16 to, the following:
17 a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that
18 adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects
19 on the environment, including but not limited to air quality and health risk from
20 exposure to TACs;

21 b. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures

22 that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were

23 infeasible;

24 C. The determination that the Project, as approved, would have no significant effects

25 on the environment with regard to other resource areas;

26 d. The determination that the Project complied with all applicable laws.

- 171.

2 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

3 discretion by making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements

4 of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon, and by adopting a legally inadequate

5 statement of overriding considerations that failed to mitigate all significant impacts to the greatest

6 extent feasible before concluding that any remaining significant environmental impacts are

7 acceptable due to overriding considerations. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the FEIR
and approval of the Project must be set aside.

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief and judgment as follows:

1.

11 That the Court place a stay on Respondents' decisions certifying the FEIR and
approving the Project pending trial.

12 2.

13 That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent

14 injunction barring Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and all other persons working on their

15 behalf, from proceeding with any activity that may result in any physical change in the

16 environment on the Project site until the Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions
in compliance with CEQA and the writ is discharged.

17 3.

18 That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate and declaratory relief directing
Respondents to:

19 a)

20 Vacate and set aside the certification and approval of the FEIR and other
Project approvals for the Project;

21 b)

22 Refrain from approving any further permits or entitlements for the Project

23 until Respondents have prepared and certified a legally adequate EIR and

24 complied with all other applicable requirements of CEQA, as directed by

25 this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

c)

26 Prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate EIR and

27 otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve
the Project; and

Dear Chairman Griffen, Honorable Members of the Stockton Board of Port

This letter provides the Port of Stockton, Stockton Port District, Board of Port Commissioners of The Port Of Stockton, and the Board of Port Commissioners of
the Stockton Port District (collectively, "Port") with notice, in accordance with the Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Safe Fuel and Energy Resources California, Steven M.

Page 2

the Port of Stockton and Eco-Energy Distribution Services, LLC's (collectively "Applicant") Eco-Energy Liquid Bulk Receiving Terminal Project ("Project"), including certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") prepared
for the Project, adoption of California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and
Reporting Program, 20-year lease agreement, and approval of related Project
entitlements, based on violations of CEQA. 1 The Board of Port Commissioners
certified the FEIR and approved the Project on April 15, 2019 and filed a Notice of
Determination pursuant to CEQA on April 19, 2019.

The petition being filed will seek the following relief:

1. a For a stay of the Port's decisions in certifying the FEIR and approving the Project pending trial.

2. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction
restraining the Port and the Project Applicant from taking any action
to carry out the Project, relying in whole or in part upon the FEIR
pending trial.

3. For a peremptory writ of mandate, preliminary and permanent
injunction and declaratory relief directing the Port to:

a. Vacate and set aside its adoption of the FEIR and all other
Project approvals; b. Suspend all activity under the existing Project approvals that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment, including but not limited to, refraining from
approving any further permits or entitlements for the Project
until the Port has prepared and certified a legally adequate EIR
and complied with all other applicable requirements of CEQA,
as directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code
section 21168.9;
C. Prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate EIR and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action
taken to approve the Project; and

1 Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

d. Comply with all other applicable requirements of CEQA, as
directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section
21168.9.

4. For the costs of suit.

5. For an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure,
section 1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of law and equity.

6. For any other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and
proper.

SAFER California urges the Port to rescind its Notice of Determination for
the Project, as well as the existing Project approvals, and prepare legally adequate CEQA document for this Project as required by law.

Our clients may be willing to forego this lawsuit if the Port promptly contacts
us to set forth its plan for rescinding its certification of the FEIR and approvals of the Project, or to propose alternative, potential terms of settlement acceptable to our clients. Otherwise, we will promptly serve the petition as soon as it is completed
and filed.

Sincerely,
Actd
Sara Dudley
