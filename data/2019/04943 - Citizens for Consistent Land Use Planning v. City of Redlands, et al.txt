24 INTRODUCTION

25 This action challenges the approval by the City of Redlands on or about September 3,
26 2019 of a housing project known as Tentative Tract Map (TTM) 20065. The Project will
27 develop a 10.44-acre site intò 30 lots and 29 single-family homes. The Project includes a
28 zone change from "Education" to "Suburban Residential" to allow for the proposed

3 residential use. Petitioner, Citizens For Consistent Land Use Planning, a group of

4 concerned residents and citizens, brings this mandamus action because the Project results

Redland's General Plan.

5 in adverse, unmitigated environmental impacts and creates conflicts with the City of

6

7 The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et

8 seq.) requires an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for any project that may have a

9 significant adverse effect on the environment. Despite reasoned comments in the record

10 regarding the Project's significant environmental effects, the City of Redlands declined to

11 prepare an EIR for the Project, instead relying upon a lesser level of CEQA review - a
Mitigated Negative Declaration - which was in error.

12

13 3. All land use decisions in California must be consistent with the policies of a city's

14 adopted general plan. The City of Redlands General Plan has policies that are applicable

15 to the Project. The Project, however, conflicts with many of the relevant General Plan

16 policies, including those relating to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, promoting the

17 use of renewable energy, and the preservation of community character and agricultural
resources including citrus trees.

18

19 As a result of the CEQA violations and General Plan inconsistencies, Petitioner

20 respectfully requests issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the decisions

21 of Respondent City of Redlands ("City") approving the Project, including: a Mitigated

22 Negative Declaration, Resolution No. 7998 approving a Socio-Economic Cost/Benefit

23 Study, Resolution No .7999 approving Tentative Trace Map No. 20065, Ordinance 2988
adopting Zone Change No. 461 and all associated approvals (collectively, "the
Project").

24

25 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:

26 S

27

28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

PARTIES

2 6. Petitioner, CITIZENS FOR CONSISTENT LAND USE PLANNING, is an

3 unincorporated association of residents and citizens who are concerned with land use,

4 environmental, and quality of life issues in the City of Redlands.

5 Respondent, CITY OF REDLANDS, is a political subdivision of the State of California.

6 The City is a local governmental agency charged with the authority of regulating and

7 administering local land use and development within its territory in compliance with the

8 provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable provisions of

9 State law, including CEQA. The City is the lead agency for the Project and is therefore
10 charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with applicable laws.
11 8. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest,
12 DANIEL J. BUOYE, an individual, is the applicant for the Project, the sponsor of the
13 Project, has an ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project
14 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.
15 DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership interest in
16 the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in approvals at the subject of
17 this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the Real Parties in
18 Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through 100 inclusive.

19 STATEMENT OF FACTS

20 The Project

21 10. The Project will develop a residential housing project consisting of 29 single family

22 residential lots and one lettered lot on a 10.44-acre site on south side of East Highland

23 Avenue and west of Redlands Street in the City of Redlands.
24 11. The vacant Project site was formerly an orange grove. On-site vegetation includes mature

25 palm trees along the northern boundary of the Project site. An existing riparian

26 watercourse traverses the Project site. The Project includes the fill of this riparian area.
27 12. The Project site is designated Low Density Residential under the City of Redland's

28

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 General Plan. The site is zoned Education (E). The Project includes an application for a

3 zone change to Suburban Residential (R-S) to allow for the proposed residential
development.

4

5 13. Surrounding uses include established single-family residential homes to the north and

6 west. To the south is an agricultural property. To the east is a vacant parcel and Moore
Middle School.

7

8 14. The record indicates that an important historical resource - the Mill Creek Zanja

9 (historical citrus irrigation ditch) - or portions thereof runs along the southern edge of the
Project site.

10

11 15. Access to the Project site would be provided via East Highland Avenue.
Administrative Process

12

13 16. The City prepared an Initial Study for the Project pursuant to CEQA on or about April
16, 2019.

14

15 17. On or about May 28, 2019, the City of Redlands Planning Commission reviewed the

16 Project and voted to recommend that the City Council adopt the Mitigated Negative

17 Declaration, Zone Change, and associated Project approvals.

18 18. On July 16, 2019, the City of Redlands City Council held a public hearing on the Project.
After taking public comment, the Council continued the item.
19 19. On September 3, 2019, the City Council again held a public hearing on the Project and
20

21 voted 3-2 in favor of approving the Project including the Mitigated Negative Declaration
pursuant to CEQA.

22

23 20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, the City filed and posted the

24 CEQA Notice of Determination for the Project on or about September 4, 2019.

25 21. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public policies

26 of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA

27 and conformance with state law. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will

28 confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from environmental

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

- and other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general

2 to enforce these public policies and prevent such harm.

3 22. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying with
4 the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, in notifying Respondent of

5 the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by complying with the

6 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.6, in notifying Respondent of

7 Petitioner's election to prepare the record of proceedings in connection with this action

8 (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").

9 23. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which

10 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be irreparably

11 harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was harmed by, among
12 other things, the failure of the City to require the preparation of a EIR to adequately

13 evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and by the City's approval of the Project

14 without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures contrary to the
15 requirements of State law.

16 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
17 24. Petitioner and its members commented in writing and verbally during the administrative

18 review process that the CEQA review was inadequate in that the Initial Study failed to
19 properly disclose and evaluate impacts and/or support its conclusions with evidence; that
20 the Project would have potentially significant impacts to/from the following: aesthetics,
21 air quality/greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, cultural resources, land use/
22 planning, and traffic; and that the City did not adopt adequate mitigation for these
23 potential effects or adopt all feasible mitigation.
24 25. Accordingly, Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies pursuant to the requirements

25 of Cal. Public Resources Code $ 21177 and State law.

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

Section 1094.5.
2 is 27. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and 394
0v as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in, San Bernardino County,
and because the City is located in San Bernardino County.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (WRIT OF MANDATE- VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT, AS TO ALL PARTIES)
7

a. 8 The City wrongly adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project when there was substantial evidence of a fair argument of significant
9 environmental impacts as result of the Project.

10 28. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 27 above as though set

11 forth in full herein.

12 29. As the lead agency, Respondent City is charged with the duty to fully and accurately

13 consider the environmental consequences of the Project through the preparation of an

14 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). (Public Resources Code, § 21080 (d).)

15 30. The EIR requirement is the "heart of CEQA." (Cal. Code of Regs., Tit. 14 "State CEQA

16 Guidelines," § 15003(a).)
17 31. An EIR is required for any proposed project that may have a significant effect on the

18 environment. (Public Resources Code, § 21100 (a).)

19 32. If a lead agency is presented with a "fair argument" based on substantial evidence in the

20 record that a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead

21 agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may be presented with other substantial

22 evidence that the proposed project will not have a significant effect. (State CEQA

23 Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1).)

24 33. A lead agency may prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project only when: (1)
25 revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant project effects

26 to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur; and (2) there is no substantial

27 evidence in light of the whole record that the project as revised may have a significant

28 effect on the environment. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15070 (b).)

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

- 34. The City was presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may
2 significantly affect the environment within the meanings of CEQA for impacts to/from,
a u A u but not limited to, aesthetics, air quality/greenhouse gas emissions, cultural resources,
biological resources, land use/ planning, and traffic; and Petitioner submitted comments
to the City based on substantial evidence that the Project may result in significant
environmental impacts that were not adequately evaluated and/or mitigated. By way of
7 example, Petitioner commented that:

8 a. The record supports a fair argument of significant biological impacts in terms
o of adverse impacts to protected animal species and sensitive riparian
resources. The Project purports to rely on future analysis, permits and
11 approvals as mitigation for these impacts, which is improper under CEQA.
12 (State CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).)
13 b. The record supports a fair argument of significant cultural/historical resource
14 impacts but the Project relies on uncertain, unenforceable and deferred
15 mitigation which is improper under CEQA. CEQA requires that a public
16 agency ensure that mitigation measures are fully enforceable, certain to occur,
17 and not improperly deferred. (Public Resources Code, § 21081.6 (b); State
18 CEQA Guidelines, § 15097.)

19 C. The record supports a fair argument of significant land use impacts, namely
20 the Project conflicts with General Plan policies with respect to: preservation of
21 riparian and cultural/archaeological resources; reduction of greenhouse gas
88 * emissions; promotion of renewable energy; preservation of community
character; preservation of agricultural resources; and promotion of urban
forests/tree planting including citrus trees. Likewise, there is a fair argument in
25 the record that the Project conflicts with City of Redlands and County of San
26 Bernardino policies and plans related to the reduction of greenhouse gas
27 emissions (GHGs).

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 35. The City failed to demonstrate that all potentially significant impacts from the Project

3 will be mitigated below a level of significance.

4 36. By adopting the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project where there is substantial

5 evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant

6 environmental effects and/or where the Initial Study is based on incomplete analysis or

7 investigation, the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and the Project
approvals must be set aside. (Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code, con
21168.)
b. The Initial Study Fails as an Informational Document.
10 37. Two of the

11 purposes of the CEQA Initial Study are to "[p]rovide the Lead Agency with

12 information to use as the basis for deciding whether to prepare an EIR or a Negative

13 Declaration" and "[p]rovide documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a

14 Negative Declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment."

15 38. Under CEQA, a prejudicial abuse of discretion may occur when relevant information is

16 not presented to the public agency. "When the informational requirements of CEQA are

17 not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in 'a manner required by law' and has

18 therefore abused its discretion." (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz

19 (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1200.) "The failure to comply with the law subverts the

20 purposes of CEQA if it omits material necessary to informed decisionmaking and

21 informed public participation." (Lighthouse, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at 1201.)

22 39. CEQA requires that the lead agency investigate impacts. "CEQA places the burden of

23 environmental investigation on government rather than the public." (Gentry v. City of

24 Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4™h 1359, 1379.) "Where an agency fails to gather

25 information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a

26 negative declaration is inappropriate. (City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398, 406-408.)

27

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

1 40. Petitioner commented that the Initial Study fails to adequately evaluate and disclose

2 impacts and/or substantiate its conclusions, despite comments in the record that

3 information was lacking or that conclusions were not supported by facts or analysis. The

4 Initial Study fails to document its conclusion of "less than significant" or "less than

5 significant with mitigation" with respect to impacts including to/from: aesthetic
6 resources, biological resources, cultural resources, greenhouse gas emissions, and land

7 use impacts.

8 41. Furthermore, under CEQA, the initial study/mitigated negative declaration must contain

9 "project description" which adequately informs the reader about the scope and nature of

10 the proposed activity. (State CEQA Guidelines 15071 (a).) An inaccurate or incomplete
11 project description undermines CEQA's purposes, particularly where it minimizes the
12 project's environmental impacts. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the
13 sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City of Los
14 Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.) Petitioner commented in the record that the

15 Initial Study fails to provide an accurate or complete Project Description with respect to

16 vehicular access to the Project site as well as the orientation of homes relative to East
17 Highland Avenue.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (WRIT OF MANDATE- VIOLATIONS OF THE GENERAL PLAN, AS TO ALL
PARTIES)
20 42. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 41 above as though
21 set forth in full herein.
22 43. It is settled California law that project approvals must be consistent with an adopted
23 general plan. "The general plan has been aptly described as the "constitution for all
24 future developments' within the city or county... '[T]he propriety of virtually any local
25 decision affecting land use and development depends upon consistency with the
26 applicable general plan and its elements.' The consistency doctrine has been described
27 as "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws; it is the principle which
28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

] infuse[s] the concept of planned growth with the force of law'." (Napa Citizens For

2 Honest Goy't v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 355.)
0 44. According to CEQA case law, "[a] project is consistent with the general plan 'if, v considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan
and not obstruct their attainment.' A given project need not be in perfect conformity

6 with each and every general plan policy. To be consistent, a [project] must be
'compatible with' the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs specified in
the general plan.'." (Napa Citizens, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 378.) "General plans

9 ordinarily do not state specific mandates or prohibitions. Rather, they state 'policies,'

10 and set forth 'goals'." (Id.)
11 45. The Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan because it conflicts with

12 objectives and policies with respect to: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;
13 promotion of solar energy; mitigation and analysis of archaeological resources;

14 preservation of community character; preservation of trees; and promotion of

15 agricultural resources and urban forests/tree planting including the planting of citrus

16 trees.

17 46. By approving the Project which is inconsistent with the City's General Plan, the City's

18 action were arbitrary and capricious, prejudicial abuse of discretion, or otherwise

19 violated the County's duties under the law for which the Project approvals must be set

20 aside. (CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5.)

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:
22 47. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of Redlands, to
23 set aside its decision approving the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project.

24 (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1094.5, 1085)
25 48. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of Redlands, to

26 set aside all Project approvals. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9, Code Civ.

27 Proc., §§ 1094.5, 1085.)

28

4 (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9, Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1094.5, 1085.)

5 50. For costs of this suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, §
1021.5 and other provisions of law.

6

7 51. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary and permanent

8 injunctive relief, in the event that the Real Party in Interest, or its agents or

0 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site during the litigation. (Code
of Civil Procedure § 526.)
