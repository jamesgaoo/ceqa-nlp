21 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that under Section 21167.7 of the California Public

22 Resources Code and Rule 338 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, on October 16,
23 2019, Petitioner MILL VALLEY RESIDENTS FOR THE PROTECTION OF WILDLIFE
24 ("Petitioner" or "MVRPW") filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Verified
25 Petition") against the City of Mill Valley (the "City" or "Respondent") in Marin County
26 Superior Court. Petitioner alleges that the City violated the California Environmental Quality
27 Act ("CEQA") by adopting Ordinance No. 1309, an Ordinance of the City Council of the
28 City of Mill Valley amending Chapter 15.04 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code to modify
Page 1
PETITIONER'S NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL - Case No.:

1 Section 4907 of the California Fire Code (the "Project"), and issuance of categorical

2 exemptions for the Project, illegally exempting the Project from review under the California
3 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code section 21000 et seq.

4 Petitioner alleges that the City adopted the Project before conducting an

5 environmental review of the impact that the Project may have on the environment, and that

6 the City is not categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15304, 15307

7 and 15308 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations because substantial evidence in

8 the record supports a fair argument that the Project will have a significant effect on the
9 environment and that these exemptions do not apply.

19 Petitioner MILL VALLEY RESIDENTS FOR THE PROTECTION OF

20 WILDLIFE, an Unincorporated Association ("MVRPW" or "Petitioner") hereby petitions

21 the Court for a Writ of Mandate ordering Defendant and Respondent City of Mill Valley

22 ("City" or "Respondent") to rescind its adoption on September 16, 2019, of Ordinance

23 No. 1309, an Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Mill Valley amending Chapter

24 15.04 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code to modify Section 4907 of the California Fire Code

25 (the "Project"), and therefore brings this public interest citizens suit to enforce the California

26 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.

27 By this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (the "Petition"), MVRPW alleges

28 as follows:

Page 1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

THE PARTIES P

2 1. Petitioner MVRPW is a non-profit unincorporated association whose

0 v members reside and own property in the City and are dedicated to protecting critical plant and
animal habitats through science, policy, education, and environmental law. Petitioner has a

5 beneficial interest in the outcome of the proceedings due to, among other things, the nature of

6 the project at issue in the proceedings (defined below beginning at paragraph 10) and because

7 Petitioner's members reside and own property in Mill Valley, Marin County, California and

8 use publicly accessible portions of the Project area and surrounding areas for recreation,

9 wildlife viewing, and educational purposes.

10 2. On information and belief, Respondent City is a local governmental

11 agency and political subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to

12 regulate and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the

13 obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA

14 and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondent also has the authority to legislate changes to land use

15 and policy within its jurisdiction. Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA® for the

16 preparation of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and for approval of the Project.

17 3. The true names and capacities of Respondents DOES 1-100, inclusive,

18 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sued such Respondents by such fictitious names

19 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 474. Petitioners will, with leave of court if

20 necessary, further amend this Petition when the true names and capacities of said DOE

21 Respondents have been ascertained.
22 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 4. This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Section 1085

24 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 21168.5 of the Public Resource Code.

25 Alternatively, this Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the

26 Code of Civil Procedure and Section 21168 of the Public Resource Code.

27 5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 394 of the Code of

28 Civil Procedure because the acts performed by the Respondent, including the violations of

Page 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

-

2 law and statutes, took place in Marin County. In addition, the Project will be implemented in

3 Marin County and will therefore affect Petitioner's members who reside in Marin County and
Marin County's environment, as further detailed herein.

4 6.

5 Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting

6 multiple written correspondence on the Project via email and personal delivery to the City to

7 request compliance with CEQA, including the completion of full and adequate environmental

8 review. All issues raised in this Petition were raised before Respondents by Petitioner, other
members of the public, or public agencies prior to approval of the Project.
7.

10 Petitioner has complied with Section 21167.5 of the Public Resource
Code by serving the City with written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action.

11 A true and correct copy of this written notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

12 8.

13 Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings. A true and

14 correct copy of the Notification of Intent to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached
hereto as Exhibit B.

15 9.

16 This petition is timely filed in accordance with Section 21167 of the
Public Resource Code and Section 15112 of the CEQA Guidelines.

17 THE PROJECT

18 10:

19 The Project requires Mill Valley property owners within the Wildlife

20 Urban Interface area ("'WUI") to remove ten (10) species of plants from the entirety of each

21 parcel of land they own and to maintain the property free of the "banned" vegetation
commencing May 1, 2021.

22 11.

23 The Project further requires property owners within the WUI,

24 commencing 30 days after the adoption of Ordinance No. 1309, to comply as follows:

a)

25 remove all "pyrophytic vegetation" within 10 feet of property

26 lines and within thirty (30) feet of structures "as determined by the Fire Chief or his/her
designee;"

27 b)

28 cut and remove tree limbs within 10 feet of decks and roofs;

c) raise crowns of all trees by cutting and removing growth less

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 3

501255.8

-

2 than three (3) inches in diameter, from the ground up to a minimum height of 10 feet; and,
that grasses be cut and maintained at the height of 3 inches or shorter, among other

4 requirements, with "exceptions" only being subject to the "approval of the Fire Chief."

12.

5 The Project further places the burden of environmental impact review

6 and reporting on the property owner "when the removal of trees and/or vegetation under the

7 Project will affect threatened or endangered species" by requiring that the property owner

8 hire a "qualified biologist to conduct a species survey and prepare a mitigation plan."

13. The Project calls for "voluntary" clearance of all vegetation (other than
succulents) within the first 3 feet of all structures and for the installation of hardscape

10 material within the 3 feet area.

11 14.

12 Respondent has pushed-through and adopted the Project without
compliance with state laws protecting the environment and in violation of the Due Process

13

14 rights of the City's property owners - of which approximately 5,000 parcels in the WUI are
immediately affected.

15 15.

16 The Project will require the removal of significant vegetation, affecting
no less than 5,000 residential structures, and critical habitat for numerous threatened and

17

18 endangered species. As is evident from its unique and beautiful topography, Mill Valley.

19 contains critical vegetative habitat for numerous threatened and endangered species

20 including, the California red-legged frog, steelhead and coho salmon, the California tiger

21 salamander and the Northern spotted owl, in addition to the California giant salamander
which is classified as a "California Species of Concern" and "near threatened."

22 16.

23 The Project will eradicate a significant amount of the City's vegetative

24 landscape thereby causing an overwhelming direct physical change in the entire environment

25 encompassed by the Proposed Ordinance and even beyond the City limits, overflowing into

26 the surrounding Marin County lands. Given the rich diversity of the City's vegetative

27 landscape, the Project will not only affect the City's biological resources, but will also have
significant aesthetic impacts.

28 17. The potential effects on the environment and threatened and endangered

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 4

501255.8

l species will undoubtedly be felt even outside of the Project area of the 5,000 residences in the

2 WUI, as these threatened and endangered species migrate, nest and reproduce in the
surrounding County lands and waterways adjacent to the City limits in addition to within the

4 City limits targeted by the roject.

5 18. The Project will result in extreme, aggressive and sweeping eradication

6 of critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, and the resulting "taking" of

7 personal property from private landowners without due process.

8 19. The Project will result in significant removal of vegetation which will

9 cause dangerous erosion and flooding risks.

10 20. The Project will also result in the unnecessary destruction of

11 California's native plant heritage, diminishment of water quality, loss of cultural resources

12 and habitat for wildlife, and loss of hillside stability for the purpose of wildfire vegetation

13 management.

14 BACKGROUND OF PROJECT

15 21. On November 7, 2016, the City adopted by reference the current 2016

16 California Fire Code of Regulations Title 24, Part 9, as modified by Ordinance No. 1286.

17 22. On or about August 6, 2018, a draft of what is now Ordinance No. 1309

18 (the "Ordinance") was introduced during regular meeting of the City. The City's Fire Chief

19 prepared and presented a Staff Report to support adopting the Ordinance which had a stated

20 purpose of enabling "the creation of survivable properties during wildland conflagration."

21 23. An EIR was not prepared in connection with the Ordinance.

22 24. On or about June 17, 2019, the Ordinance was discussed during a

23 regular meeting of the City.

24 25. On or about August 5, 2019, the Ordinance was discussed during a

25 regular meeting.

26 26. On or about September 5, 2019, the Ordinance was discussed during a

27 regular meeting.

28 •27. On or around September 16, 2019, the City passed and adopted the

Page 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

- Ordinance, with an effective date of thirty days after its adoption.

2 28.

3 The City conducted no environmental review under CEQA before

4 adopting the Ordinance and, therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
29.

5 The City improperly contends that the Ordinance is categorically
exempt from environmental review under CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15304, 15307
and 15308 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. However, substantial evidence

8 in the record supports a fair argument that the Project will result in significant environmental
impacts as set forth herein and that these exceptions do not apply.

9 30.

10 The Ordinance will foreseeably result in significant effects on the

environment and on Petitioner.

11 31.

12 Prior to the City's passage and adoption of the Ordinance, Petitioner

13 and members of the public submitted numerous detailed comments concerning the Ordinance,

14 including the need for the City to comply with CEQA, the need for the City to complete a full

15 and adequate EIR concerning the Project, and that the City was not exempted from
complying with CEQA:

16 32. initial

17 Prior to approving the Ordinance, the City did not prepare an

18 study, a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or an EIR, despite the fact that

19 the Ordinance is a project subject to CEQA that will have a demonstrably adverse impact on
the environment.

20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21

22 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

33.

23 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference all the
allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 32, inclusive, of this Petition.

24 34.

25 Respondent's actions in approving the Project constitute a prejudicial

26 abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its

27 decisions are not supported by substantial evidence, as more fully set forth below:
a) The City failed to prepare an EIR.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Page 6

501255.8

(b) The City's finding that the Project is categorically exempt from

2 environmental review under Section 15301 of the California Code of Regulations because it
requires residents to repair and maintain existing landscaping and native growth is not is

4 supported by the record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair

5 argument that the Project will result in major alterations to land, including eradication of a

6 significant amount of the City's vegetative landscape.

7 (c) The City's findings that the Project is categorically exempt from

8 environmental review under Section 15304 of the California Code of Regulations because it

9 would require minor public or private alterations in the condition of land and vegetation is not

10 supported by the record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair a

11 argument that the Project will result in significant environmental impacts, including

12 significant impacts on threatened and endangered species, and a "taking" of personal property

13 from private landowners without due process.

14 (d) The City's findings that the Project is categorically exempt from

15 environmental review under Sections 15307 and 15308 of the California Code of Regulations

16 because it would protect natural resources and the environment is not supported by the

17 record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the

18 Project will result in such impacts, including significant impacts on threatened and

19 endangered species, unnecessary destruction of California's native plant heritage,

20 diminishment of water quality, loss of cultural resources, and loss of hillside stability.

21 (e) The City failed to adequately respond to comments by Petitioner

22 and other members of the public about the Project prior to adoption on September 16, 2019.

23 (f) The substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a

24 fair argument that the Project will have a significant impact on the environment.

25 (g) The City's findings do not adequately disclose the evidence it

26 relied on and assert conclusory statements unsupported by evidence or factual information.

27 35. Petitioner exhausted its administrative remedies by, inter alia,

28 submitting timely comments on the Project to Respondent, and by demanding that

Page 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

P Respondent conduct an adequate environmental review of the Project in compliance with

2 CEQA.

3 36. Respondent's failure to prepare an EIR precluded an analysis of

of 4 alternatives to the Project. Pursuant to CEQA, Respondent had a duty to identify a range

5 reasonable alternatives and to describe these alternatives in sufficient detail to be of

6 informational value to themselves and to the public. The discussion of alternatives is
required to focus on those that were capable of substantially reducing or eliminating any

8 significant adverse environmental effects. Because an EIR was not prepared, there was no

9 analysis of alternatives that are capable of achieving the Project's goals and of substantially

10 reducing the adverse environmental impacts.

11 37. The failure to prepare an EIR also precluded an effective analysis of the

12 cumulative effects of the Project with other projects and/or impacts in the region. CEQA
13 requires that a lead agency analyze not only the environmental effects of a project within the

14 project's own boundaries, but the cumulative impacts the project will have in an area-wide or
15 regional context, including cumulative effects along with other projects. The cumulative

16 environmental impacts of the Project in conjunction with other projects were not examined.

17 These cumulative impacts should have been studied and mitigated to the maximum extent

18 feasible.

19 38. Respondent has the clear, present legal duty and present legal authority

20 and ability to comply with CEQA. However, Respondent has failed and refused to perform

21 that duty and has abused its discretion in failing to comply with CEQA. Respondent's failure

22 and refusal is arbitrary and capricious. Respondent's decision to approve the Project is not

23 supported by substantial evidence. The standard of review is set forth in Cal. Pub. Res. Code

24 § 21168.5.

25 39. Respondent's actions of approving the Project are invalid and do not

26 comply with CEQA for the reasons set forth above. In failing to comply with CEQA and the

27 CEQA Guidelines and by failing to prepare a full EIR for the Project, Respondent has

28 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that it has not proceeded in a manner required

Page 8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

by law and in that the determination to approve the Project is not supported by substantial

2 evidence.

3 40. The public interest will suffer from Respondent's failure to perform its

4 clear public duty to comply with CEQA by preparing and certifying a legally adequate EIR.

5 Respondent's failure to perform the reviews required by CEQA undermines the CEQA goals

6 of alerting the public and Respondent to environmental changes before they have reached the

7 point of ecological no return. It deprives Respondent of the opportunity to mitigate
environmental impacts. It fails to protect the environment and the interest of providing
informed self-government. In the absence of adequate information and mitigation measures,

10 the public and the environment will be significantly and adversely affected by numerous

11 environmental harms.

12 41. Petitioner has incurred substantial costs and attorney's fees that will

13 continue to accrue in an amount not yet determined. Petitioner is entitled to an award of

14 attorneys' fees if it prevails in this action as provided in California Code of Civil Procedure :

15 1021.5 and other applicable statutes because this action seeks to enforce important rights

16 affecting the public interest which, if enforced, will confer significant benefits on the general

17 public. Petitioner will seek an award of fees and costs.

18 PETITIONERS ARE ENTITLED TO RELIEF

19 42. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference all the

20 allegations of Paragraphs through 41, inclusive, of this Petition.

21 43. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the City's adoption of the

22 Ordinance, because the City's approval of this Project poses environmental impacts that will

23 harm Petitioner's members and their real property.

24 44. Petitioner timely seeks appropriate mandamus and other equitable or

25 legal relief as the Court sees proper to prevent the City from attempting to implement any part

26 of the Ordinance before this action is resolved on its merits.

27 45. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and the City. Petitioner

28 contends that the City has acted in violation of applicable law as alleged herein above, and

Page 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
501255.8

r must therefore vacate and set aside its adoption of the Ordinance. Petitioner is informed and

2 believes, and thereon alleges, that the City disputes these contentions. A judicial resolution

3 of this controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

4 46. At all times mentioned herein, the City was able to conduct

5 environmental review and analysis of the Ordinance as required by CEQA. Nonetheless, the
City has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to conduct this required

7 environmental review and analysis under CEQA.

47. If the City is not ordered to set aside its approval of the Ordinance,
Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and

10 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Unless this Court issues its Writ of Mandate

11 or grants relief vacating the City's approval of the Ordinance, and requiring the City to

12 comply with CEQA, the City's adoption of the Ordinance challenged herein would violate

13 applicable law. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate

14 Petitioner for the harm that will be caused to by the lack of essential environmental reviews,

15 harm to property interests, harm to the environment, and violations Due Process rights of the

16 City's property owners threatened by the City's approval of the Ordinance.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment and further relief as follows:
19 1. • For a preemptory writ of mandate directing Respondent:
20 a) to vacate and set aside approval of the Project;
21 b) to prepare, circulate, and consider a legally adequate EIR for the
22 Project and otherwise to comply with CEQA before any subsequent action is taken to
23 implement the Project;

24 c) the City be prevented from implementing the Project unless and

25 until Respondent has complied with all requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state

26 and local laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations as are directed by this Court pursuant to

27 Section 21168.9 of the Public Resources Code;

28 2. For costs of suit;

3. For an award of attorney fees pursuant to CCP con 1021.5 and other
