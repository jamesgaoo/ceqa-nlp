PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Plaintiff and Petitioner STANISLAUS CONSOLIDATED FIRE PROTECTION

2 DISTRICT (hereinafter, "Petitioner" or "District") alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the decision of defendant and respondent CITY OF

5 RIVERBANK (*Respondent" or "City") to certify an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for

6 the Crossroads West Specific Plan (the "Project") under the California Environmental Quality

7 Act ("CEQA") and approve the Project-a decision that potentially endangers the City's residents

8 and exacerbates the risk of fire hazards in the City.

9 2. The District has repeatedly apprised the City of the EIR's shortcomings and the

10 Project's inconsistency with the City's fire-related General Plan policies, but the City has paid

11 little heed to the District's concerns. Indeed, the City has dismissed the District's concerns by
% d11 83O3IA 8 1S38 1S38 12 erroneously contending that "[a]dequate equipment, staffing, facilities and response times for fire LAW OFFICES 969t6 VINHOHITVO NE3HO LNNTVM 06E ELLINS 'IEEHLS NIVW 'N LOOZ 13 protection services are issues that are not physical impacts to the environment that must be

14 addressed through the EIR process, or require mitigation under CEQA." In other words, the City

15 contends that it has no obligation to analyze the Project's impacts on fire protection services or to

16 mitigate those impacts. The City is wrong. To protect the people it serves, the District has no

17 choice but to file this action.

18 3. The Project seeks to fundamentally transform a 380-acre swath of land ("Subject

19 Property") currently dedicated to agricultural purposes, including a cow dairy operation with 550

20 milking cows and row crops. The Project entails, among other things, development of the Subject

21 Property with at least 2,452 residential units (including high density residential units) and 577,000

22 square feet of mixed uses (including retail uses and up to 350 additional residential units). The

23 City concedes that the Project would result in population growth by bringing thousands of people

24 to the area.

25 4. Despite the obvious enormity of the Project, the City failed to properly analyze the

26 Project's impact on fire protection services or the Project's consistency with the City's fire-

27 related General Plan policies. Instead, the City ignored the District's repeated concerns, certified

28 the EIR, and approved the Project. In doing so, the City failed to properly exercise its duties as a 1 - 38075.00001\31979469.3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

lead agency under CEQA (Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. and California Code of

2 Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. [State CEQA Guidelines]) and failed to ensure the
Project's consistency with the City's General Plan.

4 5. Through this lawsuit, the District seeks to enforce the provisions of CEQA as they

5 apply to this Project and to ensure the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. The

6 maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by

7 protecting the public from the unmitigated and unanalyzed harms alleged in this Petition and

8 Complaint.

THE PARTIES 9

10 6. Petitioner and plaintiff Stanislaus Consolidated Fire Protection District is, and at

11 all relevant times was, a special district organized and existing under the laws of the State of

13 fire protection and fire safety services as authorized under the general laws of the State.

a 14 7. Respondent and defendant City of Riverbank is, and at all relevant times was,

15 municipal corporation and general law city, organized and existing under the laws of the State of

16 California, located within the County of Stanislaus, California. The City of Riverbank is, and at

17 all times mentioned herein was, the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. (State CEQA

18 Guidelines, § 15051.)

19 8. The District is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and

20 Defendants DOES through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues those Respondents and Defendants

21 under fictitious names. The District will amend its Petition and Complaint to show their true

22 names and capacities when the Respondents and Defendants have been identified and their

23 capacities ascertained. Each of the Respondents and Defendants is the agent, employee, or both

24 of every other Respondent and Defendant, and each performed acts on which this action is based

27 is legally responsible in some manner for the events and happenings referred to herein.

JURISDICTION

2 16. This Court has jurisdiction to review the City's findings, approvals, and actions; to

3 issue a writ of mandate; and to grant declaratory and/or injunctive relief, as well as all other relief

4 sought herein, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 1085 and 1094.5; Public

5 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5; and Government Code section 65000, et seq.
n a VENUE

17. The Superior Court of the County of Stanislaus is the proper venue for this action.

8 The Project and the property it concerns are located within the County of Stanislaus. The Subject

9 Property is bounded on the east by Oakdale Road, on the south by Claribel Road, on the north by
10 the Modesto Irrigation District Main Canal and the City of Riverbank city limits, and on the west
11 by those property lines approximately one-half mile west of Oakland Road. The approval of the
AW OFFICES OF 06S ELLINS 'IE3ULS NIVW N LOOZ d11 8HO3IXN 8 IS38 1S38 969V6 VINJOJITVO X33X0 LONTVM 12 Project without proper compliance with CEQA and without consistency with the City's General
13 Plan will expose the City's residents (and the people the District is charged to serve) to
14 heightened risk of fire-related injury and serious adverse environmental impacts.
15 STANDING

16 18. The District and those whom the District serves will be directly and adversely
17 affected by the City's actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project. The District has no
18 plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in that the District and those
19 whom the District serves will suffer irreparable harm if the Project is implemented.

20 19. The District provides fire protection services to the people and area surrounding
21 the Subject Property, and the District would be responsible for providing fire protection services

22 to the Project's future residents and businesses. The Project, however, will adversely impact the

23 District's fire protection operations absent adequate mitigation. Accordingly, the District has a
24 beneficial interest in any action that challenges the City's decision to approve the Project without
25 (i) fully disclosing the Project's significant impacts on the environment, (ii) imposing all feasible
26 mitigation measures to avoid such impacts, and (iii) ensuring the Project's consistency with the

27 City's General Plan.

38075.00001\31979469.3 - 4-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 20. The District objected to the City's approval of the Project during and after the

2 public comment periods provided by CEQA, and the District repeatedly requested that the City

3 comply with CEQA. The District and/or other agencies, organizations and individuals raised or

4 affirmed each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint orally or in writing
5 prior to the City's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR.

6 21. The District and the people it serves will be directly and substantially affected by

7 the adverse environmental impacts of the City's actions, including impacts resulting from the

8 Project's inconsistency with the General Plan's policies relating to fire protection services. The

9 District seeks to promote and enforce the informational purposes of CEQA in this action, which

10 purposes are defeated by the City's attempt to approve the Project without sufficient or accurate
information. Ascertaining the true facts about the environmental impacts of projects and
LAW OFFICES OF 96916 VINHOJITVO XEESO IONTVM 06E ELINS 'IEEALS NIW N HOOZ BEST BEST & KRIEGER LLP 11

12 disclosing those true facts to decision-makers and the public are purposes that are within the zone
13 of interests CEQA was intended to protect.

14 22. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA and all other
15 applicable laws when certifying the EIR and approving the Project; the City further has an
16 obligation to ensure that the Project is consistent with the City's General Plan. The issues in this

17 action are issues of public right and the object of the action is to enforce public duties in the

18 public interest.

19 23. The District has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and, unless a
20 temporary restraining order and injunction is issued, the City will be allowed to proceed with the

21 Project without complying with CEQA and without ensuring the Project's consistency with the

22 City's General Plan.

23 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

24 24. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Public Resources Code

25 section 21177 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The District has exhausted

26 all available administrative remedies by objecting to the City's approval of the Project during and
27 after the public comment periods provided by CEQA, requesting that the City comply with
28 CEQA, and requesting that the City ensure the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. 38075.00001131979469.3 5.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

The District and/or other agencies, organizations, or individuals raised or affirmed each of the

2 legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint orally or in writing prior to the City's

3 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

4 25. The District has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior

5 provision of notice to the City indicating its intent to commence this action. The notice and proof

6 of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS 7

8 26. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action

9 under the Code of Civil Procedure, the Public Resources Code, and all other applicable statutes.

10 Notably, the District, the City, Western Pacific Holdings, Inc., Harrigfeld Family, Machado

12 L.P. (collectively, the "Parties") entered into an agreement to toll all applicable statutes of

13 limitations (the "Tolling Agreement") as of April 12, 2019eighteen (18) days after the City

14 filed its Notice of Determination on March 25, 2019. The Parties subsequently executed four

15 separate amendments to the Tolling Agreement, with each amendment lengthening the tolling

16 period.

17 27. The Parties' Fourth Amendment to the Tolling Agreement extended the tolling

18 period until July 16, 2019. Attached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the Parties' Fourth

19 Amendment to the Tolling Agreement. Since the tolling period began eighteen days after the

20 City filed its Notice of Determination, the District had an additional twelve days after termination

21 of the tolling period (i.e., until July 28, 2019) to challenge the District's certification of the EIR

22 under Public Resources Code section 21167. This lawsuit has thus been commenced within the

23 time limits imposed for this action under all applicable statutes.

THE PROJECT 24

25 28. The District seeks issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the City to vacate and set

26 aside its approvals relating to the Project. As discussed above, the Project contemplates, among

27 other things, development of the Subject Property with at least 2,452 residential units and 577,000

28 square feet of mixed uses. On or about March 19, 2019, the City issued a variety of approvals for 6 - 38075.00001\31979469.3

17 the District filed Notices of Determination relating to the Approvals and the Project on or about
18 March 25, 2019.

19 30. The City approved the Project and issued the Approvals despite the District's

20 repeated comment letters regarding the Project. Before the City's approval, the District provided

21 the City with comment letters dated July 30, 2018, February 15, 2019, and March 19, 2019

22 (collectively, "Comment Letters"). The District is informed and believes, and on that basis

23 alleges, that other comment letters were also received by the City that identified deficiencies in

24 the EIR for the Project.

25 31. The District's Comment Letters objected to the Project, outlined the inadequacies

26 of the City's Draft and Final EIRs for the Project, and explained that the Project is inconsistent

27 with the City's General Plan.

38075.00001\31979469.3 - 7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

32. For example, the District noted that, under CEQA, a project is presumed to have a

2 significant environmental impact where it would "[c]onflict with any applicable land use plan,

3 policy, or regulation of an agency ... (including .. the general plan ...) adopted for the purpose

4 of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect." (See State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G,

5 Section X [Land Use and Planning].) The District explained, however, that the City failed to

6 reference any of the City's General Plan policies concerning fire hazards- e.g., City General Plan

7 Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5-in the EIR's discussion of whether this threshold of

8 significance is met. Notably, in its February 15, 2019 letter, the District wrote:

9 The Fire District thus again requests that the City comply with its

10 statutory obligation under CEQA to analyze and discuss the

11 Project's consistency with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1,

8 12 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Absent such analysis, the EIR is fatally MV1 OFFICES 068 ELLINS 'I33ULS NIVW N LOOZ 969P6 VINHOJITVO ME3HO IONTVM d11 8E03I8N 8 1S38 1S38 13 defective as a matter of law.

14 33. Despite the District's repeated requests, the City dismissed the District's concerns
15 and objections.-Rather than comply with the law, the City forged ahead with the Project.

17 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085 and 1094.5 -

18 Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest for Violation of CEQA)

19 34. The District incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 33, above, as though

20 set forth in full herein.

21 35. The District is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City

22 violated CEQA in numerous ways. The City's failure to comply with CEQA includes, but is not

23 limited to, the following:

24 36. Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Consistency with the General

25 Plan: Under CEQA, the City must prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR before

26 approving any discretionary project, such as the Project here, that may have a significant adverse

27 environmental effect. The EIR must fully disclose and analyze the Project's significant adverse

28 effects.

P 37. Among other impacts, the EIR must disclose and analyze whether the Project

2 would "[c]onflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency ..

3 (including ….. the general plan ..) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an

4 environmental effect." (See State CEQA Guidelines, Appendix, G, Section X [Land Use and

5 Planning].) Here, the EIR failed to disclose or analyze whether the Project would conflict with

6 the City's General Plan policies concerning fire hazards-e.g., City General Plan Policies
PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Those General Plan Policies are collectively entitled "Fire

8 Protection Services, Staffing, and Deployment Adequate to Serve the Needs of Existing and

9 Planned Development" and provide as follows:

10 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.1: The City will ensure that adequate fire flow pressure is

14 mains; as specified in the City's Water Master Plan.

15 General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.2: For new development, the City will require a minimum
16 fire flow pressure of 1,500 GPM (sustainable for at least two hours) for residential use.

17 For new development, the City will require a minimum fire flow pressure of

18 approximately 3,600 GPM (sustainable for longer periods) for larger residences and for

19 other building types, depending on the particular use and structure characteristics, and in

20 coordination with the fire service provider.

General Plan Policy PUBLIC 7.5: The City will coordinate with fire protection providers
to an emergency response system capable of achieving the following standards in 95% of

5 all cases: first fire emergency response unit within six minutes of dispatch; full alarm

6 assignment within 10 minutes of dispatch; second alarm assignment within 15 minutes of
N dispatch; and an Insurance Service Office (ISO) rating of Class 2 for areas within the City.

8 38. The EIR fails to properly disclose and analyze whether the Project would conflict

9 with any of these general plan policies--a violation of CEQA. (See State CEQA Guidelines,

10 Appendix G, Section X [Land Use and Planning].)

11 39.

30 S3O1:O MVT 96916 VINZO!ITVO X33HO LANTVM 06€ EILINS 'E3HI NIVW 'N LOOZ Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Temporary Impacts: Under d11 8303I8M 8 1S38 1S38 12 CEQA, an EIR must analyze not only permanent impacts, but also temporary impacts resulting
13 from the Project (e.g., the Project's impacts during construction of the Project or impacts that
14 would occurvbefore mitigation takes place.) Here, the City vaguely contemplated that a future fire
15 station would be required as a result of the Project, but the City failed to analyze whether the
16 Project would result in any temporary inconsistency with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC

17 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 while the Project is being implemented, but before the future fire station

18 vaguely contemplated in the EIR is fully operational.

19 40. In its February 15, 2019 letter, the District explained that the EIR is fatally flawed

20 because it fails to analyze the Project's temporary inconsistencies with City General Plan Policies

21 PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Despite the District's comments, the City refused to analyze

22 these temporary impacts of the Project.

23 41. Failure to Mitigate the Project's Impacts: Under CEQA, the City is required to

24 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to the Project, to adopt all feasible mitigation

25 measures and/or alternatives, and to determine that proposed mitigation measures will or will not

26 be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the Project's significant environmental impacts.

27 42. In its February 15, 2019 letter, the District informed the City that "the EIR must

28 require all feasible mitigation necessary to ensure the Project's consistency with City General . 10 - 38075.00001\31979469.3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 both before and after the future fire station's

2 construction." Nevertheless, the City approved a Project inconsistent with the City's General

3 it Plan, and it did nothing to mitigate the Project's inconsistency with City General Plan Policies

4 PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5.

5 43. In short, the City has statutory obligations under CEQA to analyze whether the

6 Project is consistent with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5, and if is

7 not consistent, to adopt mitigation measures to ensure consistency. The City approved the Project
8 and issued the Approvals without satisfying either of these obligations under CEQA. Moreover,

9 to the extent the City found the Project consistent with the aforementioned General Plan Policies,

10 the City's finding and determination was not supported by substantial evidence as required by
11 CEQA. The District thus requests the Court issue a writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside

13 44. Attorneys' Fees: The District has had to employ attorneys to bring this litigation.
14 Furthermore, the District has incurred and will incur substantial attorneys' fees and litigation
15. costs because of the City's and Respondents' unlawful acts. This litigation, if successful, will
16 result in enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest. Such enforcement will
17 confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons. The District is entitled to be reimbursed

18 for its attorneys' fees and costs because it is functioning as a private attorney general pursuant to

19 Section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The District is also entitled to attorneys' fees and
20 costs pursuant to Section 800 of the Government Code.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 21

22 (Inconsistency with the City's General Plan)
23 45, The District hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1
24 through 44 as though fully set forth herein.

25 46. The Project approved by the City is inconsistent with the City of Riverbank

26 General Plan 2005 - 2025 ("General Plan") in violation of California's Planning and Zoning Law
27 and the City's Code of Ordinances, among other laws. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, § 65000, et seq.;

- 1f 28 City of Riverbank Code of Ordinances, § 150.31 ['The General Plan establishes that land 38075.00001\31979469.3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT RE GENERAL PLAN INCONSISTENCY AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 development shall not be permitted unless adequate capital facilities and/or infrastructure exist or

2 are assured"].) Alternatively, the City approved the Project based on a finding that the Project is

3 consistent with the General Plan, but that finding is not supported by substantial evidence.

4 47. "The propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development

5 depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements." (Families Unafraid

6 to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. El Dorado County Bd. of Sup'rs (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th
7 1332, 1336.) A project's "inconsistency with simply one general plan policy" may thus "be

8 enough to scuttle a project." (Id. at p. 1341; Spring Valley Lake Assn. V. City of Victorville (2016)

9 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 100-101 [project deemed inconsistent with general plan where it conflicted

10 with just one general plan policy].)
WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA 96916 O6E ELLINS 'L33ALS NIVW 'N L00Z 11 48. Here, the Project is inconsistent with City General Plan Policies PUBLIC 7.1, 7.2,
:0 SEOIHO MV1 LS38 1S38 & KRIEGER LLP 12 7.3, 7.4, and 7.5. Notably, the Project would result in inadequate fire protection services, staffing,

13 and deployment adequate to serve the needs of existing and planned development. Consistency
14 with these policies is necessary and essential to the safety of the City's residents.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Declaratory Relief• against all Respondents/Defendants)

17 49. The District hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of Paragraphs 1

18 through 48 as though fully set forth herein.

19 50. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the District and the City.

20 The District contends that the City has not complied with the provisions of CEQA in certifying

21 the EIR and approving the Project. Moreover, the District contends that the Project is

22 inconsistent with the City's General Plan. The District believes that the Project will cause

23 irreparable injury for which the District has no adequate remedy at law and will have significant

24 adverse effects on the environment.

25 51. The District is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the City

26 disputes the contentions of the District as described in the immediately preceding paragraph.

38075.00001\31979469.3 - 12 -

P 52. The District seeks a judicial declaration and determination that the City must abide

2 by its duties and obligations under CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and the City's own

3 ordinances and regulations.

4 53. A judicial declaration and determination is necessary and appropriate at this time

5 in order that the District may ascertain its rights with respect to the duties and obligations of the

6 City and in order to resolve all controversies between the parties hereto regarding such rights and

7 duties.
