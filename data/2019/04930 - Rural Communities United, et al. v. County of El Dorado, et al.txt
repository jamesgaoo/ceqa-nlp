28 Resources Code section 21168 or 21168.5.

29 General Allegations
30 10. The County adopted its 2004 General Plan along with a program EIR (2004 PEIR). The PEIR

determined that the proposed General Plan buildout by 2025 would have "significant and unavoidable"
2 impacts on a host of biological resources, including oak woodland habitat and dependent wildlife.
3 11. The PEIR does not analyze the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions due to predicted development.

4 12. To avoid or substantially lessen the impacts of development on oak woodland habitat, the General
5 Plan adopted a series of policies. Policy 7.4.1.6 requires projects to "fully mitigate the effects of important
6 habitat loss and fragmentation." Policy 7.4.4.4, Option B (Option B) allows a project applicant to eliminate
7 oak woodlands entirely on a parcel in exchange for payment into a "mitigation fund" adequate to "fully]
8 compensate for the impact to oak woodland habitat," which the PEIR describes as "existing woodlands of

9 equal or greater biological value as those a lost." Option B requires a 2:1 replacement ratio necessary to
10 compensate for fragmentation as well as habitat loss. Option B states the "[i]mpacts on woodland habitat
11 and mitigation requirements shall be addressed in a Biological Resources Study and Integrated Natural
12 Resources Management Plan [INRMP] as described in Policy 7.4.2.8." Policy 7.4.2.8 required, within five
13 years of General Plan adoption, the development of the INRMP, which must identify "Important" wildlife
14 habitat and establish a program for effective habitat preservation and management. The INRMP shall also
15 include a "Habitat Protection Strategy" for protecting important habitat based on coordinated land
16 acquisitions and management of acquired land. The goal of the strategy shall be to conserve and restore
17 contiguous blocks of important habitat to offset the effects of increased habitat loss and fragmentation
18 elsewhere in the County. To implement this approach, General Plan Implementation Measure CO-P
19 required the County to adopt the INRMP by 2009.
20 13. To specifically address impacts to oak woodland habitat, General Plan Implementation Measure
21 CO-P required the County to adopt by 2006 an Oak Resources Management Plan that will address mitigation
22 standards outlined in Policy 7.4.4.4, thresholds of significance for the loss of oak woodlands and replanting
23 and replacement standards, among other things. This plan is a future mitigation program to "fully
24 compensate" for loss of important oak woodland habitat with lands of "equal biological value as those lost.'
25 14. The 2004 General Plan was legally challenged, resulting in a settlement in which the County agreed
26 that the clearing of oak woodlands pursuant to Option B would not be permitted until the County had
27 adopted the "oak woodland portion of the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan described in
28 General Plan Policy 7.4.2.8."
29 15. In 2008, the County approved an Oak Woodland Management Plan (2008 OWMP), which purported
30 to meet the requirements of Implementation Measure CO-P and the terms of the settlement so as to allow

development to clear oak woodlands in accordance with Option B.
2 16. The 2008 OWMP was legally challenged based on the County's failure to comply with CEQA. In
Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1156, the Court of
4 Appeal overturned the County's approval of the 2008 OWMP, finding that the County had erred in not
preparing a second tier EIR to examine how mitigation standards and policies contained in the plan could

6 avoid or substantially lessen the significant impacts to oak woodland habitat identified in the PEIR.
7 17. Following adoption of the OWMP, the County continued work on the INRMP, which was divided
8 into two phases. Phase 1 focused l on fact-finding, organizing, and analyzing the scientific and regulatory|

9 facts related to oak woodland habitat preservation. Phase 2 was to entail the development of a draft INRMP
10 with recommendations on the required environmental review pursuant to CEQA.
11 18. The County completed Phase 1 of the INRMP in 2011, which included the compilation of baseline
12 conditions. However, the County subsequently decided not to proceed with Phase 2 and to drop the INRMP
13 requirement altogether due to their limiting effect on development in the County. Instead, in 2012, the
14 County Board decided to amend the General Plan, including Policy 7.4.1.6, Option B of Policy 7.4.4.4, and
15 Policy 7.4.2.8.
16 19. In 2014, the County Board approved the preparation of a new OWMP specifically related to Option|
17 B, which would be considered as part of the General Plan amendments and would be adopted in place of
18 establishing and implementing the INRMP.
19 20. In 2015, the County approved amendments to General Plan policies and land use designations and
20 an update of the Zoning Ordinance (TGPA-ZOU). The County also prepared and certified a program EIR

21 for the TGPA-ZOU (2015 TGPA-ZOU Program EIR). The County chose not to include the proposed
22 General Plan policy amendments related to oak woodlands or the ongoing new OWMP as part of approving
23 the TGPA/ZOU.

24 21. In 2016, the County proposed a Biological Resource Policy Update, Oak Resources Management
25 Plan (ORMP) and Oak Resources Conservation Ordinance (together, the Project) and issued a draft program
26 EIR (ORMP DEIR) for public review and comment. In February of 2017, the County issued the final
27 program EIR (ORMP FEIR) for the proposed Project.
28 22. On October 24, 2017, the County approved the Project and certified the ORMP EIR. The Project
29 substantially amends the General Plan policies formerly adopted as part of the 2004 General Plan to protect
30 oak woodlands. The Project eliminates Policy 7.4.1.6, Option B of Policy 7.4.4.4, and amends Policy 7.4.2.8

to eliminate the requirement that the County prepare the INRMP. For oak woodlands, the ORMP now
2 establishes the mitigation required to develop parcels containing oak woodland habitat.
3 23. As a program-level EIR, the ORMP EIR is intended to analyze the first-tier effects of the new
4 General Plan polices and ORMP. The ORMP EIR assesses the environmental impacts of the TGPA-ZOU
buildout scenarios for the years 2025 and 2035 that were evaluated in the 2015 Program EIR but as modified
6 by the Project. The ORMP EIR analyzes the impacts of development that can be expected to occur as a
7 result of allowing developers to clear oak woodlands under the TGPA-ZOU and ORMP development

8 standards in buildout scenarios for the years 2025 and 2035. While it references prior analyses contained

9 in the 2004 PEIR and the 2015 TGPA-ZOU Program EIR, the ORMP EIR is not tiered to any prior program
10 EIR.
11 24. The ORMP EIR finds that the Project's impacts to oak woodlands and associated wildlife due to
12 habitat loss and fragmentation are significant and unavoidable.
13 25. The ORMP EIR finds that the Project's greenhouse gas emissions from loss of sequestration caused
14 by clearing oak woodlands will be significant and unavoidable, but that there is no significant impact from
15 any inconsistency between the Project and existing greenhouse gas plans.

16 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

17 26. Plaintiffs exhausted all available administrative remedies in that Respondent County's approval of
18 the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.
19 27. In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Plaintiffs objected to the
20 approval of the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to the close of the
21 public hearing on the Project before the filing of any related notices of determination.
22 28. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (a), all alleged grounds for
23 non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to Respondent County during the public
24 comment period for, or prior to the close of the public hearing on, the Project.
25 29. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (c), individual petitioners
26 Ellen Van Dyke and Cheryl Langley have formed a group, Conserve El Dorado Oaks, after the project
27 approval in order to establish organizational standing for a group entity that could represent their interests.
28 30. In the alternative, there was no opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of
29 noncompliance alleged in this Complaint and Petition prior to Respondent County's adoption of the Project.
