SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1

1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Mission Peak Conservancy and Kelly Abreau ("Petitioners")

2 allege through this Verified Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for

3 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition") as follows:

4 I. INTRODUCTION

5 Respondent and RPI's Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

1. This action challenges the legality of Respondent County of Alameda, by and

7 through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning

8 Department, Public Works Agency, Fire Department, and Board of Supervisors ("the County"),

9 and Real Parties in Interest Christopher and Teresa George ("RPI"), to proceed with the

10 transformation of agricultural land into a resort like event and recreation center without any

11 environmental review in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act under California

12 Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., and title 14 of California Code of Regulations §§ 15000

13 et seq. ("CEQA"), on properties commonly known as 3505 and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road,

14 located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont, California, in an area not

15 visible to the public ("the Properties"), including, but not limited to, the following:

16 The construction of a 12,000 square foot event center, also known as the
17 "agricultural barn", "barn". or "mini-Versailles";

18 The creation of a six million gallon lake stocked with unknown species of fish;

19 The creation of a dam and the alteration of a watercourse to create the lake;

20 The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;

21 The construction of a 6800 square foot "workshop";

22 The construction of a 2000 square foot greenhouse;

23 The construction of a large gazebo;

24 The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;

25 The excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars;

26 The installation of a winery or brewery;

27

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2

1 The construction of a courtyard connected to the 12,000 square foot "barn"

2 containing an gas fire pit for entertainment, cooking area kitchen, lighting, seatingl

3 and retaining walls ("the courtyard");

4 The construction of a waterfall or watercourse feature;

5 The installation of a 500 foot gas line into the courtyard kitchen;

6 The installation of a 2400 foot water line from a well to the "barn" storage tank;

7 and

8 The construction and grading of an elevated and landscaped road thousands of

9 feet long with an impermeable surface and an approximate 10%-20% grade.

10 (collectively, defined as "the Project").

11 2. The definition of the Project has changed over time, and may continue to change,
12 as Petitioners have continued to obtain more information about the Project up to recent weeks.

13 With each new public disclosure, including, but not limited to, applications for a permit received |

14 and/or approved by the County, the Project has become more stable, finite and capable of being
15 described with accuracy.

16 3. The Project is located in an agricultural and riparian area. It is very large in

17 scope, and will have a significant effect on the environment, yet the County failed to conduct any

18 environmental review of the Project as a whole, including, but not limited to, a preliminary

19 review of the Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project as a whole a

20 qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project as a whole

21 (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an environmental impact report or a negative

22 declaration of the Project as a whole. The County has not issued any approvals, permits, or made

23 any findings with respect to the Project as a whole.

24 4. Instead, the County RPI are improperly piecemealing or segmenting the Project

25 into many sub-projects, and have obtained County approvals (building permits) for the 12,000

26 square foot event center, the courtyard, the installation of a 500 foot gas line, and the installation

27 of a 2400 foot water line. RPI, on or about November 15, 2018, applied for County "corrective"

28 building permits to legalize the gazebo, the new road, the greenhouse, and the 6800 square foot

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3

1 "workshop, all of which have already been constructed, or are under construction, and are known

2 to Respondent. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the foregoing are

3 currently awaiting County approval as of the date of the filing of this Second Amended Petition.

4 5. Piecemealing applies to a project when a future action: "(1) is a reasonably

5 foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be

6 significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its

7 environmental effects." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of University of

8 California (1987) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.) Related activities constitute a single project where "the

9 second activity is reasonably foreseeable consequence of the first activity; the second activity is

10 a future expansion of the first activity; or both activities are integral parts of the same project."

11 (Sierra Club y West Side Irrigation Dist. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 690, 698 (citations omitted).)

12 6. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI

13 will continue to engage in further piecemealing, as RPI are currently seeking, or will seek in the

14 imminent future, separate approvals (building permits) for the remaining sub-projects already

15 built without any permits, including, but not limited to, the six million gallon lake, dam and

16 watercourse alteration, the white sand beach alongside the lake, the mobile/manufactured home,

17 the excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars, and the

18 installation of a winery or brewery. The County, pursuant to conditions described on permit

19 BLD2017-02969, dated November 21, 2017 for the courtyard, explicitly required RPI to "submit

20 permits for all structures on site that were built without permits", "prior to permit final". A true

21 and correct copy of this permit is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is hereby

22 incorporated by reference.

23 7. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI

24 have, and currently are, improperly piecemealing the Project, and have obtained, and/or are

25 seeking, separate County approvals for each separate sub-project of the Project in an effort to

26 avoid CEQA review. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County
27 mischaracterized each of the separate building permit approvals as ministerial in order to exempt

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4

1 them from CEQA review. The County should have analyzed the Project as a whole, not

2 separately, which analysis would have required discretionary approvals and CEQA review.

3 8. The County already knew, as early as July 14, 2014, when RPI first sought

4 County approval for the 12,000 square foot event center or "barn", that the "barn" was a portion

5 of a much bigger project which required CEQA review. A true and correct copy of the County

6 email correspondence providing this information and dated July 14, 2014, is attached to this

7 Petition as Exhibit B, and is hereby incorporated by reference.

8 9. Despite knowing of the County's July 14, 2014 warning not to issue any permits

9 without CEQA review (see Exhibit B), and despite the County's October 2017 site visit to the

10 Properties when it saw first-hand the scope of the Project, the County issued the following

11 approvals and permits without any CEQA review between 2014 and the present:
12 a. BLD2014-02024 of August 29, 2014 - construction of eight foot high retaining

13 walls and site drainage system "per approved plans" for the 12,000 square foot event

14 center or "ag barn";

15 b. BLD2014-02739 of February 6, 2015 - foundation permit for the 12,000 square

16 foot event center or "barn";

17 c. BLD2014-01654 of November 5, 2015 - construction of the 12,000 square foot

18 event center or "barn" (renewed by BLD2017-03666 on November 8, 2017)

19 d. BLD2017-02969 of November 21, 2017 - construction for the courtyard

20 connected to the event center (renewed on January 4, 2019)

21 e. BLD2018-01508 of May 8, 2018 - gas line installation to the courtyard

22 f. BLD2018-01949 of June 15, 2018 - waterline installation from well to "barn"

23 storage tank

24 g. BLD2018-03182 of September 27, 2018 - supplemental permit to BLD2018-

25 01949 for additional 2,400 feet of waterline from well to "barn" storage tank.

26 On or about November 15, 2018, the County and RPI applied for and/or opened the

27 following new permits for the Properties:

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5

1 h. BLD2018-03850 - legalize pre-fab 6,000 square foot metal shop building, and

2 323 square foot gazebo;

3 i. BLD2018-03851 - agricultural exemption for the 2,880 square foot greenhouse,

4 which has been "routed for departmental approvals"; and

5 j. SAM2014-00001 - extension of private driveway to future on-site building

6 (access road or driveway). (d through j, collectively defined as, "the Permitted

7 Project", being all approvals and permits issued by the County on or after November

8 21, 2017)

9 10. The County has not, however, issued any approvals, permits, or made any

10 findings with respect to the Permitted Project as a whole. a

11 11. The definition of the Permitted Project has changed over time, and may continue

12 to change with each new public disclosure, including, but not limited to, applications for a permit

13 received and/or approved by the County. The definition of the Permitted Project will likely grow

14 to include the sub-projects for which RPI must obtain the "corrective permits", but for which RPI

15 have not yet applied, such as the lake, dam, watercourse alteration, beach, and parking lot.

16 12. Although the County has mischaracterized the building permits issued for the

17 Permitted Project as ministerial, the level of discretion actually exercised and authorized by the

18 County in determining the approvals and any conditions attached thereto meet the definition of

19 discretionary approvals under CEQA.

20 13. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a

21 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion

22 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,

23 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

24 14. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the

25 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals

26 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful. The

27 County also abused its discretion when it failed to conduct any review or reporting in compliance

28 with the provisions set forth under CEQA with respect to the Project as a whole, and/or the

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

1 Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early as July it 2014 that CEQA was required, and

2 that discretionary approvals were going to be required.

3 15. The County did not hold any public hearings, or post any public notices,

4 regarding CEQA and the Project, or CEQA and the Permitted Project, including but not limited

5 to, notice(s) of exemption(s) from CEQA.

6 16. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any

7 actions, uses, or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance

8 with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve

9 actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, or, in the

10 alternative, mandating Respondent only approve further actions or permits on the Properties that

11 consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA,
12 including, but not limited to, conducting: preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted
13 a Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted

14 Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the

15 Project and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an

16 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

17 as a whole.

18 17. Petitioners also seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,

19 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made

20 by the County regarding the construction of any part of the Project, and/or the Permitted Project,
21 including the rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any decisions

22 regarding exemption from CEQA.

23 Respondent and RPI's Violations of Alameda County Zoning Ordinances and County Plan

24 18. Petitioners also challenge the County's failure to perform certain mandatory

25 duties, and its abuse of its discretionary duties, found in the zoning regulations applicable to the

26 Properties, including, but not limited to, Title 17 of the Alameda County Municipal Code

27 ("ACMC") regarding Zone A - Agricultural, and Measure D, adopted by the voters and made a

28 part of the County Plan.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -

1 19. Zone A does not allow for assembly use event centers or outdoor recreation

2 centers, absent a conditional use permit, variance, a zoning adjustment, or some combination of

3 these. Measure D and the County Plan do not allow for assembly use event centers in "resource

4 management" areas, where the Properties are located, which "designation is intended mainly for

5 land designated for long-term preservation as open space but may include low intensity

6 agriculture, grazing, and very low density residential use." (East County Area Plan, at 47.)

7 20. RPI have repeatedly mischaracterized the event center as a "barn" for agricultural

8 use, in order to avoid the legal requirement they obtain a conditional use permit, zoning variance

9 or adjustment, if such are even allowed in resource management areas, and the transparent public
10 process it would entail. Furthermore, despite its own admissions to the contrary, the County

11 aided and abetted the mischaracterization, claiming the "barn" is "legal land use wise", and

12 approved it as to zoning for agricultural use. Attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated by

13 reference are true and correct copies of County email correspondence dated July 11, 2017 and

14 November 14, 2017 indicating the County's zoning approval of the event center.

15 21. The building plans, fire department records, the building permits themselves,

16 RPI's own admissions in letters to the County, and the County's own admissions among other

17 evidence, all show the "barn" is a not a barn. Instead, it is really an event center for assembly use

18 with an occupancy of 400 persons. The barn has no farm animals or equipment, and it requires

19 panic hardware on the exit doors, a septic system for large gatherings of people, fire sprinklers

20 throughout its 12,000 square feet, a 100 car a parking lot, and a 2,000 square foot courtyard.

21 22. The County knew, as early as July 14, 2014, that the "barn" was not a barn, and

22 continued to receive new information up to the present day confirming it is not a barn, but an

23 event center that is a part of a much larger resort-like outdoor recreation center being built in an

24 agricultural zone without the proper use permits, and with discretionary building permits

25 approved contrary to Zone A regulations. Despite knowing the said zoning violations, and

26 having received RPI's admissions of the zoning violations through building plans and letters to

27 the County, the County continues to fail in its duty to correct them.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8

1 23. The County has mandatory duty to ensure that all permits it issues that affect the

2 use or occupancy of land or buildings contained thereon conform to the applicable zoning

3 regulations. "Every department and every employee of the county authorized to issue permits or

4 licenses affecting the use or occupancy of land or of a building or structure shall comply with the

5 provisions of this title. Where any action of referral or on an appeal is required by this title, no

6 permit or license involved shall be issued unless and until such action has been taken and the

7 time within which any further appeal could have been taken has expired. Any permit or license

8 hereafter issued for a building, structure, use or occupancy contrary to the provisions of this title

9 shall be void and of no effect." (ACMC § 17.58.010 - Permits shall conform.)

10 24. The County building permits for the "barn" and the courtyard do not conform to

11 the zoning regulations of the ACMC, which do not allow event centers or assembly uses in

12 agricultural zones absent a conditional use, zoning variance or adjustment.

13 25. The County issued five building permits for the "barn" and courtyard, which werel

14 all falsely classified as agricultural use, and S-2 and U occupancy, storage and utility,

15 respectively.

16 26. Petitioenrs The building plans RPI submitted to the County for the "barn" and the

17 courtyard classify the actual use differently, however. The plans state that the use of the

18 structures will be for an event center and/or banquet hall, a mixed Occupancy of"A-2"

19 assembly, and "U" utility.

20 27. Mr. George admitted to the County in a letter he wrote to the Fire Department on

21 August 17, 2017 that he will not use the "barn" as a barn. It will not store agricultural equipment,

22 or animals, but it will be used as an event center. A true and correct copy of the August 17, 2017

23 letter to the Fire Department from RPI is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit D and

24 incorporated by reference.

25 28. In fall 2017, the County visited the Properties and came away with the conclusion

26 that "We are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not

27 designed to be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and

28 construction, adjacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc." A true and correct copy of

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9

1 the October 23, 2017 County email correspondence is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit E

2 and incorporated by reference.

3 29. Multiple large events have been held at the "ag barn" since the summer of 2018,

4 and Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County issued an occupancy

5 permit (final signoff of the building permit) for 400 people in summer 2018.

6 30. The reality is that the "barn" and the courtyard were never intended for, and are in

7 fact not being used for agricultural purposes, nor is their occupancy classified as storage/utility

8 as claimed on the building permits. The building permits for the "barn" and the courtyard should

9 read "Use - Event Center/Banquet Hall", and the occupancy should be classified as "A-2" or "A-
10 3"

11 31. The correct occupancy classification, however, would put it directly at odds with
12 the zoning regulations for Zone A, which does not allow an event center or assembly occupancy,

13 absent a conditional use permit, zoning variance or adjustment.
14 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that RPI was aided and
15 abetted by the County to promulgate and permit their false claims of agricultural use. RPI

16 obtained the building permits and zoning approvals ("legal land use wise") from the County,

17 despite overwhelming evidence that the actual use would not conform to the requirements of

18 Zone A agriculture. The joint efforts of the RPI and the County were intended to avoid or evade

19 obtaining the proper use, variance or adjustment permits, and consequently, CEQA review.

20 33. Had the County opened its eyes to the mounting evidence in plain view, it would
21 have recognized that the "barn" and courtyard would not be used for agricultural purposes but

22 were to be used as an event center or assembly facility. In that case, the County would not have

23 issued building permits for the same without the required conditional use, variance or adjustment
24 procedure which includes CEQA. The County admitted on at least two occasions that if the

25 use of the "barn" changes (to a non-agricultural use), then CEQA would be needed to obtain the

26 required conditional use permits. (See, Ex. C and Ex. F, transcript of August 16, 2018 hearing.)

27 34. As it stands now, the building permits, for the "barn" and the courtyard do not

28 conform to the actual use and occupancy. This violates the zoning regulations of Zone A and the

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10

1 County Plan. The County has allowed the violation in the first place, and is allowing it to

2 it continue. Thus, it has failed to perform its mandatory duty to ensure permits shall conform with

3 the zoning regulations of the ACMC. The building permits must be voided as required by

4 AC17.58.010, and shall be of no effect.

5 35. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) mandating Respondent perform its mandatory

6 duty under ACMC § 17.58.010 as described, and only approve any further action, permit, use or

7 occupancy with respect to the Properties that conforms to Respondent's own zoning laws and the

8 County Plan, (b) enjoining Respondent from approving any further action, use, or permits on the

9 Properties that allows for a use, occupancy, a and/or structure that are inconsistent with

10 Respondent's own zoning laws and the County Plan, and (c) mandating Respondent to correct

11 any violations of the zoning laws and the County Plan.

12 36. Furthermore, the County has abused its discretion in the approval and issuance of

13 the building permits for the courtyard and the "barn", as well as its approval as to zoning for the

14 building permits, based on agricultural use and storage/utility occupancy. As described herein,

15 the building permit approvals and the zoning approvals based on agricultural use and

16 storage/utility occupancy were entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

17 37. On the contrary, all evidence pointed to the obvious fact that the use was not

18 agricultural and the occupancy was not storage/utility. Thus, the zoning approval should not

19 have been granted, and none of the building permits should have been issued. The approvals and

20 permits were all based on the faulty zoning approval for agricultural use. ("Whenever zoning

21 approval is found to have been obtained by fraud or to have been issued illegally or in error, it

22 shall be revoked." ACMC 17.54.030 - Zoning approval---Permits revocable. "Any permit or

23 license hereafter issued for a building, structure, use or occupancy contrary to the provisions of

24 this title shall be void and of no effect." ACMC § 17.58.010 - Permits shall conform).

25 38. Petitioners seek a Court Order mandating the County revoke and/or reverse the

26 issuance of the zoning approvals, and the building permits, for the courtyard and the "barn". and

27 any other approvals and permits based on agricultural use and storage/utility occupancy that are

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

not, in fact, being used or occupied as agricultural and storage/utility, as an abuse of discretion

2 lacking any evidentiary support.

3 39. The County did not hold any public hearings or post any public notices with

4 respect to zoning approvals for the "barn" and the courtyard, or with respect to the issuance of

5 any building permits including, but not limited to, the event center and the courtyard.

6 II. PARTIES

26 this reference.

27 51. Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA and its own zoning regulations and

28 County Plan, constitute prejudicial abuses of discretion and/or failures of a mandatory duty. As

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13

1 alleged in this Petition, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law, failed to

2 make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

3 Respondent has also failed in its mandatory duty that all permits issued by the County shall

4 conform to the zoning regulations and the County Plan. Petitioners have no plain, speedy,

5 adequate remedy at law and, along with members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a

6 result of Respondent's violations of CEQA and its own zoning regulations as set forth herein.

7 52. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

8 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

9 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018 to the State Attorney

10 General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the original Petition for Writ of Mandate and

11 Notice of Commencement of Action on the Attorney General, a and a true and correct copy of the

12 Service of this Petition, is attached hereto as Exhibit G, respectively, and incorporated herein by

13 this reference.

14 53. California Public Resources Code § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies

15 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain a CEQA action does not apply to

16 Petitioners in accordance with subsection (e), which states, "This section does not apply to any

17 alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or

18 other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to

19 the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

20 (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued

21 any public notice regarding CEQA review of the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or any

22 portion thereof.

23 IV.. STANDING

24 54. Petitioners have standing as parties beneficially interested in the issuance of the

25 requested writ of mandate because the Project and/or the Permitted Project, as alleged more

26 specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the individuals

27 named herein as well as the general public.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14

1 55. Petitioners have beneficial interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all their legal

2 duties, discretionary and mandatory, as alleged in this Petition. Further, issuance of the relief

3 requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on the general public by requiring

4 Respondent to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable state and local laws.

5 Issuance of the relief requested will also result in the enforcement of important rights affecting

6 the public interest by compelling the County to engage in a fair, objective, and legally adequate

7 analysis of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, and ensure that the public has a meaningful

8 opportunity to review and comment on the impacts of the same.

9 56. The significant adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to,

10 increased traffic and safety issues, habitat and waterway destruction, agricultural land

11 destruction, increased sewage and refuse, and the exploitation of, and harm to, groundwater

12 resources.

13 VI. CEQA REQUIREMENTS

14 57. Respondent is subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

15 that may have significant effect on the environment. The Project and the Permitted Project are

16 a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that they are "an activity which may cause

17 either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

18 change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity that involves the issuance to a person of

19 a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies."

20 (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)

21 58. CEQA requires Respondent to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of

22 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that

23 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

24 significant adverse environmental impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen

25 such impacts.

26 59. CEQA also requires Respondent to evaluate the environmental impacts of "the

27 whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondent

28 must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the Project

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 15

1 and/or the Permitted Project, and cannot separate these larger projects into smaller ones such that|

2 each individually has a lesser environmental impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the

3 impact of these projects as a whole.

4 60. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent, knew as

5 early as July 2014 that the "barn" was one part of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, yet

6 Respondent impermissibly issued separate discretionary approvals for individual sub-projects

7 without any CEQA review.

8 61. Had Respondent analyzed whether CEQA applies to the whole of the Project or

9 the Permitted Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion that

10 replacing a barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard, expanding a

11 cattle pond into a lake stocked with unknown species of fish, with an artificial white-sand beach

12 on the north side, damming the watercourse to create the lake, grading the former rolling

13 pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and erecting a barn with a brewery or a

14 workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would create and has

15 created significant and multiple environmental impacts more than sufficient to trigger CEQA

16 review and a report on the same.

17 62. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent has

18 determined that exemptions apply individually to each portion of the Project and/or the Permitted

19 Project, or that the approvals were all ministerial approvals, versus determining whether any

20 exemption applies to the Project or the Permitted Project as a whole. Exemptions to CEQA,

21 however, do not apply to the Project or to the Permitted Project.
22 63. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County

23 determined the structures and alterations that make up the Project are exempt individually based

24 on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:

25 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of

26 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

27 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose

28 and capacity as the structure replaced."

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor public or private

2 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve

3 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural

purposes."
California Code of Regulations § 15303 - Class 3 "construction and location of

6 limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new

7 equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small

8 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in

9 the exterior of the structure."

10 64. The "barn" and the courtyard, although placed on the same space where the old

11 barn was located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure

12 replaced." (California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

13 65. The lake, the dam, the parking lot, the driveway or access road which extends

14 thousands of feet southeast, a more than one-half mile long water line, and the beach are not

15 "minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do

16 not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes."

17 (California Code of Regulations § 15304.)

18 66. The gazebo, the manufactured home, and the 6800 square foot barn are not

19 "limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations §

20 15303.)

21 67. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.

22 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:

23 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the

24 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
25 significant.

26 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where

27 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect a on the

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17

environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §

2 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

68 - Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

4 apply to the Project, or the Permitted Project, which Petitioners deny, these exceptions to the

5 exemptions preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review and

6 reporting.

7 69. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under

8 CEQA apply to the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or portions thereof, and challenge any and
all of Respondent's findings to the contrary.

10 IV. CEQA STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

11 70. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

12 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15112. Depending on which

13 definition of the CEQA project is considered, as defined in this Petition either as the Project or

14 the Permitted Project, a different analysis is required of the applicable statute of limitations.

15 The Project

16 71. With respect to the Project as defined herein, this Petition has been filed within

17 180 days of the commencement of the Project under Title 14 of the California Code of

18 Regulations section 15112(c)(5)(B), where the County has not made any formal approval of the

19 Project as a whole.

20 72. Although Petitioners have known of the construction of portions of the Project

21 since 2016, and have complained to the County about the same, the commencement of the

22 Project has been within 180 days before the filing of the original Petition, when the Project

23 became more stable, finite, and capable of being described with accuracy, and Petitioners knew
24 the County was committed to allowing the Project, or portions of it, to proceed.

25 73. As described herein, the Properties are located in a very private setting a at the end

26 of a road in the hills near Fremont, California, and are not visible to the public at large. The only
27 manners by which Petitioners have to learn of an accurate, stable and finite project description

28 are through publicly available documents such as the permit applications, approvals and/or

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18

1 building plans that are submitted to the County. With each new permit application and/or permit

2 approval, as Petitioners learn more of the details of the Project, it becomes more stable, finite and

3 capable of being described with accuracy.

4 74. RPI, before November 2017, had received permits for only one structure out of

5 the entire Project - the "ag barn" - even though they had made a dozen or more changes in the

6 years past. At that time, the Project was not stable, finite and capable of being defined with

7 accuracy, just speculation based on aerial photos. The only part of the Project that was capable

8 of being defined with accuracy at that time was the "barn".

9 75. After November 21, 2017 to the present day, however, RPI have applied for or

10 received at least seven building permits related to the Project, and Petitioners are informed and

11 believe and thereon allege that more are forthcoming based on the conditions the County

12 imposed on the November 21, 2017 courtyard permit that all structures built without permits,

13 which was every single one except the courtyard and the "barn", obtain them. Each time the

14 County issues the permits, the Project becomes more stable, finite and capable of being defined

15 with accuracy, and Petitioners gain constructive knowledge of what the County is committing
16 itself to with respect to the Project and its possible environmental effects.

17 76. The definition of the Project has changed over time, and may continue to change

18 as Petitioners have continued to learn more information about the Project up to recent weeks.

19 With each new public disclosure, including, but not limited to, applications for a permit received

20 and/or approved by the County, the Project has become more stable, finite and capable of being

21 described with accuracy, and thus the statute of limitations for the Project may change over time.

22 77. At the very earliest, the Project did not begin to commence until November 21,
23 2017, when the second permit for the courtyard was issued and Petitioners had constructive

24 knowledge of the same, or even later, because more permit applications and/or approvals have

25 been submitted and/or issued since then.

26

27

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19

1 The Permitted Proiect

2 78. This Petition has been filed within 180 days of the commencement of the

3 Permitted Project under Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations section 15112(c)(5)(B),

4 where the County has not made any formal approval of the Permitted Project as a whole.

5 79. The commencement of the Permitted Project as a whole a has been within 180 days
before the filing of the original Petition, when the Permitted Project became more stable, finite,
and capable of being described with accuracy, and Petitioners knew the County was committed

8 to allowing the Project, or portions of it, to proceed.
80. As described herein, the Properties are located in a very private setting at the end

10 of a road in the hills near Fremont, California, and are not visible to the public at large. The only

11 manners by which Petitioners have to learn of an accurate, stable and finite project description

12 are through publicly available documents such as the permit applications, approvals and/or

13 building plans that are submitted to the County. With each new permit application and/or permit

14 approval, as Petitioners learn more of the details of the Project, it becomes more stable, finite and

15 capable of being described with accuracy.

16 81. Beginning on November 21, 2017 to the present day, RPI have applied for or

17 received at least seven building permits related to the Permitted Project, and Petitioners are

18 informed and believe and thereon allege that more are forthcoming based on the conditions the

19 County imposed on the November 21, 2017 courtyard permit that all structures built without

20 permits, which was every single one except the courtyard and the "barn". obtain them. Each

21 time the County issues the permits, the Permitted Project becomes more stable, finite and capable

22 of being defined with accuracy, and Petitioners gain constructive knowledge of what the County

23 is committing itself to with respect to the Permitted Project and its possible environmental

24 effects. The latest permit applications and building plans have been submitted to the County on

25 Or about November 15, 2018, but have not yet been issued.

26 82. As the definition of the Permitted Project has changed over time, and will likely

27 continue to change, so has the statute of limitations. Thus, at the very earliest, the Permitted

28 Project statute of limitations began about two months ago on November 15, 2018, which is six

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20

1 months after the date of the filing of the original Petition, when Petitioners had constructive

2 knowledge of what the County is committing itself to with respect to the Permitted Project, and

3 when the Permitted Project became more stable, finite and capable of being defined with

4 accuracy.

5 83. In the alternative, the statute of limitations for the various sub-parts of the

6 Permitted Project is 180 days from the approval of each sub-project, all of which have occurred

7 within 180 days of the filing of the original Petition.

8 THE ALTERATIONS MADE TO THE PROPERTIES

9 84. The Properties sit upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the hills of
10 Sunol east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay Regional

11 Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and a included a small and seasonal

12 cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small residential

13 home. The road leading up to the Properties, Morrison Canyon a Road, is a narrow and hazardous

14 road. Petitioners have complained to the city and the park district about the dangerous condition

15 of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from George Ranch.

16 85. When RPI began to transform the Properties into the resort-like recreation center,

17 they kept it secret from the County. RPI did not seek or obtain any County approvals or permits

18 at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot, the

19 brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo, the manufactured home, or the other 6,800 square foot

20 workshop. The only approvals the County sought, before the filing of the original Petition, were

21 related to the "barn" and the courtyard.

22 86. Building plans for the "barn" describe a 12,000 square foot multi-story event

23 center with a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and

24 cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic system, restrooms with disability access, an

25 elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable for large gatherings of people, a fire sprinkler

26 system, a groundwater treatment system for the production of beer and wine, two walk-in

27 refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels of wine, class IV heavy-frame timber

28 suitable for an entertainment facility that can accommodate large groups of people.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

1 87. The "ag barn", however, houses no animals, no farm equipment, and is not being

2 used a barn a per RPI. (See, Ex. D.) The 3,000 sq ft barn that the RPI demolished, and replaced

3 with a much larger structure, was more than a half-century old. The old barn had a traditional

4 appearance and typical size.

5 88. The cattle stock pond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

6 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with a masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

7 to the stock pond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam.

8 89. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn," the lake and the main gate of

9 the Properties was graded and excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars,

10 and displaced approximately 1,200 cubic yards of earth. Petitioners are informed and believe

11 and thereon allege, that just recently, in the summer of 2018, RPI began construction of a new

12 road. Petitioners do not know at this time to where the road is going, or why it is being built.

13 90. The 6,800 square foot workshop is not a barn in structure a or use, and Petitioners

14 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,

15 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George

16 announced and advertised that beer labeled "Sunol Ridge" had been produced at Properties as of

17 2013-2015.

18 91. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the courtyard with its

19 fireplace, outdoor kitchen, and 13-foot high retaining walls is connected to the "barn", and was

20 built at or around the same time construction began on the "barn". The lakefront waterfall feature
21 is also listed on the November 21, 2017 permit.

22 92. All in all, RPI are transforming the formerly traditional ranch and farm property

23 into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any CEQA review, and

24 with no zoning review or adjustment.

25 93. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and

26 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016

27 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

1 park located next to (west of) the Properties and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas

2 Rd.

3 94. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,

4 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what

5 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in

6 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which

7 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion ofwhich is owned and

8 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from

9 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp

10 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for

11 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these
12 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,
13 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George v.

14 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

15 95. The George Petition alleged in part:

16 €4 In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

17 (A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along

18 Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and

19 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of

20 the Park to the public in summer 2008.
21 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse
22 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison

23 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,

24 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.

25 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger

26 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the

27 Park to the public in summer 2008.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23

1 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon

2 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to

3 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use

4 Plan.

5 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified

6 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County

7 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.

8 (F) Failing to adopt a monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation

9 measures.

10 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning

11 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to

12 accommodate additional traffic."

13 96. The George Petition also complained that EBRPD had intended to construct a

14 parking lot at the Regional Park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.
15 97. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached

16 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon

17 Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit

18 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of

19 Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

20 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called

21 for more road improvements.

22 98. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to

23 Morrison Canyon Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted

24 to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road

25 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

26 99. RPI also have constructed a parking lot on the Properties which may

27 accommodate up to 100 cars, and this is four times the limit on the number of spaces that Mr.

28 George insisted on for the EBRPD lot.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24

1 100. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege George Ranch has hosted

2 events with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

3 101. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain

4 substandard, as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the

5 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the Project and/or the Permitted

6 Project is not required when George Ranch is essentially a park, resort, event facility, brewery

7 and/or winery that is comparable in area and has as many peak hourly visitors, if not more, than

8 the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for the very same concerns alleged in this

9 Petition. (George Ranch has 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately

10 1200 acres.) In other words, the Regional Park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr.

11 George's own "park" (actually a private resort park and events center) is not.

12 THE COUNTY'S DISCRETIONARY APPROVALS

13 AND THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION

14 102. Although the County has not issued any approvals, discretionary or otherwise,

15 with respect to the Project as a whole or the Permitted Project as a whole, the County did issue
16| discretionary approvals with respect to the subsidiary portions of the same, including but not
17 limited to the "barn" and the courtyard. The County issued permit number BLD2014-02739 for

18 the foundation of the 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-
19 01654 for the construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued

20 permit number BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls. No other

21 applications for permits (other than renewals for these permits) were submitted or other permits

22 issued until November 21, 2017 for the courtyard.

23 103. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic
24 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the
25 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles", or "barn", were fast-tracked and avoided CEQA
26 review and zoning scrutiny in a highly irregular manner. Prior to their issuance, the County

27 Planning Department wrote the following assessment in an email communication dated July 14,

28 2014: "Please do not issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25

1 require CEQA and rezoning." (Ex. B.) Regardless of this directive, Respondent issued the
permits for the "barn" just a few months later, without any CEQA or zoning review.

3 104. In or around 2016, Petitioners began complaining to the County about the Project

4 and/or the Permitted Project. Finally, in or around summer 2017, the County engaged in a code

5 and enforcement action that reinforced, or should have reinforced, what it had known as of

6 2014-that the "barn" is no barn, but an event center that is "part of a much larger project that

7 does require CEQA and rezoning."

8 105. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,
2017 internal email, "it a. came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of

10 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter

11 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It

12 was the best we could do at the time since the "bam" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself

13 was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back and

14 forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an

15 existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."

16 106. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County's decision

17 to exempt the "barn" from CEQA, its zoning approval for the building permit for the "barn" and
18 the approval of the building permit itself, were discretionary actions that required the exercise of
19 personal judgment and deliberation. The discretionary actions would have had the ability to

20 mitigate environmental damage, in that the County admitted it knew the "barn" "was clearly

21 being planned to be something other than a barn" (personal judgment), admitted it "went back

22 and forth on CEQA" (deliberation) and "ultimately determined" (personal judgment and

23 deliberation), that the "barn" was exempt from CEQA. The foregoing extensive deliberations by

24 the Planning Department were undertaken before they could "sign off on it" as to zoning

25 approval, leading to the building permit approval.

26 107. The County did not simply determine whether zoning allowed the "barn" to be

27 built in the requested location, it also exercised personal judgment and deliberation in

28 determining whether or not the "barn" was in a fact a barn, if it was going to be actually used as a

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 26

1 barn, what conditions, if any, should be attached to the County's approval of it, and finally,
whether or not it should be approved. The County used its personal judgment as to the wisdom
and/or manner of carrying out this subsidiary project.

108. Just because the County did not make any effort to mitigate the potential
environmental damage, does not imply or demonstrate that they did not have the authority or

6 discretion to do so. If the County had made the correct determination that the "barn" is not a

7 barn, and was not going to be used as a barn, the approvals as they are would not have issued.
RPI would have had to obtain a conditional use permit prior to construction, a zoning variance

9 and/or adjustment, each of which would require CEQA review as Respondent has admitted.

10 109. Approximately three years after the first permit was issued for the "barn," RPI

11 sought County approval to construct the entertainment courtyard, literally attached to the event

12 center. At the same time, however, on or about August 17, 2017, RPI wrote a letter to the

13 County in which they admitted that the "barn is not to be used as a traditional barn", "no animals

14 nor equipment nor stables [sic] housed in this barn", but RPI intend to use the "barn" "as

15 indicated on the plans submitted to you and the county." (Ex. D.) The plans submitted to the

16 County indicate that the actual intended use for the 12,000 square foot structure is for a banquet

17 hall with assembly occupancy.

18 110. During this time frame, while RPI were actively seeking County approval for the

19 building permit for the entertainment courtyard, the County had also opened a code enforcement

20 investigation, likely because of Petitioners complaints. RPI regularly relied on Shawn Wilson,

21 Chief of Staff to County Supervisor Bob Haggerty, as their point man in communications with

22 the County.

23 111. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Mr. Wilson exercised

24 undue political influence to demand the staff of the County issue the required building permits.

25 Mr. Wilson sent dozens if not hundreds of emails to the County on behalf of RPI as a part of the

26 endeavor to exert influence, and it ultimately worked. The County approved the courtyard, but

27 not before exercising its discretion over the course of several months in determining whether or

28 not to provide it, and under what conditions.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 27

1 112. Mr. Lopez, on July 11, 2017, wrote to Rodrigo Orduna in the Planning

2 Department: "Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show a

3 mini beach has been created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not

4 clear which structures are legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and

5 others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous

6 stock pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we
7 never authorized that work, and CEQA probably wasn't done. So I would start by digging out the

8 old file, see what was approved and what was already existing, and then compare that with what

9 is built today. Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting complaints, try and get

10 access to the site, which is remote." (Ex. C.)

11 113. Four months later, after the site visit to the Properties, Mr. Orduna wrote: "We

12 are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not

13 designed to be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and

14 construction, adjacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See attached pictures taken

15 this past Friday.) This begs the question, if used currently as an accessory entertainment building

16 for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum floor area for the residential buildings

17 and residential accessory buildings applies. I understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be

18 at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor

19 area, the property would likely be over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for

20 residential and residential accessory buildings, per ECA. We are trying to get the other County

21 departments and with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to see about the adjacent

22 property, at 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned

23 by Christopher George, to see about the beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after

24 months being told that it would soon it be, gazebo built without a permits on a deck at the edge of

25 the pond (I can't tell its size)." (Ex. E.)

26 114. An hour and a half later on the same day, the Mr. Lopez wrote to Mr. Wilson:

27 "We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the various activities on the two

28 parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some kind of assembly use,

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 28

1 event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily have to look at

2 everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our

3 normal process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to learn more about

4 his plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local ordinances." (Ex. E.)

5 115. In an email to Petitioner MPC on November 14, 2017, Mr. Lopez writes: "the

6 ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the property

7 and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner". .. "[B]ased

8 on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being looked at as

9 well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to discuss what
10 he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code

11 enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings

12 on the parcel permitted and up to county code." "[N]o discretionary permits have been

13 required so far based on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this
14 remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns
15 related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response."

16 (Ex. C.) The use, however, has changed - from agriculture to event center - and CEQA is -

17 required.

18 116. RPI were irate by November 2017, irked that the County had not provided its

19 approval for the building permit for the courtyard, and let the County know it. The County,

20 however, was concerned that the "barn" and the entertainment courtyard connected to the "barn"

21 were clearly not intended for agricultural use and occupancy. The County advised RPI that in

22 order to receive County approval for the courtyard, RPI would have to bring every existing

23 structure that had built illegally into compliance.

24

25 117. This did not go over well with RPI, so the County offered another alternative, a

26 Deed Use Restriction restricting use to agricultural use. Mr. George initially agreed to the deed

27 restriction, but then changed his mind and backtracked. So, no such deed restriction was signed

28 or recorded.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 29

118. The County, however, once again made the wrong determination that the "barn"

2 is really going to be used as a barn, and concluded the courtyard attached thereto is really going
to be used for agriculture, once again avoiding CEQA review of anything.

4 119. The courtyard permit requires that RPI must bring every other structure built
illegally into compliance, and that amounts to lot. (Ex. A.) RPI will have to submit permit

6 applications for every structure to bring them into compliance, and the County must be enjoined

7 from this continued piecemealing of the Project and/or the Permitted Project to avoid CEQA, and

8 mandated to issue only approvals that consider the whole of the Project and/or the Permitted
Project.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Writ of Mandate - CEQA Violations

12 (Against Respondent)

13 120. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

14 paragraphs 1 through 112 as though fully stated herein.

15 121. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental analysis of

16 the Project as a whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early as July

17 2014 that the "barn" was a part of a much larger project that required CEQA, rezoning and

18 discretionary approvals.

19 122. Respondent also violated CEQA by piecemealing the Project and/or the Permitted

20 Project into separate sub-projects and approving each sub-project individually in order to avoid

21 complying with CEQA, and by exempting the "barn" and/or any other structure from CEQA

22 review, when it knew as early as July 2014 that the "barn" was a part of a much larger project

23 that required CEQA, rezoning, and discretionary approvals.

24 123. Respondent also violated CEQA by approving the discretionary permits for
25 construction of the "barn" and the courtyard, and approving them as to zoning, based on false

26 claims of agricultural use, and contrary to all the evidence. Respondent has admitted that if the
27 uses changes from agriculture, then CEQA will be required. The use has changed, the County

28 knows it, and CEQA is required.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 30

1 124. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a

2 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion

3 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,

4 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

5 125. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the
6 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals

7 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful.

8 126. The County abused its discretion when it failed to conduct any review or

9 reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with respect to the Project as

10 whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early as July 2014 that CEQA

11 was required, and that discretionary approvals were required.

12 127. The County abused its discretion when it determined that exemptions apply

13 individually to a portion of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, or that the approvals were all

14 ministerial approvals, versus determining whether any exemption applies to the Project or the

15 Permitted Project as a whole.

16 128. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any

17 actions, uses, or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance

18 with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve

19 actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, or, in the

20 alternative, mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that

21 consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA,

22 including, but not limited to, conducting preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted

23 Project as whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted

24 Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), § an initial study of the

25 Project and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and § the preparation of either an
26 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

27 as a whole.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 31

1 129. Petitioners also seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,

2 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made

3 by the County regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project,

4 including the rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any approvals

5 regarding exemption from CEQA.

6 130. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

7 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit

8 has been conferred on the general public or large class of persons, and that the necessity and

9 burden of private enforcement is such is as to make an award of fees appropriate.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Writ of Mandate - Zoning Violations

12 (Against Respondent)

13 131. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
14 paragraphs through 92 as though fully stated herein.

15 132. The County a has a mandatory duty to ensure that all permits it issues that affect the

16 use or occupancy of land or buildings contained thereon conform to the applicable zoning

17 regulations. (ACMC § 17.58.010 - Permits shall conform.)

18 133. The County also has a mandatory duty that it shall not issue any permits that do

19 not conform to the County Plan, including Measure D.

20 134. The County issued five building permits for the "barn" and courtyard, which were

21 all falsely classified as agricultural use, and S-2 and U occupancy, storage and utility,

22 respectively. The reality is that the "barn" and the courtyard were never intended for, and are in

23 fact not being used for agricultural purposes, nor is their occupancy classified as storage/utility

24 as claimed on the building permits.

25 135. The building permits for the "barn" and the courtyard should read "Use - Event

26 Center/Banquet Hall", and the occupancy should be classified as "A-2" or "A-3".

27

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 32

136. The zoning regulations of the ACMC or the County Plan do not allow event

2 centers or assembly uses in agricultural zones absent a conditional use, zoning variance or

3 adjustment, if at all.
137. Zone A does not allow for assembly use event centers or outdoor recreation

5 centers, absent a conditional use permit, a variance, a zoning adjustment, or some combination of

6 these. Measure D and the County Plan do not allow for assembly use event centers in "resource
management" areas, where the Properties are located, which "designation is intended mainly for

8 land designated for long-term preservation as open space but may include low intensity
agriculture, grazing, and very low density residential use.* (East County Area Plan, at 47.)
10 138. RPI have repeatedly mischaracterized the event center as a "barn" for agricultural

11 use, in order to avoid the legal requirement they obtain a conditional use permit, zoning variance

12 or adjustment, and the transparent public process it would entail. Furthermore, despite its own

13 admissions to the contrary, the County aided and abetted the mischaracterization, claiming the

14 "barn" is "legal land use wise", and approved it as it to zoning for agricultural use.

15 139. The building plans, fire department records, the building permits themselves,

16 RPI's own admissions in letters to the County, and the County's own admissions among other

17 evidence, all show the "barn" is not a barn. Instead, it is really an event center for assembly use

18 with an occupancy of 400 persons. The barn has no farm animals or equipment, and it requires
19 panic hardware on the exit doors, a septic system for large gatherings of people, fire sprinklers

20 throughout its 12,000 square feet, a 100 car parking lot, and a 2,000 square foot courtyard.
21 140. The County knew, as early as July 14, 2014, that the "barn" was not a barn, and
22 continued to receive new information up to the present day confirming it is not a barn, but an

23 event center that is a part of a much larger resort-like outdoor recreation center being built in an

24 agricultural zone without the proper use permits, and with discretionary building permits

25 approved contrary to Zone A regulations. Despite knowing the said zoning violations, and

26 having received RPI's admissions of the zoning violations through building plans and letters to

27 the County, the County continues to fail in its duty to correct them.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RÉLIEF - 33

1 141. The correct use and occupancy classification, as banquet hall and A-2 or A-3,

2 respectively, would put it directly at odds with the zoning regulations for Zone A and the County

3 Plan, which does not allow an event center or assembly occupancy, absent a conditional use

4 permit, zoning variance or adjustment, if at all.

5 142. As it stands now, the building permits for the "barn" and the courtyard do not
conform to the actual use and occupancy. This violates the zoning regulations of Zone A and the

7 County Plan. The County has allowed the violation in the first place, and is allowing it to is

8 continue. Thus, it has failed to perform its mandatory duty to ensure permits shall conform with

9 the zoning regulations of the ACMC and the County Plan. The building permits must be voided

10 as required by ACMC §17.58.010, and shall be of no effect.

11 143. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) mandating Respondent perform its mandatory

12 duty under ACMC § 17.58.010 as § described, and only approve any further action, permit, use or

13 occupancy with respect to the Properties that conforms to Respondent's own zoning laws and the

14 County Plan, (b) enjoining Respondent from approving any further action, use, or permits on the

15 Properties that allows for a use, occupancy, and/or structure that are inconsistent with

16 Respondent's own zoning laws and the County Plan, and (c) mandating Respondent to correct

17 any violations of the zoning laws and the County Plan.

18 144. Furthermore, the County has abused its discretion in the approval and issuance of

19 the building permits for the courtyard and the "barn", as well as its approval as to zoning for the

20 building permits, based on agricultural use and storage/utility occupancy. As described herein,

21 the building permit approvals and the zoning approvals based on agricultural use and

22 storage/utility occupancy were entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

23 145. On the contrary, all evidence pointed to the obvious fact that the use was not

24 agricultural and the occupancy was not storage/utility. Thus, the zoning approval should not

25 have been granted, and none of the building permits should have been issued. The approvals and

26 permits were all based on the faulty zoning approval for agricultural use. ("Whenever zoning

27 approval is found to have been obtained by fraud or to have been issued illegally or in error, it

28 shall be revoked." ACMC 17.54.030 - Zoning approval--Permits revocable. "Any permit or

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 34

1 license hereafter issued for a building, structure, use or occupancy contrary to the provisions of

2 this title shall be void and of no effect." ACMC § 17.58.010 - Permits shall conform).

3 146. Petitioners seek a Court Order mandating the County revoke and/or reverse the

4 issuance of the zoning approvals, and the building permits, for the courtyard and the "barn", and

5 any other approvals and permits based on agricultural use and storage/utility occupancy that are

6 not, in fact, being used or occupied as agricultural and storage/utility, as an abuse of discretion

7 lacking any evidentiary support.

8 147. In the alternative, or in addition to, the County has a discretionary duty to enforce

9 its zoning regulations, and the failure to exercise that discretion when it is clearly required is an

10 abuse of discretion, and Petitioners seek a Court Order mandating the County to exercise its

11 discretion and enforce the zoning regulations violated by the County and RPI with respect to the

12 Properties as stated herein.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Declaratory Relief

15 (Against Respondent)

16 148. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
17 paragraphs 1 through 146 as though fully stated herein.
18 149. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondent

19 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondent denies, the

20 following:

21 a. That the Project as a whole and/or the Permitted Project as a whole require CEQA

22 review;

23 b. That the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or portions thereof are not exempt

24 from CEQA;

25 C. That the building permits issued by Respondent for the Permitted Project and for
26 portions of the Project do not conform to the County's zoning ordinances and the County Plan;

27 d. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 35

1 150. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of

2 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the Project and/or the

3 Permitted Project.

4 151. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that

5 Petitioners and Respondent may ascertain Respondent's obligations under CEQA with respect to

6 the Project and/or the Permitted Project and Petitioners' rights.

7 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Injunctive Relief

9 (Against Respondent)

10 152. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

11 paragraphs 1 through 150 as though fully stated herein.

12 153. Respondent has unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the Permitted

13 Project and portions of the Project in violation of CEQA, and have failed to conduct CEQA

14 review of the Project or the Permitted Project as whole, when the County knows it is required.

15 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined that

16 portions of the Project or the Permitted Project are exempt from CEQA. Petitioners
17 154. Unauthorized construction and use is ongoing at the Properties. Petitioners are

18 informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large events

19 continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.

20 155. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as

21 weddings, have been and continue to be held at the Properties.

22 156. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the
23 environment already and in the future as a result of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

24 and/or portions thereof, as well as the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless

25 the County and RPI are ordered to halt construction and all approvals pending a judgment by this

26 Court that CEQA review and reporting is required for the entire Project and/or Permitted Project,

27 pending a judgment by this Court that CEQA review and reporting is required.

28

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 36

1 157. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondent and RPI refrain from the

2 conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondent failed and refused the

3 requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue construction, and continue

4 to authorize construction and impermissible uses of the Properties.

5 158. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain

6 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration

7 and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of

8 Morrison Canyon Road. It will be impossible for Petitioners to obtain adequate relief by way of

9 money damages, and therefore, is without an adequate remedy at law.

10 159. Petitioners seek temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and

11 preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining RPI and Respondent, their agents, employees,

12 officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, order or

13 delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction or

14 development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring any large

15 gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the "agricultural barn" or

16 on other portions of the Properties, or taking any other action to implement in any way the
17 Properties and any portion thereof pending judgment of this Court and/or compliance with

18 CEQA.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Public Nuisance

21 (Against Respondent and RPN)

22 160. Respondent, by failing perform is mandatory duties as described herein, and by

23 abusing its discretionary authorities as described herein, has created potentially dangerous

24 conditions on the Properties and to the surrounding area, including, but not limited to, Morrison

25 Canyon Road. RPI, as the proponent of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, has also created

26 the potentially dangerous conditions on the Properties and the surrounding area.

27 161. These dangerous conditions, include, but are not limited to, dangerous traffic and

28 road safety conditions, harm to underground aquifers and streams near the Properties through

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 37

1 excess sewage and waste, harm to the riparian habitat and wildlife at or near the Properties,

2 including the next door East Bay Regional Park, and potential fire hazards in a high risk fire

3 zone.

4 162. These dangerous conditions affect the public at large, especially considering the

5 East Bay Regional Park right next to the Properties, and those who use Morrison Canyon Road.

6 163. These dangerous conditions are those by which an ordinary person would be

7 reasonably annoyed or disturbed, not only because of the danger itself, but because the illegal

8 construction on the Properties has created the dangerous conditions, as well as the corrupt

9 manner in which they were allowed to be constructed.

10 164. The extent of the construction and the seriousness of the dangers, as described in

11 this Petition, outweighs the social utility of Respondent and RPI's illegal conduct and

12 construction, of which social utility there is none.

13 165. Petitioners have not consented to the Respondent's or RPI's conduct.

14 166. Petitioners have suffered harm that was different from the type of harm suffered

15 by the general public; and

16 167. Respondent's and RPI's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Petitioners

17 harm.

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request judgment against Respondent as follows:

19 1. For a writ of mandate (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any actions, uses,

20 or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance with CEQA's

21 prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve actions, use, Or

22 permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as whole, or, in the alternative,

23 mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that consider the

24 Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA, including,

25 but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted Project as

26 a whole, (CCR § 15060), an § evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted Project as a

27 whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project

28 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 38

1 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

2 as a whole.

3 2. For a writ of mandate ordering the County to vacate, set aside, rescind, and void

4 all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made by the County

5 regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project, including the

6 rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any approvals regarding

7 exemption from CEQA.

8 3. For a writ of mandate (a) ordering Respondent perform its mandatory duty under

9 ACMC § 17.58.010 as described, and only approve any further action, permit, use or occupancy

10 with respect to the Properties that conforms to Respondent's own zoning laws and the County

11 Plan, (b) enjoining Respondent from approving any further action, use, or permits on the

12 Properties that allows for a use, occupancy, a and/or structure that are inconsistent with

13 Respondent's own zoning laws and the County Plan, and (c) mandating Respondent to correct

14 any violations of the zoning laws and the County Plan as they pertain to the permits for the

15 "barn" and the courtyard.

16 4. For a writ of mandate ordering the County to revoke and/or reverse the issuance

17 of the zoning approvals, and the building permits, for the courtyard and the "barn", and any other

18 approvals and permits based on agricultural use and storage/utility occupancy that are not, in

19 fact, being used or occupied as agricultural and storage/utility, as an abuse of discretion lacking

20 any evidentiary support.

21 5. A judgment declaring that a fundamental vested right of the Petitioners is

22 adversely affected.

23 6. For a temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

24 permanent injunctions restraining RPI and Respondent, their agents, employees, officers, and

25 representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, order or delivery of
26 construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction, development or use

27 approvals or permits, allowing or sponsoring any large gatherings or assemblies whether for

I'll be in Oakland for a good chunk of the day, so I'1l give you quick summary here. Jana worked on this as one of her last big projects, Chris George was the applicant - it came in as "barn" structure that looked more like mini palace of Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send

code enforcement. It was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The
structure itself was permitted by BID and we signed off on it. We went back and forth on the CEQA
process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an existing barn over
disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA. There was some talk of a possible brewery which is
probably why D1 has been pushing for the ordinance to allow it. As of now, I have not heard of any
reason to believe there is a brewery going on out there, but maybe there is. The interference of D1 was
the subject of a grand jury report from 2015 I believe, so you can go back and read that if you want to.

Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show mini beach has been
created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not clear which structures are
legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and others probably new • for sure the
tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous stock pond, sand import and
waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we never authorized that work, and
CEQA probably wasn't done.

So I would start by digging out the old file, see what was approved and what was already existing, and
then compare that with what is built today. Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting
complaints, try and get access to the site, which is remote. Access from Morrison Canyon is shared by
EBRPD/Vargas Plateau which is one of the reasons Kelly has it out for Mr. George. George sued
EBRPD due to a substandard roadway which closed access to the park
(http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/15/neighbors-force-just-opened-fremont-park-to-close/)for
some time. I think Kelly actually lives in Fremont and uses the park, so he's now looking into Mr.
George's business. I don't know the degree to which D1 would get involved now in a code enforcement
action, but I'm assuming they would get minimally involved, and I'm pretty sure the property is actually in D2 which doesn't have the same history/ties with the owner.

Subject: Re: More Background Historical images of the Vargas Plateau development
Thanks Chris for including us on this email string, I can hopefully provide some more background
information about what is and what is not happening at the site. From its inception, the project has been
proposed to be a non-commercial venue, it is being proposed for personal use and storage and the
building permit that was obtained reflects this use. Based on recent complaints we have visited the site
2 times of the last month or so to look at the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss
the overall use of the property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the
property owner.
The use of the main barn, as mentioned above, is not being proposed for anything other than storage
and personal use, there is no proposal to open a brewery, winery or any other commercial activity at the site. Although the construction is of a quality not usually associated with a barn, this a is a matter of
personal taste and that is not something we regulate.
For various reasons we are also concerned about the use of the property going forward, especially given the condition of the road and other possible limitations of the site. To that end, the property
owner has received a draft document that would limit the use of his property and has in concept agreed
to language that could ultimately result in a recorded deed restriction.
Further based on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code
enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the
parcel permitted and up to county code.
There is also some questions regarding the Williamson Act and whether or not the owner can have
other uses on his property that are not related to agriculture. The uniform rules adopted by the county- do allow other uses that are compatible with Agriculture and given the large size of the parcel it's likely
that the property owner will be okay in terms of what the Williamson Act requires. We are further looking into this issue and will have more information later.
hope this is helpful to dispel some of the rumors about the potential use of the barn being
constructed. This is an ongoing code enforcement case which will take some time to resolve fully, but
I just wanted you to know that we are actively pursuing each and every complaint that we have
received, and aze communicating with the property owner on an almost daily basis.
Also, there is nothing occurring on the property that I believe conflicts with the East County area plan;
references to some of the policies in that plan I don't think are relevant to this discussion. It could be

"

that additional information comes forward that could change that conclusion but at this time I'm fairly
confident in this determination.

Lastly, no discretionary permits have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through
the code enforcement process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting
their response.
I'd be happy to discuss some of this over the phone if needed, I'll be out of the office after today until

: next week, which as you know is short week, so please let me know if you like to speak before then.
Thank you

What I do not understand and perhaps you can help me with this one, but it was not clear what

Or, does this investigation stem from the comments made under public comment at the EBZA a

Subject: RE: Morrison Canyon Ranch

Greetings, Shawn.

We are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. a It is clearly not

designed to be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom

design and construction, adjacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See

attached pictures taken this past Friday.) This begs the question, if used currently as an

accessory entertainment building for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum

floor area for the residential buildings and residential accessory buildings applies. I

understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors

combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor area, the property would likely be

-12- 1 over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for residential and residential

accessory buildings, per ECAP.

[cid:image001.jpg@01D34C19.858362F0]

We are trying to get the other County departments and with the State Department of Fish of

and Wildlife to see about the adjacent property, at 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's

Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned by Christopher George, to see about the

beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after months being told that it would

soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of the pond (I can't tell its

size).

Hi Shawn, I thought I would weigh in but just with CDA staff. There has been one complaining party (he's been very public about his complaint as well, see PC meeting minutes of 10/16.). He has taken it upon himself to see that enforcement is done, to the
extent warranted by our local ordinances/codes. He's keenly aware of the pending
brewery ordinance which was also at the PC for action when he was there (he's been there
at least 3.times). The PC has been receptive to hear him out, and the staff response has
been that at this time we know of no unpermitted use (including a brewery), but that
breweries will become possible very soon pending BOS action.

We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the various activities on the two
parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some kind of assembly use, event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily have to look at
everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our normal process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to learn more about his plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local
ordinances.

Transcript of Proceedings August 16, 2018

1 showing that the county planning department was doing its

2 due diligence in trying to figure out what the right

3 permitting structure was.

4 They made that determination in 2014, when they

5 decided that this was a barn. It qualified as an

6 allowable use. And they issued the building permit for it

7 then. So, again, to the extent that they're challenging

8 that decision, that happened a long time ago.

9 I think there's also evidence

10 THE COURT: So what if the I think the

11 Petitioners are saying it was permitted as a barn, but it

12 was built as something else.

13 That's not a problem for the county?

14 MS. KING: I think the structure was built

15 exactly as it was permitted. I don't think there is any

16 evidence that the structure itself is different.

17 I think what Petitioners are arguing is, they're

18 worried that there's been a change in use, or that the

19 Georges intend to change the use and have it be an event

20 center, instead of a barn.

21 I think you'll also see, there's correspondence

22 where the planning department said

23 THE COURT: If the Georges wanted to use it as an

24 event center

25 MS. KING: they would need to come in

Page 12 LITIVATE REPORTING + TRIAL SERVICES | 877.771.3312 | litivate.com

1 either for a change in zoning or a conditional use permit.

2 And either of those, if they came in for that,

3 would be

t THE COURT: subject to CEQA review.

5 MS. KING: would be subject to CEQA review.

6 Those would be discretionary.

7 THE COURT: Have you heard the county make that

8 concession before?

9 MR. JUSTI: That there was discretionary

10 review

11 THE COURT: No.

12 MS. KING: No, no.

13 THE COURT: If there was a change in use that

14 required a permit, or conditional use permit, or change in

15 zoning that, at that point, CEQA review would be

16 required. They're conceding that.

17 MR. JUSTI: We have not heard that concession.

18 We agree with that.

19 THE COURT: Does that change your position?

20 MR. JUSTI: Well, I think that they are admitting

21 that the change in use has now triggered CEQA review.

22 MS. KING: No.

23 THE COURT: No. They're not admitting that at

24 all.

25 MR. JUSTI: Well, I think that's the implication;

Page 13 LITIVATE REPORTING + TRIAL SERVICES | 877.771.3312 | litivate.com

Transcript of Proceedings August 16, 2018

1 that there was a change I'm sorry. I was consulting

2 with my co-counsel.

3 But just to make sure I understand tracking

4 that the county is acknowledging that if there is a change

5 of use, that it, therefore, triggers CEQA review.

6 THE COURT: Right.

7 MR. JUSTI: Right. And we agree with that

8 position.

9 THE COURT: But have you heard the county say

10 that before?

11 MR. JUSTI: No.

12 THE COURT: So let me ask Mr. Ballesteros and

-d 13 Mr. Cavin, if you agree with. that?

14 And for the record, if you want to go talk to

15 your client, you can do that.

16 MR. BALLESTEROS: No. I don't think we need to

17 talk to the client.

18 We understand I think that's replete in the

19 e-mails and the communications back and forth between our

20 client and the county.

21 If you're really planning a commercial event

22 center out there, then you're going to have to do other

23 things. We're going to make you jump through these hoops.

24 And Mr. George and his wife are well aware of that.

25 But the fact that they have a private wedding on

Transcript of Proceedings August 16, 2018

1 their property, a non-commercial event, that's what the

2 plans say on top of them that the county stamped.

3 It's okay if I have a Quinceanera, a

4 graduation party, whatever, at my house? That doesn't

5 magically transform my house into an event center. And it

6 doesn't magically trigger CEQA review, even though my

7 house was built in 1992, or '89, or whenever the heck it

8 was built.

9 So we understand that if we do something

10 different than what we've applied for, we're going to need

11 to jump through more hoops.

12 But right now, we haven't done anything

; 13 different.

14 MR. JUSTI: Well, the

15 THE COURT: Hurry, because then I want to get

16 back to Ms. King, so I can let her finish.

17 MR. JUSTI: Yes. The focus is wrong.

18 As Counsel suggested, if this were commercial

19 use, it would be different.

20 The use issue is not whether it's commercial or

21 private. It's whether it's a barn, or something other

22 than a barn.

23 If they went and said, "Well, we want to build a

24 house here, where the old barn used to be, but it's for

Please take notice that on May 18, 2018, Petitioners Kelly Abreau and the Mission Peak Conservancy will file a Petition for Writ of Mandate in Alameda County Superior Court challenging actions of the County of Alameda, by and through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning Department, Public Works Agency, and Board of Supervisors ("the County") with respect to the structures and alterations of land and water on properties commonly known as 3505 Morrison Canyon Road, and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road, located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont, California, known as the George Ranch Project.
Petitioners specifically challenge the County's decision(s) not to conduct a review and prepare a report complying with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to the George
Ranch Project and/or any portions thereof, both permitted and non-permitted, including, but not limited to, those that are or were the subject(s) of a code and permit enforcement action in which
the County made the determination(s) that CEQA does not apply, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

02969 on November 21, 2017, Building Permit Number BLD2018-01508, issued on May 8,
