22 INTRODUCTION

23 Plaintiffs and Petitioners allege as follows:
24 1. On April 18, 2019, after providing only two-day's notice of the scheduling of a
25 City Council meeting, the City of Huntington Beach approved and authorized the execution of
26 a purchase and sale agreement for property located at 15311 Pipeline Lane, Huntington Beach,
27 CA (hereafter the "Pipeline Site") for use as a homeless shelter. On or about May 8, 2019, a
28 grant deed was recorded in the Orange County Recorder's Office as Document Number

Palmiori, Tyler, Wiener -1-

2688971.1

I 2019000153866 providing notice of the transfer of the Pipeline Site to the City of Huntington
2 Beach. A true and correct copy of the Grant Deed is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and
3 incorporated herein by this reference.

4 2. The Pipeline Site is subject to a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and
5 Restrictions for Huntington Beach Industrial Park Tract 8694 (hercafter the "CC&Rs"). The
6 CC&Rs were recorded on April 19, 1977 in the Orange County Recorder's Office as Book
7 12153, Page 1394. A true and correct copy of the CC&Rs is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and
8 incorporated herein by this reference.

9 3. Plaintiffs Benzen Properties, LLC, XR Realty, LLC and Saint Enterprises Family
10 Limited Partnership are fee owners of properties that are also subject to the CC&Rs.
11 4. The City purchased the Pipeline Site for a homeless shelter. The homeless
12 shelter violates the CC&Rs. The homeless shelter constitutes a nuisance under the CC&Rs.
13 5. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City of
14 Huntington Beach has commenced to expend funds, including public funds, to convert the
15 existing industrial building at the Pipeline Site into a homeless shelter. Plaintiffs seek a
16 temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction to prohibit the implementation of a
17 homeless shelter at the Pipeline Site.

18 6. Plaintiffs further challenge the action taken by the City Council of the City of
19 Huntington Beach at the April 18, 2019 meeting approving "all five items as presented by
20 staff": "(1) Approve Resolution 2019-22 'A Resolution of the City Council of the City of
21 Huntington Beach Pursuant to SB850.. Declaring an Emergency Shelter Bed Crisis. (2)
22 Declaration of City's intent to proceed with establishing a Homeless Navigation Center. (3)
23 Approval and authorization for the Mayor and the City Clerk to enter into the Purchase and
24 Sale Agreement for 15311 Pipeline Lane (APN 145-537-06), Huntington Beach, CA. (4)
25 Authorize the City Manager to execute any and all documents related to the Agreement to
26 further this action. (5) Approve the appropriation of $2,850,000 in the Fiscal Year 2018/19
27 Revised Budget from the following sources: Redevelopment Dissolution Assignment (100),
28 Community Development Block Grant Funds (215 and 239), and Residual Receipts Fund

(233) as needed" (hereafter collectively referred to as the "City's Homeless Shelter Action").
2 Plaintiff's challenge the City's Homeless Shelter Action on the grounds that the action violates
3 the City of Huntington Beach Municipal Code and the California Environmental Quality Act
4 (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000-21177) ("CEQA").

21

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
23 Breach of Written Contract/CC&Rs

24 (By the CC&R Plaintiffs Against All Defendants)
25 22. The CC&R Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 21 of this
26 Complaint as though set forth in full herein.
27 23. The CC&Rs apply to the property identified in the CC&Rs as "Tract No. 8694 as
28 per map recorded in Book 401, Pages 45 through 48 inclusive, of Miscellaneous Maps in the

Palmiori, Tylor, Wiener -5-
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP
Attornoys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

Office of the County Recorder of Orange County, California." (Ex. 1 [CC&Rs, 11.01, Ex.
2 A].)

3 24. The CC&Rs state, "Declarant, owner of the Property, hereby declares that the
4 Property is now held, and shall hereafter be held, transferred, sold, leased, conveyed and
5 occupied subject to the restrictions herein set forth, each and all of which is and are for, and

6 shall inure to, the benefit of and pass with each and every parcel of the Property and shall
7 apply to and bind the heirs, assignees, and successors in interest of any owner thereof."
8 (Ex. [CC&Rs, 12.01, emphasis added].) The CC&Rs provide that "Every person who now
9 owns or acquires any right, title, or interest in or to any portion of said property is and shall be
10 conclusively deemed to have consented and agreed to every covenant, condition and restriction
11 contained herein, whether or not any reference to this Declaration is contained in the
12 instrument by which such person acquired an interest in said property." (Ex. 1 [CC&Rs,
13 18.01].)

14 25. The Pipeline Site is subject to the CC&Rs. The grant deed transferring the
15 Pipeline Site to the City identifies the real property as "Lot 40 of Tract No. 8694, in the City
16 of Huntington Beach, County of Orange, State of California, as per map recorded in Book 401,
17 Pages 45 through 48 inclusive of Miscellaneous Maps, in the Office of the County Recorder of
18 Said County." (Ex. 2 [Grant Deed, Ex. A, emphasis added].) As the now-owner of the
19 Pipeline Site and as successors in title, the City is bound to the CC&Rs and the Pipeline Site
20 must conform to the CC&Rs.

21 26. The Pipeline Site is limited to industrial operations and uses. (Ex. 1 [CC&Rs,
22 1 6.01, subds. (a), (b)].) The CC&R's provide, "Each site in the Industrial Park shall be used
23 for manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, processing, laboratory, office, professional or
24 research and development activities. No other uses ... will be permitted ..." (Ex.
25 [CC&Rs, 16.01, subd. (b), emphasis added].)
26 27. The City seeks to implement a homeless shelter. A homeless shelter is not an
27 industrial operation. It is an "other use" expressly impermissible by the CC&Rs.
28

Palmieri, Tyler, Wioner -6-
Wilhoim & Waldron LLP
Altornoys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

28. The CC&Rs declare that violation of the CC&Rs is a nuisance, expressly
2 applicable and enforceable by any Owner against a "public" owner: "The result of every action
3 or omission whereby any restriction herein contained is violated in whole or in part is hereby
4 declared to be and to constitute nuisance, and every remedy allowed by law or equity against
an owner, either public or private, may be exercised by Declarant or by any Owner of property
6 subject to these restrictions." (Ex. [CC&Rs, 15.02].) The "other use" expressly
7 impermissible by the CC&Rs is a nuisance. Further, as explained in further detail below, the
8 City Homeless Shelter Action violates CEQA and the City's Municipal Code, among other
9 things, and thus is a nuisance.

10 29. The CC&Rs further provide that "the failure of Declarant or any property owner
11 to enforce any restriction hercin contained shall in no event be deemed to be a waiver of the
12 right to do so thereafter nor of the right to enforce any other restriction." (Ex. 1 [CC&Rs,
13 1 5.05].)

14 30. The CC&Rs impose mutually beneficial restrictions under a general plan of
15 improvement for the benefit of all the Owners. The CC&Rs constitute an affirmative
16 covenant, running with the land and an equitable servitude that is attached to each parcel of
17 land subject to the CC&Rs.

18 31. The CC&Rs are enforceable equitable servitudes under California Civil Code
19 Section 6856, and, as such, shall inure to the benefit of all owners of separate interests subject
20 to the CC&Rs including the CC&R Plaintiffs.

21 32. The CC&R Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction, including a temporary
22 restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting the City from
23 taking any action and expending or directing the expenditure of any further funds to implement
24 the homeless shelter at the Pipeline Site or any use other than industrial operations and uses as
25 required by the CC&Rs. The CC&R Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon
26 allege, that the City intends to continue its conduct in violation of the CC&Rs causing further
27 breaches of the CC&Rs and causing further damage. Such actions of the City, if they continue,

28

Palmieri, Tylor, Wioner -7-
Wilholm & Waldron LLP
Altorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2688971.1

1 will cause serious and permanent damage to the CC&R Plaintiffs, for which there is no
2 adequate monetary remedy.

3 33. The CC&R Plaintiffs were required to hire the services of attorneys, and have
4 thereby incurred attorneys' fees and costs, and will continue to incur such fees and costs in the
5 future by virtue of the pendency of this action, in an amount according to proof.

6 34. The CC&R Plaintiffs are not required to file a claim pursuant to Government
7 Code sections 810, et seq. (the "Tort Claims Act") for the CC&R Plaintiffs' causes of action
8 seeking injunctive relief and declaratory relief because such causes of action against the City in
9 this action do not require the filing of a claim. (See Gov. Code, § 905.) The CC&R Plaintiffs
10 reserve their rights to proceed with further compliance with the Tort Claims Act and to amend
11 for damages, as appropriate.

12

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
14 Enforcement of Equitable Servitudes
15 (By the CC&R Plaintiffs Against All Defendants)
16 35. The CC&R Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 34 of this
17 Complaint as though set forth in full herein.
18 36. The CC&Rs impose mutually beneficial restrictions under a general plan of
19 improvement for the benefit of all owners subject to the CC&Rs. The CC&Rs constitute an
20 affirmative covenant, running with the land, and an equitable servitude that is attached to each
21 parcel subject to the CC&Rs.

22 37. The CC&Rs are enforceable equitable servitudes under California Civil Code
23 Section 6856, and, as such, shall inure to the benefit of all owners of separate interests subject
24 to the CC&Rs including the CC&R Plaintiffs.
25 38. At a minimum, the City had constructive notice of the CC&Rs in that they were
26 recorded prior to the City obtaining a property interest in the Pipeline Site.
27 39. The City's implementation of a homeless shelter on the Pipeline Site is a breach
28 and violation of the CC&Rs.

Palmieri, Tyler, Wienor -8-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Allorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

40. Accordingly, the CC&R Plaintiffs are entitled to judicial enforcement of the
2 CC&Rs as an equitable servitude, and attorneys' fees as set forth in this Complaint.
3 41. The CC&R Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction, including a temporary
4 restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting the City from
5 taking any action and expending or directing the expenditure of any further funds to implement
6 the homeless shelter at the Pipeline Site or any use other than industrial operations and uses as
7 required by the CC&Rs. The CC&R Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon
8 allege, that the City intends to continue its conduct in violation of the CC&Rs causing further
9 breaches of the CC&Rs and causing further damage. Such actions of the City, if they continue,
10 will cause serious and permanent damage to the CC&R Plaintiffs, for which there is no
11 adequate monetary remedy.
12

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
14 Declaratory Relief

15 (By the CC&R Plaintiffs Against All Defendants)
16 42. The CC&R Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 41 of this
17 Complaint as though set forth in full herein.
18 43. An actual controversy has arisen, and now exists between the CC&R Plaintiffs
19 and the City concerning their respective rights and duties. The CC&R Plaintiffs contend that a
20 homeless shelter is prohibited by and a violates the CC&Rs. The City seeks to implement a
21  homeless shelter on a prohibited site, SO it apparently disputes the CC&R Plaintiffs'
22  contentions.

23 44. A judicial determination is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that the
24 CC&R Plaintiffs may ascertain the rights and duties of the City regarding the CC&Rs.
25 45. The CC&R Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction, including a temporary
26 restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction prohibiting the City from
27 taking any action and expending or directing the expenditure of any further funds to implement
28 the homeless shelter at the Pipeline Site or any use other than industrial operations and uses as

Palmiori, Tyler, Wiener -9-
Wilhelm & Waldron LLP
Attorneys at La COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

required by the CC&Rs. The CC&R Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon
2 allege, that the City intends to continue its conduct in violation of the CC&Rs causing further
3 breaches of the CC&Rs and causing further damage. Such actions of the City, if they continue,
4 will cause serious and permanent damage to the CC&R Plaintiffs, for which there is no
5 adequate monetary remedy.

6 46. The CC&R Plaintiffs were required to hire the services of attorneys, and have
7 thereby incurred attorneys' fees and costs, and will continue to incur such fees and costs in the
8 future by virtue of the pendency of this action, in an amount according to proof.
9

10 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
11 Petition for Writ of Mandate
12 (By All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants)
13 47. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate paragraphs 1 through 1 46 of this Complaint as
14 though set forth in full herein.

15 48. Plaintiffs, as well as members of End the Pipeline, complied with subdivisions
16 (a) and (b) of Public Resources Code Section 21177 and despite short notice exhausted their
17 administrative remedies by timely commenting on and objecting to the City's Homeless Shelter
18 Action. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate, the impacts resulting from the
19 City's decision to approve and proceed with the homeless shelter will extend to areas in which
20 Plaintiffs and the members, supporters and citizens represented by End the Pipeline own
21 property, do business, live and will directly and adversely affect the environment.
22 49. Plaintiffs bring this public interest litigation as a citizen's action. In this petition
23 for writ of mandate, Plaintiffs do not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief
24 sought for the general public or for a class of which Plaintiffs and the members and supporters
25 of End the Pipeline owning property, doing business and residing within the geographical
26 jurisdiction in the City of Huntington Beach are themselves members. By bringing this
27 petition for writ of mandate, Plaintiffs seek to enforce an important right affecting the public
28 interest and to confer a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, on the general

Palmiori, Tyler, Wiener -10-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Altorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

1 public or a large class of persons. Private enforcement is necessary and places a
2 disproportionate financial burden on Plaintiffs in relation to their stake in the matter.
3 50. The City is, and at all times relevant herein has been charged by law with the
4 performance of all duties arising under CEQA and the Guidelines.

5 51. Plaintiffs have objected to the City's Homeless Shelter Action at the
6 administrative level and thus complied with their requirements to do so. The City's Homeless
7 Shelter Action is a final determination. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed for herein,
8 Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury for which they have no adequate remedy at law, there
9 will be a waste, and the failure to enjoin further conduct may tend to render the judgment in
10 this action ineffectual.

11 52. Plaintiffs have previously complied with the requirements of Public Resources
12 Code Section 21167.5 by sending, via United States Postal Service First Class Mail, written
13 notice of this action to the City. A copy of the written notice provided to the City with proof of
14 service of same is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated herein by this reference.
15 53. Plaintiffs will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section
16 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388 by furnishing a copy of this
17 complaint/petition to the Attorney General of the State of California.
18 54. Plaintiffs have timely filed this petition for writ of mandate in accordance with
19 applicable law.

20 55. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City's
21 Homeless Shelter Action would place a "75 to 90 bed shelter" at the Pipeline Site for homeless
22 persons and associated facilities. Other than the general information, minimal information has
23 been disclosed to the public about the homeless shelter and its implementation.
24 56. Despite many impacts, the City Homeless Shelter Action moved through the
25 City's "approval process" at lightning speed and with no environmental review under CEQA.
26 The City held what it referred to as a "work session" concerning the then-proposed City
27 Homeless Shelter Action on April 15, 2019. Just a few days later, on April 18, 2019, the City
28 held a "special meeting" and adopted and approved the City Homeless Shelter Action.

Palmiori, Tylor, Wionor -11-
Wilholm & Waldron LLP
Attorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

1 57. The City's initial staff report was made publicly available just 24-hours prior to
2 the April 18th "special meeting." There was absolutely no reference to or findings relating to
3 CEQA in the initial staff report.

4 58. At, or shortly before, the April 18th "special meeting," a "Supplemental
5 Communication" was issued from the Director of Community Development belatedly asserting

6 a purported categorical exemption from CEQA.

7 59. At the April 18th "special meeting," the City Council approved the City
8 Homeless Shelter Action. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that
9 the City Council approved "all five items as presented by staff": "(1) Approve Resolution
10 2019-22 'A Resolution of the City Council of the City of Huntington Beach Pursuant to SB850
11 Declaring an Emergency Shelter Bed Crisis. (2) Declaration of City's intent to proceed
12 with establishing a Homeless Navigation Center. (3) Approval and authorization for the
13 Mayor and the City Clerk to enter into the Purchase and Sale Agreement for 15311 Pipeline
14 Lane (APN 145-537-06), Huntington Beach, CA. (4) Authorize the City Manager to execute
15 any and all documents related to the Agreement to further this action. (5) Approve the
16 appropriation of $2,850,000 in the Fiscal Year 2018/19 Revised Budget from the following
17 sources: Redevelopment Dissolution Assignment (100), Community Development Block
18 Grant Funds (215 and 239), and Residual Receipts Fund (233) as needed." The only resolution
19 that was publicly available prior to or at the meeting was Resolution 2019-22 which was
20 limited to the emergency shelter bed crisis. That resolution did not reach the other four items
21  "approved" by the City. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the
22 City Council did not adopt a motion determining the propriety and application of a Categorical
23 CEQA exemption.
24 60. The City's Homeless Shelter Action is in violation of CEQA. The City did not
25 first prepare and certify an environmental impact report (EIR) under CEQA, even though there
26 is substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the City's Homeless Shelter Action may
27 have a significant impact on the environment, concerning inter alia, surrounding land use,
28 parking, noise, public safety, surface water, hazardous substances, traffic and aesthetics, and

Palmiori, Tylor, Wiener -12-
Wilholm & Waidron LLP
Allorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

even though the City's Homeless Shelter Action did not qualify for Categorical Exemption
2 under CEQA and the Guidelines.

3 61. The City's Homeless Shelter Action is also in violation of the City's Municipal
4 Code. Such violations include, but are not limited to, the following:
5 A. Plaintiffs are informed and believe based upon minimal information
6 disclosed by the City, and based thereon allege, that the City determined that the City's
7 homeless shelter will have 75 to 90 beds, or even as many as 100 beds. The City's Municipal
8 Code Section 230.52, subdivision (A), limits emergency shelters to "50 occupants."
9 B. Plaintiffs are informed and believe based upon minimal information
10 disclosed by the City, and based thereon allege, that the length of stay for those at the homeless
11 shelter will be up to 90 days. The City's Municipal Code Section 230.52, subdivision (B)
12 provides, "Clients must vacate the facility by 8:00 a.m. each day and have no guaranteed bed
13 for the next night."

14 C. Plaintiffs are informed and believe based upon minimal information
15 disclosed by the City, and based thereon allege, that the Pipeline Site will not comply with the
16 parking requirements for the use provided in Municipal Code Section 230.52, subdivision (I).
17 62. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that the City was
18 contractually obligated to the Seller of the Pipeline Site and that the City had placed a sizeable
19 monetary deposit for the purchase of the Pipeline Site before public hearing and approval.
20 Plaintiffs and the public were not provided a fair and impartial hearing on the homeless shelter
21 because it was a decision improperly already made.
22 63. The City has the legal duty to make its determinations comply with the
23 applicable law governing such acts. In particular, the City has the legal and nondiscretionary
24 duty to act in accordance with the requirements of CEQA, the Guidelines, the Planning and
25 Zoning Law, the City Municipal Code, the City's General Plan, City policies and procedures
26 and other applicable laws and regulations.
27 64. The City acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, unreasonably and without
28 any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of

Palmiori, Tylor, Wioner -13-
Wilheim & Waldron LLP
Altorneys at Law COMPLAINT AND VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
2688971.1

CEQA, the Guidelines, the Planning and Zoning Law, the City Municipal Code, the City's
2 General Plan, City policies and procedures and other applicable laws and regulations. At all
times material hereto, the City had, and continues to have, the ability to comply with its legal
4 duties. Notwithstanding the efforts of Plaintiffs and others to inform the City of its legal
5 duties, and to induce the City to comply with its legal duties, the City has failed and refused to
6 perform these duties as described herein.

7 65. Plaintiffs have exhausted all available administrative remedies. There is no
8 provision known to Plaintiffs for any further administrative remedial action from the decision
of the City to approve the City's Homeless Shelter Action.
10 66. The City has prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the City's Homeless
11 Shelter Action and permitting the acts and omissions described herein to occur. Plaintiffs were
12 entitled to review of the City's Homeless Shelter Action by an impartial adjudicator. Plaintiffs
13 are informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that Plaintiffs did not receive a fair hearing
14 by an unbiased adjudicator. The lack of fair hearing constitutes an abuse of discretion.
15 67. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, the City has acted in
16 an arbitrary, capricious, and irrational manner lacking any reasonable basis, in violation of
17 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085, et seq.
18 68. Plaintiffs are beneficially interested in the issuance of the peremptory writ of
19 mandate as prayed for hereafter. Plaintiffs will be seriously harmed if the City is allowed to
20 proceed without first complying with applicable laws and regulations.
21 69. At all times material hereto, the City has been able to perform its duties and
22 obligations as demanded by Plaintiffs. The City has, however, failed and refused to undertake
23  its obligations. The City has failed and refused to require or to perform any of the above,
24 notwithstanding the substantial evidence presented by Plaintiffs and others that such failures
25 and refusals are contrary to law and will have adverse consequences on Plaintiffs.
26 70. Alternatively, the decision of the City to approve the City's Homeless Shelter
27 Action constitutes a final decision as contemplated in Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5,
28 et seq.

- 71. Plaintiffs have no plain speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
2 sought in this petition. In acting and failing to act in the manner described above, the City has
3 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the City's Homeless Shelter Action, in violation
4 of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5, et seq.
