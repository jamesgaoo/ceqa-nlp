VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTION

1.
2 This action challenges and' seeks to enjoin the actions of City of Westminster ("City"),

3 City Council of the City of Westminster ("City Council"), and the Mayor of Westminster, Tri Ta, in his

4 official capacity ("Mayor" collectively with City and City Council as "Respondents") on September 19,
2018, approving the application for Development Review and Affordable Housing Density Bonus to
5 consolidate three (3) lots to accommodate the development of 24 multi-family residences located at
6 13800, 13802 and 13812 Milton Ave. (Case No. 2017-80 or "Project").

7 2. In approving the Project, Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality

8 Act, Cal. Public Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21000, et seq ("CEQA"), State Planning and Zoning Law,

9 Cal. Government Code § 65000 et seq, the Westminster Municipal Code and Westminster General

10 Plan.

11 PARTIES

3.
12 Petitioner and plaintiff RESIDENTS OF WESTMINSTER (*Petitioner") is a California is
non-profit public benefit corporation based in Westminster, California and is comprised of members
13 who reside in the City of Westminster in the vicinity of the Project and will be directly affected by the
14 traffic, public health and safety, flooding, air quality, noise, and other impacts of the Project.
15 4. Respondent and defendant City is a municipal corporation organized and existing as a
16 general law city and subdivision of the State of California, organized and existing by virtue of the

17 Constitution and laws of the State of California. The City has principal responsibility for approving the

18 Project, and, therefore, is the lead agency within the meaning of PRC section 21067 and section 15367

19 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations ("CEQA Guidelines") for the purposes of

20 environmental review of the project.
5. Respondent and defendant City Council is the is City's governing legislative body, vested
21 by the City's laws and the laws of the State of California with the authority and duty to order, certify or
22 reject environmental documents, to regulate land use in the city, and all other applicable powers.
23 6. Respondent and defendant Mayor is the Mayor of the City.
24 7. Real Party in Interest and defendant Chris Albers (*Real Party") is the applicant for the

25 Project and the owner of the parcels involved in the Project.

26 8. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and

27 defendants DOES 1 - 10 and Real Parties and defendants Roes - 10. Petitioner will seek leave to
amend this Petition to state the
28 true names and capacities of the fictitiously named parties when they
have been ascertained:

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9.
2 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") sections 1094.5 and 1085 and
PRC sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate, and
for declaratory and injunctive relief, to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the Project,
4 including the application for Development Review and Affordable Housing Density Bonus to
consolidate three (3) lots to accommodate the development of 24 multi-family residences located at
13800, 13802 and 13812 Milton Ave.

10. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of

8 Orange and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this county. The cause

9 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

10 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to.

11 CCP §§ 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency) and 395 (actions generally), since the City

12 of Westminster is in the County of Orange.
11. The petition initiating this action was timely filed within 35 days after Respondents' 13 decision to issue a Notice of Exemption in accordance with CEQA Guidelines sections 15062 and
14 15332.

15 12. Petitioner provided written notice to Respondents of their intention to file the petition in
16 compliance with PRC section 21167.5. The notice and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit
17 "1.33

18 13. Petitioner has caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General not

19 more than ten days after the commencement of this proceeding, as required by PRC section 21167.7

20 and CCP section 388. A true and correct copy of the notice is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "2."
14. Petitioner has filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section 21167.4, a true 21 and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit "3."
22 15. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and exhausted
23 administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC section 21177. Petitioner and/or other
24 agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in the petition orally or in writing
25 during the Respondents' decision-making process.

26 16. The violations by Respondents alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

27 Petitioner and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress these

28 beneficial interests and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and
those of their supporting members.

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 17. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this Court

2 grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the certification of the Project

3 and supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions
will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.
4 STANDING
5 18. Petitioner has organizational as well as public-interest standing to bring this Action.
6 Generally, a party must be "beneficially interested" in order to obtain a writ of mandate. § CCP S 1086.
7 Associations, such as the Petitioner, have standing to sue when the association's members would

8 otherwise have standing to sue on their own individual behalf, the interests the organization is seeking

9 to protect in the lawsuit are germane to the organization's purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor

10 the relief requested requires participation of the members in the lawsuit. See Brotherhood of Teamsters

11 v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd (1987) 190 Cal.3d 1515, 1522; Citizens Against Forced Annexation

12 V. County of Santa Clara (1984) 153 Cal.3d 89, 96; Simons v. City of Los Angeles (1979) 100 Cal.3d
496, 500.
13 19. However, a petitioner may have standing to sue even if they do not have a beneficial
14 interest if the subject matter of the action is one of public right, the purpose of the proceeding is
15 enforcement of a public duty, and the public interest would suffer if the agency is not compelled to

16 perform. Environmental Protection Info Ctr. v. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44

17 Cal.4th 459, 479; Common Cause V. Board of Supervisors (1989) 44 Cal.3d 432, 439.

18 20. Petitioner has associational standing to bring this Action on behalf of its members.

19 Petitioner's members live and work near the Project site as well as recreate within the Project site.

20 Petitioner's members will be directly affected by the impacts of this Project, including increased traffic
and public health and safety issues. The subject matter of this Action is germane to Petitioner's
21 organizational purpose as the Petitioner is dedicated to ensuring that developments in the City of
22 Westminster, particularly in the Project area, are carried out in a legally sufficient manner to promote
23 public safety, public health and general welfare. Finally, neither the claim asserted nor the relief
24 requested requires participation of the members in the lawsuit.

25 21. Even if Petitioner is found to not have associational standing to bring this Action, the

26 Court should find that Petitioner has standing as the Action was brought to vindicate a public right, to

27 ask the Court to issue an order to the City to comply with CEQA, the City's Municipal Code, and all

28 other applicable requirements.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

2 California Environmental Quality Act
22. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant
3 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
4 23. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
5 proposed actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR") except in certain limited circumstances.

6 See, e.g., PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD
7 (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature

8 intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the

9 reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002)

10 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.
24.
11 CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

12 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code of
Regulations ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1). "Its purpose is to inform the public and its
13 responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus,
14 the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-government.? Citizens of Goleta
15 Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has been described as "an

16 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to

17 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep Jets

18 Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").
25.
19 Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

20 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.
(14 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to
21 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed
22 project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced."
23 (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).). If a project has a significant effect on the environment, the agency
24 may approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant

25 effects on the environment where feasible" and that any significant unavoidable effects on the

26 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." PRC § 21082; see also CEQA Guidelines

27 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).
26.
28 To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered
structure. CEQA Guidelines § 15002(k); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

~ Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 -86. First, if a project falls into an exempt category, or it

2 can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the

3 environment, no further agency evaluation is required. Id. Second, if there is a possibility the projèct
will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial study. Id.;
4 CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a). If the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the
5 project may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a negative declaration.

6 Id., CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063(b)(2), 15070. Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on

7 the environment, an EIR is required. Id. Here, since the City proposes to exempt the Project from

8 CEQA entirely, we are at the first step of the CEQA process.

© 27. CEQA exempt activities are either expressly identified by statute (i.e., statutory

10 exemptions, PRC. 21080.01 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15261 - 85) or those that fall into one of

11 more than two-dozen classes deemed categorically exempt by the Secretary of Resources (i.e.,
categorical exemptions). PRC §§ 21080(b)(10); CEQA Guidelines § 15300. Public agencies utilizing
12 CEQA exemptions must support their determination with substantial evidence. PRC $ 21168.5.
13 Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond
14 the reasonable scope of their statutory language. Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
15 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125. A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated

16 CEQA requirements." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

17 Erroneous reliance by the City on a categorical exemption constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion

18 and a violation of CEQA. Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997)

19 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192.
28. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects which are exempt from the provisions of
20 CEQA. These are called categorical exemptions. PRC § 21084(a); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15300, 15354.
21 Categorical exemptions are certain classes of activities that generally do not have a significant effect on
22 the environment. Id. Public agencies utilizing such exemptions must support their determination with
23 substantial évidence. PRC § 21168.5. "[I]f the court perceives there was substantial evidence that the
24 project might have an adverse impact, but the agency failed to secure preparation of an EIR, the
25 agency's action must be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to follow the law."

26 Dunn-Edwards Corp. V. Bay Area Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 656. A

27 categorical exemption may not be invoked for any project that may cause a substantial adverse change

28 in the significance of a historical resource. PRC § 21084(e); CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(f); Comm. to
Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles ("Hollywoodland") (2008) 161 Cal. App.

-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

4th 1168, 1186.

2 29. CEQA's unique "fair argument" standard applies when reviewing a CEQA exemption.
Under the "fair argument" standard, an agency is precluded under the CEQA Guidelines from relying
on a categorical exemption when there is a fair argument that a project will have a significant effect on
the environment. Berkeley Hillside Pres. v. City of Berkeley (2012) 203 Cal. App. 4th 656, 670-671;
Banker's Hill, Hillcrest, Park West Community Preservation Group v. City of San Diego (*Bankers
Hill") (2006) 139 Cal. App. 4th 249, 266. In other words, "where there is any reasonable possibility
that project or activity may have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption would be

8 improper." Id.; Dunn-Edwards Corp., 9 Cal.App.4th at 654 - 55.

( 30. The standard of review in an action challenging a CEQA exemption is whether there has

10 been a prejudicial abuse of discretion. See PRC $ 21168.5; Dunn-Edwards Corp., 9 Cal.App.4th at 656.

11 "Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not procceded in a manner required by law or if

12 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence." Id.; Western States Petroleum
Assn. v. Super. Ct. (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 568; See, e.g., Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents 13 of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 409. "[I]f the court perceives there was substantial
14 evidence that the project might have an adverse impact, but the agency failed to secure preparation of
15 an EIR, the agency's action must be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to
16 follow the law." Dunn-Edwards Corp., 9 Cal.App.4th at 656; Bankers Hill, 139 Cal. App. 4th at 260.
17 "Generally speaking, an agency's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of CEQA is

18 prejudicial when the violation thwarts the act's goals by precluding informed decision-making and

19 public participation." San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocates for Responsible Education v. San

20 Lorenzo Valley Unified School Dist. ("San Lorenzo") (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1375.
31.
21 CEQA categorical exemptions "are construed narrowly" and will not be unreasonably
expanded beyond their terms. County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 91 22 Cal.Rptr.2d 66, 89. Exemptions are strictly construed to construction allow for the fullest possible
23 environmental protections within the reasonable scope of statutory language. CEQA Guidelines §
24 15003(f); Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App.
25 4th 1165, 1192 -93 ("Azusa"); East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. V. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified

26 School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 155, 171; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of

27 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390 (rejecting "an attempt to use limited exemptions

28 contained in CEQA as a means to subvert rules regulating the protection of the environment").
32. Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines provides that five (5) conditions must be met to
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

1 invoke the categorical exemption as an in-fill development. The conditions include:

2 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
3 regulations.

4 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.
5

6 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.

7 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,
noise, air quality, or water quality.
8

9 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

33.
10 The Discussion section of Section-15332 of the CEQA Guidelines provides, in relevant

11 part, that "[t]he class consists of environmentally benign in-fill projects which are consistent with local
general plan and zoning requirements. This class is not intended to be applied to projects which would
-12 result in any significant traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality effects. Application of this
13 exemption, as all categorical exemptions, is limited by the factors described in section 15300.2.3
14 34. Section 15300.2(c) of the CEQA Guidelines states that "a categorical exemption shall
15 not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant

16 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

17 35. CEQA imposes a 35-day statute of limitations from the date of filing and posting of a

18 Notice of Exemption. PRC § 21167(d); CEQA Guidelines § 15112(c)(1). The California Planning and

19 Zoning Law, Gov. Code § 65000, et seq. ("Planning & Zoning Law") imposes a 90-day statute of
limitations from the day of the legislative body's decision.
20 Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code sections 65915-65918 and Westminster Municipal Code sections
21 17.570.005 through 17.570.035)
22 36. The Density Bonus Law under Gov. Code sections 65915 - 65918 provides that when
23 an applicant seeks a density bonus for a housing development within the jurisdiction of a city or county,

24 the local government must comply with the State Density Bonus Law.

25 37. Gov. Code section 65915(d) sets the number of concessions or incentives that an

26 applicant for a density bonus could receive from the City.
38.
27 Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(A) provides that for projects which would include at

28 least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 5 percent for very low-income
households, the applicant shall receive one concession or incentive.

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

39. Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(B) provides that for projects which would include at

2 least 20 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 10 percent for very low-

3 income households, the applicant shall receive two concession or incentive.
40. Gov. Code section 65915(a)(1) requires a city of county to adopt an ordinance that
4 specifies how compliance with the section will be implemented.
41. The City has adopted ordinances in accordance with Gov. Code section 65915(a)(1) in
6 sections 17.570.005 through 17.570.035 of its Municipal Code.
42. Westminster Municipal Code section 17.570.025 requires the City Council to make the
following findings in approving & density bonus and other bonus incentives:

0 A. The project would be compatible with the purpose and intent of the General Plan and the provisions of this Title;
10
B.
11 The project will not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, or general welfare, or injurious to persons, property, or improvements in the vicinity and zoning
12 district in which the property is located;

13 C. The number of dwellings can be accommodated by existing and planned infrastructure capacities;
14
D.
15 Adequate evidence exists to ensure that the development of the property would result in the provision of affordable housing in a manner consistent with Gov. section
16 65915, or as may be amended, and the purpose and intent of this Title;

17 E. There are sufficient provisions to guarantee that the designated dwelling units would remain affordable in the future.
18
General Plan Consistency 19 43.
20 Each California city and county must adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan
governing development. Napa Citizens for Honest Gov. v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 21 Cal.App.4th 342, 352, citing Gov. Code §§ 65030, 65300. The general plan sits at the top of the land
22 use planning hierarchy (see DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773), and serves as a
23 "constitution" or "charter" for all future development. Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut
24 Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.

25 44. General plan consistency is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws;

26 it is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth with the force of law." See Debottari v.

27 Norco City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.
45.
28 State law mandates two levels of consistency. a First, a general plan must be internally or
"horizontally" consistent: its elements must "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency." See Gov. Code § 65300.5; Sierra Club v.

2 Bd. of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704. A general plan amendment thus may not be
internally inconsistent, nor may it cause the general a plan as a whole to become internally inconsistent. 3 See De Vita, 9 Cal.4th at 796 fn. 12.
4 46. Second, stäte law requires "vertical" consistency, meaning that zoning ordinances and
5 other land use decisions also must be consistent with the general plan. See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2)

6 [land uses authorized by zoning ordinance must be "compatible with the objectives, policies, general

7 land uses, and programs specified in the [general] plan."]; see also Neighborhood Action Group V.

8 County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184. A zoning ordinance that conflicts with the

9 general plan or impedes achievement of its policies is invalid and cannot be given effect. See Lesher, 52

10 Cal.3d at 544.

47. State law requires that all subordinate land use decisions, including conditional use 11 permits, be consistent with the general plan. See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2); Neighborhood Action
12 Group, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184.
13 48. A project cannot be found consistent with a general plan if it conflicts with a general
14 plan policy that is "fundamental, mandatory, and clear," regardless of whether it is consistent with other
15 general plan policies. See Endangered Habitats League v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th
16 777, 782-83; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62

17 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1341-42 ("FUTURE"). Morcover, even in the absence of such a direct conflict, an

18 ordinance or development project may not be approved if it interferes with or frustrates the general

19 plan's policies and objectives. See Napa Citizens, 91 Cal.App.4th at 378-79; see also Lesher, 52 Cal.3d

20 at 544 (zoning ordinance restricting development conflicted with growth-oriented policies of general
plan).
21 Westminster Municipal Code
22 49. Pursuant to Westminster Municipal Code 17.210.015, residential development standard
23 for R-4 zoning district allows maximum of two-stories, not to exceed 35-feet in height.
24 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
25 50. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

26 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

27 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City of Westminster and Orange County, and will

28 result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring the City to comply with CEQA and
other legal requirements applicable to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project Approvals and

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

prohibiting Respondents from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied

2 with those legal requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the
Project until the County has fully complied with these legal requirements.
51. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to CCP §1021.5. The
necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of
reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
52. The Project is located at 13800, 13802 and 13812 Milton Ave. in the City of
Westminster, California and is comprised of three (3) parcels (Assessor's Parcel Numbers 203-311-13,
24, & 16) and total 1.01 acres (*Project Site.")

10 53. The applicant submitted an Application to consolidate the (3) parcels into a single 1.01-

11 acre site and for Development Review for the development of three (3) apartment buildings to provide
25 residential dwelling units.
12 54. In the Application, the Applicant requested an affordable density bonus of seven (7)
13 additional units, in addition to 18-units which could be built onsite at the allowed R-4 (Multiple-Family
14 Residential 15-18 Units/Acre) density and the granting of said density bonus will require units to be set
15 aside for low-income or very low-income households, in accordance with Gov. Code sections 65915
16 through 65918.

17 55. On March 21, 2018, the City of Westminster's Planning Commission ("Planning

18 Commission") passed Resolution No. 18-006, recommending that the Mayor and City Council deny the

19 Project. The Planning Commission's decision to recommend the denial of the Project was based on

- 20 findings, among others, that the Project would not be consistent with the General Plan and that the

21 Project would be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, and welfare within the adjacent
neighborhood.
22 56. On September 5, 2018, the Mayor and City Council held a hearing to consider the
23 Project. After the hearing, the Mayor and City Council, pursuant to the recommendation by the
24 Planning Commission, voted to deny the Project. The Mayor and City Council directed staff to prepare .
25 the appropriate findings for the Mayor and City Council's consideration at their meeting on September

26 19, 2018. The Mayor and the City Counci also voted to continue the public hearing to the meeting of

27 September 19, 2018.
57.
28 After the September 5, 2018 City Council meeting, the Real Party submitted a revised
site plan for the Mayor and City Council's consideration, modifying the project from 25 units to 24

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 units, an increase of parking spaces from 50 to 52 (including 7 open parking spaces and 45 garage

2 spaces), modifying the drive-entry to align with Hefley Street and install three-way stop signs at the T-

3 intersection of Milton Avenue and Hefley Street. (*Modified Project"). In exchange for receiving a

4 density bonus of 6 units in addition to the 18-units allowed, the Modified Project would reserve either
four (4) units for low-income households or two (2) units for very low-income households. The Real
5 Party also submitted a draft parking agreement that would be included as part of the rental lease

6 agreement for each tenant which includes language that would prohibit garage spaces from being used

7 for storage.

8 58. On September 19, 2018, the Mayor and City Council held a meeting to consider the

9 Modified Project. The Mayor and City Council then voted to approve the Modified Project upon the

10 Real Party's modifications.
59.
11 As part of the approval of the Modified Project, the Mayor and City Council made

12 findings that the Project was exempt from CEQA environmental review pursuant to Section 15332 of

13 the CEQA Guidelines (that all 5 conditions or exemption criteria under this section were met); and

14 made findings pursuant to Westminster Municipal Code section 17.560.020 to approve the density
bonus and the development review.
15 60. On September 26, 2018, the City filed and posted the Notice of Exemption for the

16 Project.

17 61. Petitioner is filing this Petition in compliance with all applicable durational limitation

18 periods.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (By Petitioner For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC §211168 Or In

21 The Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5 Re: Project Ineligibility For CEQA Exemption)
62. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
22 forth herein.

23 63. The City exempted the Project from CEQA under Section 15332 of the CEQA

24 Guidelines which exempts Class 32 projects which "consists of projects characterized as in-fill

25 development meeting the conditions described in this section."

26 64. This Project is not an environmental benign in-fill project consistent with local general

27 plan and zoning requirements that Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines intended to exempt.
65.
28 Also, this Project could potentially result in significant traffic and other related
environmental impacts that could adversely affect the nearby residents.

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

66. Moreover, the Project is ineligible to be exempt from CEQA under Section 15332 of the

2 CEQA Guidelines as the Project does not meet the conditions or exemption criteria which are required

3 for the exemption to apply.
67. First, the Project does not meet condition (a) of Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines
4 as the Project is not consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general
plan policies as well as applicable zoning designation and regulations.
6 68. Substantial evidence in the record support a finding that condition (a) is not met because
the Project is inconsistent with (1) Goal PHS-4 (Flooding and Inundation) and Policy PHS-4.6 (Best

8 Management Practices for flood control) because the Project site and vicinity are known to flood and

9 inundate as they are located at the center of three flood control channels and present flood and

10 inundation hazards to residents and business nearby, (2) Goal M-4 (adequate parking), Policy M-4.1

11 (new developments to provide sufficient off-street parking) by failing to provide adequate off-street

12 parking in an area with unusually narrow streets and insufficient on-street parking, (3) Goal M-1

13 (complete streets), Policy M-1.3 (required level of service ("LOS") D)), Policy M-1.4 (multi-modal
LOS), and Policy M-1.5 (requiring evaluation of potential mobility impacts of a new development and
14 implementation of mitigation measures) in an area where there is already significant traffic impairment.
15 69. Next, the Project does not meet condition (d) of Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines

16 as the approval of the project would result in significant effects relating to traffic and other related

17 environmental impacts.

18 70. Substantial evidence in the record supports a finding that condition (d) is not met

19 because the Project, among others, could have a significant traffic and other related environmental

20 impacts including (1) the traffic ingress and egress issues in an area where the street is abnormally

21 narrower than normal with parked cars filling the street, (2) public safety issues arising out of the lack
of sufficient street parking, (3) public safety and health issue related to over ten traffic incidents in a
22 span of less than 9 months from October 9, 2017 to June 18, 2018, (4) public safety issue related to a
23 fire station being close to the Project Site without any sign to indicate the existence of one, and (5) the
24 significant traffic impairment of existing roadways in the Project area from existing residents, office
25 buildings, churches and preschools.

26 71. Finally, the Project is ineligible to be exempt from CEQA as it will have a significant

27 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances pursuant to Section 15300.2(a) of the CEQA

28 Guidelines. The Project site lies on an unusually narrow street in a very congested portion of the City
next to the 405 freeway and substantial evidence in the record indicates that there are unique and

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- unusual public safety and health hazards from cars traveling on a narrow street with cars parked on both

2 sides and with the increase of traffic flowing through the narrow roadway. Correspondingly, the

3 Project could have significant impacts on traffic and related areas based on the unusual circumstances

4 surrounding the Project.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (By Petitioner For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC $ 211168 Or

7 In The Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5, Re: Violations of CEQA; Failure To

8 72. Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding Considerations)

herein. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

o

10 73. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported

11 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide

12 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.
74.
13 Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings and a Notice of Exemption that are

14 inadequate as a matter of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including
but not limited to the following:
15 a.

16 Finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 15332 of the
CEQA Guidelines.

17 b.

18 Finding that the Project satisfies all conditions or exemption criteria pursuant to
Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines.

19 C. Finding that the Project will not have a significant environment impact due to

20 unusual circumstances.
75.
21 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

22 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

23 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' approval and exemption of the
Project from CEQA must be set aside.

24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

25

• 26 (Gov. Code §§ 65915 to 65918 - Violation of the State Density Bonus Law By Petitioner Against

27 76. All Respondents and All Real Parties)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

28 herein.

77. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 required by law in approving this Project, in that the Project violates the State Density Bonus Law.
78.
2 According to Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(A) provides that for projects which would

3 include at least 10 percent of the total units for lower income households or at least 5 percent for very
low-income households, the applicant shall only receive one concession or incentive.
4 79. According to Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(B) provides that for projects which would
5 include at least 20 percent of the total units for low-income households or at least 10 percent for very

6 low-income households, the applicant shall only receive two concession or incentive.

7 80. The Project proposes 4 low income or 2 very low income affordable units out of 24 total

8 units. Thus, the Project would encompass either 17% low-income households or 8% very low-income

9 I households.

10 81. Based on the percentage of the units dedicated to low income or very low income

11 affordable units, the Project falls under Gov. Code section 65915(d)(2)(A) and the applicant can receive
one concession or incentive.
12 82. However, the Project, as approved, provides two concessions/incentives, including
13 allowing tandem parking and the waiver of Westminster Municipal Code 17.210.015, allowing the Real
14 Party to build three-story apartments in a R-4 zone which limits buildings to two-stories.
15 83. As such, the City violated Gov. Code section 65915 by allowing more incentives or

16 concession for the Project than is allowed by the section, jeopardizing the public health and safety of

17 the residents in and nearby the Project, including Petitioner.

18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (WMC § 17.570.025 - Violation of the Density Bonus Ordinance By Petitioner Against All

20 Respondents and All Real Parties)
84.
21 Petitioner realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.
22 85. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
23 required by law in approving this Project, in that the Project violates the Westminster Municipal Code
24 section 17.570.025 or the local density bonus ordinance.

25 86. Westminster Municipal Code section 17.570.025 provides that a density bonus and other

26 bonus incentives may be approved upon being able to make five (5) distinct factual findings.

27 87. For finding (A) under Westminster Municipal Code section 17.570.025, the City's

28 finding was improper where there is substantial evidence in the record that the Project would not be
compatible with the purpose and intent of the General Plan, including Goal M-4 (adequate parking),

-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Policy M-4.1 (new developments to provide sufficient off-street parking), Goal PHS-4 (flooding and

2 inundation), Policy PHS-4.6 (best management practices to prevent flooding), Goal M-1 (complete

3 streets), Policy M-1.3 (required LOS D)), Policy M-1.4 (multi-modal LOS), M-1.5 (requiring
evaluation of potential mobility impacts of a new development and implementation of mitigation 4 I measures).
88. For finding (B) under Westminster Municipal Code section 17.570.025, the City's
6 finding was improper where there is substantial evidence in the record that the Project will be
7 "detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, or general welfare, or injurious to persons, property,

8 or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located" where there is

0 substantial evidence in the record that the Project will be detrimental to the public interest, health,

10 safety, general welfare as a result of the significant traffic and related impacts and flooding and

11 inundation impacts.
89.
12 Based on the foregoing, the City improperly made findings (A) and (B) of Westminster
Municipal Code section 17.570.025.
13 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Gov. Code § 65000 et seq. Violations of City of Westminster's General Plan By Petitioner
15 Against All Respondents and All Real Parties)
16 90. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
17 required by law in approving this project, in that the Project is inconsistent with the City of

18 Westminster General Plan.

19 91. The Project is inconsistent with the City of Westminster General Plan. The Project is

20 inconsistent with the City's General Plan's Mobility and Flooding and Inundation.
92.
21 The Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan Mobility Element. City of
Westminster (2016) General Plan Mobility Element.
22 93. First, the Project is inconsistent with Goal M-1 and related Policies M-1.3, M-1.4, and
23 M-1.5. Goal M-1 (complete streets) provides the goal of "[a] safe, efficient and accessible
24 transportation system that serves the mobility needs of all users of all ages and abilities." Policy M-1.3
25 (level of service), in relevant part, requires the maintenance of LOS D for vehicles at intersections and

26 roadways when vehicles are considered a prioritized mode of travel. Policy M-1.4 (multi-modal LOS)

27 requires the City to "[m]onitor SB 743 and multi-modal level of service (MMLOS) methodologies and

28 incorporate into impact assessment as appropriate." Policy M-1.5 (mobility impacts) requires the City
to evaluate of potential mobility impacts of a new development and implementation of mitigation

-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P measures. Despite the substantial evidence in the record that there are significant traffic impairments in

2 the Project area, the City failed to conduct an adequate traffic assessment to determine whether the
Project was consistent with the Goal M-1 and related policies herein. No project assessment
3 determining the LOS of the Project site or evaluating the potential mobility impacts of a new
4 development like the Project was prepared.
5 94. Second, Goal M-4 (parking) requires "[a]dequate availability of parking that meets the
6 needs of people who live, work, and visit Westminster.3 And Policy M-4.1 (off-street parking) is to
7 "require new developments to provide sufficient off-street parking to reduce on-street parking

8 congestion and increase both auto and pedestrian safety,..." Substantial evidence in the record shows

9 that the Project fails to provide adequate off-street parking in an area with unusually narrow streets and

10 insufficient on-street parking. Therefore, the Project is inconsistent with Goal M-4 and PolicyM-4.1.
95.
11 Next, the Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan Flood and Inundation
Element. City of Westminster (2016) General Plan Flood and Inundation Element. Goal PHS-4 12 (Flooding and Inundation) seeks to cause "[m]inimal injury, loss of life, property damage, and social
13 and economic disruptions caused by flood and inundation hazards in Westminster. Policy PHS-4.6
14 (Best Management Practices) establishes ways to prevent flooding for new developments by integrating
15 low-impact development best management practices. Substantial evidence in the record demonstrate

16 that the Project site and vicinity are known to flood and inundate as they are located at the center of

17 three flood control channels and present flood and inundation hazards to residents and businesses

18 nearby. However, the Project fails to adequately incorporate flood prevention and best management

19 practices to prevent flooding in an especially flood-prone area.

20 (WMC § 17.210.015 Violation of City Municipal Code By Petitioner Against All Respondents and
21 All Real Parties) C
22 96. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
23 herein.

24 97. The Project proposes to three-stories for two buildings (Building No. 1 and 2) in

25 violation of Westminster Municipal Code 17.210.015, which limits residential developments in R-4

26 zoning districts to two-stories and 35-feet in height. Thus, the Project, which is located a in a R-4 zoning

27 district, is limited to two-stories, not three-stories.
98. Because the City improperly provided two concessions rather than one concession under 28 the State Density Bonus law (Gov. Code § 65915(2)(A)), the waiver of Westminster Municipal Code

1 17.210.015's 2-story building limit the City provided for this Project by is invalid, null and void.
