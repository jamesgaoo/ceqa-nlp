VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the actions of the City of Los Angeles

3 ("City") action on December 12, 2018 to approve land use entitlements for an approximately 324,693

4 square-foot, 22-story, mixed-use development consisting of an 18-floor residential tower above a four-

5 level above grade podium structure including three levels of subterranean parking and three levels of

6 above~grade parking, and containing a maximum of 299 residential apartment units, approximately

7 46,110 square feel of commercial space comprised of 38,440 square feet of office space, approximately

8 3,700 square feet of ground floor restaurant spaee, and approximately 3,970 square feet of ground floor

9 community serving retail space, an approximately 18,962 square foot public park on the north side of
the project site along Gordon Street and approximately 508 parking spaces within lhe lhree levels of

10 subterranean parking and three levels of above-grade parking ("Project").

11 2. The Project is located at 5929-5945 W. Sunset Boulevard and 1512-1540 N. Gordon

12 Street, at the northeast corner of the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Gordon Street in the

13 Hollywood Redevelopment Project Area and the Hollywood Community Plan Area in the City of Los

14 Angeles. The Project Site encompasses approximately 1.65 acres (approximately 72,154 sf) of land

15 area and includes Lots 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 of the Bagnoli Tract No. 2 (Assessor Parcel No. (APN)

16 5545-009-035), the west 50 feet of Lot 6 of the Paul and Angel Reyes Subdivision (APN 5545-009-

17 031), and Lots 17, 18, and 19 of the Bagnoli Tract No. 2 (APNs 5545-009-005, 5545-009-006, 5545-
009-007) ("Project Site").

18 3. Prior to being illegally demolished on February 22, 2015, the 1924 Peerless Motor

19 Company Building, alternatively known as the Old Spaghetti Factory building was located at the

20 Project Site ("OSF Building"). The OSF Building has had a storied history in the development of

21 Hollywood, beginning as an auto showroom for the Peerless Motor Company and then subsequently

22 serving as the home for the Motion Picture Hall of Fame, an acting school founded by celebrated

23 theatre director Max Reinhart (1938 to 1943), studios of radio station KNX (1936 to 1938) and "Station

24 of the Stars" KMPC (1944 to 1968), and the popular Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant.

4.

25 In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act

26 ("CEQA"), Cal. Public Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21000, et seq ("CEQA"), the Subdivision Map
Act, Government Code §§ 66410, et seq ("Subdivision Map Act"), the Planning and Zoning Law, Cal.

27 Government Code §§ 65000 et seq ("Planning and Zoning Law"), the City's General Plan and the

28 Hollywood Community Plan.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

H PARTIES

2 5. Petitioner and Plaintiff COALITION TO PRESERVE a LA, a California nonprofit public

3 benefit corporation ("Preserve LA" or "Petitioner") is a nonprofit organization in Los Angeles that

4 advocates for smart land use planning, government transparency, open space, affordable housing,

5 support for the City's homeless population, and against gentrification. Coalition, its employees,

6 customers, and the many persons whom Coalition serves are beneficially interested in and will be
impacted by the outcome of this Project

7 6.

8 Defendant and Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City") is a California charter city

9 located in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of the
City.

10 7. Defendants and Respondents DOES - 10 are entities of which the true names,

11 capacities, and corporate associations are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are

12 sued under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities
when ascertained.
13 8.

14 Real Party in Interest 5929 SUNSET (HOLLYWOOD), LLC is a Delaware limited

15 liability company (*5929 Sunset" or "Real Party") is the owner of the Project Site and is the applicant

16 to the City for the Project's vesting tentative tract map and other associated entitlements.
9.

17 Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities of which the true names, capacities, and
corporate association are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued under

18 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when

19 ascertained.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10.
21 Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and

22 Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ

23 of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the Project's environmental impact report and
purported approval of the Project.

24 11.

25 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

26 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause
alleged in this Petition, or some part of that

27 cause, arise in this county. (Code Civ. Proc. ("CCP") § 393;
Cal. State Parks Foundation V. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this

28 Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency)
and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

12. The petition initiating this action was timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's

2 decision to issue Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code sections
21167(a).
3 13.
4 Petitioner provided written notice to Respondents of their intention to file the petition in
compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. The notice and proof of service are attached
5 hereto as Exhibit A.

6 14. Petitioner has caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General not

7 more than ten days after the commencement of this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code

8 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388. A true and correct copy of the notice is

9 attached to this pleading as Exhibit "B."

10 15. Petitioner has filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section 21167.4, a true

11 and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
16.
12 Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and exhausted
administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section 21177.
13 Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in the
14 petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

15 17. The violations by Respondents alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

16 Petitioner and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress these

17 beneficial interests and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and

18 those of their supporting members.
18.
19 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy under ordinary law unless this Court

20 grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside the certification of the Project

21 and supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions
will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.
22 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

23 California Environmental Quality Act

24 19. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

25 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

26 20. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

27 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g.,

28 PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9
Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended
-4-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

2 scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103
Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
3 21. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers
4 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Reg.
5 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials

6 of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not

7 only the environment but also informed self-government.'* (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

8 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564). The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell'

9 whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they

10 have reached ecological points of no return. (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs.

11 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 (*Berkeley Jets").)

22. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
12 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.
13 supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to (14 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley,
14 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed
15 project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced."

16 (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).).

17 23. Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a

18 Project prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section

19 21002.1(d) of the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both
individual and collective, of all activities involved in a project."
20 24. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural
21 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights
22 Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The
23 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned

24 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936

25 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency

26 should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal,

27 consistent with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

28 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines§ 15201). The lead agency
must consider all a "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b)).

2 25. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a

3 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
26.
4 Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification, as here, is addressed in PRC § 21092.1,

5 and 14 CCR $15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental impact report

6 after notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the public agency

7 shall give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and
21153 before certifying the environmental impact report." PRC § 21092.1.

8 27. "Significant new information" includes:

9 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new

10 mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

11 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result…

12 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental impacts of the project...

13 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that

14 meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

15 14 CCR $15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043
28.

16 In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. v. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112 ("Laurel
Heights IP'), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation prior to

17 certification. The Court stated:

18 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. (See State Bar Rep.,

19 supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR commented upon by
the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or conclusory in nature that public

20 comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation under section 21092.1. (See, Mountain
Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

21 Laurel Heights II, 6 Cal.4th at 1130 (emph. added).

22 29. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead

23 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise

24 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC § 21002.1(c).)

25 The Subdivision Map Act
30.
26 The Subdivision Map Act, California Government Code, §§ 66410, et seq,

27 ("Subdivision Map Act") requires local agencies to review and approve all land subdivisions. The Map

28 Act regulates both the process for approving subdivisions and sets substantive requirements for
approval of land subdivisions.

-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

31. The Map Act requires that local agency deny approval of a land subdivision, referred

to
2 as a tentative map a or a parcel map, if "(a) That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable

3 general and specific plans .. . ; (b) That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with applicable general and specific plans; (c) That the site is not physically suitable for the
4 type of development; (d) That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of
5 development; (e) That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause

6 substantial environmental damage or substantial and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat; (f)

7 That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health

8 problems. (g) That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements will conflict with easements,

9 acquired by the public at large, or find as part of approving a subdivision map that access through or

10 use of, property within the proposed subdivision." (Cal. Government Code § 66474.)

11 The Planning and Zoning Law, General Plan & Hollywood Community Plan
32.
12 The Planning and Zoning Law requires cities to prepare and adopt a comprehensive,
long-term general plan that includes at minimum seven elements including land use, circulation,
13 housing, conservation, open space, noise and safety.
14 33. The City has adopted a General Plan that includes thirty-five Community Plans under
15 the City's General Plan Land Use Element.

16 34. The Hollywood Community Plan ("Community Plan") applies to the Project Site as the

17 Project Site falls within the Hollywood Community Plan Area.

18 35. The Community Plan imposes numerous requirements for land use development within

19 the Hollywood Community Plan Area, including the preparation of additional master plans if

20 development intensities increase within the Hollywood Community Plan Area.
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
21 36. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
22 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, a including
23 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important
24 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable

25 to the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties

26 In Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

27 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until

28 they have fully complied with these legal requirements.-
37. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these

2 public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

3 STATEMENT OF FACTS
38.
4 Between November 28, 2006 to January 8, 2008, the Community Redevelopment

5 Agency of Los Angeles ("CRA") issued and circulated a Notice of Preparation for an environmental

6 impact report to consider the approval of the development of a 324,432 square-foot, mixed-use project

7 including 305 dwelling units, 40,000 square feet of creative office space and 13,500 square feet of

8 ground floor retail (including 8,500 square feet of restaurant space), an approximately 21,177 square

9 foot public park, two Supergraphic Signs and 508 on-site parking spaces in four subterranean levels and
two above grade levels which would retain and incorporate portions of the amenity deck on the third

10 floor and portions of the structural/architectural components of the existing OSF Building on the

11 Project Site. ("Original Project")
39.
12 Subsequently, the CRA circulated a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") to the

13 general public for the Original Project between June 20, 2007 until August 3, 2007. ("Public Comment

14 Period".) During the Public Comment Period, the CRA conducted a public hearing before the CRA's
Board of Commissions on August 2,2007.

15 40.

16 A Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") and Erratum were respectively released

17 on September 1, 2007 and October 7, 2007 responding to comment received the Public Comment

18 Period, making additions and corrections to the DEIR as well as analyzing a change to the Original
Project concerning the location of one of the two Supergraphic Signs proposed for the Original Project.

19 41. On or about October 18, 2007, the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of

20 Los Angeles ("CRA") adopted Resolution No. 7094, certifying that the FEIR for the Project. (the

21 "CRA EIR") had been completed in compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, that the

22 information contained in the Final EIR and the Erratum to the Final EIR had been reviewed and

23 considered by the Commissioners of the CRA prior to considering the proposed project, and that the

24 Final EIR and the Erratum to the Final EIR reflected the independent judgment and analysis of the
CRA.

25 42.

26 Subsequently, on or about December 14, 2007, the CRA approved the Project, adopting
Resolution No. 7095 which adopted CEQA findings for the approval of the project, a statement of

27 overriding considerations, and a mitigation monitoring and reporting program. The City Council

28 approved the CRA's action to approve the Project on or about the December 14, 2007 as well.
43. On or about February 1, 2007 and May 2, 2007, Real Party in Interest Sunset & Gordon

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider

2 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.

70. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying a Final EIR that fails to adequately analyze
3 and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to:
4 a. Failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by rejecting reasonable
5 alternatives.

6 b. Failure to provide an adequate range of project objectives by adopting narrowly

7 defined project objectives directly based upon the Project's description,

9 by including 5 percent affordable housing units at the 'Very Low' income level.

C. Failure to adequately analyze the Project's environmental baseline and impact. 10 d. Failure to adequately describe the Project by adopting an unstable and uncertain 11 project description as the SEIR described the Project as requiring a list of
12 entitlements which "include, but may not be limited to" a general plan
13 amendment, vesting zone, height district change, among others."
14 e. Adoption of vague, unenforceable and deferred mitigation measures including

15 but not limited to:

16 1. Noise Mitigation Measures MM. F.-1.2 which requires that construction

17 operations be conducted "as far as possible from the nearest noise-
sensitive land uses and that barriers shall be utilized "to the maximum 18
extent possible" is impermissibly vague and unenforceable; 19
2. Noise Mitigation Measures MM. F.-1.3 which requires that the use of
20 construction equipment or construction methods "with the greatest peak
21 noise generation potential" shall be minimized "[t]o the maximum extent
22 feasible" is also impermissibly vague and unenforceable;
23 3. Land Use Mitigation Measure IV.H-7 which requires that the Project
24 "procure all necessary entitlements and land use approvals from the City

25 of Los Angeles Department of City Planning" is impermissibly vague,
defers mitigation measures to a later date and unenforceable; 26
4. Public Utilities Mitigation Measure IV.H-4-1 which requires that the 27
Project "develop a construction and demolition debris recycling program" 28

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

defers mitigation measures to a later date and is unenforceable as it sets -
no performance standards for the recycling program; 2
5. Public Utilities Mitigation Measure IV.H-4-2 which requires that the 3 Project "develop an operational project recycling plan" defers the
† 4o development of ; mitigation measure to a later date and is unenforceable

6. Public Services Mitigation Measure IV.J.1-2.1 which requires that the

7 Project develop a Construction Traffic Control / Management Plan defers
the development of a mitigation measure to a later date; 8
7. Public Services Mitigation Measure IV.J.1-3.2 which requires that the 9
Project "develop and implement a security plan" defers the development 10 of a mitigation measure to a later date; 11
8. Parking Mitigation Measure IV.K.2-1 which requires that the Project
12 "develop a Construction Parking Plan" defers the development of a
13 mitigation measure to a later date;
14 9. General Impact Categories Mitigation Measure IV.D-5 which requires

15 that the Project "prepare and submit an emergency response plan" defers
the development of a mitigation measure to a later date. 16
f. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts by 17
failing to account for the environmental impacts, including traffic, hazardous 18
materials and air quality, of the many other projects planned for the area. 19
g. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts on air quality by
20 among other things, severely underestimating the Project's mobile source air
21 quality and toxic air contaminant emissions.
22 h. Failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impact on greenhouse
23 gas emissions by among other things, underestimating the Project's mobile

24 source greenhouse gas emissions.
i. 25 Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on land use and
planning by failing to adequately review the Project's consistency with the City's 26
General Plan and the Hollywood Community Plan. 27

P j. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on noise by among

2 other things underestimating and failing to describe the noise impacts that would
likely be caused by the Project's construction and operations.
3 k. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on population,
† 4o housing and employment by failing to account for the gentrification and
displacement impacts of urban revitalization and failing to allocate adequate
housing towards below median income households to mitigate the Project's

7 gentrification impacts.

8 1. Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on transportation,

9 including traffic and circulation, by underestimating the Project's trips and

10 failing to analyze the Project's impacts on the State and local highway system.

m.
11 Failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impact on utilities by

12 underestimate the Project's demands on sewage capacity and electrical
infrastructure.
13 71. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents
14 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by

15 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and

16 purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings and Overriding

19 Considerations)
72.
20 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.
21 73. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of: project be supported
22 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide
23 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

24 74. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding
25 Considerations that are inadequate as a matter of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence

26 In the record, including but not limited to the following:

27 a. The determinations that certain environmental impacts would be less than

28 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
Project's significant effects on the environment.
-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

b. The determinations that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation

measures
2 that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the

3 Project were infeasible, including but not limited to the no-Project alternative
and the other alternatives examined in the EIR; and
4 C. The determinations that other environmental impact were significant and
5 unavoidable and had been mitigated to the extent feasible.

6 75. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

7 making determinations or adopting findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations that do not

8 comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly,

9 Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of CEQA: Failure To Revise and Recirculate)
76. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
12 herein.
13 77. CEQA requires that a lead agency recirculate an EIR prior to circulation when
14 significant new information is added to an environmental impact report.
15 78. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the Project's DSEIR even after

16 adding significant new information to the FSEIR, including but not limited to adding noise mitigation

17 measure MM F-1.6, public service mitigation measure MM J.1-1.1, traffic / transportation mitigation

18 measure MM K.1-3, traffic / transportation mitigation measure MM J.1-1.1 and modifying Project

19 Design features to address new, previously undisclosed noise, traffic and public service environmental
impacts.
20 79. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents
21 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by
22 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and
23 purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Violation of State Planning & Zoning Law; City General Plan & Hollywood Community Plan)

26 80. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

27 herein.

81.
28 As required by State Planning and Zoning Law, the City has a General Plan that governs
land use planning throughout the City.
-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P 82. The Hollywood Community Plan is integrated into the City's General Plan and applies

2 to the Project Site.
83.
3 The Project fails to comply with the objectives and mandates set forth in the City's

4 General Plan and the Hollywood Community Plan as the Project is inconsistent with the General

5 Plan's zoning, density limits, height limits, permitted floor-area-ratio for the Project Site as well as the

6 framework, air quality, conservation, housing, noise, open space, service systems / public recreation,

7 safety, traffic, circulation, mobility elements and other objectives of the General Plan and Hollywood
Community Plan.

8 84.

9 In particular, the the Hollywood Community Plan requires that the City prepare station
area master plans prior to permitting higher intensity development, such as the Proposed Project, in the

10 vicinity of Metro Rail stations. The Project Site is a mere six blocks from the Hollywood and Vine

11 Metro Rail Station, and therefore the City is barred from approving the Project Site's land use zoning

12 designations to allow higher density without having adopted a station area master plan.
85.
13 86. No station master plan has been developed for the Hollywood / Vine Metro Rail Station.

14 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

15 approving the Project. Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Violation of Subdivision Map Act; Consistenty with General Plan)

17 87.

18 herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

19 88. The Subdivision Map Act requires that a division of land as well as its proposed

20 improvement be consistent with applicable general and specific plans, that the site be physically

21 suitable for the type of development and proposed density of the proposed improvement, that the design

22 of or proposed improvement not cause substantial environmental damage or injure fish, wildlife, habitat

23 or otherwise cause serious public health problems and that the design of the division not conflict with
public easements.

24 89.

25 The Project's Tract Map is inconsistent with the Subdivision Map Act's requirements as

26 the Project's location and design is inconsistent with applicable general and specific plans as the
Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and the Hollywood Community Plan

27 90. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

28 approving the Project. Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.

herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

4
92.
5 The City Charter imposes minimum requirements on the scope of amendments to the

6 City's General Plan, requiring that amendments be submitted as to subject elements, parts of subject

7 elements or as to geographic areas with significant social, economic or physical identity.
93.

8 The Project included an amendment to the City's General Plan to redesignate the portion

9 of the Project Site located at 1528 - 1540 N. Gordon Street (Lots 17, 18 and 19 of the Bagnoli Tract 2)

10 from High Medium Residential to Regional Center Commercial ("Redesignated Area").
94.

11 The Redesignated Area lacks significant social, economic or physical identity and
therefore cannot properly be redesignated as part of an individual amendment to the City's General

12 Plan.

95.
13 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

14 approving the Project. Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.

24 with CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act, the Planning and Zoning Law, City Charter, Hollywood

25 Community Plan, and local land use ordinances and municipal codes;
