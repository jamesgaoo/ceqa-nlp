3 approval violates the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and state and local planning laws.
4 2. The Project amends the City and County of San Francisco's General Plan to establish a new specific
5 area plan known as the Central South of Market (SoMa) Area Plan, running from Second Street to Sixth
6 Street, and from Market Street to Townsend Street, excluding areas within the Downtown Plan area north
7 of Folsom Street; new zoning controls for this area, including drastically increased height limits in many
8 areas (e.g., from 40 feet to 270 feet, from 45 feet to 240 feet, from 65 feet to 130 feet, from 65 feet to 20 feet,
9 from 85 feet to 200 feet, from 85 feet to 400 feet); and the creation of a newly established Housing
10 Sustainability District for this area pursuant to California Government Code section 66201.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
8 (California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA))

9 26. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

10 27. In certifying the EIR and approving the Project, Respondents violated CEQA as described in a

11 number of comment letters submitted during the administrative process, including, without limitation, the

12 following letters and their attachments, which are incorporated herein by reference:

13 (a) February 13, 2017, comment letter on the DEIR from Lozeau Drury to Planning Commission

14 (Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017), attaching:

15 (1) February 13, 2017, letter from Terrell Watt (Watt, February 13, 2017);

16 (2) February 8, 2017, letter from Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise (SWAPE),

17 (SWAPE, February 8, 2017);

18 (3) February 13, 2017, letter from Daniel Smith (Smith, February 13, 2017);

19 (4) February 12, 2017, letter from Shawn Smallwood (Smallwood February 12, 2017).

20 (b) May 9, 2018, comment letter on the FEIR from Lozeau Drury to Planning Commission

21 (Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018), attaching:

22 (1) April 12, 2018, letter from Daniel Smith (Smith, April 12, 2018).

23 (c) June 8, 2018, notice of appeal and comment letter on the FEIR from Lozeau Drury to Board

24 of Supervisors (Lozeau Drury, June 8, 2018).

25 (d) August 31, 2018, supplemental appeal and comment letter on the FEIR from Lozeau Drury

26 to Board of Supervisors (Lozeau Drury, August 31, 2018), attaching:

27 (1) August 31, 2017, letter from SWAPE (SWAPE, August 31, 2017).

28 (e) October 18, 2018, comment letter on the FEIR from Lozeau Drury to Board of Supervisors

29 requesting recirculation of the EIR (Lozeau Drury, October 18, 2018).

30 28. In approving the Project, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA

1 because Respondents certified an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) that fails to include informationl
2 necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation, including information necessary
3 to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the Project's environmental impacts, the
4 effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the Project's significant environmental impacts, or the
5 feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant environmental impacts; because the EIR

6 fails to lawfully assess the Project's cumulative effects, because the EIR fails to use best available
7 information; because the FEIR fails provide good faith responses to comments on the DEIR; becausel
8 Respondents failed and refused to recirculate a revised draft EIR including said necessary information;
9 because, with respect to the findings required by CEQA at Public Resource Code section 21081, Respondent
10 City failed to make required findings, failed to support the findings made with substantial evidence, and
11 failed to disclose the analytic route showing how the evidence supports said findings. These violations of
12 CEQA include, without limitation, the legal errors described in the following paragraphs.
13 Environmental Setting
14 29. The EIR fails to adequately describe baseline conditions in the Project area. (See Lozeau Drury,
15 February 13, 2017, p. 7; Watt, February 13, 2017, pp. 7-9.)
16 Project Description
17 30. The EIR presents an inconsistent and inadequate project description because the Initial Study
18 describes an entirely different project than the EIR in a number of respects, including, without limitation:
19 (a) The EIR Project a has a vastly different geographic scope, populations and jobs projections,
20 and other elements than the Initial Study;
21 (b) The EIR Project has entirely different goals than the Initial Study;
22 (c) The EIR eliminates the mid-rise option that was favored by the Central Corridor Plan;
23 (d) The Initial Study and DEIR use out-of-date baseline data.
24 (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 9-14; Watt, February 13, 2017, pp. 4-7.)
25 31. With respect to many issues, including transportation, air quality, shadow impacts, and noise, the
26 DEIR relied on representations that later, specific building projects proposed within the Project area would
27 undergo additional "project level" CEQA review that tiers to the Project's programmatic EIR. But between
28 issuance of the Draft EIR and certification of the Final EIR, the City changed the Project by proposing to
29 designate it a Housing Sustainability District pursuant to AB 73, which exempts certain housing projects

from CEQA review. (See Government Code § 21155.11.)
(a) The City failed to recirculate a revised draft EIR to assess the new Project description,
3 including the effects of establishing the Central SoMa Housing Sustainability District; and
4 (b) The City failed to recirculate a revised draft EIR to revise its assessment of impacts that were
5 previously based on the assumption that later specific building projects proposed within the Project
6 area would undergo additional project level CEQA review.
7 (Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018, pp. 4-8.)
8 Alternatives

9 32. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze a range of reasonable alternatives. (See Lozeau Drury, February
10 13, 2017, pp. 42-46, SWAPE, February 8, 2017, pp. 8-10.)
11 33. The City's CEQA findings fail to adopt a feasible alternative (i.e., the Mid-Rise Alternative) that
12 would substantially reduce the Project's significant effects. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 28-
13 29, 42-46; Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018, pp. 11-12; Lozeau Drury, June 8, 2018, pp. 3-5; Lozeau Drury,
14 August 31, 2018, pp. 2; SWAPE, February 8, 2017, pp. 8-10.)
15 General Plan Consistency
16 34. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan and other|
17 applicable planning documents. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 15-18, Watt, February 13, 2017,
18 pp. 27-30.)
19 35. The EIR fails to discuss inconsistencies between the Project's goal of 33% affordable housing and
20 the Housing Element of the General Plan's goal of 57% affordable housing citywide.
21 Traffic Impacts
22 36. The EIR fails to lawfully evaluate the significance of the Project's traffic impacts for many reasons,
23 including, without limitation:
24 (a) The EIR failed to apply its own selected threshold of significance for traffic impacts using
25 per capita "vehicle miles traveled" (VMT) as a metric and failed to find this impact significant
26 despite admitting that the Project will cause increases in per capita VMT. (See Lozeau Drury,
27 February 13, 2017, pp. 19-20; Smith, February 13, 2017, pp 1-3; Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018, pp.
28 8-10; Smith April 12, 2018, pp. 1-2.)
29 (b) The EIR failed to consider whether Project-induced increases in total, as opposed to per
30 capita, "vehicle miles traveled" (VMT) is a significant adverse impact. (See Lozeau Drury, February

N April 12, 2018, pp. 1-2.)
3 (c) The EIR failed to consider whether Project-induced increases in traffic delay and congestion
4 at numerous street intersections and freeway access ramps represent significant adverse
5 environmental effects of the Project. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 20-21; Smith,
6 February 13, 2017, pp 3-4; Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018, pp. 8-10; Smith April 12, 2018, pp. 2-3.)
7 (d) The EIR fails to adequately describe baseline traffic conditions in the Project area. (See
8 Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, p. 7; Smith April 12, 2018, pp. 3-4.)
9 (e) The EIR failed to include in its analysis of transportation impacts, as measured by per capita
10 or total VMT, the substantial number of VMTs caused by the use of transportation network company
11 (TNC) (e.g., Uber and Lyft) vehicles in the area, a resulting in a substantial downward bias in the
12 EIR's VMT calculations. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 8-9; Watt, February 13, 2017,
13 p. 3; Lozeau Drury, May 9, 2018, pp. 8-10; Smith, April 12, 2018, pp. 7-8; Lozeau Drury, October
14 18, 2018.)
15 (f) On October 18, 2018, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority published a study
16 entitled "TNCs and Congestion," showing that the use of TNCs is responsible for 51% of traffic
17 congestion in the City. This study shows an even more extreme downward bias in the EIR's VMT
18 calculations than discussed in the previous paragraph. The City was required to but failed to
19 recirculate a revised draft EIR or to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR to assess the effect
20 on its analysis of all impacts that were based on VMTs or traffic delay, including transportation, air
21 quality, and noise impacts. (Lozeau Drury, October 18, 2018.)
22 (g) The EIR uses flawed thresholds of significance to exclude consideration of evidencel
23 supporting a fair argument that the Project may have significant adverse traffic safety impacts.
24 (Smith, February 13, 2017, p. 6-7.)
25 (h) The EIR fails to lawfully evaluate the significance of Project-induced parking impacts. (See
26 Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, p. 22.)
27 (i) The EIR's cumulative traffic impact analysis fails to include other closely related projects
28 whose effects will combine and interact with the effects of the Project. (See Lozeau Drury, February
29 13, 2017, p. 22; Smith, February 13, 2017, p. 6.)

6 39. The EIR and the City's CEQA's findings unlawfully defer the development of mitigation measures
7 that would substantially reduce the Project's significant impacts on public transit. (See Lozeau Drury,
8 February 13, 2017, pp. 38-39.)

program will 9 40. The EIR and the City's CEQA's findings unlawfully find that a "fee based"
10 substantially reduce the Project's significant impacts on public transit. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13,
11 2017, p. 39.)
12 Emergency Vehicle Access
13 41. The EIR fails to lawfully evaluate the significance of Project-induced impacts on emergency vehicle
14 access. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, p. 21; Smith, February 13, 2017, p. 8; Smith April 12, 2018,
15 pp. 6-7.)
16 Pedestrian Safety Impacts
17 42. The EIR fails to lawfully assess the significance of the Project's pedestrian safety impacts. (See

19 5-6.)
20 Air Quality Impacts
21 43. The EIR fails to lawfully evaluate the significance of the Project's air quality impacts for many
22 reasons, including, without limitation:
23 (a) The EIR's analysis of impacts related to criteria air pollutants (e.g., Impact AQ-2, Impact
24 AQ-3, Impact AQ-4, Impact AQ-5, Impact C-AQ-1, and Impact C-AQ-2) fails to include required
25 baseline information. (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 23-25; SWAPE, February 8, 2017,
26 pp. 2-4.)
27 (b) The EIR's analysis of cumulative impacts related to criteria air pollutants (e.g., Impact AQ-2,
28 Impact AQ-3, Impact AQ-4, Impact AQ-5, Impact C-AQ-1, and Impact C-AQ-2) fails to include
29 other closely related projects whose effects will combine and interact with the effects of the Project.

24 Id. at subd. (c). In particular, the major environmental issues raised when the lead agency's position is at
25 variance with recommendations and objections raised in the comments must be addressed in detail, giving
26 reasons why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. Id. There must be good faith, reasoned
27 analysis in response; conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. Id.
28 54. The City here failed to provide a detailed, written, good faith, reasoned analysis in response to
29 comments received on the draft EIR during the public comment period from individuals and responsible
30 agencies, and failed to give adequate reasons why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted.

P Instead, the City merely gave conclusory statements unsupported by factual information.
2 55. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by failing to proceed in
3 the manner required by CEQA.
Unsupported Findings And Statement Of Overriding Considerations
5 56. Under Public Resources Code section 21081, an agency may not approve project with significant
6 unavoidable impacts unless it finds, based on substantial evidence, that specific overriding economic, legal,
7 social, technological, or other benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
8 57. The EIR for the Plan identifies impacts as unavoidably significant, but the City's CEQA findings
9 pursuant to section 21081 that said significant impacts are unavoidable because no further mitigation is
10 feasible are erroneous as a matter of law or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
11 58. The EIR for the Plan identifies impacts as unavoidably significant, but the City's CEQA findings
12 pursuant to section 21081 that said significant impacts are acceptable based on a statement of overriding
13 considerations are erroneous as a matter of law, not adequately supported by findings, or not supported by
14 substantial evidence in the record.
15 59. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR by failing to proceed in
16 the manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are erroneous as a matter of law, not
17 adequately supported by findings, or not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
18 60. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will
19 suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this action.
20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (General Plan Consistency, Government Code § 65860; San Francisco Planning Code § 101.1)

22 61. Petitioners incorporate all prior allegations as if fully set forth.

23 62. The Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and other applicable planning documents

24 and the Project's amendments to the General Plan render the General Plan internally inconsistent, for many

25 reasons, including, without limitation:

26 (a) The Project is inconsistent with Policy 3.5 of the General Plan, which states, "Ensure that

27 growth will not outpace improvements to transit of the circulation system."

28 (b) The Plan is inconsistent with the Urban Design Element of the General Plan, and its Policy

29 3.5 ("Relate the height of buildings to important attributes of the city pattern and to the height and

30 character of existing development"); and Policy 3.6: (*Relate the bulk of buildings to the prevailing

scale of development to avoid an overwhelming or dominating appearance in new construction.")
2 (c) The Plan is inconsistent with the Recreation and Open Space Element of the General Plan,
3 Policy 1.9 ("Preserve sunlight in public open spaces").
4 (d) The Plan is also inconsistent with the General Plan Objective 9 ("Reduce)
5 transportation-related noise"), and Policy 11.1 (Discourage new uses in areas in which the noise level

6 exceeds the noise compatibility guidelines for that use").
7 (e) The Plan is inconsistent with the Western SoMa Plan, Policy 1.2.4 ("Prohibit housing outside)
8 of designated Residential Enclave Districts (RED) south of Harrison Street").
9 (See Lozeau Drury, February 13, 2017, pp. 15-18.)
10 63. The Project is inconsistent with the Housing Element of the General Plan's goal of 57% affordable
11 housing citywide.
12 64. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and will
13 suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested in this action.
14 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:
15 65. For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9 and Code of
16 Civil Procedure sections 1085 or 1094.5:

17 (a) Ordering Respondents to void their approval of the Project, including all of the approvals
18 listed in paragraphs 9 and 10 above;
19 (b) Ordering Respondents to take any other actions the Court finds necessary to bring its
20 determinations, findings, or decisions on the Project into compliance with CEQA and applicable
21 planning laws;
22 (c) Retaining the Court's jurisdiction over this matter until Respondents comply with the
23 peremptory writ of mandate.
24 66. For an order compelling Respondents to pay Petitioners' costs of suit.
25 67. For an order compelling Respondents to pay Petitioners' reasonable attorneys fees pursuant to Code
26 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
27 68. For such other relief as the Court may deem proper.
