2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Over strong public opposition and in violation of the California Environmental

4 Quality Act (CEQA), on January 22, 2019, the City of Los Angeles ("City") certified an

5 environmental impact report (EIR), approved a statement of overriding considerations, and

6 approved various entitlements for the Crossroads expansion project ("Project"). This massive

7 expansion project would demolish 84 units of existing rent stabilized housing. The Project

8 includes eight new mixed-use buildings with residential, hotel, commercial/retail, office,

9 entertainment, and restaurant uses, and a new stand-alone, one-story commercial/retail building

10 on the eastern edge of the Crossroads of the World complex in the Hollywood section of the

11 City.

12 2. The draft environmental impact report (DEIR) for the Project identified

13 significant impacts to the environment in the areas of traffic (construction and operations
14 phases), noise (construction and operations phases), and air quality (construction phase) as a
15 result of adding new facilities, remodeling existing facilities, and significantly intensifying the

16 use of the site. Despite significant community opposition, the Crossroads proponent sought and

17 ultimately was successful in obtaining City approval of a Project substantially increasing the

18 footprint of the built environment. The Project would increase density onsite beyond what is
19 normally allowed by over 35 percent by utilizing the State Density Bonus law.

20 3. In addition, the DEIR understated and improperly evaluated the impacts of the
21 proposed project on land use, traffic, noise, and air quality. The impacts of the proposed project

22 will significantly burden not only the nearby community, but also the entire Hollywood area of

23 Los Angeles as the Project adds to the cumulative effect of other development projects through

24 years of construction and ongoing increased use and activity. The cumulative impacts due to

25 past, current, and likely future projects were not adequately considered.

26 4. The Project fails to provide an amount of affordable housing that would allow the

27 City to comply with the requirements of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan. The
28 Redevelopment Plan requires that 15% of residential units built in the area be affordable units,

Printed on Recycled Paper 2 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
02

1 and 30% of units in projects assisted by the redevelopment agency be affordable. However, to
2 this point the City has failed on an areawide basis to provide the required number of affordable
3 units, falling short in production of low and moderate income units by 331 units in 2008 and

4 worsening that shortfall ever since. Its approval of the Project worsens that shortfall by
5 providing fewer affordable units than would be necessary to meet areawide affordable housing

6 goals.

7 5. Hollywood has been experiencing explosive development, which has led to

8 increased traffic, the demolition of historic buildings, and the destruction of existing affordable

( housing. The Project site includes the Crossroads of the World building, which is a designated
10 City Cultural-Historic Monument (Monument #134) and is also listed on the National Register
11 of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources. Other historic resources

12 currently located on the site include the former Hollywood Reporter Building, which is
13 designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, and the Bullinger
14 Building. Although, after facing significant pressure from the community, the Project applicant
15 finally modified the Project to retain or relocate some buildings, it will nonetheless demolish
16 the historically significant Selma-Las Palmas Courtyard Apartments. The Selma-Las Palmas
17 Courtyard Apartments ("Selma Apartments"), constructed around 1939, include 84 rent

18 stabilized units and are home to many families who have created a community there over
19 decades.

20 6. One of the options presented in the environmental review for the Project was
21 known as Alternative 5. This alternative would have supported additional growth while at the
22 same time preserving historic properties onsite including the historic Selma Apartments, which
23 have significant existing rent stabilized housing. However, Alternative 5 was not seriously
24 considered by the City's Planning Commission or City Council due to its alleged economic
25 infeasibility. Substantial evidence did not support this allegation of economic infeasibility.
26 Indeed, Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation submitted evidence and information
27 challenging the allegation of economic infeasibility during the administrative phase of the
28 project review.

Printed on Recycled Paper 3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
03

1 7. Because the City failed to provide adequate environmental review with full
2 disclosure of the Project's extensive adverse impacts, reviewable by the public, as required by

3 the California Environmental Quality Act, because it violated Planning and Zoning Law and

4 Community Redevelopment Law requirements for consistency of the Project with the

5 Community Redevelopment plan and provision of affordable housing, the City's approvals of

6 the Project must be set aside as an abuse of discretion.
JURISDICTION

8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

9 of Civil Procedure.

10 9. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

11 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

12 PARTIES

13 10. Petitioner Livable LA is an unincorporated association composed of concerned
14 residents seeking a positive future for Los Angeles through good land use planning,

15 environmental stewardship, transparent government, availability of affordable housing, and
16 community empowerment.

17 11. AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is nonprofit organization based in Los
18 Angeles providing cutting-edge medicine and advocacy to over 1,000,000 people in 41

19 countries. AHF is currently the largest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care in the U.S.
20 Generating new, innovative ways of treatment, prevention and advocacy has been the hallmark

21 of AHF's success. Since 1987, AHF has cared for thousands of people living with HIV and

22 AIDS worldwide. AHF creates and implements new programs in communities across the U.S.
23 and abroad, expanding delivery of healthcare and influencing policy with the aim of saving

24 more lives. Many of AHF's clients and patients are at risk of homelessness and are in very low,

25 low, or moderate income households that would qualify for affordable housing. Homelessness
26 and housing instability has a significant negative impact on health, especially for those who are

27 already chronically ill. AHF launched the Healthy Housing Foundation ("HHF*) to provide

28 decent housing units at an affordable cost to low-income people, including families with

Printed on Recycled Paper 4 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
04

children, and those previously unsheltered or homeless. AHF has purchased and rehabilitated a
2 string of properties in the Los Angeles area since October 2017 and has renovated them for

3 affordable housing.
12. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a political subdivision of the State of
California.

6 13. Respondent Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles (CRA/LA) is the

7 Successor Agency of the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles. CRA/LA is the
8 agency charged under Community Redevelopment Law and Dissolution Law of 2011 with

0 implementation of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan. CRA/LA was also responsible for
10 review and approval of site plan reviews within the Hollywood Redevelopment Area.' The

11 Hollywood Redevelopment plan in section 407.1.4 states "All development plans (whether

12 public or private) shall be subject to review and approval by the Agency." Hereinafter, unless
13 otherwise noted the term "the City" shall apply to the City of Los Angeles and the CRA/LA
14 jointly.

15 14. Real Party in Interest CRE-HAR Crossroads SPV, LLC is the applicant and
16 recipient of the approvals associated with the Project.

17 15. Real parties named as Does I to X are given fictitious names because their names
18 and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioner.

20 STATEMENT OF FACTS

21 The Project Site and Its Surroundings.
22 16. Upon buildout, the Project would include approximately 1,381,000 square feet

23 of floor area, consisting of 950 residential units, 308 hotel rooms, approximately 95,000 square
24 feet of office uses, and approximately 190,000 square feet of commercial/retail uses. The
25

26 The City of Los Angeles purported to modify the Municipal Code provision (Los Angeles

27 Municipal Code (LAMC) section 16.05.G) conveying jurisdiction on the CRA/LA to review site plan approval applications during the pendency of the Project application. However, CRA/LA
28 continues to be charged by Community Redevelopment Law with implementation of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan.

Printed on Recycled Paper 5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
05

1 proposed floor area ratio (FAR) would be approximately 3.81:1 averaged across the Project

2 Site. As such, the Project would result in a net increase of approximately 1,208,427 square feet
3 of floor area on-site. The Project design would impact the historic setting of the Crossroads of

4 the World complex by locating new buildings on various portions of the Project Site.

5 17. The Crossroads project will have severe adverse impacts on a historic area by
6 looming over and even destroying historic buildings. The net loss of permanent affordable and

7 rent stabilized housing in historic apartment buildings is sizable and unmitigated.
18. The Project site is currently populated by the buildings that were at the center
of Hollywood's Golden Age. The Crossroads of the World and former Hollywood Reporter
10 buildings are designated Los Angeles Cultural-Historic Landmarks. The site is also home to

11 the Bullinger Building and the century-old Fritz Cottage (dating to 1907), Major Kunkle
12 Bungalow (dating to 1910), Talbot-Wood Double Dwelling (dating to 1912).
13 19. The intense use associated with the Project could severely impede access to,
14 and exiting off of, the 101 Freeway, because Highland Avenue and Cahuenga are heavily
15 congested. The intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Highland Avenue is one of the worst
16 congested intersections in the City and that congestion would be made worse by the Project.
17 20. Significant and unavoidable Project impacts were identified with regard to
18 regional air quality emissions for construction and operation, demolition of historical resources,
19 on-site and off-site noise and vibration during construction, traffic intersection levels of service
20 during construction, and traffic on residential street segments during operation.
21 The Proposed Project Application Process.
22 21, On November 29, 2016, the Governor certified the Crossroads Project as an
23 Environmental Leadership Project under Public Resources Code sections 21182-21184. The

24 Project is subject to California Rules of Court Rule 3.2223. The person or entity that applied
25 for certification of the Project as a leadership project must, if the matter goes to the Court of
26 Appeal, make the payments required by Public Resources Code section 21183 (f).
27 22. In May 2017, the City released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR)
28 for the Crossroads Project.

Printed on Recycled Paper 6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
06

1 23. On July 25, 2017, Petitioner Livable LA submitted comments on the DEIR

2 detailing numerous inadequacies including but not limited to the analysis of traffic, historic
3 resources, affordable housing loss, greenhouse gas emissions, consistency with the Hollywood
4 Redevelopment Plan, an inadequate range of alternatives, excessive floor area ratio, and City

5 usurpation of redevelopment agency authority.

6 24. On May 4, 2018, the City provided notice of the availability of a final EIR.

7 25. On May 4, 2018, the City made available the Application for Environmental
8. Leadership Development Project for the Hollywood Center Project (Millenium project). This
9 Millenium project will have cumulative impacts with the proposed Crossroads Project that
10 should have been analyzed in the EIR.

11 26. On May 14, 2018, Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation submitted
12 comments on the Draft EIR objecting to the economic feasibility study for evaluation of the
13 Historic Preservation Alternative (Alternative 5).
14 27. On May 14, 2018, Petitioner Livable LA submitted additional comments on
15 the environmental impact report objecting to the addition of significant new information in the
16 errata released for the Project. Petitioner objected to the FEIR's failure to respond to Caltrans'
17 comments stating the analysis method in the EIR did not adequately analyze freeway impacts,
18 nor mitigate cumulative impacts on Caltrans facilities.
19 28. Petitioners objected to the newly created economic feasibility review for
20 rejection of Alternative 5, the Historic Preservation Alternative.
21 29. The Los Angeles Unified School District stated "Based upon a review of the
22 Draft EIR, the proposed project will have a significant impact on LAUSD schools." (FEIR, II-
23 80.) LAUSD's Hollywood High School and Selma Avenue Elementary School campuses
24 would be located within 0.25 mile of the proposed project Site. These significant impacts
25 would occur in the areas of air quality, noise, traffic, and pedestrian safety impacts. The
26 significant impacts on LAUSD schools, which were not identified in the Draft EIR, requires
27 recirculation of the EIR for public review to ensure the proposed mitigation measures actually
28 reduce the newly-identified significant impacts below a level of significance.

Printed on Recycled Paper 7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 07

30. In August 2018, an Errata to the EIR was released. This Errata included

2 significant new information including a revision to the proposed building mix on the project

3 site with a new parking structure.

4 31. During the pendency of the Project entitlement applications, there were
applications for Historic Cultural Monument (HCM) designation of four properties that were

6 identified as historically significant but would be demolished by the Project. (Cultural Heritage
7 Commission Case No. CHC-2018-1035-HCM, CHC-2018-1038-HCM, CHC-2018-1040-

8 HCM; CHC-2018-1042-HCM; Council File number 18-0465, 18-0499, 18-0500, and 18-0501.)

9 These buildings are: (1) the one-story vernacular house known as the "Fritz Cottage" at 1547-
10 49 McCadden Place (1907); (2) the Regency Revival courtyard apartment building complex,
11 known as the "Selma-Las Palmas Courtyard Apartments" at 6700 Selma Avenue and 1535-55
12 Las Palmas Avenue (1939); (3) the one-story, single-family house, known as the "Major
13 Kunkle Bungalow" at 1542 McCadden Place (1910); and (4) the two-story Craftsman style
14 duplex, known as the "Talbot-Wood Double Dwelling" at 1606-08 Las Palmas Avenue (1912).
15 (EIR Errata, p. 11.) All of them were orginally proposed to be demolished, though that
16 proposal was subsequently modified. These four cultural heritage nominations for buildings at

17 the Crossroads were brought by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and the Art Deco Society and
18 recommended by the Cultural Heritage Commission.

19 32. The Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee, chaired by
20 Councilmember Jose Huizar at that time, on August 21, 2018 decided to deny the HCM status
21 for these properties but there was no valid reason for that denial.

22 33. The City's Deputy Advisory Agency approved the tentative tract map for the
23 Project on August 15, 2018.
24 34. Petitioner Livable LA appealed this approval to the City Planning
25 Commission on August 23, 2018.

26 35. The City Planning Commission approved the Project including a tract map,
27 site plan review, and master conditional use permit at its hearing on September 13, 2018. Its
28 decision was mailed on October 31, 2018.

Printed on Recycled Paper 8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 08

1 36. On November 8, 2018, Petitioner Livable LA appealed the Planning
2 Commission's approval of the Project to the City Council.
37. On December 4, 2018, Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation objected to the

4 approval of the Project and certification of the environmental impact report and joined the
comments and objections of Livable LA.

6 38. The City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee
("PLUM") heard the appeals on January 15, 2019.
39. The City Council heard the appeals and approved the Project on January 22,

9 2019.

10 40. The City Council approved the Tract Map, Site Plan Review, and CUP and
11 certified the EIR for the Project.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

13 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

14 41. Petitioners objected to the Project in the administrative process and fully
15 exhausted their administrative remedies. Petitioners submitted letters and testified during
16 public hearings for the Project during the comment period raising the issues set forth herein.
17 42. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
18 law unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence
19 of such remedics, Respondent's approval of the Project would form the basis for a development
20 project that would proceed in violation of state law.

21 43. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
22 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
23 Exhibit A.

24 44. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
25 providing the City of Los Angeles with notice of its intention to commence the action. A copy

26 of that notice is attached as Exhibit B.

27 45. Petitioners elect to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
28  attached as Exhibit C.

Printed on Recycled Paper 9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 09

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION P

2 (VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)
m 46. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

4 47. Affordable Housing Loss Was Insufficiently Mitigated.

5 48. A project's contemplated loss of housing, particularly affordable or low-income
6 housing, can pose a potentially significant impact that must be considered under CEQA. (See

7 Concerned Citizens of S. Cent. L.A. v. LAUSD (1994) 24 Cal. App. 4th 826; Sacramento Old

8 City Assn. v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal. App. 3d 1011, 1038-39 [indicating that loss of
9 housing can constitute a potentially significant impact necessitating adequate mitigation
10 measures.]) CEQA requires analysis of, and mitigation for, the displacement and disruption of
11 existing communities.

12 49. The proposed Project demolishes existing "affordable" housing as 84 units of
13 housing in historic buildings (the Selma Las Palmas Apartments) that will be demolished.
14 50. The Project must provide replacement for the loss of affordable Rent Stabilization
15 Ordinance (RSO) housing, as the RSO can only apply to structures built and occupied prior to
16 1978. However, the Project does not provide a replacement for all 84 units of RSO housing.
17 51. Consistency with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan Was Not Ensured.

18 52. "[T]he requirement of consistency is the linchpin of California's land use and
19 development laws. It is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth with the
20 force of law." (Debottari v. City of Norco (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.) A

21 redevelopment plan must be consistent with the general plan and proposed projects must be

22 consistent with both.

23 53. The Project must be consistent with the Hollywood redevelopment plan. The
24 Project does not meet Hollywood Redevelopment Plan goals (9), (10), (11), (12), and (16).
25 These Hollywood redevelopment plan goals include the following (emphasis added):

26 (9) Provide housing choices and increase the supply and improve the quality of housing

27 for all income and age groups, especially for persons with low and moderate incomes;

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE Printed on Recycled Paper 10 10

and to provide home ownership opportunities and other housing choices which meet the

2 needs of the resident population.

m (10) Promote the development of sound residential neighborhoods through mechanisms
such as land use, density and design standards, public improvements, property
rehabilitation, sensitive in-fill housing, traffic and circulation programming, development
of open spaces and other support services necessary to enable residents to live and work
6 in Hollywood.
(11) Recognize, promote and support the retention, restoration and appropriate reuse of
8 existing buildings, groupings of buildings and other physical features especially those
9 having significant historic and/or architectural value and ensure that new development is

10 sensitive to these features through land use and development criteria.

11 (12) Support and encourage a circulation system which will improve the quality of life in

12 Hollywood, including pedestrian, automobile, parking and mass transit systems with an
emphasis on serving existing facilities and meeting future needs. ...
13

14 (16) To the maximum extent feasible, seek to build replacement housing within the
15 Project Area prior to the destruction or removal of dwelling units which house low and
16 moderate income people. ...

17
54. The Project is not consistent with the redevelopment plan that requires 30% of 18

19 all new housing construction involving the CRA/LA to be reserved for "affordable" and 14% of
that for "very low income." The redevelopment plan further requires that at least fifteen percent 20 (15%) of all new or rehabilitated units developed within the Project Area by public or private 21 entities or persons other than the Agency shall be for persons and families of low or moderate
22 income; and of such fifteen percent, not less than forty percent (40%) thereof shall be for very
23 low income households. The Project does not meet, nor does it sufficiently assist the City in
24 meeting, the required housing targets.
25
55. The City relied upon inadequate analysis and mitigation of impacts as it 26 approved the Project.
27

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

1 56. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

2 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal.

3 Code Regs. § 15004).

4 57. CEQA imposes upon the City a clear, present and mandatory duty to certify an

5 EIR only if the EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may

6 occur. The EIR for the Project lacks the necessary analysis, including but not limited to, details

7 of the substantially modified project, analysis of the impacts thereof, and of possible alternativesl

8 and mitigation measures. Further, CEQA requires adoption of all feasible mitigation measures

9 that will reduce adverse environmental impacts. Many feasible mitigation measures were
ignored in the EIR.
10

11 58. Traffic impacts were inadequately analyzed and mitigated.

12 59. In connection with the relatively nearby Millennium Project, the California

13 Department of Transportation (Caltrans) opined that the US-101 Freeway, which operates at

14 Level of Service (LOS) F in this area, would be further hurt by the massive project within

15 blocks of the US-101. Because Crossroads is regionally significant in the same way the

16 Millennium Project is, Petitioners incorporated all of Caltrans' comments by reference for the

17 Crossroads project and requested the City to respond to them as such. The City failed to provide

18 an adequate response.

19 60. Crossroads is proposed several blocks south of the US-101, and to the west of

20 the Millennium. The Sunset/Highland area where Crossroads would be built includes numerous

21 feeder surface streets of traffic trying to get to the busiest US-101 north/south ramp in

22 Hollywood, which is on Highland next to the Hollywood Bowl. The backup of traffic on

23 Highland, waiting to get on the US-101, backs up well south of Sunset much of the time, rush

24 hour or not.

25 61. The Project is also close enough to the Cahuenga to US-101 Freeway entrance

26 and exit ramps to contribute significant traffic and create significant impacts to them. The EIR

27 should have addressed these impacts, and how to reduce them, including a reduction in the size

28 of the Project. The FEIR fails to adequately address the objections Caltrans raised regarding

Printed on Recycled Paper 12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 12

1 the Project's impacts to the US-101 Freeway. Caltrans stated the CMP methodology used in
2 the EIR is "not adequate when analyzing freeway impacts." (FEIR, II-63.) Rather than use an

3 adequate methodology, the FEIR responds that an October 2013 Freeway Analysis Agreement
4 somehow absolves the City from conducting adequate analysis. It does not. Caltrans'
5 objections identify a significant issue that has not been mitigated.

6 62. Caltrans further requested a Traffic Mitigation Agreement be signed prior to
7 circulation of the Final EIR. (FEIR, p. II-65.) However, the FEIR stated the City does not view

8 such an agreement as a defensible mitigation measure. Nonetheless, the City claims "a
9 significant unavoidable cumulative impact on Caltrans facilities would occur." (FEIR, p. II-66.)
10 The City could not adopt statement of overriding considerations for cumulative traffic impacts
11 when feasible mitigation measures such as the traffic mitigation agreement have not been
12 adopted. (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.)

13 63. The size of the Project should have been reduced to reduce the impacts to
14: Caltrans facilities. (FEIR, p. II-277.) However, the FEIR fails to address this feasible
15 mitigation measure.

16 64. Traffic Engineer Robert Kahn identified a number of issues related to the on-

17 site site plan, traffic impact analysis, significantly impacted intersections, mitigation program,

18 impacts from the new stand-alone parking structure, residential street segment impact analysis,

19 and construction impacts as it affects the local area that were insufficiently analyzed and

20 mitigated. The City did not address these comments.

21 65. The Community Redevelopment Agency, i.e., the City, was obliged under the

22 Redevelopment Plan to cease development activities and provide credible traffic and mobility

23 mitigation measures after development in the Regional Center reached an FAR of 2:1.

24 Development has reached and surpassed that point. Hollywood Heritage objected to the failure

25 to meet this obligation in a letter dated November 23, 2015.

26 Air Quality impacts were inadequately analyzed and mitigated.

27 66. SCAQMD staff recommended "additional mitigation measures to further

28 reduce construction and operational emissions, particularly from NO." (FEIR, p. II-87.) The

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 13

1 FEIR improperly refused to adopt such measures or explain the reasons they would not be
2 adopted. The FEIR incorrectly states the requirement to adopt all feasible mitigation measures
3 "is not a requirement in CEQA." (FEIR, II-89.)

4 67. Deborah Stevens of Environmental Audit Inc. identified a number of

5 deficiencies in the air quality analysis in the EIR. She stated construction emissions were
6 underestimated, the LST analysis is incorrect, mitigation measures provided in the EIR are
7 inadequate, the cumulative air quality impact analysis is inadequate, and the health risk analysis
8 is inadequate. The City did not address these comments.

9 68. Greenhouse Gas Emission Analysis and Mitigation are Insufficient.
10 69. The EIR sets forth an analysis that depends on a "No Implementation of
11 Energy Reduction Measures (NIERM)" scenario. (EIR Page IV.C-38.) This approach is
12 misleading and no better than the "Business as Usual" scenario adopted by Newhall Ranch in
13 Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish and Wildlife, discussed at EIR page
14 IV.C-23. Basing an analysis on a comparison to a situation that is not legally permissible
15 creates an illusory baseline for comparison. Instead, the EIR should have addressed the
16 comparison of the existing environment to the increases in emissions associated with the
17 Project, and how those emissions could be reduced.

18 70. Greenhouse gas emission can be reduced by energy usage reductions.
19 Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines requires an analysis of energy usage of a project. The
20 EIR did not adequately consider the energy usage of the Project, including the energy that can
21 be saved by rehabilitating existing buildings compared to that which will be used to demolish
22 existing buildings and construct new buildings onsite.

23 71. The FEIR's attempt to take credit for measures that must be implemented in
24 any case is misleading. The baseline scenario must assume these legally required mitigation
25 measures will be implemented.

26 72. The FEIR states the project will "not result in any net additional GHG
27 emissions . . . . with the purchase of emission offset credits.» (FEIR, p. II-283.) The Project
28 must avoid additional GHG emissions through reduction of emissions and implementation of

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 14

1 measures to avoid creating new emissions. Reducing the size of the Project would have

2 reduced its emissions.

3 73. Land use impacts would be significant but were not acknowledged.

4 74. Under the CEQA Guidelines, a project may have a significant impact on land
use if it "conflict[s] with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with
jurisdiction over the project ... adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an

7 environmental effect." The City of Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide elaborates that a

8 proposed project must be evaluated for consistency with land use policies by comparison to the

9 policies in the relevant Community Plan. The City of Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide
10 also contains parameters to evaluate land use consistency of a proposal, including the extent of
11 the area that would be impacted, nature and degree of impacts, type of land use, and the number

12 and type of "secondary impacts" to surrounding land uses from the proposed project. The
13 proposed project has significant impacts both under the metric of consistency and compatibility.

14 75. Historic and Cultural Resource Values are Insufficiently Protected.
15 76. The EIR claims the demolition of historic buildings would be significant and
16 cannot be avoided. This conclusion is false as demolition could be avoided with a redesign of

17 the proposed Project. The City adopted a statement of overriding considerations to allow the
18 demolition of the historic buildings. (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.) However, such a
19 statement may not be adopted where there are feasible alternatives and mitigation measures

20 which will avoid the significant impact.

21 77. The original configuration of the proposed Project would demolish existing
22 historic buildings on the site. a These buildings include a 1907 1-story vernacular at 1547-49
23 McCadden, and a 1910 Craftsman at 1542 McCadden, a 2-story commercial block at 6683
24 Sunset (1923), a 2-story Craftsman at 1606-08 Las Palmas (1912), and the Hollywood Reporter
25 Building at 6713 Sunset. The 1907, 1910, and 1912 structures are among the oldest in
26 Hollywood, and this population has been disappearing at a rapid rate throughout the former
27 CRA area and in other parts of the Community Plan area over the past several years. The
28 Selma Las Palmas apartments are a collection of prewar apartments that serviced the Golden

Printed on Recycled Paper 15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

1 Age of Hollywood in the 20s, 30s, and 40s. Therefore, the Project would demolish prime

2 examples of several periods of significance in the Hollywood core.

3 78. Late in the process, the City purported to require protection of the 1606 Las

4 Palmas and 1542 McCadden buildings through relocation. The Project was also modified to
preserve the Hollywood Reporter Building. However, the Project would still demolish three 2-

6 story 1939 Regency Revival courtyard apartments buildings (6700 Selma, 1535-55 Las
Palmas).
79. These Selma Las Palmas apartments are home to numerous tenants in rent

9 stabilized housing. At least 84 units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) would
10 be demolished.

11 80. The proposed Project has impacts to Crossroads of the World. While the

12 complex is not being demolished, it is being altered. This will diminish the integrity of a
13 significant designated landmark, the Crossroads of the World which has National Register and
14 Cultural Heritage designations.

15 81. Alternatives Are Inadequately Analyzed.
16 82. An analysis of alternatives to a proposed project is a critical component of an
17 EIR. The alternatives analysis is particularly important where it may demonstrate that a

18 feasible alternative has fewer impacts than a proposed project. Where there is a better

19 alternative environmentally, the project proponent must present evidence that costs and profits
20 lost are so severe as to make the project impractical. The alternatives analysis serves an

21 important purpose in providing the reviewing agency adequate information about feasible
22 means to avoid impacts and gives the public a clear window into governmental decisionmaking
23 about environmental impacts. The alternatives section has been described as the "core" of the
24 EIR (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564), and an
25 adequate EIR must describe a reasonable range of alternatives. (Laurel Heights Improvement
26 Association v. Regents of the University of California (1993) 47 Cal.3d 376.)

27 83. The EIR should have analyzed a modified version of Alternative 5, the
28 "preservation" alternative. Rehabilitation and reuse of historic structures was feasible. The

Printed on Recycled Paper 16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
16

1 DEIR says that Alternative 5 is actually more impactful than other alternatives because it does

2 not rehabilitate the structures. This is specious and presents a false dichotomy. An alternative
3 that includes rehabilitation of structures should have been analyzed.

4 84. The FEIR claimed that late-prepared economic analysis done after the draft

5 EIR was released for review showed Alternative 5 cannot provide the financial ability to

6 rehabilitate five on-site historical resources. (FEIR, p. II-13.) The evidence presented in the

7 Economic Feasibility Review-Crossroads Hollywood and Peer Review in Appendix FEIR-2

8 of the Final EIR did not provide sufficient evidence to support a claim of economic
9 infeasibility. As found by independent economic analysis submitted by Aaron Chowla, this
10 conclusion is defective for several reasons including: the "estimated land cost" should have
11 been lower than provided; estimated construction costs for Alternative 5 have an unreasonably
12 high markup for general allowances and soft costs; the Feasibility Review improperly assumes
13 losing 2/3 of useable space due to historic preservation (1,432,500 SF for original project
14 compared to 474,018 SF for historic preservation); the Feasibility Review underestimates the
15 Lease/SF revenue associated with a historic preservation alternative; and the Feasibility Review
16  model assumes no debt financing with beneficial tax breaks and a higher return on equity a
17 developer could receive under Alternative 5. Furthermore, the assumptions in the FEIR's
18 economic analysis failed to account for rehabilitation cost savings that could be realized
19 through application of the Historical Building Code.
20 85. The Project proponent did not present its pro formas or other meaningful
21 evidence of the economic infeasibility of an alternative that would preserve the historic
22 properties. Therefore, the Project should not have been approved on the basis of a statement of
23 overriding considerations pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21081.
24 86. The City had insufficient evidentiary basis to reject Alternative 5 as an
25 infeasible alternative.

26 87. Recirculation of the EIR Was Required.
27 88. An EIR must be revised and recirculated when significant new information
28 becomes available. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5.) Furthermore, recirculation is required

Printed on Recycled Paper 17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 17

when "[a] new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from a new

2 mitigation measure proposed to be implemented" or "[a] substantial increase in the severity of
an environmental impact would result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the

4 impact to a level of insignificance." (Ibid.)
89. When a lead agency adds "significant new information" to an EIR after the

6 public has reviewed the Draft EIR but before the agency certifies the EIR, the agency must
7 pursue an additional round of consultation by recirculating the revised Draft EIR to the public.
8 (Pub. Resources Code § 21092.1.) New information is "significant" if, a as a result of the

9 additional information, "the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful
10 opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a
11 feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.
12 Regents of Univ, of California (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112, 1129, CEQA Guidelines, Cal.Code
13 Regs., tit. 14, § 15088.5, subd. (a).)

14 90. The FEIR stated the Modified Project includes "the addition of Development
15 Parcel E, which would be located at the terminus of Cherokee Avenue at Selma Avenue... for
16 the construction of a stand-alone parking structure north of the Blessed Sacrament Church."

17 (FEIR, p. II-272.) Because this new structure was not included in the Draft EIR, its potentially
18 significant impacts on traffic, air quality, and noise among other impacts, should have been

19 disclosed in a recirculated EIR.

20 91. The addition of a parking structure and other changes to the project required
21 recirculation.

22 92. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are
23 Unsupported by Substantial Evidence.
24 93. CEQA permits a project with significant adverse environmental impacts to be
25 approved if the lead agency makes findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the
26 project's benefits will outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation
27 measures or less damaging alternatives available.
28 94. Because it bas significant impacts even after mitigation, disapproval of the

Printed on Recycled Paper 18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 18

Project is required unless there are no feasible mitigation measures or alternatives, and specific

2 benefits outweigh the significant impact. (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.) That is because
3 CEQA requires public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects

4 when feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects.
(Pub. Resources Code § 21002; Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (6th Dist. 1990) 222

6 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)
95. The Legislature has stated:

9 The Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that public agencies

10 should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
11 environmental effects of such projects. . . . The Legislature further finds and declares
that in the event specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such
12 project alternatives or such mitigation measures, individual projects may be approved in
13 spite of one or more significant effects thereof. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.)

14 96. CEQA mandates that:
15

16 Pursuant to the policy stated in Sections 21002 and 21002.1, no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an environmental impact report has been
17 certified which identifies one or more significant effects on the environment that would

18 occur if the Project is approved or carried out unless both of the following occur:

19 (a). (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives
20 identified in the environmental impact report.
21

22 (Pub. Resources Code § 21081.) The Guidelines that implement CEQA restate this requirement.
(Guidelines § 15091 (a)(3).) Feasible mitigation measures were not identified, a reasonable
23 range of alternatives was not considered, and the alternatives that were included were analyzed
24 and rejected arbitrarily.
25 97. The findings that there are no feasible less environmentally damaging
26 alternatives to the Project and that all feasible mitigation measures were required for the Project

27 are not supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the Statement of Overriding Considerations

28 lacks substantial evidence, in violation of CEQA.

(VIOLATIONS OF PLANNING AND ZONING LAW AND COMMUNITY 3
REDEVELOPMENT LAW REQUIREMENTS.) 4 98. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained
5 in the previous paragraphs.
6 99. The City failed to require that the Project provide an amount of affordable
7 housing necessary to meet the requirements of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan and
8 Community Redevelopment Law.
9 100. The Project must be consistent with the general plan and with the
10 redevelopment plan. (Govt. Code § 65300.5; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. County v.
11 Board of Supervisors, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336.) A project is inconsistent if it conflicts
12 with a plan policy that is fundamental, mandatory, and clear. (Families Unafraid to Uphold
13 Rural Etc. County V. Board of Supervisors, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th. at pp. 1341-1342.)
14 101. The Government Code mandates that if a proposed tentative map is
15 inconsistent with General Plan policies the City "shall deny approval" of it. (Govt. Code §
16 66474.)

17 102. In the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area, the Redevelopment Plan requires
18 that all project proponents, whether public or private, provide at least 15% affordable units in

19 proposed housing development. If the Redevelopment Agency is participating in the project,

20 then the requirement for inclusion of affordable housing increases to 30%.

21 103. The requirement for the provision of affordable housing is fundamental,

22 mandatory, and clear. The Redevelopment Plan states:

23 At least thirty percent (30%) of all new or rehabilitated dwelling units developed within 24 the Project Area by the Agency, if any, shall be for persons and families of low or
25 moderate income; and of such thirty percent, not less than fifty percent (50%) thereof shall be for very low income households.
26 At least fifteen percent (15%) of all new or rehabilitated units developed within the
27 Project Area by public or private entities or persons other than the Agency shall be. for persons and families of low or moderate income; and of such fifteen percent, not less than
28 forty percent (40%) thereof shall be for very low income households.

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 20 20

(Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, P. 17, section 410.4, emphasis added.)
2

3 104. In addition to the Redevelopment Plan requirements, Community

4 Redevelopment Law requires 30% and 15% set asides. (Govt. Code section 33413 subds. (b) (1)

5 and (b)(2)(A)(i).) The Supreme Court has noted the Legislature has explicitly required that new

6 Fesidential development in redevelopment areas include affordable units. (California Building

7 Industry Assn. V. City of San Jose (2015) 61 Cal.4th 435, 445-446.)
105. The Project would include 950 units of residential housing, but is proposed

9 with a mere 105 (11%) affordable units. It would also demolish 84 units of rent stabilized

10 housing that should have been preserved to comply with the City's municipal code and relevant
community plan.
11 106. To comply with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan's and Municipal Code's
12 minimum requirements, the Project must provide at least 15% affordable units (143 units), or
13 30% affordable units (286 units) to the extent the CRA/LA is providing funding that assists the
14 Project.
15 107. In addition, the City should have provided a right of return for tenants who
16 would be displaced from their current residences subject to the rent stabilization ordinance
17 (RSO).
18 108. On an areawide basis, the City has fallen short of its obligation to produce
19 low/moderate income units and has a deficit of at least 331 Low/Moderate Income Units
20 according to page 32 of the May 15, 2008 "5-Year Implementation Plan (2009-2013)."
21 Therefore, whether the project is considered alone or as part of an areawide requirement, the
22 City fails to meet its obligations to produce sufficient low/moderate income units. By setting
23 aside only 11% Very Low Income units, the Project is failing to produce the required amount of
24 affordable units, and is not producing any low or moderate income units at all.
25 109. In the Vesting Tract Map staff report, the City Planning department incorrectly
26 claimed the Project to be consistent with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan because it is not
27 required to supply 30% affordable units. CRA-LA provides substantial funding for area
28 improvements that assist the Project in the form of community facilities and public

Printed on Recycled Paper 21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 21

*

1 improvements. For example, between 1990 and 2003, the CRA-LA spent over $5 million on

2 streetscape improvements. During that time, one of its stated five year goals was to "Complete

3 Hollywood Crossroads Project." Therefore, the Project must be regarded as being developed

4 "by the Agency" within the meaning of section 410.4 to the extent such funding benefits it and it

5 should have provided at least 30% affordable units. While the Project purports to set aside

6 some units for Very Low Income persons and families, it does not set aside any at all for low or

7 moderate income persons or families.
110.
8 The City Improperly Relied Upon an Outdated General Plan to Support
lits Consistency Findings.
9 111.
10 To be legally adequate, the mandatory elements of the general plan must meet
the minimum requirements contained in state law. (Buena Vista Gardens Apartments Ass'n v.
11 City of San Diego (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 289, 298; Twain Harte Homeowners Ass'n v. County
12 of Tuolumne (1982) 138 Cal.App. 3d 664, 699.) The land use element must include standards of
13 population density based on accurate and reasonably current numbers of people and building
14 intensity. (Govt. Code section 65302 subd. (a) ["The land use element shall include a statement
15 of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended for the various
16 districts and other territory covered by the plan.")) Because the current Hollywood Community
17 Plan contains woefully outdated population projections and densities, it cannot serve as a valid a
18 a basis for a finding of consistency with the general plan. In Camp v. Board of Supervisors (1981)
19 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348, the court held it was not possible to approve development project
20 because appropriate general plan consistency findings could not be made using a general plan
21 that did not meet state requirements for adequacy.
22 112. The Hollywood Community Plan (HCP) has not been updated in a legal way
23 since the 1980s. Although the City attempted to update the HCP several years ago, that HCP
24 amendment was struck down in Court as a violation of Government Code consistency
25 requirements. The Los Angeles Superior Court, the Honorable Judge Goodman presiding,

26 found that the Hollywood Community Plan as proposed by the City at that point was

27 "fundamentally flawed." (https://patch.com/california/hollywood/judge-rues-hollywood-
28 community-plan-fundamentally-flawed.) This case is Fix the City V. City of Los Angeles, Los

Printed on Recycled Paper 22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 22

1 Angeles Superior Court case number BS138580. The present case is related to case number

2 BS138580. Until the new HCP, under review at the time of Project approval, was adopted in a

3 legally sufficient manner, the City could not make a consistency finding with the HCP because

4 the HCP is based on outdated information and assumptions about population growth and

5 density. Therefore, the City could not legally approve the Crossroads Project until after an

6 updated HCP was validly adopted. No updated HCP has yet been adopted.
113.
7 In response to Petitioner's objections that the Project site is mapped as subject

8 to liquefaction in the City's General Plan, the FEIR states that the General Plan Safety

9 Element's classification of the Project sites as "susceptible to liquefaction" is "outdated" and

10 proceeds to state various sources that have not identified the Project site as subject to

11 liquefaction, (FEIR, p. II-20.) However, the General Plan is the authoritative source for
information, not to be overruled by a zoning map or imprecise State of California map 12 referenced in the FEIR. The General Plan is the "constitution for future development" and is
13 located at the top of "the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use." (DeVita v.
14 County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773.) The FEIR seeks to sweep liquefaction issues under
15 the rug by claiming the area is not in a liquefaction hazard zone. (FEIR, p. II-21.)
16 114. The EIR's treatment of land use consistency is inadequate because of its failure
17 to address the General Plan Safety Element's identification of the susceptibility to liquefaction
18 other than by saying it is outdated. The FEIR revealed a potentially significant impact that
19 requires recirculation of the EIR so the public and public agencies may evaluate why the FEIR
20 asserts the City's General Plan Safety Element is incorrect. Construction in an area subject to
21 liquefaction exacerbates those risks.
22 115. The City improperly usurped redevelopment agency authority to review
23 and approve the Project.
24 116. Hollywood Redevelopment Plan section 407.1.4 states (with emphasis added)
25 "All development plans (whether public or private) shall be subject to review and approval by
26 the Agency [the CRA]. All development in the Project Area must conform to this
27 Redevelopment Plan."

117. Contrary to the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, the City failed to ensure the

2 CRA reviewed and approved the Project. The CRA failed to review and approve the Project.

3 118. Los Angeles Municipal Code section 16.05.G formerly required the CRA to

4 assume lead agency responsibilities for environmental review of all projects that required site
plan review. The City of Los Angeles during the pendency of Project application review

6 modified this section of the Municipal Code to remove CRA authority to review projects in the

7 Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area that require site plan review, including the Project.
119.
8 The City violated the Health and Safety Code as it took certain land use
functions from the CRA/LA, but did not assume all CRA/LA's land use authority and
responsibility.
10

11 120. Health and Safety Code Section 34173 subdivision (i) provides:

12 At the request of the city, county, or city and county, notwithstanding Section 33205, all
13 land use related plans and functions of the former redevelopment agency are hereby

14 transferred to the city, county, or city and county that authorized the creation of a redevelopment agency; provided, however, that the city, county, or city and county shall
15 not create a new project area, add territory to, or expand or change the boundaries of a

16 project area, or take any action that would increase the amount of obligated property tax (formerly tax increment) necessary to fulfill any existing enforceable obligation beyond
17 what was authorized as of June 27, 2011.

18 (Emphasis added.)
121.
19 Health and Safety Code Section 34173 subdivision (i) provides the sole means
by which the City may lawfully attempt to assume land use authority of the former
20 redevelopment agency, which authority was exercised by the CRA/LA as the lawful successor
21 agency. As of now, redevelopment plans are slated to remain in effect until their scheduled
22 expiration years from now, and the CRA/LA will be responsible for exercising that significant

23 land use authority, unless or until the City of Los Angeles assumes all of that authority and

24 responsibility under Section 34173. The City of Los Angeles has not properly assumed all of

25 that authority and responsibility.
122.
26 Nevertheless, the City of Los Angeles is responsible for ensuring the
production of adequate affordable housing in the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area and
27 maintaining consistency of approved projects with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan.

123. There can only be one "lead agency" under CEQA. Whenever a project 'is to

2 be carried out or approved by more than one public agency, one public agency shall be

3 responsible for preparing an EIR or negative declaration for the project. This agency shall be
called the lead agency.'"* (City of Redding v. Shasta County Local Agency Formation Com.
(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1169, 1174, quoting CEQA § Guidelines § 15050, subd. (a).)
124. The agency that should have performed project review and prepared the
6 environmental documents for Site Plan Review in redevelopment plan areas is the CRA/LA.
Thus, the CRA/LA is the "lead agency" under CEQA. Moreover, the CRA/LA fulfills the
definition of lead agency under CEQA in part by virtue of its expertise and function in

9 approving projects in the Redevelopment Area. The land-use authorities in the Redevelopment

10 Plans remain in effect and continue to be administered by the CRA/LA.

12 yet adopted in Council File number 13-1482-S3 an action called "Unexpired Redevelopment

13 Use Authority." Because the City had not yet transferred land use authority from the CRA/LA
14 to the City Council when it purported to approve the Project on January 22, 2019, it acted
15 without jurisdiction and its approval was void.

21 126. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained

22 in the previous paragraphs.

23 127. Redevelopment agencies were created by local legislative bodies in

24 accordance with the State Community Redevelopment Law ("CRL"). (Health & Safety Code

25 §§ 33101-33105.) Redevelopment agencies were established to eliminate blight and increase

26 the supply of housing in a manner that cannot be accomplished by private enterprises alone.

27 (Health & Safety Code §§ 33030, 33037, 33320.1.) Agencies designated one or more

28 redevelopment project areas, each governed by its own redevelopment plan, to accomplish

Printed on Recycled Paper 25 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 25

1 eradication of blight. (Health & Safety Code §§ 33320.1, 33322, 33367.)

2 128. To increase the supply of housing, the CRL requires the inclusion of affordable

3 housing units when a redevelopment agency or other entity develops any new housing, or

4 substantially rehabilitates existing housing, within the project area. A percentage of these units

5 must be available and affordable to, and actually occupied by, households with very low, low

6 and moderate incomes. (Health & Safety Code § 33413 subd. (b).)
129.
7 The CRL also requires that any affordable housing units that were demolished

8 as part of redevelopment activities have to be replaced. (Health & Safety Code § 33413 subd.

9 |(a).)
130.
10 All redevelopment agencies dissolved as a matter of law on February 1, 2012,
pursuant to legislation that amended the CRL, in accordance to Stats. 2011-12 1st Ex. Sess. Ch.
11

12 5, June 29, 2011 ("ABx1 26" or "Dissolution Law"), as modified by the decision of the
California Supreme Court in CRA v. Matosantos, 53 Cal.4th 231 (2011), and as amended by
13 Statutes 2012, Chapter 26, enacted June 27, 2012 (AB 1484). When the redevelopment
14 agencies dissolved pursuant to ABx1 26, any "tax increment" that would have been allocated
15 to redevelopment agencies is instead allocated to successor agencies for payment of
16 enforceable obligations incurred by the former redevelopment agencies; the remaining
17 balances were allocated in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.
18 (Health & Safety Code § 34183, ABx1 26, at Ch. 5, § 1 (i).)
19 131: The Dissolution Law established successor agencies to carry out the duties of
20 the former redevelopment agencies. Successor agencies could retain the housing functions of
21 the former redevelopment agency or transfer those responsibilities to another entity. (Health &
22 Safety Code § 34176.)
23 132. The obligation to provide affordable housing pursuant to Section 33413 is a
24 duty imposed by law upon the former redevelopment agency, which is now an enforceable

25 obligation under the terms of the Dissolution Law. (Health & Safety Code § 34171 subd.
26 (d)(1).) The Dissolution Law requires the Housing Successor to prepare an Annual Report on

27 its housing activities, including any outstanding obligations pursuant to Section 33413, its
28 progress towards meeting those obligations, and its plans to meet the unmet obligations.

Printed on Recycled Paper 26 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 26

1 (Health & Safety Code § 34176.1(f).) Petitioners are informed and believe that the City and

2 CRA-LA have failed to produce such an Annual Report every year as required.

3 133. The Dissolution Law also established a process to provide tax increment

4 funds, called Redevelopment Program Tax Trust Fund ("RPTTF"), to pay for the enforceable

5 obligations of the former redevelopment agencies including paying contracts, bonds, and

6 housing activities required by the CRL. (Health & Safety Code § 34182.) The Dissolution

7 Law requires that the Successor Agency prepare a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule

8 ("ROPS") that must be reviewed for approval by the Oversight Board and submitted to the

9 Department of Finance and the County Auditor Controller to provide for the allocation of

10 RPTTF amounts. (Health & Safety Code §§ 34177(1) & (m).) The ROPS covers the payments
required to be paid by the Successor Agency for its enforceable obligations for successive six- 11 month periods,
12 134. On an areawide basis in the Hollywood Redevelopment Area, the City has
13 fallen short of its obligation to produce low/moderate income units and has a deficit of at least
14 331 Low/Moderate Income Units according to the May 15, 2008 "5-Year Implementation
15 Plan (2009-2013)." Petitioners are informed and believe that the 2008 Implementation Plan
16 is the most recent plan that has been produced and that the City and CRA-LA have failed to
17 produce more recent implementation plans. Therefore, whether the Project is considered
18 alone or as part of an areawide requirement, the City fails to meet its obligations to produce
19 sufficient low/moderate income units. By setting aside only 11% Very Low Income units, the
20 Project is failing to address the shortage of units for lower income people, and is failing to
21 produce any low or moderate income units at all.
22
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
23 WRIT OF MANDATE - COMPEL COMPLIANCE WITH THE CRL REPLACEMENT
24 OBLIGATION
(HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 33413, CODE OF CIV. PROC. § 1085)
25

26 135. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained
27 in the previous paragraphs.

28 136. The CRL requires that when dwelling units occupied by lower income residents

Printed on Recycled Paper 27 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 27

1 are destroyed or removed in a redevelopment project area as a result of financial assistance or a

2 written agreement with a redevelopment agency, one hundred percent of the units must be

3 replaced within four years from the date of removal. (Health & Safety Code § 33413.) In

4 addition, when replacement of such units is required, a redevelopment agency must give priority

5 to those lower income persons displaced, to rent or purchase the replacement housing units

6 pursuant to a replacement housing plan. (Id. at § 33411.3.) The CRL also requires that no less

7 than 30 days prior to the execution of any project which would lead to the destruction or

8 removal of dwelling units from the low- and moderate-income housing market, the Agency must

9 prepare and adopt by resolution a replacement housing plan. (ld. at § 33413.5.) Among other

10 things, this plan must include an adequate means of financing the replacement of one hundred

11 percent of the units removed. (Id. at §§ 33413(a), 33413.5.)
137. California Health and Safety Code § 33413.5 further provides that within a
12 reasonable time before adopting the replacement housing plan, the redevelopment agency must 13 make a draft of the proposed replacement housing plan available for review and comment to
14 public agencies and the general public. The Agency must require that persons and families 15 displaced by Agency activity be given priority to housing that the Agency makes available for
16 rent to low- or moderate-income households as part of a redevelopment project. (Id. at §
17 (33411.3.)
18 138. At all times relevant to this action, Respondents have had clear mandatory
19 duties and prohibitions imposed by the CRL, and Respondents have repeatedly violated those
20 duties and legal prohibitions as alleged herein. In violation of the CRL, Respondents failed to
21 provide the required number of replacement dwelling units or adopt or make available for
22 public comment and review a Replacement Housing Plan that plans for the replacement of the
23 dwelling units that they are obligated to provide and gives the displaced residents priority to the
24 replacement housing.

25 139. The City imposed a condition (CPC condition 15) contemplating the return of
26 a minimum of 40 displaced tenants into the newly constructed Project. However, the Real
27 Party in Interest stated this was a "voluntary" condition and that the City had no power to
28 require the return of dislocated tenants from rent stabilized apartments to the newly constructed

Printed on Recyoled Paper 28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 28

1 Project buildings. This condition was also limited to those tenants that qualify as Very Low

2 Income Households, and did not provide for application to Low or Moderate Income

3 households. Furthermore, there would be far more than 40 displaced tenants resulting from the

4 active removal of tenants who have lived at the Selma Las Palmas apartments and the planned

5 demolition of the Selma Las Palmas apartments.
140.
6 Petitioners are directly and beneficially interested in having Respondents

7 comply with all applicable provisions of the law and their legal duties, as set forth herein.

8 Petitioner requests a writ of mandate compelling Respondents to immediately adopt and

9 follow an adequate Replacement Housing Plan in compliance with the CRL.
141. Petitioners, other members of the public and lower-income families are 10

11 suffering irreparable injury as a result of the unlawful acts and omissions of Respondents. The
injuries suffered are not easily quantified or compensable. No money damages or other legal
12 remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and low-income families for the irreparable
13 harm the City's conduct has caused, continues to cause, and threatens to cause Petitioner and
14 members of the public. The City, unless enjoined, will continue to violate state laws.
15

16 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
DECLARATORY RELIEF CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE § 1060
17 AGAINST ALL RESPONDENTS
142.
18 Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation contained

19 in the previous paragraphs.
143.
20 An actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents because the
City has failed to comply with Community Redevelopment Law, CEQA, and Planning and Zoning 21 Law.
22 144. Petitioners are beneficially interested in having Respondents comply with all
23 applicable provisions of law and their legal duties, as set forth herein.
24

25 145. Wherefore Petitioners pray for declaratory relief, as set forth below.

26 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

27 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under
28 law, abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the

Printed on Recycled Paper 29 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 29

p matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the

2 certification of the EIR and the approval of the Project must be set aside.

3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

4 1. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondents:
A. To set aside and vacate its certification of the EIR, Findings of Fact, and

6 Statement of Overriding Considerations supporting the approval of the Project; and

7 B. To set aside and vacate any approvals for the Project based upon the EIR,

8 Findings of Fact, and Statement of Overriding Considerations supporting the Project; and
2. For an order enjoining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking any
10 action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way
11 that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful
12 approval is obtained from Respondents after the preparation and consideration of an adequate
13 EIR. The City must adopt all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures.

14 3. For an order ensuring the Respondents provide adequate affordable housing in the
15 Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area as required by the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan.
16 4. For declaratory relief;

17 5. For costs of the suit;

18 6. For reasonable attorneys' fees; and

19 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
