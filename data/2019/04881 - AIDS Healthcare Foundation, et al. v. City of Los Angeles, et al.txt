2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Over strong public opposition and in violation of the California

4 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Community Redevelopment Law, and Planning and

5 Zoning Law, on June 25, 2019, the City of Los Angeles ("City") approved various

6 entitlements for a mixed use development at 6400 West Sunset Boulevard ("Project"). The

7 Project was proposed by Real Party in Interest 6400 Sunset LLC.

8 2. Instead of conducting environmental analysis of the proposed Project as required

9 by the CEQA, the City relied upon Sustainable Communities Plan Exemption ("SCPE")

10 from CEQA. This exemption was inapplicable because the criteria to qualify for such an
11 exemption were not met. The proposed Project would demolish a cultural resource, the

12 Amoeba Records building, that substantial evidence showed would be eligible for listing on

13 the California register of historic places because of its culturally significant murals associated

14 with significant artists. Furthermore, the City failed to comply with the procedural

15 requirements required for utilizing a SCPE because it failed to circulate a draft of the

16 sustainable communities environmental assessment for a period of 30 days.

17 3. The Project fails to provide an amount of affordable housing that would allow

18 the City to comply with the requirements of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan. The

19 Redevelopment Plan requires that 15% of residential units built in the area be affordable units.

20 To this point the City has failed on an areawide basis to provide the required number of

21 affordable units, falling short in production of low and moderate income units by 331 units in

22 2008 and worsening that shortfall ever since. Its approval of the Project worsens that shortfall

23 by providing fewer affordable units than would be necessary to meet areawide affordable

24 housing goals.

25 4. Hollywood has been experiencing explosive development, which has led to
26 increased traffic, the demolition of historic buildings, the destruction of existing affordable
27 housing, and the inadequate provision of affordable housing with new construction of market

28 rate units.

Printed on Recycled Paper 02 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

5. Because the City failed to provide adequate environmental review with full
2 disclosure of the Project's extensive adverse impacts, reviewable by the public, as required by
3 the California Environmental Quality Act, and it violated Planning and Zoning Law and

4 Community Redevelopment Law requirements for consistency of the Project with the

5 Community Redevelopment plan and provision of affordable housing, the City's approvals of

6 the Project must be set aside as an abuse of discretion.

7 JURISDICTION

8 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

9 of Civil Procedure. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of
10 the Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

11 PARTIES

12 7. AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) is a nonprofit organization based in Los
13 Angeles providing cutting-edge medicine and advocacy to over 1,000,000 people in 43
14 countries. AHF is currently the largest provider of HIV/AIDS medical care in the U.S.
15 Generating new, innovative ways of treatment, prevention and advocacy has been the hallmark
16 of AHF's success. Since 1987, AHF has cared for millions of people living with HIV and
17 AIDS worldwide. AHF creates and implements new programs in communities across the U.S.
18 and abroad, expanding delivery of healthcare and influencing policy with the aim of saving
19 more lives. Many of AHF's clients and patients are at risk of homelessness and are in
20 extremely low, very low, low, or moderate income households that would qualify for
21 affordable housing. Homelessness and a housing instability have a significant negative impact
22 on health, especially for those who are already chronically ill. AHF launched the Healthy
23 Housing Foundation ("HHF") to provide decent housing units at an affordable cost to low-
24 income people, including families with children, and those previously unsheltered or
25 homeless. AHF has purchased and rehabilitated : string of properties in the Los Angeles area
26 since October 2017 and has renovated them for affordable housing.
27 8. Petitioner Coalition to Preserve LA is an unincorporated association composed
28 of concerned residents seeking a positive future for Los Angeles through good land use

Printed on Recycled Paper 03 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 planning, environmental stewardship, transparent government, availability of affordable

2 housing, and community empowerment.

3 9. Respondent City of Los Angeles is political subdivision of the State of

4 California.

5 10. Real Party in Interest 6400 Sunset, LLC is the applicant and recipient of the

6 approvals associated with the Project.

7 11. Real parties named as Does I to X are given fictitious names because their names

8 and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioners.

9 STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 The Project Site and Its Surroundings.

11 12. The Project site consists of 0.83 non-contiguous acres, located in the

12 Hollywood Community Plan Area where Hollywood Boulevard meets Cahuenga Boulevard.

13 The Project is generally bounded by Sunset Boulevard, Cahuenga Boulevard, and Ivar
14 Avenue, but is split by single-story buildings currently used as nightclubs.

15 13. The site is divided into a northern portion, which is currently developed with

16 the Amoeba Music building, and a southern portion, which consists of a 21-space surface

17 parking lot. The Project proposes to develop only the northern portion at this time.

18 14. The land use designation is "Regional Center Commercial," and zoned C4-
19 2D-SN.

20 15. The Project authorizes construction of a mixed-use development containing

21 200 residential units, of which five percent (10 units) would be reserved for Very Low-Income

22 households. The Project would be 26 stories and 284 feet tall. Six of the building's floors

23 would serve as a parking a garage, four of which would be located aboveground. The ground

24 floor of the Project would contain 7,000 square feet of commercial space.
25 16. The Project would demolish an existing three-story, 47-foot-tall commercial

26 structure with 43,077 square feet of floor area and a single-level subterranean parking garage.

27 The existing commercial building has housed Amoeba Music since 2001.

28 17. The Project would construct 231,836 square feet of new floor area, 190,735

Printed on Recycled Paper 04 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

square feet of new residential floor area, and a maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 6:1. This

2 FAR depends on the continued use of the southern half of the Project site as a surface parking

3 lot.

18. Although the Los Angeles Municipal Code requires the provision of 22,875
square feet of open space, the majority of this open space will not be available to the public.
6 Some of this open space will be located in a private penthouse. Other "open space" includes

7 amenities intended only for Project residents.
19. The Project is surrounded by a one-story commercial building to the north,

9 the four-story ArcLight Cinema Complex to the east, a one-story commercial building and
10 alley to the south, and the 14-story CNN office building to the west. A 19-story hotel has been

11 approved north of the Project site, but construction has not yet occurred.

12 20. Access to the Project will occur by surface streets and the 101 Freeway,
13 which runs approximately 0.8 miles east of the Project site and has on- and off-ramps at
14 Cahuenga Boulevard, Highland Avenue, Western Avenue, Sunset Boulevard, and Santa

15 Monica Boulevard.

16

17 The Proposed Project Application Process.

18 21. Throughout development of the Project, City staff raised concerns about its

19 reliance on an elevated parking podium, the appearance of the podium, and the barriers such a
20 podium would present to activating the Project's streetscape. The applicant updated the
21 Project's plans in August 2018 and March 2019, but failed to satisfy staff concerns.
22 22. On September 4, 2018, the Urban Design Studio presented the Project to the
23 Professional Volunteer Program. The program provided feedback concentrated on the
24 monolithic appearance of the parking podium.
25 23. The Project proponent applied for a "Sustainable Communities Project"

26 exemption from compliance with CEQA. This exemption, contained within Public Resources
27 Code section 21155.1, applies to ransit priority projects that would not have unmitigated
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 05 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environmental impacts, public health impacts, historic resources impacts, and that meet a

2 multitude of requirements for energy efficiency.

3 24. As the City reviewed the Project, it approved several other large
4 developments in the immediate vicinity. On September 13, 2018, the City Planning

5 Commission approved a density bonus and conditional use permit for the construction of eight

6 buildings, 950 residential units, 308 hotel rooms, and 190,000 square feet of commercial and

7 retail uses in the Crossroads Project, located at 6701 West Sunset Boulevard. At that same

8 meeting, the City Planning Commission approved entitlements for a mixed-use building at

9 6200 West Sunset Boulevard containing 12,120 square feet of commercial retail and restaurant

10 uses. The previous week, on September 8, 2018, the City Planning Commission approved

11 entitlements for a 275-room hotel at 6407 Sunset Boulevard. In February 2018, the City

12 Planning Commission approved entitlements for a 275-room hotel at 1400 North Cahuenga

13 Boulevard. In 2016 and 2017, the city approved entitlements a 200-unit residential building

14 with 285,719 square feet of office space and 16,315 square feet of restaurant space at 1341

15 North Vine Street; and a 369-unit residential building at 1311 Cahuenga Boulevard; a 200-unit

16 residential building at 6250 West Sunset Boulevard.

17 25. On October 25, 2018, Petitioner Coalition to Preserve LA submitted a letter

18 to the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) Committee, objecting to

19 the potential Sustainable Communities exemption from CEQA. Petitioner described the
20 failure of the Project to be adequately served by existing utilities, its impacts on the historic

21 Amoeba Music store, and the failure to conduct a preliminary endangerment assessment due to

22 the site's prior use as a gas station and service center. These are all requirements of the

23 Sustainable Communities Exemption. Petitioner's letter further questioned the failure to

24 conduct a health risk assessment. The letter further objected to the City's failure to circulate a
25 draft of a sustainable communities environmental assessment for at least a thirty day review
26 period as required by Public Resources Code section 21155.2 subdivision (b) (3).

27 26. The PLUM Committee of the City Council found the Project exempt from

28 CEQA at a meeting on November 6, 2018.

Printed on Recycled Paper 06 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 27. On November 21, 2018, the City Council followed suit, deeming the Project

2 exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21155.1.

3 28. On January 9, 2019, the Advisory Agency approved Vesting Tentative Tract
4 Map No. VTT-74496-CN, merging the Project's lots, after a public hearing conducted by the
5 Hearing Officer for the City Planning Commission and the Advisory Agency. Members of the

6 public testified that the Project was not properly exempt from CEQA and that the Project

7 contained insufficient affordable housing, would damage historic resources, and would set a
8 negative precedent for the area.

0 29. The City claimed that the CEQA exemption was not before the Advisory
10 Agency and that no action was taken on the Project's CEQA compliance at that hearing.
11 30. Petitioner Coalition to Preserve LA appealed the Advisory Agency's action
12 on the Vesting Tentative Tract Map on January 28, 2019. The appeal raised the failure to
13 address Petitioner's previous comments, the use of a CEQA exemption for the Project, and the
14 City's separate review and approval of the Project's entitlements.
15 31. On March 13, 2019, Petitioner submitted a letter to the City Planning
16 Commission outlining its objections to the Project. Petitioner asked the City to require at least
17 15 percent affordable housing (instead of five percent) so that the Hollywood Area may
18 comply with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan and Community Redevelopment Law.
19 Petitioner's letter further explained the Project's inconsistencies with the Hollywood
20 Community Plan and incorporated its October 25, 2018 letter.

21 32. The City Planning Commission approved the Project at a hearing held on
22 March 14, 2009 and affirmed the use of the Sustainable Communities exemption from CEQA.
23 33. Petitioner Coalition to Preserve LA appealed this approval on April 17, 2019.
24 Petitioner again enumerated its concerns with the Project's CEQA exemption, the changes in
25 circumstances and new information that required EIR review, piecemealing of approvals,
26 failure to provide sufficient affordable housing to satisfy Community Redevelopment Law and
27 the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, and inconsistencies with adopted City plans.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 07 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. On June 7, 2019, the PLUM Committee scheduled Petitioner's appeal of the

2 Project's approvals for June 11, 2019.

3 35. On June 11, 2019, Petitioner supplemented its comments regarding the

4 Project and its failure to provide sufficient affordable housing with the City's Annual Housing

5 Element Progress Reports. The documents submitted demonstrated that the City has failed to

6 provide the 15 percent of affordable housing units required in the Hollywood Community Plan

7 area.

8 36. The PLUM Committee heard Petitioner's appeal of the Project on June 11,

9 2019. The appeal was denied, and the matter was transmitted to the City Council.

10 37. Without notifying Petitioners, on June 21, 2019, the City scheduled the final

11 City Council meeting for the Project on June 25, 2019.

12 38. The City Council approved the Project on June 25, 2019.

13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

14 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

15 39. Petitioners objected to the Project in the administrative process and fully

16 exhausted their administrative remedies. Petitioners submitted letters and testified during

17 public hearings for the Project during the comment period raising the issues set forth herein.

18 40. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

19 law unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the
20 absence of such remedies, Respondent's approval of the Project would form the basis for a

21 development project that would proceed in violation of state law.

22 41. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing

23 a copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached

24 as Exhibit A.

25 42. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

26 providing the City of Los Angeles with notice of its intention to commence the action. A copy

27 of that notice is attached as Exhibit B.

28 43. Petitioners elect to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

Printed on Recycled Paper 08 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- attached as Exhibit C.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3

4 (VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)
44.

5 Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

6 The Project is Not Exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.
45.

7 CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior

8 to making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14
Cal. Code Regs. § 15004). Further, CEQA requires adoption of all feasible mitigation

9 measures that will reduce adverse environmental impacts. Under the CEQA Guidelines, a

10 project a may have a significant impact on land use if it "conflict[s] with any applicable land use

11 plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project .. . adopted for the

12 purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect." (Guidelines §15125 subd. (d).)
46.
13 Public Resources Code section 21155.2 requires that a sustainable communities

14 project be reviewed through a "sustainable communities environmental assessment." (Pub.

15 Resources Code § 21155.2 subd. (b).) This sustainable communities assessment must be

16 released in draft and "circulated for public comment for a period of not less than 30 days."

17 (Pub. Resources Code § 21155.2 subd. (b)(3).) Notice must be provided in the same way as

18 for an EIR under Public Resources Code section 21092. (Ibid.) No such notice was provided,

19 and no such environmental assessment was released in draft form.

20 The Project Cannot Meet the Requirements for Review of a Transit Priority Project.

47.
21 Public Resources Code section 21155.1 requires that a sustainable

22 communities project can be adequately served by existing utilities. (Pub. Resources Code §

23 21155.2 subd. (a)(1).) This finding cannot be made for this project. Five water main ruptures

24 occurred in nearby areas between 2010 and 2014. The water mains in the area serving the

25 project are all over 75 years old. Therefore, with massive new development, the water main
infrastructure is inadequate to serve the Project and other nearby projects approved by the

26 City.
48.
27 Public Resources Code section 21155.1 requires that a sustainable

28 communities project not have a significant effect on historic resources. (Pub. Resources Code
§ 21155.2 subd. (a)(5).) This finding cannot be made for this project. The Project would

Printed on Recycled Paper 09 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

demolish the Amoeba Music store. Amoeba Music, currently occupying the site, meets at

2 least two criteria of significance for registration in the California Register of Historic

3 Resources under Public Resources Code section 21084.1 for its association with the lives of

4 persons important to local and state history and for its association with events contributing to

5 broad patterns of cultural heritage. The murals on the interior and exterior of the Amoeba
Music building qualify as historic cultural resources as they are by original Amoeba northern
California artist Larry Smulian aka Silver, an independent African-American graphic designer
7 of Berkeley, California, and Brian Blesser, the murals' executor. Michael Alvarez was
8 commissioned to add interior and exterior murals at Amoeba. The Historic Resources
Technical Report prepared in August 2018 does not mention the murals or their historic

10 cultural significance.

11 Consistency with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan Was Not Ensured.
12

13 49. "[T]he requirement of consistency is the linchpin of California's land use and
14 development laws. It is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth with the
15 force of law." (Debottari v. City of Norco (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.) A
16 redevelopment plan must be consistent with the general plan and proposed projects must be
17 consistent with both.

18 50. The Project must be consistent with the Hollywood redevelopment plan. The

19 Project does not meet Hollywood Redevelopment Plan goals (9) and (10). These Hollywood
20 redevelopment plan goals include the following:
21 (9) Provide housing choices and increase the supply and improve the quality of housing

22 for all income and age groups, especially for persons with low and moderate incomes;

23 and to provide home ownership opportunities and other housing choices which meet the

24 needs of the resident population.

25 (10) Promote the development of sound residential neighborhoods through mechanisms
such as land use, density and design standards, public improvements, property
26 rehabilitation, sensitive in-fill housing, traffic and circulation programming,
27 development of open spaces and other support services necessary to enable residents to
28 live and work in Hollywood.

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

51.
2 The Project is not consistent with the redevelopment plan that requires at

3 least fifteen percent (15%) of all new or rehabilitated units developed within the Project Area

4 by public or private entities or persons other than the Agency shall be for persons and families
of low or moderate income; and of such fifteen percent, not less than forty percent (40%)
thereof shall be for very low income households. The Project does not meet, nor does it 6

7 sufficiently assist the City in meeting, the required housing targets.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATIONS OF PLANNING AND ZONING LAW AND COMMUNITY

9 52. REDEVELOPMENT LAW REQUIREMENTS.) Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation 10 contained in the previous paragraphs.
11 53. The City failed to require that the Project provide an amount of affordable
12 housing necessary to meet the requirements of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan and
13 Community Redevelopment Law.
14 54. The Project must be consistent with the general plan and with the
15 redevelopment plan. (Govt. Code § 65300.5; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural Etc. County
16 v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336.) A project is inconsistent if it
17 a conflicts with a plan policy that is fundamental, mandatory, and clear. (Families Unafraid to
18 Uphold Rural Etc. County v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th. at pp. 1341-1342.)
19 55. The Government Code mandates that if a proposed tentative map is
20 inconsistent with General Plan policies the City "shall deny approval" of it. (Govt. Code §
21 66474.)

22 56. In the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area, the Redevelopment Plan

23 requires that all project proponents, whether public or private, provide at least 15% affordable

24 units in proposed housing development.

25 57. The requirement for the provision of affordable housing is fundamental,
26 mandatory, and clear. The Redevelopment Plan states:

27

28 At least fifteen percent (15%) of all new or rehabilitated units developed within the Project Area by public or private entities or persons other than the Agency shall be

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 for persons and families of low or moderate income; and of such fifteen percent, not less than forty percent (40%) thereof shall be for very low income households.
2 (Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, P. 17, section 410.4, emphasis added.)
3 58. In addition to the Redevelopment Plan requirements, Community
4 Redevelopment Law requires 15% set asides. (Govt. Code section 33413 subds. (b) (1) and
5 (b)(2X(A)(i).) The Supreme Court has noted the Legislature has explicitly required that new
6 Fesidential development in redevelopment areas include affordable units. (California Building
7 Industry Assn. V. City of San Jose (2015) 61 Cal.4th 435, 445-446.)
8 59. The Project would include 200 units of residential housing, but is proposed
9 a with a mere 10 (5%) affordable units.
10 60. To comply with the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan's and Municipal Code's
11 minimum requirements, the Project must provide at least 15% affordable units (30 units).
12 61. On an areawide basis, the City has fallen short of its obligation to produce
13 low/moderate income units and has a deficit of at least 331 Low/Moderate Income Units
14 according to page 32 of the May 15, 2008 "5-Year Implementation Plan (2009-2013)."
15 Therefore, whether the project is considered alone or as part of an areawide requirement, the
16 City fails to meet its obligations to produce sufficient low/moderate income units. By setting
17 aside only 5% Very Low Income units, the Project is failing to produce the required amount of
18 affordable units, and is not producing any low or moderate income units at all.
19 The City Improperly Relied Upon an Outdated General Plan to Support its

20 Consistency Findings.
62.
21 To be legally adequate, the mandatory elements of the general plan must

22 meet the minimum requirements contained in state law. (Buena Vista Gardens Apartments

23 Ass n V. City of San Diego (1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 289, 298; Twain Harte Homeowners Ass'n

24 v. County of Tuolumne (1982) 138 Cal.App. 3d 664, 699.) The land use element must include

25 standards of population density based on accurate and reasonably current numbers of people

26 and building intensity. (Govt. Code section 65302 subd. (a) ["The land use element shall

27 include a statement of the standards of population density and building intensity recommended

28 for the various districts and other territory covered by the plan. ']) Because the current

Printed on Recycled Paper 12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Hollywood Community Plan contains woefully outdated population projections and densities,
2 it cannot serve as a valid basis for a finding of consistency with the general plan. In Camp v.
3 Board of Supervisors (1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 334, 348, the court held it was not possible to
4 approve a development project because appropriate general plan consistency findings could

5 not be made using a general plan that did not meet state requirements for adequacy.

6 63. The Hollywood Community Plan (HCP) has not been updated in a legal way
7 since the 1980s. Although the City attempted to update the HCP several years ago, that HCP
8 amendment was struck down in Court for violating Government Code consistency

9 requirements. The Los Angeles Superior Court, the Honorable Judge Goodman presiding,
10 found that the Hollywood Community Plan as proposed by the City at that point was
11 "fundamentally flawed." (https://patch.com/california/hollywood/judge-rues-hollywood-
12 community-plan-fundamentally-flawed.) This case is Fix the City V. City of Los Angeles, Los
13 Angeles Superior Court case number BS138580. Until the new HCP, under review at the time
14 of Project approval, was adopted in a legally sufficient manner, the City could not make a
15 consistency finding with the HCP because the HCP is based on outdated information and

16 assumptions about population growth and density. Therefore, the City could not legally
17 approve the Amoeba Project until after an updated HCP was validly adopted. No updated
18 HCP has yet been adopted.

19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (VIOLATION OF COMMUNITY REDEVELOPMENT LAW BY FAILURE TO
PROVIDE SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE HOLLYWOOD
21 REDEVELOPMENT AREA.)
22
64.
23 Petitioners incorporate by reference herein each and every allegation
contained in the previous paragraphs.
24
65.
25 Redevelopment agencies were created by local legislative bodies in

26 accordance with the State Community Redevelopment Law ("CRL"). (Health & Safety Code
§§ 33101-33105.) Redevelopment agencies were established to eliminate blight and increase 27 the supply of housing in a manner that cannot be accomplished by private enterprises alone. 28

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 (Health & Safety Code §§ 33030, 33037, 33320.1.) Agencies designated one or more
redevelopment project areas, each governed by its own redevelopment plan, to accomplish
3 eradication of blight. (Health & Safety Code §§ 33320.1, 33322, 33367.)

4 66.

5 To increase the supply of housing, the CRL requires the inclusion of

6 affordable housing units when a redevelopment agency or other entity develops any new

7 housing, or substantially rehabilitates existing housing, within the project area. A percentage

8 of these units must be available and affordable to, and actually occupied by, households with

9 very low, low and moderate incomes. (Health & Safety Code § 33413 subd. (b).)
67.

10 All redevelopment agencies dissolved as a matter of law on February 1, 2012,

11 pursuant to legislation that amended the CRL, in accordance to Stats. 2011-12 1st Ex. Sess. Ch.

12 5, June 29, 2011 ("ABx1 26" or "Dissolution Law"), as modified by the decision of the

13 California Supreme Court in CRA v. Matosantos, 53 Cal.4th 231 (2011), and as amended by

14 Statutes 2012, Chapter 26, enacted June 27, 2012 (AB 1484). When the redevelopment

15 agencies dissolved pursuant to ABx1 26, any "tax increment" that would have been allocated

16 to redevelopment agencies is instead allocated to successor agencies for payment of

17 enforceable obligations incurred by the former redevelopment agencies; the remaining

18 balances were allocated in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.

19 (Health & Safety Code § 34183, ABx1 26, at Ch. 5, § 1 (i).)

68. The Dissolution Law established successor agencies to carry out the duties of
20 the former redevelopment agencies. Successor agencies could retain the housing functions of

21

22 the former redevelopment agency or transfer those responsibilities to another entity. (Health &
Safety Code § 34176.)

23 69.

24 The obligation to provide affordable housing pursuant to Section 33413 is a

25 duty imposed by law upon the former redevelopment agency, which is now an enforceable

26 obligation under the terms of the Dissolution Law. (Health & Safety Code § 34171 subd.

27 (d)(1).) The Dissolution Law requires the Housing Successor to prepare an Annual Report on

28 its housing activities, including any outstanding obligations pursuant to Section 33413, its
progress towards meeting those obligations, and its plans to meet the unmet obligations.

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(Health & Safety Code § 34176.1(f).)

2 70. On an areawide basis in the Hollywood Redevelopment Area, the City has

3 fallen short of its obligation to produce low/moderate income a units and has a deficit of at least

4 331 Low/Moderate Income Units according to the May 15, 2008 "5-Year Implementation Plan
Il (2009-2013)." Petitioners are informed and believe that the 2008 Implementation Plan is the

6 most recent plan that has been produced and that the City and CRA/LA have failed to produce

7 more recent implementation plans. Therefore, whether the Project is considered alone or as

8 part of an areawide requirement, the City fails to meet its obligations to produce sufficient

9 low/moderate income units. By setting aside only 5% Very Low Income units, the Project is
10 failing to address the shortage of units for lower income people, and is failing to produce any
11 low or moderate income units at all.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent has violated its duties under law,
14 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters
15 complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the adoption of the

16 SCPE and the approval of the Project must be set aside.

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:
18 1. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondent to
19 set aside and vacate its approval of the Project; and

20 2. For an order enjoining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest from taking any
21 action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way
22 that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and a until a lawful
23 approval is obtained from Respondent after the preparation and consideration of an adequate
24 EIR.

25 3. For an order ensuring the Respondent provides adequate affordable housing in
26 the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan area as required by the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan.
27 4. For declaratory relief;

28 5. For costs of the suit;

Printed on Recycled Paper 15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act to
approval of the project at 6400 West Sunset Boulevard.

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the City of Los Angeles' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in its approval of a 26-story mixed use development at 6400 West Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, without preparation of an environmental impact report. Only five percent of the project's housing units will be restricted as affordable, far less than is
required to bring the project and Hollywood area into compliance with city and state affordable housing requirements.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Michelle Black

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act to
approval of the project at 6400 West Sunset Boulevard.

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge
the City of Los Angeles' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) in its approval of a 26-story mixed use development at 6400 West Sunset
Boulevard in Hollywood, without preparation of an environmental impact report. Only
five percent of the project's housing units will be restricted as affordable, far less than is
required to bring the project and Hollywood area into compliance with city and state
affordable housing requirements.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
a

Michelle Black
