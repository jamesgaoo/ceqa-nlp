17 Real Party In Interest.

18 INTRODUCTION

19 1. Petitioner Coastal Defender NC ("DEFENDER") brings this action against
20 Respondent City of Encinitas ("CITY") for its failure to comply with the procedural and substantive
21 lrequirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Public Resources Code §§
22 21000 et seq.) and the CITY's Municipal Code (*EMC") in approving the development of a hotel
23 Iproject at 186 N. Coast Highway 101, Encinitas, California (the "Project") proposed by real party in
24 interest, 101 Hotel, LLC (the "RPI").

25 2. The Project seeks to replace an abandoned, nonconforming 45-room motel with a

26 further nonconforming 35-room hotel, restaurant, roof-deck bar and lounge exceeding an applicable
27 30-foot height limit in violation of the CITY's Municipal Code, and without the benefit of
28 environmental review under CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

3. CITY approved the Project, on or about September 18, 2019, determining the Project
2 to be exempt under CEQA Guidelines (the "Guidelines"; California Code of Regulations, Title 14,

3 |Division 6, Chapter 3, §§ 15000-15387) Sections 15301(a), 15301(e)(2) and 15303(e) (collectively,

4 Ithe "Exemptions") and filed its Notice of Exemption on or about September 24, 2019.

5 4. DEFENDER has exhausted all available administrative remedies provided by law,
6 satisfied CEQA's Notice of Action requirement (Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5) and brought suit within
7 the applicable statute of limitations period (Pub. Res. Code § 21167(b)).

5. a Through this action, DEFENDER seeks a peremptory writ of mandate setting aside
the Exemptions and all Project approvals and entitlements. In addition, DEFENDER seeks
10 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to stop the CITY and RPI from taking any action on the
11 Project that may affect the environment until such time as the Project's defects are corrected and full
12 compliance with CEQA and the EMC is achieved.

13 6. DEFENDER brings this action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
14 1094.5, or, in the alternative, under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1087. The action is
15 also brought pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167 and other applicable laws.

16 PARTIES

17 7. DEFENDER is a non-profit 501(c)(4) California corporation, whose President, Dr.
18 Donald McPherson owns real property in the City of Encinitas neighboring the Project site, and
19 whose members, including Dr. McPherson, objected to the Project during the administrative process,
20 las required under Public Resources Code section 21177(b) and 21177(c). DEFENDER brings this
21 laction to protect the environment and ensure that the public disclosure imperatives of CEQA are
22 satisfied and that the CITY's violations of the Municipal Code are corrected.

23 8. CITY is general law city operating under the laws of the State of California. CITY
24 has general land use authority over the Project, is responsible for reviewing entitlement requests for
25 the Project, and either approving or denying such requests. As such, CITY functions as the "lead
26 agency" under CEQA for purposes of assessing the Project for conflicts with the EMC and potential
27 environmental impacts, disclosing such assessments to the public as they arise. In the role of lead
28 agency, CITY must comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of the EMC and CEQA,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(including, among other things, review of the Project's compliance with height limits, noise
2 restrictions, parking needs, fire and other safety requirements, and environmental impacts.

3 9. Respondent Does 1-10 are sued under fictitious names. Their true names and
4 Icapacities are unknown to DEFENDER. When their true names and capacities are ascertained,
5 DEFENDER will amend this petition to assert them. DEFENDER is informed and believes that each
of the fictitiously named respondents is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein
7 lalleged, and that the damages as herein alleged were proximately caused by their conduct.

10. DEFENDER is informed and believes that the RPI is a limited liability company
9 organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. RPI is identified as the applicant for
10 lthe Project approved by the City and challenged by this lawsuit.
11 11. Real Parties in Interest DOES 1 through 10 are sued under fictitious names. Their
12 true names and capacities are unknown to DEFENDER. When their true names and capacities are
13 ascertained, DEFENDER will amend this petition to assert them. DEFENDER is informed and
14 believes that each of the fictitiously named real parties in interest have an interest, in some manner,
15 lin or related to the Project or the underlying property.
16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 12. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and/or
18 21168.5, and California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and/or 1085.
19 13. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition and
20 Complaint arose in the City of Encinitas, which is located in the County of San Diego, where the
21 Project was approved and would be carried out, and all parties are located in San Diego County.
22 14. DEFENDER has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
23 21167.5 by serving a written notice of its intention to commence this action on the City.
24 15. DEFENDER has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
25 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
26 16. DEFENDER has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the
27 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the CITY to set aside their
28 lapproval for the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 17. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs 1
3 through 16, inclusive, of this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

4 18. The site of the Project was originally constructed as a motel under the County a of San
5 Diego's jurisdiction in 1986 wherein it was approved for a total 39 guest rooms and 39 substandard

6 (i.e. mostly undersized, per the EMC) parking spaces.

19. Sometime thereafter, the motel was illegally remodeled (i.e. without permits or other
8 required approvals) to add 6 additional guest rooms for a total of 45 rooms.

20. RPI submitted an application to the CITY in 2015 to develop the Project as a 45 guest
10  room hotel with a full-service restaurant and a rooftop bar and lounge exposing the neighboring
11 properties to late night noise from the hotel, restaurant and bar patrons, while offering no additional
12 parking notwithstanding the EMC's requirement that each such use requires over double the parking
13 spaces available onsite. Pursuant to this application, RPI sought the CITY's approval for a Major Use
14 Permit, a Design Review Permit and a Coastal Development Permit, while simultaneously seeking
15 lexemption from environmental review notwithstanding strong evidence in the record reflecting the
16 Project's expected potentially significant impacts with respect to noise, parking, traffic and life safety
17 to the community.

18 21. After several iterations, the Project was ultimately revised to reduce the number of
19 guest rooms to 35, but otherwise kept the development substantively as it had been originally
20 submitted such that the restaurant and bar uses remain under-parked by 52 spaces, or over 100% per
21 lan analysis submitted to the CITY by transportation engineer Craig Neustaedter.
22 22. Recognizing that the Project would generate on-street parking and traffic queuing
23 impacts along Highway 101 because it would be incapable of handling the full load of vehicles
a 24 required under the EMC, RPI proposed a 24-hour valet service even though it admitted that this
25 *solution" was sufficient if only 65 percent of the hotel patrons drove to the site. DEFENDER,
26 through its own traffic engineer, prepared and submitted reports to the CITY indicating that the
27 lproposed valet service would not alleviate the Project's parking and traffic impacts in real world
28 conditions and failed to take into account the additional parking needs generated by the Project's

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 restaurant and bar uses likely to result in potentially significant environmental impacts and violative
2 of EMC section 30.76.050 which prohibits the expansion of nonconforming uses and structural
3 nonconformities.

4 23. Regarding the Project's open-air roof deck, DEFENDER submitted its acoustic
5 expert's noise analysis showing that neighboring homeowners and residents would be inundated with
6 late-night noise impacts in violation of the noise standards found at EMC Chapter 9.32.
24. DEFENDER further submitted expert architectural evidence showing that the Project
8 would exceed the CITY's height limitations found at EMC section 30.00.060. Making matters worse,
9 the CITY admitted that it had not reviewed this issue prior to its approval of the Project, but that it
10 would (unlawfully) defer its investigation of this, and any potential mitigation required, until after
11 |the Project was approved.

12 25. DEFENDER also submitted a licensed appraiser's analysis showing that the Project
13 could not be constructed at a cost of less than 50% of the existing building's value, resulting in the
14 Project's failure to meet the requirements set forth at EMC section 30.76.070(A) which require
15 developments seeking to remodel sites with existing, structural nonconformities to correct all such
16 nonconformities if the estimated cost of such work exceeds 50% of the building's value. Though the
17 existing building includes a number of structural nonconformities, including but not limited to the
18 substandard parking facilities, and the Project's cost will definitively exceed the 50% threshold, the
19 CITY approved the Project so that it may maintain these structural nonconformities in their
20 substandard state.

21 26. DEFENDER further pointed out to the CITY that the existing motel use had been
22 abandoned in excess of 180 days, resulting in the prohibition of continuing the existing
23 nonconforming uses on the Project site pursuant to EMC section 30.76.090(B). The CITY and RPI
24 ignored this requirement altogether.
25 27. DEFENDER also submitted reports from its fire and life safety expert and its licensed
26 architect showing that the Project was incapable of meeting California State Fire and Building Codes
27 as required under EMC Chapter 23.12, and that the CITY could not making the necessary findings
28 for the Project's requested Major Use Permit as required pursuant to EMC section 30.74.070.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

28. Compounding matters further, when DEFENDER, through Dr. McPherson, sought
2 the CITY's internal (i.e. inter-staff) and external (between staff and the public and/or the RPI)
3 correspondence regarding the Project through the California Public Records Act ("CPRA";
4 /Government Code section 6250 et. seq.), the CITY was incapable of producing an overwhelming
5 number of these public records because it claims to have destroyed them. This, in turn, makes it
6 difficult to understand how the CITY will be able to certify a valid administrative record for purposes
7 Jof CEQA in the instant litigation.

8 29. Notwithstanding the extensive list of potentially significant impacts under CEQA, and
violations of the EMC, the CITY's Planning Commission approved the Project on or about May 16,
10 2019.

11 30. Thereafter, on or about May 28, 2019, DEFENDER, through Dr. McPherson, timely
12 filed its appeal of the Project's approval to the City Council.
13 31. On or about September 18, 2019, the CITY's Council approved the Project and filed
14 a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk on or about September 24, 2019.
15 32. Having exhausted all administrative remedies available to it, DEFENDER filed this
16 Petition for Writ of Mandate to appeal the CITY's approval of the Project.
17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA)
19 33. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
20 through 32, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.
21 34. Though CEQA does not demand perfection, it does require that a plain reading of the
22 Guidelines, and the exemptions therein, not be exploited and abused in a manner intended to avoid
23 environmental analysis.
24 35. CEQA requires analytical assumptions and conclusions be supported by substantial
25 levidence in the record, yet no such viable, substantial evidence exists for the CITY's use of the
26 Exemptions in light of the unusual circumstances presented by the Project as to its potentially
27 significant impacts with respect to parking, traffic, noise and fire life safety, as well as a revision to
28 the Project's baseline in light of the abandoned motel use currently on the subject site.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

36. The CITY approved the Exemptions notwithstanding the Project's expected
2 potentially significant impacts on the environment. In doing so, the CITY unlawfully avoids
3 lexamination of these impacts so that it failed to apply mitigation measures as required under CEQA.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (DECLARATORY RELIEF AS TO CEQA CLAIMS)
37. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
7 |through 36, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.

8 38. An actual controversy has arisen between DEFENDER on the one hand and the CITY
on the other concerning their respective rights and duties. DEFENDER contends that the CITY erred
10 when it approved the Project through the improper implementation of the Exemptions. DEFENDER
11is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the CITY disputes DEFENDER's contentions
12 land maintains that the Exemptions are adequate under the law and that the Project was properly

13 lapproved.

14 39. DEFENDER seeks a judicial determination concerning the rights and duties of the

15 parties in the controversy alleged. Such a determination is necessary and appropriate at this time so

16 Ithat the parties may plan and determine their actions accordingly.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS TO CEQA CLAIMS)

19 40. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
20 lthrough 39, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.

21 41. DEFENDER seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent

22 injunction to enjoin the CITY from continuing to implement the Project without adequate

23 environmental review as required by CEQA. DEFENDER further seeks a temporary restraining

24 order, preliminary and permanent injunction compelling and ordering the CITY to comply with
25 CEQA in implementing the Project.

26 42. DEFENDER is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that the CITY, by its

27 actions violated CEQA.

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43. Unless enjoined and restrained, the CITY and RPI will continue to implement the
2 Project without adequate environmental review as required by CEQA. DEFENDER has no adequate
3 Iremedy at law to prevent this from happening. In the event the Project is implemented without proper
4 environmental review, DEFENDER, and the public generally, will sustain damages that are
limpossible to determine. The environment itself will likewise suffer. Moreover, if the Project is

6 allowed to proceed, DEFENDER's claims for relief may become moot. Finally, the actions of the
CITY and RPI may result in a multiplicity of lawsuits. For these reasons, injunctive relief is
8 appropriate in this case.
9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (VIOLATION OF MUNICIPAL CODE)

11 44. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
12 through 43, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.

13 45. CITY failed to follow the EMC in approving the Project's over-permissible height
14 development, substandard parking, augmented noise levels, and fire and building safety code
Iviolations. 15

16 46. These Project "deviations" were proposed and approved without adherence to

17 appropriate procedures in violation of the EMC. Absent an order from this Court, the Project will be

18 Iconstructed to the detriment of the neighboring community and the public at large.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (DECLARATORY RELIEF AS TO MUNICIPAL CODE CLAIM)

21 47. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
22 through 46, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.

23 48. An actual controversy has arisen between DEFENDER on one hand and the CITY on
the other concerning their respective rights and duties. DEFENDER contends that the City erred 24

25 when it approved the Project in violation of the EMC. DEFENDER is informed and believes, and
26 on that basis alleges, that the CITY dispute DEFENDER's contentions and maintains that the Project
27 was properly approved under the Municipal Code.

28

8

49. DEFENDER seeks a judicial determination concerning the rights and duties of the
2 parties in the controversy alleged. Such determination is necessary and appropriate at this time so
3 |that the parties may plan and determine their actions accordingly.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS TO MUNICIPAL CODE CLAIMS)

50. DEFENDER hereby incorporates by this reference the allegations of paragraphs
through 49, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint as though fully set forth herein.
51. DEFENDER seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent
o injunction to enjoin the CITY from continuing to implement the Project without adherence to, and
10 compliance with, the EMC. DEFENDER further seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary
11 land permanent injunction compelling and ordering the CITY to comply with the EMC in
12 implementing the Project.

13 52. DEFENDER is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that the CITY by its actions
14 violated the Municipal Code as alleged herein.

15 53. Unless enjoined and restrained, the CITY will continue to implement the Project
16 without adherence to, and compliance with, the EMC. DEFENDER has no adequate remedy at law
17 to prevent this from happening. In the event the Project is implemented DEFENDER, and the public
18 generally, will sustain damages that are impossible to determine. Moreover, if the Project is allowed
19 to proceed, DEFENDER's claims for relief may become moot. Finally, the actions of the CITY may
20 result in a multiplicity of lawsuits. For these reasons, injunctive relief is appropriate in this case.

21
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
22

23 WHEREFORE, DEFENDER prays for judgment as follows:
1.
24 A writ of mandate directing the CITY to (a) void, rescind, or otherwise set aside the
its decision to approve the Exemption under CEQA, and (b) void, rescind, or 25 otherwise set aside its approval of all Project entitlements; 26
