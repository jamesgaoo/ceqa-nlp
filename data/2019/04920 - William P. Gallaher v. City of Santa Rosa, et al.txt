17

18 Petitioner and Plaintiff William P. Gallaher, an individual ("Petitioner"), alleges as

19 follows:

20 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

21 1. Petitioner is an individual, over the age of eighteen who regularly conducts business
22| in the City of Santa Rosa.

23 2. Respondent and Defendant City of Santa Rosa ("City") is and at all relevant times
24 was a political and legal subdivision of the State of California, duly organized and existing under
25 and pursuant to the laws of the State of California.

26 3. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of Santa Rosa ("Council") is,
27 and at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the City existing
28 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The Council is, and at relevant times
OLLRI564572202838.2 -]•
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND NITATAPTUIR DOT I01

1 was, the local body charged with proposing, drafting, amending and passing legislation governing

2 land use and the City's municipal affairs, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all applicable

3 federal, state, and local law.

4 4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued
5 herein as DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and will amend this complaint to set forth their true names

6 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based
thereon alleges, that some fictitiously named Respondents were the agents and employees of the
other fictitiously named, or actually named, Respondents and, acting within the course of scope of

9 such employment or agency, took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are the
10 principals and took some part in such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-named
11 Respondents are liable to Petitioner for the relief prayed for herein.
12 5. Respondents and Defendants identified in paragraphs 2 through 4 above, inclusive,
13 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "Respondents."

14 6. This action challenges the approval by the City of a so-called "reach code" via
15 "Ordinance No. ORD-2019-019 Entitled: Ordinance of the Council of the City of Santa Rosa
16 Adopting by Reference, With Local Amendments, the 2019 California Energy Code Including
17 All-Electric, Low-Rise Residential Reach Code" ("Reach Code"), which ordinance was passed by
18 the Council on second reading on November 19, 2019.

19 7. A "reach code" is so called because it "reaches" beyond the ordinary standards of a
20 building or energy code to impose greater restrictions on building and development. Reach codes
21 in California are optional and can only be enacted if specific procedures are followed. Here, the
22 Reach Code forbids the inclusion of natural gas or propane plumbing in new low-rise residential
23 construction in the City.

24 8. Despite the fact that enactment of the Reach Code constituted a discretionary
25 project affecting the use and occupancy of land and structures in the City, and having the potential
26 for reasonably foreseeable and potentially significant adverse physical changes in the
27 environment, the City enacted the Reach Code without undertaking environmental review as
28 required by, and therefore in violation of, the California Environmental Quality .ct ("CEQA";
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) and its implementing CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs.,

2 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).

3 9. The enactment of a reach code is governed by section 10-106 of the 2019 Building

4 Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings, title 24, part 6 of the
5 California Code of Regulations ("Reach Code Law"). Before enacting the Reach Code, the Reach

6 Code Law required that the City adopt "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective."
7 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The City's determination was based on a
8 document entitled "2019 Cost-effectiveness Study: Low-Rise Residential New Construction"

9 dated July 17, 2019 ("Study"), whose material conclusions are contradicted by a separate study
10 entitled "Residential Building Electrification in California." The Reach Code Law also requires

11 the submittal of an application to the Executive Director of the California State Energy Resources
12 Conservation and Development Commission that includes "[a]ny findings, determinations,
13 declarations or reports, including any negative declaration or environmental impact report,
14 required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section
15 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, 10-106, subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.)
16 10. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the City's full compliance with the law
17 regarding the City's approval of the Reach Code, including adhering to the requirements of CEQA.
18 Petitioner has personal, professional, environmental and other interests which will be severely
19 injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA and the Reach Code Law. Petitioner lives
20 close by the City and regularly does business there, including developing projects that would be
21 subject to the Reach Code. Moreover, the Reach Code's impacts are necessarily regional in nature,
22 thereby impacting residents throughout Sonoma County.

23 11. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by
24 the City's failure to comply with CEQA and approval of the Reach Code. Petitioner has expressed
25 his concerns and objections to the approval of the Reach Code in correspondence to the City.
26 Before approving the Reach Code, the City owed a mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties
27 which Petitioner alleges were violated. Petitioner has the right to enforce the mandatory duties
28 which CEQA imposes on the City,
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

12.

2 13. The City is the lead agency for purposes of CEQA compliance.

U Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the City's

4 approval of the Reach Code is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.
14.

5 Petitioner exhausted its administrative remedies to the extent required by law by
objecting to the approval of the Reach Code in writing and presenting all alleged grounds for non-
6 compliance with CEQA and the Reach Code Law to the City prior to the close of the public hearing
7 at which the City considered adoption of the Reach Code. (Tomlinson v. County of Alameda (2012)
8 54 Cal.4th 281.)

9 15. On December 6, 2019, Petitioner's counsel requested : copy of any notice of
10 exemption filed by the City for the adoption of the Reach Code. As of the filing of this petition the
11 City has not responded to that request. According to the County of Sonoma CEQA postings
12 database (https://crarecords.sonomacounty.ca.gov/selfserviceweb/), the City filed a notice of
13 exemption for the Reach Code on December 12, 2019. Petitioner will timely file this Petition for
14 Writ of Mandate on or before January 16, 2020, a date not more than thirty-five (35) days after the
15 filing of the notice of exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision
16| (d).

17 16. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Intent to File Suit to be served on the City as
18 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent
19 to File Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

20 17. Petitioner will have caused copy of this pleading to be served on the Office of the
21 Attorney General for the State of California not more than ten (10) days after the commencement of
22 this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure

23 section 388.

24 18. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney a general to vindicate his own legal
25 and constitutional rights and those of residents of the City and all others who may be impacted by
26 the Reach Code. Petitioner seeks, on his own behalf and the behalf of said others, that Respondents
27 obey the clear law, conduct required environmental reviews of their discretionary actions, require
28 appropriate and feasible mitigation for their significant impacts, and not act in unlawful, bad faith,
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 arbitrary, capricious, and confiscatory fashion in noticing, analyzing, enacting and enforcing local
2 land use legislation.

3 19, For these reasons, and others set forth in this Petition and Complaint, the City's
4 actions described herein and the Reach Code are unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioner
therefore requests this Court issue a writ of mandate invalidating the Reach Code and declaring it,

6 actions undertaken thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioner also and any
seeks declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and temporary,
8 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Reach Code in any
9 manner.

10 20. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner, on the one hand, and

11 Respondents, on the other hand, relating to the legal rights of the respective parties. The
12 controversy is well-defined and imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of,
13 judicial determinations at this time is warranted.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of CEQA -

16 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5 -
17 Against All Respondents)

18 21. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 20, above, are hereby incorporated herein by
19 reference as though set forth in full.

20 22. The ordinance adopting the Reach Code is a "project" that is subject to CEQA
21 review. The CEQA Guidelines, in relevant part, define "project" as "the whole of an action, which
22 has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
23 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following: (1) An
24 activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to... enactment and
25 amendment of zoning ordinances....' (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed,
26 under CEQA's broad definition of a "project," municipal ordinances, laws and regulations affecting
27 the use of land or structures have consistently been held to be CEQA "projects" over the course of
28 many decades.
I| GLLR156457\2202838.2 -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

23. The staff report for the Reach Code cites three exemptions: the Class 7 exemption
2 under section 15307 of the CEQA Guidelines, the Class 8 exemption under section 15308 of the
3 Guidelines, and the "common sense" exemption under section 15061, subdivision (b)(3).

4 24. CEQA's co-called "common sense" exemption may properly be invoked only when
5 the lead agency can declare "with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question

6 may have a significant effect on the environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)

7 Thus, it is the City's burden to provide support for application of the common sense exemption, not
8 Petitioner's burden to disprove its applicability. Any legitimate reasonable question about whether

9 a project might have a significant impact means the project cannot be exempt under the "common

10 sense" exemption. To invoke the common sense exemption, the City was required to consider
11 factual evidence and data relating to possible environmental impacts of the Reach Code, and that
12 consideration must be supported by evidence in the administrative record. (Muzzy Ranch Co. v.
13 Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386-387.)

14 25. With respect to the 8 Class 7 and 8 exemptions, such can only be used for an action
15 that constitutes a preservation of the environment. The Reach Code cannot be said to rise to this
16 standard as it merely substitutes one source of energy for another, without any sufficient analysis as

17 to whether that substitution will actually yield any benefit to the environment. (Dunn-Edwards
18 Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644; International
19| Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union V. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App.3d 265.)
20 The City cannot undertake a "net benefit" environmental analysis - i.e., reasoning that the project's
21 environmental benefits in one area outweigh its significant adverse effects in another area or areas

22 of environmental impact - as such is not permitted under CEQA. (County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 v.
23 County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1577, 1580.) "There may be environmental costs to

24 an environmentally beneficial project, which must be considered and assessed." (California Farm
25 Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)

26 26. Moreover, to qualify for the Class 8 exemption the City must have a regulatory

27 process to protect the environment that is effectively equivalent to CEQA. The Reach Code lacks

28

GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 any such regulatory process, and the City has no other regulatory program that would fulfill
2 CEQA's purpose here.

3 27. Neither the common sense nor the class 7 or 8 exemptions apply here. The Reach

4 Code may have a number of significant impacts on the environment, none of which the City has
5 analyzed. These include the following:

6 a) Hazards/Public Safety. The Reach Code was passed at a time when the supply of

7 electrical power to the City and surrounding communities may be less reliable and
subject to more and longer planned outages than ever before. In October of 2019 the
City and surrounding area were subject to prolonged electricity blackouts and
10 wildfires which may have been caused by electrical infrastructure. But the City

11 failed to analyze how all-electric residential construction would exacerbate these

12 impacts. Without adequate battery storage of electricity, or an alternative power

13 source, such as natural gas which powers backup generators cook-stoves and grills,

14 and other appliances, "all-electric" homes and businesses will be subject to hazards

15 and risks to public safety during outages when heat, life-saving medical equipment,

16 lighting, water, refrigeration, food, and air conditioning may be unavailable. Given

17 the risk of blackouts, some residents will rely on propane or gasoline generators or

18 other combustible sources of power, which are more prone to accident or spillage

19 than fixed natural gas lines. There has been no study or analysis of the risks or

20 impacts associated with such increased usage, including air quality, GHG, and fire

21 impacts.

22 The 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history, was apparently caused by

23 electrical transmission lines. There is no analysis whatsoever in the administrative

24 record as to any potential increase in fire risk from expanded electrical service

25 facilities which the Reach Code would necessitate.

26 b) Utilities/Service Systems/Wildfire. The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G checklist -

27 a template for the initial study the City is required to conduct under CEQA - requires

28 evaluation of the question of whether the project would "[r]equire or result in the
I/ GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Li

2 relocation or construction of new or expanded ... electric power, natural gas, or

3 telecommunications facilities, the construction of which could cause significant

4 environmental effects?" Projects requiring significant new construction to rely

5 solely on electricity as a power source clearly have the potential to result in the

6 installation, upgrading, and/or maintenance of associated infrastructure (e.g., roads,

7 fuel breaks, power lines), and where such occurs in or near areas of high fire hazard
the resulting environmental impacts must also be studied. (See Appendix G, Section

9 XX WILDFIRE [listing potential impacts such as impairment of adopted emergency

10 response and evacuation plans, exacerbation of wildfire risks, and other human

11 safety and environmental risks and impacts].) And, as noted above, the most deadly

12 fire in California history was started not by natural gas facilities, but by electrical

13 lines. Moreover, also as noted above, increased generator use may give rise to its
own increased risk of fire.

14

15 c) Similarly, the administrative record does not analyze whether the existing electrical

16 grid is sufficient to satisfy the demand of all new construction under a 100%

17 electricity standard. Given PG&E's warnings about potential blackouts, the grid's

18 ability to handle this new demand is questionable at best. Moreover, the City did not

19 sufficiently discuss the sources of the additional electricity required under the reach

20 Code, nor the impacts related to those sources. Electric power generation powered

21 plants fueled by natural gas or other non-renewable energy sources will obviously

22 negate the supposed benefit of gas-free construction. Wind and solar sources also

23 have their own well-known adverse impacts relating to wildlife, aesthetics, etc.

24 They are also subject to supply issues depending on weather and other conditions.

25 And hydroelectric power comes with its own suite of adverse impacts as well,

26 including harm to anadromous fish and other species and the risk of failure and flood
(as with the Oroville Dam crisis of 2017). In fact, hydroelectric facilities in

27

28 California and the west are being removed, making this source of power uncertain
for future electricity needs.
II GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d) GHG/Air Quality. In passing the Reach Code the City assumed that GHGs are the
2 only environmental concern and impact at issue; such a facile assumption is clearly
3 incorrect. The Reach Code would eliminate natural gas-powered heaters, stoves,
4 water heaters, built-in outdoor barbeques, gas burning fireplaces, fire pits, and, as

5 noted above, gas-powered backup generators to protect against losses, disruptions

6 and safety problems from blackouts of a fragile and overburdened electrical grid.

7 Alternative fuel sources - such as wood, gasoline, propane or charcoal - exist for

8 many of these amenities, and could be substituted for the cleaner-burning natural gas
that the proposal would eliminate, leading to greater GHG emissions and air quality

10 impacts. Such unintended, but clearly reasonably foreseeable, adverse

11 environmental consequences must be fully evaluated under CEQA. (See, e.g.,

12 Rodeo Citizens Association v. County of Contra Costa (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 214

13 [recognizing that to extent captured butane and propane were used to displace use of

14 other fuels such as coal, home heating fuel, fuel oil, diesel, kerosene, gasoline and

15 ethanol, they would also displace GHG emissions otherwise resulting from use of

16 those alternate fuels].) For example, propane barbeques produce only one-third of
17 the GHG emissions of charcoal barbeques (id. at p. 226), and natural gas is similarly

18 a much cleaner burning fuel than propane, charcoal, wood or gasoline. Moreover,

19 the increased use of gasoline, diesel, or propane generators may also give rise to air

20 quality and/or GHG impacts that are completely unanalyzed in the administrative

21 record.

22 e) Population and Housing/Human Impacts. Projects that would displace substantial

23 numbers of people or housing, or render housing unaffordable, may have significant

24 adverse impacts on the environment and human beings that require CEQA analysis

25 and mitigation. (See CEQA Guidelines, Appdx. G, Section XIV.) To the extent the

26 Reach Code could, for example, substantially increase the cost of new multi-family

27 apartment dwelling construction and/or retrofitting, it could lead to increased rents,

28 unaffordable housing, and tenant displacement from the same, with resulting adverse
I GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

human impacts. Alternatively, renters or home buyers may prefer residences with
traditional gas appliances and therefore show a greater propensity to move outside of
the City and commute. This may also impact the supply of housing in the City.
Residential displacement, in and of itself, has been recognized as a significant

a adverse environmental impact subject to CEQA analysis and mitigation. (Lincoln

7 Place Tenants Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425 [holding

8 CEQA mitigation measures designed to mitigate tenant displacement impacts of

9 project, contained in a vesting tentative map, were enforceable and did not conflict

10 with Ellis Act].) Public entities possess the power under existing law "to mitigate

11 adverse impacts on displaced tenants." (San Francisco Apartment Assn. v. City and

12 County of San Francisco (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 463, 484, citing Pieri v. City and

13 County of San Francisco (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 886, 892; see Gov. Code,

14 § 7060.1.) As explained by the Lincoln Place Court of Appeal, "CEQA... is made

15 relevant... by the Ellis Act's explicit exceptions for a public agency's power to

16 regulate, among other things,... the mitigation of adverse impacts on persons

17 displaced by reason of the withdrawal of rental accommodations. Such items are the

18 common focus and byproducts of the CEQA process..." (Lincoln Place Tenants

19 Assn., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at 451, emph. added.) Indeed, the Supreme Court has

20 recently reaffirmed "that CEQA addresses human health and safety" and "that public

21 health and safety are of great importance in the statutory scheme." (California

22 Building Industry Assn. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th

23 369, 386, citations omitted.) CEQA's "express language... requires a finding of a

24 "significant effect on the environment" ([Pub. Resources Code,] § 21083(b)(3))

25 whenever the "environmental effects of a project will cause substantial effects on

26 human beings, either directly or indirectly.36 (Id. at p. 386, emphasis in original.)

27 f) Land Use/Planning. Given the foregoing, the City failed to adequately analyze the

28 Reach Code's consistency with its General Plan. While the City has discretion in
interpreting and applying its General Plan, it cannot do So in a way that frustrates the
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2

UJ purpose of the General Plan. (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County

L Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-381.) The analysis in the

5 28. administrative record is far too brief to fully address the proposed ordinance's
consistency with the General Plan and its overall purpose.
Given the foregoing, the Reach Code may have any number of potentially significant
6 impacts on the environment, which makes the City's reliance on the common sense and Class 7 and
7 8 exemptions improper.

8 29. Even if the Reach Code were subject to a categorical exemption, it is clear that the
9 unusual circumstances exception would apply, rendering the exemptions inapplicable. (Cal Code
10 Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports a finding that the project
11| presents unusual circumstances giving rise to the impacts discussed herein. These unusual
12 circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following: PG&E's express planned electricity
13 service interruptions and/or blackouts that will potentially last for days in this and other Sonoma
14

15 County areas, creating very serious health and safety problems if power is actually out that long and
not resumed from a non-grid source; the jurisdiction and cumulative study area jurisdictions are in
16 very high fire danger areas, increasing both the likelihood and seriousness of electricity blackouts;
17 there are well-known serious traffic problems on Highway 101 making even longer commutes to
18 the City by displaced homebuyers and renters who want a choice other than all-electric more
19 environmentally harmful. Accordingly, even assuming arguendo a categorical exemption applies,

20

22 there is a more than a fair argument that the adoption of the ordinance may have significant adverse
21 environmental effects due to unusual circumstances which require actual analysis in a legally

23 adequate initial study and appropriate environmental document pursuant to CEQA.

30. The City's reliance on exemptions also overlooks the Reach Code's potential for
24 contributing to significant and adverse cumulative impacts. (Cal Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2,
25 subd. (b).) If other jurisdictions in Sonoma County or Northern California more broadly enact

26

28 similar ordinances, the increase in the demand for electricity will be potentially much greater than
27 that from the City's alone, and so would the related impacts.

31. Section 10-106 of the Building Energy Efficiency Standards upon which the City
2 relied to enact the Reach Code requires the submission of materials in support of an application for
a reach code. The specific submittals required do not extend to a notice of claimed exemption but a

4 "negative declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California
| Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
24, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4).) The provision clearly does not contemplate the use of an exemption
because the Reach Code will invariably require at least an initial study and appropriate
environmental analysis under CEQA. Thus, the reliance on an exemption here is in error under the

9 very authority upon which the City has relied to enact it.
10 32. Accordingly, there was no basis in law or fact for the City to conclude that adoption

11 of the Reach Code was exempt under CEQA.

12 33. Under CEQA, a lead agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to
13 proceed in the manner required by law; or (2) its decision is not supported by the evidence. (Pub.
14 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) By deeming the Reach Code exempt from CEQA review,
15 Respondents abused their discretion in failing to comply with CEQA and failing to proceed in the
16 manner required by law. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, government decision-
17 makers have been deprived of critical information essential to informal and intelligent decision-
18 making, and Petitioner and other members of the public have been deprived and harmed in that
19 they were not fully informed about the significant environmental impacts of the Reach Code and
20 potentially feasible ways to mitigate them prior to Respondents' enactment of the same.
21 Petitioner, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief
22 requested herein is not granted, as the Reach Code will be implemented in the absence of a full
23 and adequate environmental review under CEQA. For the foregoing reasons, inter alia, Petitioner
24 seeks an immediate stay of the Reach Code.

25 34. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him to
26 address Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required and not excused, and any further
27 attempts would in any event have been an idle and futile exercise even if available. Petitioner has
28 no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the Reach Code,
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and a writ of ordinary mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 is the
2 prescribed remedy for violations of this type. Petitioner is herewith or shortly will be filing and
3 serving on Respondents his election to prepare the administrative record pursuant to Public
4 Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (b)(2), and all other applicable laws. Petitioner has also
5 performed all other conditions precedent to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service of

6 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the

7 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and mail service of the petition on the
8 California Attorney General no more than ten (10) days after its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., § 388).

35. The adoption of the Reach Code are in violation of CEQA and the CEQA
10 Guidelines.

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

12

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106 -

15 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5 -

16 Against All Respondents)

36.
17 The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 35, above, are hereby incorporated by

18 reference as though set forth in full.
37.
19 Section 10-106 of the Reach Code Law requires that a jurisdiction enacting a reach

20 code satisfy certain substantive and procedural requirements. As noted above, the City was

21 required to make "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24,

22 pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The City relied upon the Study to make this determination. However,

23 the Study was prepared for PG&E, and based on information and belief, the City did not prepare

24 any other materials to comply with the Reach Code Law.

38.
25 The Study concludes that there a will be a cost savings associated with all-electric

26 low-rise residential uses with respect to consumer bills and lifecycle costs based on a "Statewide

27 Electric Residential Average Rate" of 2% per year from 2020 to 2025 and 1% thereafter. However,

28 an April 2019 study that was also authored by Frontier Energy, Inc. showed an increase in costs for

GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

"Bay Area" consumers purchasing new homes based specifically on PG&E electric rates, which
would be applicable to the City. In support of its conclusion, the April 2019 study states that
"PG&E's electric rates are assumed to increase faster than the natural gas rates due to wildfire risk
4 and liability.." Based on the failure of the Study to account for specific PG&E electric rates and
Ur the evidence that based upon electric rates specific to PG&E, costs would increase, the City has
6 failed to show that the Reach Code would be cost effective. Moreover, the Study fails to account
7 for tiered electricity pricing and fails to analyze how that would apply to all-electric construction

8 under the Reach Code. It also is not clear as to whether all-electric construction would lead to

9 residential units that cannot meet the requirements of the Building Energy Efficiency standards in
10| Part 6 of Title 24, which would preclude building altogether. The City could therefore not make the
11 proper determination under the Reach Code Law to pass the Reach Code.

12 39. The Reach Code Law also requires the submittal of an application to the Executive
13 Director of the California State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that
14 includes "[a]ny findings, determinations, declarations or reports, including any negative
15 declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California Environmental
16 Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106,
17 subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.) As noted above, the City did not prepare a negative declaration or
18 EIR in support of the Reach Code. Accordingly, it cannot make the requisite submittal under the
19 Reach Code Law.

20 40. Respondents' action in adopting the Reach Code was therefore arbitrary and
21 capricious and/or constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed
22| in a manner required by law.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

26 Against All Respondents)

27 41. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 40, above, are hereby incorporated by
28 reference as though set forth in full.
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

42. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and the
2 Respondents. Petitioner contends that the Reach Code is invalid due to Respondents' failure to

3 follow CEQA and/or the Reach Code Law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis

4 alleges, that Respondents contend that the Reach Code is valid and enforceable and was properly

5 enacted.

6 43. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the validity of the Reach Code. In
7 particular, Petitioner desires a declaration that the Reach Code is invalid and unenforceable due to
8 I Respondents' failure to follow CEQA and the Reach Code Law.

9 44. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Petitioner
10 and similarly situated persons understand their rights and obligations with respect to the Reach

11 Code.

12 45. Petitioner also seeks to enjoin Respondents from applying or enforcing the Reach
13 Code, and to require that Respondents rescind their approval of the Reach Code.

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

15 A. On the First Cause of Action

16 l. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction directed to
17| Respondents' and Defendants' unlawful enactment and enforcement of the Reach Code without
18 required CEQA review, analysis and mitigation as required by law, and for a peremptory writ of
19 ordinary mandamus invalidating, voiding, and setting aside the adoption of Reach Code and any

20 actions taken under or pursuant to it;

21 2. For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5,
22 Government Code section 800, and all applicable law.

23 B. On the Second Cause of Action

24 3. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction directed to
25| Respondents' and Defendants' unlawful enactment and enforcement of Reach Code, and for a
26 peremptory writ of ordinary mandamus invalidating, voiding, and setting aside their adoption of the

27 Reach Code and any actions taken under or pursuant to it; and
28

4. For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5,
2 Government Code section 800, and all applicable law.

3 C. On the Third Cause of Action

1. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction directed to
5 Defendants' unlawful enactment and enforcement of the Reach Code, and preventing the Reach
6 Code from being enforced or given effect in any manner;

7 2. For a declaration that the Reach Code is invalid; and

8 3. For a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of the Reach Code.
9 D. On All Causes of Action

10 1. For costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as provided by law, including but
11 not limited to attorneys' fees provided by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
12 2. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

16 CEQA ACTION

17

18 Petitioner and Plaintiff William P. Gallaher, an individual ("Petitioner"), alleges as
19 follows:

20 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

21 1. Petitioner is an individual, over the age of eighteen who regularly conducts business
22 in the City of Santa Rosa.

23 2. Respondent and Defendant City of Santa Rosa ("City") is and at all relevant times
24 was a political and legal subdivision of the State of California, duly organized and existing under
25 and pursuant to the laws of the State of California.

26 3. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of Santa Rosa ("Council") is,
27 and at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the City existing
28 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The Council is, and at relevant times
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 was, the local body charged with proposing, drafting, amending and passing legislation governing
2 land use and the City's municipal affairs, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all applicable
3 federal, state, and local law.

4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued
1 5 herein as DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, and will amend this complaint to set forth their true names
6 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based

7 thereon alleges, that some fictitiously named Respondents were the agents and employees of the
8 other fictitiously named, or actually named, Respondents and, acting within the course of scope of
9 such employment or agency, took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are the
10 principals and took some part in such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-named
11 Respondents are liable to Petitioner for the relief prayed for herein.
12 5. Respondents and Defendants identified in paragraphs 2 through 4 above, inclusive,
13 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "Respondents."
14 6. This action challenges the approval by the City of a so-called "reach code" via
15 "Ordinance No. ORD-2019-019 Entitled: Ordinance of the Council of the City of Santa Rosa
16 Adopting by Reference, With Local Amendments, the 2019 California Energy Code Including
17 All-Electric, Low-Rise Residential Reach Code" ("Reach Code"), which ordinance was passed by
18 the Council on second reading on November 19, 2019.
19 7. A "reach code" is so called because it "reaches" beyond the ordinary standards of a
20| building or energy code to impose greater restrictions on building and development. Reach codes
21 in California are optional and can only be enacted if specific procedures are followed. Here, the
22 Reach Code forbids the inclusion of natural gas or propane plumbing in new low-rise residential
23l construction in the City.

24 8. Despite the fact that enactment of the Reach Code constituted a discretionary
25 project affecting the use and occupancy of land and structures in the City, and having the potential
26 for reasonably foreseeable and potentially significant adverse physical changes in the
27 environment, the City enacted the Reach Code without undertaking environmental review as
28 required by, and therefore in violation of, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA";
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) and its implementing CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs.,
2 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).

3 9. The enactment of a reach code is governed by section 10-106 of the 2019 Building
4 Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings, title 24, part 6 of the
5 California Code of Regulations (*Reach Code Law"). Before enacting the Reach Code, the Reach

6 Code Law required that the City adopt "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective."
7 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The City's determination was based on a
co document entitled "2019 Cost-effectiveness Study: Low-Rise Residential New Construction"

9 dated July 17, 2019 ("Study"), whose material conclusions are contradicted by a separate study
10 entitled "Residential Building Electrification in California." The Reach Code Law also requires
11 the submittal of an application to the Executive Director of the California State Energy Resources
12 Conservation and Development Commission that includes "[a]ny findings, determinations,
13 declarations or reports, including any negative declaration or environmental impact report,
14 required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section
15 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.)
16 10. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the City's full compliance with the law
17 regarding the City's approval of the Reach Code, including adhering to the requirements of CEQA.
18 Petitioner has personal, professional, environmental and other interests which will be severely
19| injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA and the Reach Code Law. Petitioner lives
20| close by the City and regularly does business there, including developing projects that would be
21 subject to the Reach Code. Moreover, the Reach Code's impacts are necessarily regional in nature,
22 thereby impacting residents throughout Sonoma County.

23 11. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by
24 the City's failure to comply with CEQA and approval of the Reach Code. Petitioner has expressed
25 his concerns and objections to the approval of the Reach Code in correspondence to the City.
26 Before approving the Reach Code, the City owed a mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties
27 which Petitioner alleges were violated. Petitioner has the right to enforce the mandatory duties
28 which CEQA imposes on the City,
| GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

12. The City is the lead agency for purposes of CEQA compliance.
2 13. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the City's
3 approval of the Reach Code is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.

4 14. Petitioner exhausted its administrative remedies to the extent required by law by
5 objecting to the approval of the Reach Code in writing and presenting all alleged grounds for non-
compliance with CEQA and the Reach Code Law to the City prior to the close of the public hearing
7 at which the City considered adoption of the Reach Code. (Tomlinson v. County of Alameda (2012)
8 54 Cal.4th 281.)

9 15. On December 6, 2019, Petitioner's counsel requested a copy of any notice of
10 exemption filed by the City for the adoption of the Reach Code. As of the filing of this petition the
11 City has not responded to that request. According to the County of Sonoma CEQA postings
12 database (https://crarecords.sonomacounty.ca.gov/selfserviceweb/, the City filed a notice of
13 exemption for the Reach Code on December 12, 2019. Petitioner will timely file this Petition for
14 Writ of Mandate on or before January 16, 2020, a date not more than thirty-five (35) days after the
15  filing of the notice of exemption as required by Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision
16| (d).

17 16. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Intent to File Suit to be served on the City as
18 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent
19 to File Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

20 17. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Office of the
21 Attorney General for the State of California not more than ten (10) days after the commencement of
22 this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure
23 section 388.

24 18. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general to vindicate his own legal

25 and constitutional rights and those of residents of the City and all others who may be impacted by
26 the Reach Code. Petitioner seeks, on his own behalf and the behalf of said others, that Respondents
27 obey the clear law, conduct required environmental reviews of their discretionary actions, require
28 appropriate and feasible mitigation for their significant impacts, and not act in unlawful, bad faith,
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

arbitrary, capricious, and confiscatory fashion in noticing, analyzing, enacting and enforcing local
2 land use legislation.

L 19.

4 For these reasons, and others set forth in this Petition and Complaint, the City's

5 actions described herein and the Reach Code are unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioner
therefore requests this Court issue writ of mandate invalidating the Reach Code and declaring it,
6 and any actions undertaken thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioner also

7 seeks declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and temporary,

9 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Reach Code in any

manner.

10 20.

11 An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner, on the one hand, and
Respondents, on the other hand, relating to the legal rights of the respective parties. The
12 controversy is well-defined and imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of,
13 judicial determinations at this time is warranted.

14

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of CEQA -

17 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5 -

18 21. Against All Respondents)
The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 20, above, are hereby incorporated herein by
19 reference as though set forth in full.

20 22. The ordinance adopting the Reach Code is a "project" that is subject to CEQA
21 review. The CEQA Guidelines, in relevant part, define "project" as "the whole of an action, which
22 has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
23 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following: (1) An
24 activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to... enactment and
25 amendment of zoning ordinances....* (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed,
26 under CEQA's broad definition of a "project," municipal ordinances, laws and regulations affecting
27 the use of land or structures have consistently been held to be CEQA "projects" over the course of
28 many decades.
II GLLR156457\2202838.2 -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 23. The staff report for the Reach Code cites three exemptions: the Class 7 exemption
2 under section 15307 of the CEQA Guidelines, the Class 8 exemption under section 15308 of the
3 Guidelines, and the "common sense" exemption under section 15061, subdivision (b)(3).

4 24. CEQA's co-called "common sense" exemption may properly be invoked only when

5 the lead agency can declare "with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question

6 may have a significant effect on the environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)
7 Thus, it is the City's burden to provide support for application of the common sense exemption, not
co Petitioner's burden to disprove its applicability. Any legitimate reasonable question about whether
9 a project might have a significant impact means the project cannot be exempt under the "common
10 sense" exemption. To invoke the common sense exemption, the City was required to consider
11 factual evidence and data relating to possible environmental impacts of the Reach Code, and that
12 consideration must be supported by evidence in the administrative record. (Muzzy Ranch Co. V.
13 Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386-387.)
14 25. With respect to 7 the Class 7 and 8 exemptions, such can only be used for an action
15 that constitutes a preservation of the environment. The Reach Code cannot be said to rise to this
16 standard as it merely substitutes one source of energy for another, without any sufficient analysis as
17 to whether that substitution will actually yield any benefit to the environment. (Dunn-Edwards
18 Corp. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644; International
19 Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App.3d 265.)
20 The City cannot undertake a "net benefit" environmental analysis - i.e., reasoning that the project's
21 environmental benefits in one area outweigh its significant adverse effects in another area or areas
22 of environmental impact - as such is not permitted under CEQA. (County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 v.
23 County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1577, 1580.) "There may be environmental costs to
24 an environmentally beneficial project, which must be considered and assessed." (California Farm
25 Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)

26 26. Moreover, to qualify for the Class 8 exemption the City must have a regulatory
27 process to protect the environment that is effectively equivalent to CEQA. The Reach Code lacks
28

GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 any such regulatory process, and the City has no other regulatory program that would fulfill
2 CEQA's purpose here.

3 27. Neither the common sense nor the class 7 or 8 exemptions apply here. The Reach
4 Code may have a number of significant impacts on the environment, none of which the City has
analyzed. These include the following:
a) Hazards/Public Safety. The Reach Code was passed a at a time when the supply of
7 electrical power to the City and surrounding communities may be less reliable and
8 subject to more and longer planned outages than ever before. In October of 2019 the
a City and surrounding area were subject to prolonged electricity blackouts and

10 wildfires which may have been caused by electrical infrastructure. But the City

11 failed to analyze how all-electric residential construction would exacerbate these

12 impacts. Without adequate battery storage of electricity, or an alternative power
13 source, such as natural gas which powers backup generators cook-stoves and grills,

14 and other appliances, "all-electric" homes and businesses will be subject to hazards

15 and risks to public safety during outages when heat, life-saving medical equipment,

16 lighting, water, refrigeration, food, and air conditioning may be unavailable. Given
17 the risk of blackouts, some residents will rely on propane or gasoline generators or

18 other combustible sources of power, which are more prone to accident or spillage
19 than fixed natural gas lines. There has been no study or analysis of the risks or

20 impacts associated with such increased usage, including air quality, GHG, and fire
21 impacts.

22 The 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history, was apparently caused by

23 electrical transmission lines. There is no analysis whatsoever in the administrative

24 record as to any potential increase in fire risk from expanded electrical service

25 facilities which the Reach Code would necessitate.

26 b) Utilities/Service Systems/Wildfire. The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G checklist -

27 a template for the initial study the City is required to conduct under CEQA - requires

28 evaluation of the question of whether the project would "[r]equire or result in the
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 relocation or construction of new or expanded .. electric power, natural gas, or
telecommunications facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
environmental effects?" Projects requiring significant new construction to rely

O solely on electricity as a power source clearly have the potential to result in the

~ installation, upgrading, and/or maintenance of associated infrastructure (e.g., roads,

00 fuel breaks, power lines), and where such occurs in or near areas of high fire hazard

9 the resulting environmental impacts must also be studied. (See Appendix G, Section

10 XX WILDFIRE [listing potential impacts such as impairment of adopted emergency

11 response and evacuation plans, exacerbation of wildfire risks, and other human

12 safety and environmental risks and impacts].) And, as noted above, the most deadly

13 fire in California history was started not by natural gas facilities, but by electrical

14 lines. Moreover, also as noted above, increased generator use may give rise to its
own increased risk of fire.

15

16 c) Similarly, the administrative record does not analyze whether the existing electrical

17 grid is sufficient to satisfy the demand of all new construction under a 100%

18 electricity standard. Given PG&E's warnings about potential blackouts, the grid's

19 ability to handle this new demand is questionable at best. Moreover, the City did not

20 sufficiently discuss the sources of the additional electricity required under the reach

21 Code, nor the impacts related to those sources. Electric power generation powered

22 plants fueled by natural gas or other non-renewable energy sources will obviously

23 negate the supposed benefit of gas-free construction. Wind and solar sources also

24 have their own well-known adverse impacts relating to wildlife, aesthetics, etc.

25 They are also subject to supply issues depending on weather and other conditions.

26 And hydroelectric power comes with its own suite of adverse impacts as well,

27 including harm to anadromous fish and other species and the risk of failure and flood

28 (as with the Oroville Dam crisis of 2017). In fact, hydroelectric facilities in
California and the west are being removed, making this source of power uncertain
for future electricity needs.
II GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 d) GHG/Air Quality In passing the Reach Code the City assumed that GHGs are the
2 only environmental concern and impact at issue; such a facile assumption is clearly
3 incorrect. The Reach Code would eliminate natural gas-powered heaters, stoves,
water heaters, built-in outdoor barbeques, gas burning fireplaces, fire pits, and, as
5 noted above, gas-powered backup generators to protect against losses, disruptions
6 and safety problems from blackouts of a fragile and overburdened electrical grid.
7 Alternative fuel sources - such as wood, gasoline, propane or charcoal - exist for
8 many of these amenities, and could be substituted for the cleaner-burning natural gas
that the proposal would eliminate, leading to greater GHG emissions and air quality
10 impacts. Such unintended, but clearly reasonably foreseeable, adverse
11 environmental consequences must be fully evaluated under CEQA. (See, e.g.,
12 Rodeo Citizens Association v. County of Contra Costa (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 214
13 [recognizing that to extent captured butane and propane were used to displace use of
14 other fuels such as coal, home heating fuel, fuel oil, diesel, kerosene, gasoline and
15 ethanol, they would also displace GHG emissions otherwise resulting from use of
16 those alternate fuels].) For example, propane barbeques produce only one-third of
17 the GHG emissions of charcoal barbeques (id. at p. 226), and natural gas is similarly
18 a much cleaner burning fuel than propane, charcoal, wood or gasoline. Moreover,
19 the increased use of gasoline, diesel, or propane generators may also give rise to air

20 quality and/or GHG impacts that are completely unanalyzed in the administrative

21 record.

22 e Population and Housing/Human Impacts. Projects that would displace substantial

23 numbers of people or housing, or render housing unaffordable, may have significant
24 adverse impacts on the environment and human beings that require CEQA analysis

25 and mitigation. (See CEQA Guidelines, Appdx. G, Section XIV.) To the extent the

26 Reach Code could, for example, substantially increase the cost of new multi-family
27 apartment dwelling construction and/or retrofitting, it could lead to increased rents,

28 unaffordable housing, and tenant displacement from the same, with resulting adverse
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 human impacts. Alternatively, renters or home buyers may prefer residences with
2 traditional gas appliances and therefore show a greater propensity to move outside of
the City and commute. This may also impact the supply of housing in the City.
Residential displacement, in and of itself, has been recognized as a significant
5 adverse environmental impact subject to CEQA analysis and mitigation. (Lincoln
6 Place Tenants Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425 [holding
7 CEQA mitigation measures designed to mitigate tenant displacement impacts of
8 project, contained in a vesting tentative map, were enforceable and did not conflict
a possess the power under existing law "to mitigate with Ellis Act].) Public entities
10 adverse impacts on displaced tenants." (San Francisco Apartment Assn. v. City and
11 County of San Francisco (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 463, 484, citing Pieri v. City and
12 County of San Francisco (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 886, 892; see Gov. Code,
13 § 7060.1.) As explained by the Lincoln Place Court of Appeal, "CEQA... is made
14 relevant... by the Ellis Act's explicit exceptions for public agency's power to
15 regulate, among other things,... the mitigation of adverse impacts on persons
16 displaced by reason of the withdrawal of rental accommodations. Such items are the
17 common focus and byproducts of the CEQA process..." (Lincoln Place Tenants
18 Assn., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at 451, emph. added.) Indeed, the Supreme Court has
19 recently reaffirmed "that CEQA addresses human health and safety" and "that public
20 health and safety are of great importance in the statutory scheme." (California
21 Building Industry Assn. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th
22 369, 386, citations omitted.) CEQA's "express language... requires a finding of a

23 "significant effect on the environment" ([Pub. Resources Code,] § 21083(b)(3))
whenever the "environmental effects of a project will cause substantial effects on 24

25 human beings, either directly or indirectly.?%* (Id. at p. 386, emphasis in original.)
26 f) Land Use/Planning. Given the foregoing, the City failed to adequately analyze the

27 Reach Code's consistency with its General Plan. While the City has discretion in
28 interpreting and applying its General Plan, it cannot do SO in a way that frustrates the
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 purpose of the General Plan. (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County
2 Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-381.) The analysis in the
3 administrative record is far too brief to fully address the proposed ordinance's
4 consistency with the General Plan and its overall purpose.

5 28. Given the foregoing, the Reach Code may have any number of potentially significant

6 impacts on the environment, which makes the City's reliance on the common sense and Class 7 and
7 8 exemptions improper.

8 29. Even if the Reach Code were subject to a categorical exemption, it is clear that the
9 unusual circumstances exception would apply, rendering the exemptions inapplicable. (Cal Code
10 Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports a finding that the project
11 presents unusual circumstances giving rise to the impacts discussed herein. These unusual
12 circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following: PG&E's express planned electricity
13 service interruptions and/or blackouts that will potentially last for days in this and other Sonoma
14 County areas, creating very serious health and safety problems if power is actually out that long and
15 not resumed from a non-grid source; the jurisdiction and cumulative study area jurisdictions are in
16 very high fire danger areas, increasing both the likelihood and seriousness of electricity blackouts;
17 there are well-known serious traffic problems on Highway 101 making even longer commutes to
18 the City by displaced homebuyers and renters who want a choice other than all-electric more
19 environmentally harmful. Accordingly, even assuming arguendo a categorical exemption applies,
20 there is more than a fair argument that the adoption of the ordinance may have significant adverse
21 environmental effects due to unusual circumstances which require actual analysis in a legally
22 adequate initial study and appropriate environmental document pursuant to CEQA.

23 30. The City's reliance on exemptions also overlooks the Reach Code's potential for
24 contributing to significant and adverse cumulative impacts. (Cal Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2,
25 subd. (b).) If other jurisdictions in Sonoma County or Northern California more broadly enact
26 similar ordinances, the increase in the demand for electricity will be potentially much greater than
27 that from the City's alone, and so would the related impacts.

28

GLLR156457\2202838.2 -11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

31. Section 10-106 of the Building Energy Efficiency Standards upon which the City
2 relied to enact the Reach Code requires the submission of materials in support of an application for
3 a reach code. The specific submittals required do not extend to a notice of claimed exemption but a

4 "negative declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California
5 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
6 24, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4).) The provision clearly does not contemplate the use of an exemption
7 because the Reach Code will invariably require at least an initial study and appropriate
environmental analysis under CEQA. Thus, the reliance on an exemption here is in error under the
9 very authority upon which the City has relied to enact it.

10 32. Accordingly, there was no basis in law or fact for the City to conclude that adoption
11 of the Reach Code was exempt under CEQA.
12 33. Under CEQA, a lead agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to
13 proceed in the manner required by law; or (2) its decision is not supported by the evidence. (Pub.
14 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) By deeming the Reach Code exempt from CEQA review,
15 Respondents abused their discretion in failing to comply with CEQA and failing to proceed in the
16| manner required by law. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, government decision-
17 makers have been deprived of critical information essential to informal and intelligent decision-
18 making, and Petitioner and other members of the public have been deprived and harmed in that
19 they were not fully informed about the significant environmental impacts of the Reach Code and
20 potentially feasible ways to mitigate them prior to Respondents' enactment of the same.
21 Petitioner, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief
22 requested herein is not granted, as the Reach Code will be implemented in the absence of a full
23 and adequate environmental review under CEQA. For the foregoing reasons, inter alia, Petitioner
24 seeks an immediate stay of the Reach Code.
25 34. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him to
26 address Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required and not excused, and any further
27 attempts would in any event have been an idle and futile exercise even if available. Petitioner has
28 no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the Reach Code,
GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and a writ of ordinary mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 is the
2 prescribed remedy for violations of this type. Petitioner is herewith or shortly will be filing and
3 serving on Respondents his election to prepare the administrative record pursuant to Public

4 Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (b)(2), and all other applicable laws. Petitioner has also
5 performed all other conditions precedent to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service of

6 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the
requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and mail service of the petition on the
8 California Attorney General no more than ten (10) days after its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., § 388).
35. The adoption of the Reach Code are in violation of CEQA and the CEQA
10 Guidelines.

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
12

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106 -

15 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5 -

16 Against All Respondents)

36.
17 The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 35, above, are hereby incorporated by

18 reference as though set forth in full.

37.
19 Section 10-106 of the Reach Code Law requires that a jurisdiction enacting a reach

20 code satisfy certain substantive and procedural requirements. As noted above, the City was

21 required to make "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24,

22 pt. 6, 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The City relied upon the Study to make this determination. However,

23 the Study was prepared for PG&E, and based on information and belief, the City did not prepare

24 any other materials to comply with the Reach Code Law.

38.
25 The Study concludes that there will be a cost savings associated with all-electric

26 low-rise residential uses with respect to consumer bills and lifecycle costs based on a "Statewide

27 Electric Residential Average Rate" of 2% per year from 2020 to 2025 and 1% thereafter. However,

28 an April 2019 study that was also authored by Frontier Energy, Inc. showed an increase in costs for

GLLR\56457\2202838.2 -13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 "Bay Area" consumers purchasing new homes based specifically on PG&E electric rates, which
2 would be applicable to the City. In support of its conclusion, the April 2019 study states that

3 "PG&E's electric rates are assumed to increase faster than the natural gas rates due to wildfire risk

4 and liability...." Based on the failure of the Study to account for specific PG&E electric rates and
the evidence that based upon electric rates specific to PG&E, costs would increase, the City has

6 failed to show that the Reach Code would be cost effective. Moreover, the Study fails to account
for tiered electricity pricing and fails to analyze how that would apply to all-electric construction
8 under the Reach Code. It also is not clear as to whether all-electric construction would lead to
9 residential units that cannot meet the requirements of the Building Energy Efficiency standards in
10 Part 6 of Title 24, which would preclude building altogether. The City could therefore not make the
11 proper determination under the Reach Code Law to pass the Reach Code.

12 39. The Reach Code Law also requires the submittal of an application to the Executive
13 Director of the California State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that
14 includes "[a]ny findings, determinations, declarations or reports, including any negative
15 declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California Environmental
16 Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106,
17 subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.) As noted above, the City did a not prepare a negative declaration or
18 EIR in support of the Reach Code. Accordingly, it cannot make the requisite submittal under the
19 Reach Code Law.

20 40. Respondents' action in adopting the Reach Code was therefore arbitrary and
21 capricious and/or constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed
22| in a manner required by law.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

24 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

26 Against All Respondents)

27 41. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 40, above, are hereby incorporated by
28 reference as though set forth in full.
GLLR156457\2202838.2 -14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

42. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and the

3 Respondents. Petitioner contends that the Reach Code is invalid due to Respondents' failure to

4 follow CEQA and/or the Reach Code Law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis

Ur alleges, that Respondents contend that the Reach Code is valid and enforceable and was properly
enacted.

6 43. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the validity of the Reach Code. In
7 particular, Petitioner desires a declaration that the Reach Code is invalid and unenforceable due to
8 Respondents' failure to follow CEQA and the Reach Code Law.

9 44. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Petitioner
10 and similarly situated persons. understand their rights and obligations with respect to the Reach
11 Code.

12 45. Petitioner also seeks to enjoin Respondents from applying or enforcing the Reach
13 Code, and to require that Respondents rescind their approval of the Reach Code.
14

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

A. On the First Cause of Action

16 1. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction directed to
17 Respondents' and Defendants' unlawful enactment and enforcement of the Reach Code without
18 required CEQA review, analysis and mitigation as required by law, and for a peremptory writ of
19 ordinary mandamus invalidating, voiding, and setting aside the adoption of Reach Code and any
20 actions taken under or pursuant to it;
21 2. For attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5,
22 Government Code section 800, and all applicable law.

23 B. On the Second Cause of Action

24 3. For a stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary injunction directed to
25 Respondents' and Defendants' unlawful enactment and enforcement of Reach Code, and for a
