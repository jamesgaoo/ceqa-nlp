20 Petitioner TRINITY ACTION ASSOCIATION, INC. (*PETITIONER") alleges as follows:

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 1. PETITIONER, through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), seeks to

23 compel RESPONDENTS to perform their mandatory statutory duties pursuant to: (a) the California

24 Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000, et seq., and 14 Calif. Code of Regs. §§

25 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines") (collectively "CEQA"), by first recognizing that its commercial

26 cannabis cultivation license approvals and renewals are subject to CEQA, and then by performing

27 the various environmental review requirements of CEQA law for each such "project"; and (b) the

28 California Public Records Act (Government Code §§ 6250 et seq.) (the "CPRA"), by disclosing

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page

1 public documents associated with the RESPONDENT's approval and renewal of commercial

2 cannabis cultivation licenses in Trinity County to PETITIONER and the public generally.
3 2. PETITIONER is a California domestic non-profit corporation in good standing, whose

4 members are concerned residents of and property owners within Trinity County, California.

5 3. RESPONDENT COUNTY is a political subdivision of the State of California, and is

6 governed by the Trinity County Board of Supervisors.

7 4. RESPONDENT RICHARD TIPPETT is the Trinity County Department of

8 Transportation, Building and Planning Director. PETITIONER is informed and believes, and thereon

0 alleges, that this respondent is authorized by the COUNTY to and acts as the Trinity County
10 Planning Director, and is the primary official responsible for COUNTY compliance with CEQA in
11 the approval and renewal, and issuance, of licenses under COUNTY adopted commercial cannabis
12 cultivation ordinances.

13 5. The true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to the

14 Petitioner, and Petitioner therefore sues those RESPONDENTS by such fictitious names.
15 PETITIONER is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of said DOES parties 1
16 through 10 have jurisdiction by law over implementation of one or more aspects of the Trinity
17 County Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Ordinances. PETITIONER is informed and believes and

18 thereon alleges that, at all times mentioned herein, each of the RESPONDENTS was the agent,

19 partner, joint venturer, employee, employer, principal, subsidiary, owner, continuation, and/or alter
20 ego of each of the other RESPONDENTS, and, in doing the things alleged herein, were acting
21 within the scope of such agency, partnership, venture, employment, or relationship, with the
22 ratification and consent of each of the other RESPONDENTS.

23 6. The true names and capacities of ROES 1 through 10, inclusive, including but not limited
24 to those persons or entities that have been issued Trinity County Commercial Cannabis Cultivation
25 Licenses during the 180-days preceding the filing of this petition that are listed on the Trinity County
26 Planning Department document appended as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by reference, are
27 unknown to the PETITIONER, and PETITIONER therefore sues those RESPONDENTS by such
28 fictitious names. The individually named RESPONDENTS have refused, and continue to refuse, to

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 2

1 disclose the identities of such entities and individuals which/who submitted applications for

2 Commercial Cannabis Cultivation licenses in Trinity County, and to which/whom such licenses have

3 been approved and issued, and which are therefore real parties in interest in this proceeding.
A PETITIONER is not otherwise aware that any real parties in interest exist.
1o JURISDICTION AND VENUE, ETC.
7. Pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA where no
7 hearing is required), Government Code §§ 6258 (judicial review under the Public Records Act),
8 Code of Civil Procedure $§1085 et seq. (traditional mandate), the Court has jurisdiction to issue
9

10 peremptory and permanent writs of mandate, ordering that RESPONDENT COUNTY discontinue

11 its CEQA and PRA violations, as alleged herein.

12 8. This action challenges the actions and failures to act of RESPONDENT COUNTY and its

13 officers and employees, which actions and omissions have occurred and continue to occur in Trinity
14 County. Thus, the Trinity County Superior Court is the proper venue for this matter pursuant to Code
15

16 of Civil Procedure §§ 393(b) (actions against public officers), 394 (actions against a county), and

17 395 (actions generally).

18 9. On January 3, 2019, before the commencement of this action, PETITIONER served

19 written notice of the then impending commencement of this action on the RESPONDENT
20 COUNTY Board of Supervisors in accordance with the requirements of Public Resources Code
21

22 section 21167.5. True and correct copies of this Notice and a Proof a of Service thereof are appended

23 as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein by this reference.

24 10. On January 3, 2019, PETITIONER also notified the Attorney General of the State of

25 California of the filing of this Petition and furnished him with a copy of thereof in accordance with
26 the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section
27

28 388. A true and correct copy of this Notice and its Proof of Service are appended hereto as

Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein by this reference.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page

1 11. PETITIONER has standing as a party beneficially interested in the issuance of the
2 requested writs of mandate because the RESPONDENTS' acts and omissions, as alleged more
3

t 1 specifically herein, have had and will continue to have significant adverse environmental impacts on
PETITIONER, its members and the public generally, with the magnitude of such impacts to be fully

e made known only upon the issuance of writs of mandate ordering RESPONDENTS to fully comply

7 with CEQA and the CPRA. PETITIONER has a beneficial interest in RESPONDENTS' fulfillment

8 of their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.
9
IRREPARABLE HARM
10
12. PETITIONER has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. If 11

12 RESPONEDENTS continue to approve and renew, and then issue, commercial cannabis cultivation

13 licenses in violation of the law as alleged herein, PETITIONER and the public generally will be
14 irreparably harmed because of the resulting significant unexamined and unmitigated environmental
15 impacts that will occur before RESPONDENTS address them in an open and otherwise proper 16

manner. 17

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 18

(Writ of Mandate - CEQA Compliance) 19

20 MANDATORY COUNTY CEQA ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DUTY

21 13. PETITIONER incorporates all prior paragraphs of this Petition as though fully alleged
herein. 22
14. Under CEQA, a "project" is defined as "the whole of an action" directly undertaken, 23
supported, or authorized by a California public agency "which may cause either a direct physical 24

25 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

26 environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21065; 14 Cal. Code of Regs. § 15378(a).) The CEQA Guidelines

27 list "issuance to a person of a license, permit, or entitlement" as a "project." (CEQA Guidelines

28 § 15378(a)(3).) Thus each COUNTY's approval and issuance of an individual, site-specific
commercial cannabis cultivation license, and any renewal of such a license, like similar land-use

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 4

1 approvals, is a "project" requiring compliance with CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21165; CEQA

2 Guidelines § 15367.)

3 15. COUNTY compliance with CEQA, when it approves and issues commercial cannabis

4 cultivation licenses, is its statutory responsibility because it "has the primary responsibility for

5 carrying out or approving" such projects in Trinity County, and is therefore the "lead agency" in

6 approving such projects under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21165; CEQA Guidelines § 15367.)

7 16. CEQA requires site specific analysis of significant potential adverse environmental

8 impacts of each proposed project, including the approval or renewal, and resulting issuance, of

9 individual commercial cannabis cultivation licenses, even where no public hearing is required by

10 law, unless a specific CEQA exception or exemption is established: (a) by state law (see, e.g., CEQA

11 Guidelines § 15260 et seq.); or (b) as provided for in CEQA implementing regulations and set forth

12 in the "CEQA Guidelines" as "categorical exemptions." (Pub. Res. Code § 21084; CEQA

13 Guidelines § 15300 et seq.)

14 17. Examples of categorical exemptions sometimes used by local lead agencies include those
15 based on proposed project location (e.g., minor alteration to land (CEQA Guidelines § 15304); and

16 minor alterations in land use limitations (CEQA Guidelines § 15304)). However, and importantly

17 here, no categorical exemption from CEQA can be relied on by a lead agency such as the COUNTY

18 to avoid substantive compliance with CEQA when the cumulative impact of successive projects of

19 the same type, in the same place, over time, is significant (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2 (b)); § where

20 "there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment

21 due to unusual circumstances" (CEQA Guidelines 15300.2 (c)); or where a project "may result in

22 damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings,

23 or similar resources" close to a state scenic highway (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2 (d)). As a result,

24 for the reasons alleged in this Petition, no categorical exemption can be relied on by the COUNTY to

25 avoid CEQA compliance before its approval or renewal, and resulting issuance, of commercial

26 cannabis cultivation licenses.

27 18. The overall CEQA process to be complied with by the COUNTY as the lead agency,
28 before approving or renewing a proposed commercial cannabis cultivation license, is illustrated in

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 5

1 "Appendix A" to the CEQA Guidelines (the so called "CEQA Process Flow Chart"), a true and
2 correct copy of which is appended as Exhibit "D" and incorporated by reference.
3 19. In order for the COUNTY to comply with CEQA in approving or renewing a proposed
4 commercial cannabis cultivation license it is required to: (a) determine if there is a possibility that
5 the proposed license may result in a significant effect on the environment; (b) prepare an "initial

6 study" in order to decide whether to prepare an "environmental impact report" (EIR) or a "negative
7 declaration" (or "mitigated negative declaration") before approving the license; (c) notify all interest

8 public agencies of the form of environmental analysis document proposed before license approval
9 and issuance; (d) prepare and make that CEQA document available for interested public agency and
10 general public review and consider resulting comments before approving and issuing the proposed
11 license; (e) consider and approve the final CEQA document that has been prepared in a manner
12 consistent with CEQA, based on lead agency investigation, analysis and mitigation of the individual
13 proposed license impacts and cumulative impacts, before approving the proposed license; and (f)
14 provide public notice of its final CEQA determination for each approved project. (See Exhibit E, the
15 CEQA Process Flow Chart; and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002 - 21006; CEQA Guidelines §§15002-
16 15004 and 15020 et seq.)
17 20. The specific ways by which a lead agency such as the COUNTY must notify and inform
18 other interested agencies about the proposed commercial cannabis license approval and its proposed
19 form of CEQA review is by preparation, and publication and delivery to such agencies, of: (a) a
20 notice of its intention to prepare an EIR for the proposed project; or (b) a notice of its intent to adopt
21 a negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration for the project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.4,
22 21091, 21092, 21091.2, 21092.3, 21092.4, 21092.6 and 21098; and CEQA Guidelines §§ 15072 and
23 15075.)

24 21. If the COUNTY, as the lead agency, determines not to approve a proposed commercial
25 cannabis cultivation license it is not required to first approve a proposed CEQA environmental
26 review document, to identify and mitigate the significant adverse environmental impacts associated
27 with that proposed project. But if the lead agency does determine to approve such a proposed project
28 it must formally approve that CEQA document in the form finally proposed, after considering and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 6

1 addressing interested agency and public comments received. Such an approval of the EIR or

2 Negative Declaration (or Mitigated Negative Declaration) prepared for each project pursuant to

3 CEQA is an absolute prerequisite to approval of a proposed commercial cannabis cultivation license

4 project that is not exempt from CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081 and 21159.26;

5 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070 et seq., 15074, 15080 et seq., and 15092.)

6 22. Within five days after deciding to approve a proposed cannabis cultivation license project

7 the project, following the preparation of an EIR or Negative Declaration for such a project,

8 RESPONDENT COUNTY is required to file a "Notice of Determination" of its CEQA decision with

9 the Trinity County Clerk. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080, 21108, 21152 and 21167; CEQA Guidelines §§

10 15075 and 15094.)

11 23. COUNTY officers and employees, as the lead agency representatives required to comply

12 with CEQA as herein alleged, are required to exercise some discretion. This is because when a

13 government agency or its authorized officers adopt a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Declaration or

14 EIR in order to comply with CEQA they must exercise independent judgment and analysis. But

15 where the exercise of such discretion is required, and when compliance with CEQA requires no

16 public hearings as is generally the case in the approval and issuance of commercial cannabis

17 cultivation licenses in Trinity County, the COUNTY and its officers must still perform those CEQA

18 requirements that the law clearly, presently and specifically requires before properly approving or

19 renewing any such license.

20 COUNTY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION

21 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS & CEQA REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

22 24. The COUNTY, on or about October 3, 2017, enacted Ordinance No. 315-823, a true and

23 correct copy of which is appended as Exhibit "E" and fully incorporated herein by this reference.
24 Ordinance No. 315-823 established a commercial cannabis cultivation licensing process in Trinity
25

26 County that requires review and approval of each individual applications for such licenses by the

27 Trinity County Planning Director, or his designee.

28 25. COUNTY enactment of Ordinance 315-823 followed an initial effort by

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 7

1 RESPONDENTS to attempt to comply with CEQA by preparing a draft "Tnitial Study

2 Environmental Checklist and Evaluation of Environmental Impact for the Trinity County
0 7 1n0 Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Ordinance," that was circulated for public comment but never

completed or considered by the Trinity County Board of Supervisors before enacting this ordinance.

PETITIONER's written comments to the COUNTY concerning CEQA compliance, with concerning

7 the then proposed ordinance and license specific and cumulative environmental impacts associated

8 with proposed license approvals are appended as Exhibit "E» and incorporated herein by reference.
50 26. In enacting Ordinance 315-823, and thereby exercising the COUNTY's statutory right to

11 regulate local commercial cannabis cultivation activities, the Trinity County Board of Supervisors

12 made explicit findings that there are significant adverse environmental impacts associated with

13 cannabis cultivation in Trinity County, but found that ordinance adoption itself was exempt from

14 CEQA as follows:
15 "The County finds that this ordinance is exempt from the California
16 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Business and Professions

17 Code section 26055(h) until July 1, 2019 because this ordinance requires
discretionary review for the individual licenses that are provided for within
18 [Ordinance No. 315-823]."

19 27. The COUNTY, by action of its Board of Supervisors on February 6, 2018, enacted
20

21 Ordinance No. 315-829, a copy of which is appended as Exhibit "G" and incorporated herein by

22 this reference, and thereby amended Section 28 of the Trinity County Zoning Ordinance to further

23 address commercial cannabis cultivation license requirements. That ordinance also expressly stated
that all commercial cannabis cultivation license applications received by the COUNTY were to be
24 reviewed individually, with each requiring CEQA compliance.
25 28. On March 6, 2018, the COUNTY, again by action of its Board of Supervisors, adopted
26

27 Ordinance No. 315-830, a copy of which is also appended as Exhibit "H" and incorporated herein

28 by this reference, which further amended the COUNTY's prior adopted commercial cannabis

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 8

1 cultivation license ordinances. In enacting Ordinance No. 315-830, the COUNTY again made

2 findings regarding exemption from CEQA in ordinance enactment only, and again acknowledged the
3
7100 need for CEQA compliance before making any resulting individual license approvals, as follows:
"[Ordinance No. 315-8301 is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 26055(h) until July 1, 2019 because this Ordinance requires discretionary review for the individual licenses that are provided for within."
7

8 29. In the enactment of Ordinance Nos. 315-823, 829 & 830 (collectively hereafter the

9 "Trinity Cannabis Cultivation Ordinance" or the "TCCO") the COUNTY documented its awareness

10 of its obligation to comply with CEQA in TCCO implementation, and specifically as part of its

11 individual commercial cannabis cultivation license approvals, as alleged herein.

12 30. The COUNTY's "Commercial Cannabis Cultivation License New Application Packet", a

13 copy of which is appended as Exhibit "I" and incorporated herein by reference (the "License
14 Application"), while omitting any explicit reference to compliance with CEQA, also acknowledges

15 that CEQA compliance is required the before the COUNTY can approve any individual cannabis

16 cultivation licenses. This is made clear by the COUNTY's requirement that all such license

17 applicants agree to indemnify and hold the COUNTY and its offices and other agents harmless in the

18 event of the COUNTY'S failure "to provide related environmental clearance under the [CEQA]", by

19 executing that "Indemnification Form" that is appended as Exhibit "J" and incorporated herein by
20 reference, as a pre-condition of application approval.
21 THE COUNTY HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH CEQA REQUIREMENTS AND

22 THREATENS TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN LICENSE APPROVALS & RENEWALS

23 31. Each cannabis cultivation license application submitted to the COUNTY in accordance
24 with the TCCO is an individual "project" as that term is defined in CEQA. As alleged herein, the

25 approval of such licenses are not excepted or exempted from proper environmental review pursuant
26 to CEQA, Business and Professions Code Section 26055(h), or by any other California statutes. The

27 COUNTY must therefore fully comply with CEQA procedural and substantive requirements before

28 approving or renewing, and thereafter issuing, any such licenses.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 9

1 32. The RESPONDENTS have failed to proceed in the manner that CEQA clearly, presently

2 and specifically requires, first by failing to recognize that its commercial cannabis cultivation license

3 approvals and renewals are subject to CEQA, and then by failing to actually perform the various
specified environmental review requirements of CEQA for each such "project," when reviewing, and
100 before approving and issuing, individual commercial cannabis cultivation licenses under the
COUNTY enacted TCCO. This failure by RESPONDENTS to comply with CEQA has continued

7 despite PETITIONER representative written and oral objections to such practices, including such

8 oral objections made at a meeting with members of the Trinity County Board of Supervisors
Cannabis Sub-Committee within the past approximately 90 days, to no consequence.

10 33. Specifically, RESPONDENTS, before approving or renewing commercial cannabis

11 cultivation licenses when a public hearing is not required to be given, have failed and continue to fail

12 to: (a) initially determine if there is a possibility that each individual license issuance may result in

13 or contribute to a pre-existing significant effect on the environment; (b) prepare an "initial study" in

14 order to decide whether to prepare an "environmental impact report" (EIR) or a "negative

15 declaration" (or "mitigated negative declaration") for each proposed license; (c) notify all interest

16 public agencies of the form of environmental analysis document to be prepared for each proposed

17 license; (d) prepare and make that CEQA document available for interested public agency and

18 general public review, and consider resulting comments, before approving or renewing, and issuing,

19 each proposed license; (e) consider and approve the final CEQA document that has been prepared in

20 a manner consistent with CEQA, based on lead agency investigation, analysis and mitigation of

21 individual proposed license impacts and cumulative impacts, before approving or renewing each

22 such license under consideration; and (f) provide public notice of its final CEQA determination for

23 each license approved or renewed under the TCCO. (See Exhibit D, the CEQA Process Flow Chart;

24 and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002 - 21006 CEQA Guidelines §§15002-15004 and 15020 et seq.)

25 34. PETITIONER are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that RESPONDENTS have

26 neither undertaken nor completed any license-specific or cumulative CEQA review as required by

27 CEQA before approving and renewing, and thereafter issuing, commercial cannabis cultivation

28 licenses in Trinity County. PETITIONER is further informed and believes, and therefore alleges,

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 10

1 that there is no ongoing CEQA review being undertaken by the RESPONDENTS that properly

2 addresses individual and cumulative environmental impacts associated with any such proposed
3 license approvals or renewals. As a result, RESPONDENTS' conduct constitutes a prejudicial abuse
4 of discretion because, as alleged herein, they have failed and continue to fail to proceed in the
5 manner specifically required by CEQA law.
we 35. According to its published list of pending and approved commercial cannabis cultivation
7 license applications (Exhibit "A"), the COUNTY has approved approximately 294 licenses, which

8 PETITIONER is informed and believes has occurred with no public hearings and without CEQA

0 compliance. Each such license, which the COUNTY proposes to issue up to 500 of, is valid for only

10 one year and must then be renewed before its expiration date. Accordingly, on further information
11 and belief, in addition to threatening to approve and issue up to an additional approximately 200 new

12 licenses, PETITIONER contends that RESPONDENTS are likely to be asked to renew many of the

13 prior approved and issued licenses beginning on and after March 1, 2019, also with no public

14 hearing or CEQA compliance.

15 36. PETITIONERS, with members residing and conducting business throughout Trinity

16 County, have a substantial interest in protecting their affected properties and communities, and the
17 Trinity County environment more generally, and therefore seek to compel the RESPONDENTS to

18 comply with CEQA in their administration of the TCCO.

19 37. PETITIONER lacks an adequate remedy at law because monetary damages cannot be

20 ascertained, and because PETITIONER and its members cannot be compensated for the
21 environmental degradation caused by the activities allowed by the COUNTY'S issuance of
22

23 commercial cannabis cultivation licenses without full and timely CEQA compliance. Further, it is

24 impracticable and a waste of judicial resources for PETITIONER to challenge each discretionary

25 commercial cannabis cultivation license approved or renewed by RESPONDENTS without CEQA

26 compliance one at a time, rather than in a single lawsuit.

2 RESPONDENTS COMPLIANCE WITH CEQA

3 38. Among the significant project-specific and cumulative adverse environmental impacts

4 that the COUNTY's compliance with CEQA is required to address are those associated with Trinity
5 COUNTY recognized water quality degradation impacts to local streams, including to the Trinity
6

7 River. PETITIONER is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Trinity River, including

8 its entire watershed, provides or contributes to critical habitat for various imperiled salmonids

9 (including Coho salmon, Oncorhynchus Kisutch which is listed as threatened under both the

10 California and Federal Endangered Species Acts), and steelhead (Oncorhynchus Mykiss which is
11 listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act). This impact and related TCCO
12

13 license-specific and cumulative environmental impacts, which are associated with both licensed and

14 unlicensed commercial cannabis cultivation in Trinity County that CEQA requires consideration of,

15 have been recognized as significant by the California Department of Fish & Wildlife ("DFW").

16 DFW, the designated trustee agency in California for fish and wildlife resources pursuant to CEQA,
17 has expressed related environmental concerns to the COUNTY as recently as October 23, 2018. (See
18

19 Exhibit "K", correspondence from DFW to the COUNTY, which is incorporated herein by

20 reference.)

21 39. PETITIONERS are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that the permitting of

22 new or expanded commercial cannabis cultivation areas, and the related widening and extending of
23 roads to such cultivation sites in the already impaired Trinity River and other local watersheds, will
24

25 contribute significant additional sediment and increased turbidity to the Trinity River and other

26 Trinity County streams, which will cause or contribute to pre-existing violations of applicable water

27 quality standards and adversely impact threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead in these

28 streams.

1 40. The California Department of Transportation ("CalTrans") properly recognizes all of

2 State Route 299 between the Humboldt County and Shasta County, as it passes through Trinity
0 7 1o County on the west along the Trinity River, then through the historic areas of Oregon Mountain and
Weaverville, and again along the Trinity River in the vicinity of Douglas City, based on that
CalTrans "SR 299 Transportation Concept Report" dated September 2009 (partial copy) which is

7 appended as EXHIBIT "T2 and incorporated by reference, as a "Scenic Byway" that is rich in

8 scenic and historic resources. The individual and cumulative environmental impact of approval and
Eo issuance of commercial cannabis cultivation licenses along the SR 299 corridor in Trinity County
have not been analyzed by the COUNTY, as required by CEQA.

12 41. Potential wildfire impacts associated with new or expanded cannabis cultivation activities

13 allowed by the COUNTY's approved and issued commercial cannabis cultivation licenses, without
14 CEQA compliance following earlier COUNTY recognition of such risks, will exacerbate significant
15 preexisting wildfire risks in Trinity County in a way detrimental to the general public.
16

17 42. The COUNTY, by and through its officers and employees, has failed and continues to

18 refuse to meet its CEQA obligations in the implementation of the TCCO, and continues to disregard |

19 PETITIONER requests for such compliance in a way requiring this ordinary writ of mandate action.
20 This action involves the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and is
21

22 intended to ensure that the COUNTY and its officers and employees will comply withal applicable

23 environmental protection and related public records disclosure laws. Petitioners are therefore entitled

24 to recover their attorney's fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and

25 Government Code § 800.

26 43. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), PETITIONER has elected to
27

28 prepare the record of proceedings in this matter, and is simultaneously serving its notice of intent to
prepare said record of proceedings with the service of this Petition upon RESPONDENT COUNTY.

A true and correct copy of Petitioner's Notice of Intent to Prepare Record is appended to this Petition

2 as Exhibit "M" and incorporated herein by this reference.
6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Ordinary Mandamus - Public Records Act Violations)
5 44. PETITIONER incorporates all prior paragraphs of this Petition as though fully alleged
6
herein.
7 45. The COUNTY, by and through RESPONDENT TIPPETT and other officers and
8 employees, maintains commercial cannabis cultivation license applications and related documents in
9 a confidential, non-public manner. As a result, the COUNTY has not made and continues to be
10 unwilling to make, individual commercial cannabis cultivation applicant names and location
11 information, and related license approval documents, available to PETITIONER and the general
12 public. Instead a largely a undiscernible summary of TCCO cultivation license applications received
13 and their general status is maintained on the COUNTY Planning Department's web-site, in the form
14 illustrated by Exhibit K.
15 46. PETITIONER has requested from the COUNTY copies of all documents in its possession
16 pertaining to applications for and approvals of commercial cannabis cultivation licenses (the
17 "Cannabis License Documents"), both verbally and by written request; but the COUNTY has
18 refused, and continues to refuse, to make public and provide to PETITIONER any such Cannabis
19 License Documents, with there being no properly asserted statutory exception to mandated
20 disclosures; and the COUNTY has thereby failed, and continues to refuse to comply with the CPRA.
21 47. As a result, RESPONDENTS' conduct, by refusing to disclose Cannabis License
22

23 Documents, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged herein, they have failed

24 and continue to fail to proceed in the manner required by CPRA law, in the absence of proper

25 justification or excuse. PETITIONERS therefore seek writ of mandate relief pursuant to

26 Government Code §§ 6258 and 6259 to compel RESPONDENTS compliance with the CPRA.
27 48. PETITIONER, due to the COUNTY's failure to comply with the PRA as alleged herein,
28 and because of the significant public interest in disclosure of Cannabis License Documents for

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Page 14

1 public review and the PETITIONER's need to bring this action to compel the COUNTY to comply

2 with the PRA, is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs pursuant to Government Code section

3 6259(d).

4 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Declaratory Relief)

6 49. PETITIONER incorporates all prior paragraphs of this Petition as though fully alleged

7 herein.

8 50. The parties disagree, and are likely to continue to disagree, concerning (a)
RESPONDENT's obligations pursuant to CEQA before approving or renewing, and then issuing,

10 commercial cannabis cultivation licenses when no public hearing concerning such projects must

11 occur; and (b) concerning whether or not RESONDENTS are obligated to make records prepared,

12 obtained and otherwise retained by the COUNTY in its review and approval of such licenses must be

13 disclosed to PETITIONER and the public generally, in order for the scope and degree of related

14 individual and cumulative environmental impacts to be made know, such that there is a significant

15 present controversy between the parties concerning these issues.

16 51. Petitioner therefore seeks a judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the

17 respective parties concerning the CEQA and CPRA compliance, in light of RESPONDENT's

18 ongoing commercial cannabis cultivation license approvals and threatened license renewals, and the

19 continuing resulting controversy that can only be resolved by judicial intervention.

20 FORTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Injunction)

22 52. PETITIONER incorporates all prior paragraphs of this Petition as though fully alleged

23 herein.

24 53. Unless PETITIONER is granted preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing

25 RESPONDENTS from continuing to disregard CEQA and CPRA requirements, as alleged herein, it,

26 its members and the public generally will suffer irreparable harm associated with the undisputed

27 environmental damage to be caused by the approval and renewal, and issuance, of commercial

28 cannabis cultivation licenses throughout Trinity County.

ORDINANCE NO. 315-823

AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS
OF THE COUNTY OF TRINITY
AMENDING ZONING ORDINANCE NO. 315 CREATING
SECTION 28: COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION REGULATIONS

Section I: The Board of Supervisors of the County of Trinity, State of California, hereby finds and
declares as follows:

(1) WHEREAS, the voters of the State of California approved Proposition 215 (codified as Health and Safety Code section 11362.5 and entitled "The Compassionate Use Act of 1996").
(2) WHEREAS, the intent of Proposition 215 was to ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use Cannabis for medicinal purposes where medicinal use is deemed appro- priate and has been recommended by a physician, and to ensure that patients and their primary caregivers who obtain and use Cannabis for medicinal purposes upon the recommendation of a physician are not thereby subject to criminal prosecution or sanction. The Compassionate Use Act of 1996 further provides that "nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede legis- lation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that endangers others, or to condone the diversion of Cannabis for non-medicinal purposes."
(3) WHEREAS, the State enacted SB 420 in 2004, known as the Medical Marijuana Program Act (codified as Health and Safety Code section 11362.7 et seq.) to clarify the scope of The Com- passionate Use Act of 1996, facilitate the prompt identification of qualified patients and prima- ry caregivers, avoid unnecessary arrest and prosecution of these individuals, provide needed
guidance to law enforcement officers, promote uniform and consistent application of the Com- .passionate Use Act of 1996, enhance the access of patients and caregivers to medicinal Canna- bis through collective, cooperative cultivation projects and to allow local governing bodies to adopt and enforce rules and regulations consistent with SB 420.
(4) WHEREAS, on September 11, 2015, the State enacted the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), which took effect January 1, 2016, and which mandated a comprehen- sive state licensure and regulatory framework for cultivation, manufacture, distribution, trans- portation, testing and dispensing of medicinal Cannabis on a commercial basis, but implement- ing regulations have yet to be written and state licenses will not be available until 2018. In ad- dition, on June 27, 2016 MMRSA was amended by SB 837. (5) WHEREAS, previous landmark Cannabis legislation, including the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 and the Medical Marijuana Program Act, have precipitated a "green rush" where individ- uals have moved to Trinity County to grow Cannabis; some seeking to capitalize on ambigui- ties in the law, while others lack an awareness of community and environmental consciousness.
(6) WHEREAS, since the adoption of MMRSA, numerous sources, including law enforcement, elected officials, county administrators, neighbors and Cannabis cultivators have reported nu-
merous inquiries from individuals and entities, both from within and without Trinity County, who seek to expand their current cultivation operations, or start new ones.
(7) WHEREAS, on November 8, 2016, voters approved the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) to allow recreational use of Cannabis by adults over the age of 21.

Exhibit "EM

Ordinance No. 315-823
October 3, 2017
Page 2 of 13

(8) WHEREAS, the intent of AUMA is to allow the legal use of Cannabis for persons over the age of 21. AUMA provides that California residents are entitled to cultivate
and for personal use. up to 6 plants indoors

(9) WHEREAS, on June 27, 2017, the State adopted SB 94, the Medicinal and Adult-Use Canna- bis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), which established a comprehensive system to control and regulate the cultivation, distribution, transport, storage, manufacturing, processing and sale of both of the following: (1) Medicinal cannabis and medicinal cannabis products for
patients with valid physician's recommendations; and (2) Adult-use cannabis and adult-use
cannabis products for adults 21 years of age and over. (10) WHEREAS, local governments in California may restrict or completely ban commercial Can- nabis activities, except deliveries and transportation through local jurisdiction.
(11) WHEREAS, the Medical Marijuana Program Act defines "primary caregiver" as an individual who is designated by a qualified patient or person with an identification card, and who has con-
sistently assumed responsibility for the housing, health or safety of that patient or person. (12) WHEREAS, the right of qualified patients and their primary caregivers under State law to cul- tivate Cannabis plants for medicinal purposes does not confer upon them the right to create or maintain a public nuisance. (13) WHEREAS, Cannabis plants, whether grown indoors or outdoors, especially as they mature prior to harvest, may produce a distinctive odor that may be detectable far beyond property boundaries.
(14) WHEREAS, the strong smell of Cannabis has been deemed a nuisance and can alert persons to the location of the valuable plants, creating a risk of burglary, robbery and armed robbery. (15) WHEREAS, in recent years there has been an increased number of Cannabis related incidents of burglary, robbery and armed robbery; some including acts of violence resulting in injury or death.
(16) WHEREAS, Cannabis that is grown indoors may require excessive use of electricity which may overload standard electrical systems creating an unreasonable risk of fire. If indoor grow light- ing systems are powered by diesel generators, improper maintenance of the generators and fuel
lines and the improper storage and disposal of diesel fuel and waste oil may create an unrea-
sonable risk of fire and pollution.
(17) WHEREAS, the County revised the definition of legal parcel for the purpose of this Ordinance, from defining an unlimited number of contiguous parcels under common ownership or control as one parcel eligible for a single exemption, to a parcel with a distinct and separate Asses- sor's Parcel Number. Where contiguous legal parcels are under identical ownership by an in- dividual or an entity, such legal parcels shall be counted as a single parcel for purposes of this
Ordinance.
(18) WHEREAS, Trinity County's geographic and climatic conditions, low population density, availability of resource lands previously utilized for forestry and grazing and history and repu- tation as a Cannabis producing region have attracted a steady influx of individuals for the pur- pose of participating in Cannabis activity, whether for medicinal or commercial reasons. (19) WHEREAS, the State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB"), the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (*NCRWQCB") and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") have documented a dramatic increase in the number of Cannabis cultiva- tion sites, corresponding increases in impacts to water supply and water quality, including the discharge of sediments, pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum hydrocarbons, trash and human waste.
These impacts result from the widespread unpermitted, unmitigated and unregulated impacts of

Ordinance No. 315-823
October 3, 2017
Page 3 of 13
land grading, road development, vegetation removal, timber clearance, erosion of disturbed surfaces and stream banks, stream diversion for irrigation and temporary human occupancy
without proper sanitary or waste disposal facilities, and threaten the survival of endangered fish
species. In addition, the actions of some Cannabis growers, either directly or through irrespon- sible practices, result in the killing of wildlife, including further endangering other threatened species such as the Pacific Fisher and Coho Salmon.
(20) WHEREAS, California Regional Water Control Board, North Coast Region Order #2015-0023 (Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements and General Water Quality Certification for Dis- charges of Waste Resulting from Cannabis Cultivation and Associated Activities or Operations with Similar Environmental Effects in the North Coast Region) was passed on August 13, 2015. The purpose of this order is to provide a water quality structure to prevent and/or ad-
dress poor water quality conditions and adverse impacts to water resources associated with cannabis cultivation on private land.
(21) WHEREAS, Trinity County is negatively impacted and vulnerable to numerous large-scale,
trespass commercial Cannabis cultivation operations on public and private lands, yet law en- forcement consistently estimates that each year they eradicate only a small fraction of these
operations.
(22) WHEREAS, effective enforcement is further hampered by conflicting local, state and federal laws which create ambiguity in determining which Cannabis cultivation operations are legal or not, and whether those that are non-compliant ought to be subject to civil or criminal enforce-
ment.
(23) WHEREAS, in the absence of a formal local regulatory framework, Cannabis cultivators are less likely to learn of, or implement, guidelines that are protective of the public peace, health, safety and the environment; while law enforcement has been deprived of a clear means of dis- tinguishing legally compliant Cannabis cultivators from those who threaten the public peace, health, safety and the environment. (24) WHEREAS, the County finds, that in the absence of a formal regulatory framework, the nega- tive impacts frequently associated with Cannabis cultivation are expected to increase, resulting in an unregulated, unstudied and potentially significant negative impact on the environment
and upon the public peace, health and safety. (25) WHEREAS, the County's five primary population centers are Lewiston, Hayfork, Weaverville, Coffee Creek Volunteer Fire District and Trinity Center Community Services District, which contain more densely populated residential areas. The reduction of grows in these areas by the absolute prohibition of cannabis cultivation in certain portions of these population centers, un-
less the applicant for a County license has enrolled with the SWRCB by dates specified in Sec- tion 5(a)(v), will result in: (1) greater compliance by those cultivators who have stated that they intend to abide by the environmental controls of this Ordinance; and (2) greater protection of the residents of those areas, which encompass approximately half of the total population of the County, from the nuisances caused by irresponsible cultivation of Cannabis in populated areas.
(26) WHEREAS, the County intends to limit the number of licenses issued to larger grows in order to prevent environmental degradation and due to anticipated limitation by the State.
NOW THEREFORE be it resolved that the Board of Supervisors of the County of Trinity or-
dains as follows:

I. Lack of Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act
The environmental document under consideration is confusing. It is initially labeled as an "Initial Study", but then appears to attempt to morph into a Mitigated Negative Declaration. CEQA requires the sequence of an Initial Study ("IS") followed by comments and consideration of comments before the lead agency determines if an MND will suffice under CEQA or if an EIR is required. To address the confusion created by the IS/MND that is under consideration the lead agency should start over with a clearly identified IS a to enable all interested parties a meaningful opportunity to comment as intended by CEQA. Nevertheless, the comments will
address both IS and MND issues.

A. Programmatic Environmental Analysis
The Planning Department has completed an initial checklist and proposes amending the ordinance to include mitigation. However, at the same time the project itself (the Ordinance)

1

Exhibit "F"

TAA Comments

claims that the County need not prepare, a mitigated negative declaration ("MND") or an EIR, citing to a CEQA exemption at Business and Professions Code section 26055, subdivision (h):1
The County finds that this ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant Business and Professions Code section 26055(h)
until July 1, 2019 because this ordinance requires discretionary review for the
individual licenses that are provided for within.?
Surely this is not the County's intent. Relying now upon this exemption will necessitate applying discretionary review to every single permit application, no matter how small. This will overwhelm the County's planning capacity. 3 Without a programmatic CEQA document to tier to, each individual project will require evaluation in an initial study of: the nature of the project, its
location, the environmental setting, the project's environmental effects-with reference to
supporting evidence, ways to mitigate significant effects, and whether the project is consistent
with zoning and land use controls.* Mitigated negative declarations and environmental impact reports may follow on those initial studies for even very modest cultivation projects, especially if cumulative and incremental impacts have not been addressed in a programmatic document to which applicants and planning staff may tier.
In addition to the administrative problems this approach is likely to cause, there is also the matter of addressing the impact of marijuana cultivation in the County, which is admittedly environmentally devastating. (discussed below).

B. Is an Environmental Impact Report by Required?
In addition to SB 94 time-limited discretionary cannabis ordinance exemption, the County has
cited additional exemptions, asserting that the Ordinance will not result in direct or reasonably
foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment and that there is "no possibility the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment."5 As will be discussed below, the Ordinance and cannabis cultivation may have a significant impact on the environment of Trinity County and beyond. Under CEQA, where proposed project may have significant effects upon the environment, including the adoption of a regulation, an environmental impact report ("EIR") must be prepared. The work of the EIR is to identify and describe any feasible measures that can be implemented to reduce or avoid each potentially significant environmental impact.5 As the California Supreme Court held, "[i]f no EIR has been

While the document circulated for public comment resembles a mitigated negative declaration in some respects (e.g., it is abbreviated "IS/MND"), it lacks several required elements of an
MND, including appropriate citation, discussed more completely below. 2 . Section II: "The County finds that this Ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant Business and Professions Code section 26055(h) until July 1, 2019 because this Ordinance requires discretionary review for the individual licenses that are provided for within." 3 In fact, the IS states that "Comments received from the public and reviewing agencies will be considered by the County in its decision to approve projects implemented under the proposed ordinance." (IS/MND, p. 2.) It is not feasible for staff to consider all of the program-level comments of the public on a project- by-project basis. To do SO would also be grossly inefficient. See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063. 5 Ordinance, § II, citing 14 Cal. Code Regs, §§ 15060, subd. (c)(2) and 15061 subd. (b)(3). Cal. Pub. Res. Code, § 21100(b)(3); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(1).

prepared for a nonexempt project, but substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the project may result in significant adverse impacts, the proper remedy is to order preparation of an EIR.»7 Only if there is not even a "fair argument" that the project will have a significant environmental effect is adoption of an initial study and negative declaration
appropriate.
In addition to the legal argument that the County should prepare an EIR, assuming it abandons
the (unworkable) plan to apply CEQA to every proposed operation in the County, there also is also the practical consideration that a programmatic EIR would greatly lessen the work of planning staff for each individual permit application and make the permitting process more user
friendly.
1. No Substantial Evidence Supports Conclusions in the IS/MND
The IS/MND and the conclusion that the Ordinance will not impact the environment, rely on uncited and unsubstantiated assertions. CEQA requires that supporting documentation be made available to the public for review during the public comment period.' Ultimately, the record must demonstrate that the County did not abuse its discretion. "Abuse of discretion is established if the
agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.»10 For CEQA, "substantial evidence" is "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached. Whether a fair
argument can be made is to be determined by examining the whole record before the lead
agency. Argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence which is clearly
erroneous or inaccurate does not constitute substantial evidence.»l1
Examples of reliance upon inappropriate bases in the IS/MND include:
All facts alleged in Section 2.4 regarding project setting and location;

• All data in 1 Table 1 (Areas of Zoning Districts Potentially Available for Cannabis
Cultivation);
All assumptions in Section 2.8, and throughout the IS/MND regarding baseline
conditions;

• All data in Table 2 (Potential Impacts to Environmental baseline from Prior Cannabis

Assertion that traffic would increase "short-time" and "twice a year"12 when many indoor cultivation operations harvest four to five crops a year and employ a substantial number
of seasonal laborers.
There are many more--the IS/MND includes a references list only five items long, and most of
those are legislation, not factual reports or analyses. Virtually every statement in the IS/MND is unsupported by evidence.
It appears that the County has taken the generalized contentions considered when the urgency ordinance was enacted and rolled them into this IS/MND, without appropriately scaling. While expeditious, this process is not CEQA-compliant.
2. Incremental Impacts of the Ordinance Added to Past Degradation are
Significant
In determining its significance, the County must consider the impacts of the Ordinance in the
context of Trinity's degraded environmental condition. CEQA requires impact analyses to
consider the degree to which past actions have led to an existing significant environmental impact. Where such impact exists, additional incremental impacts that add to that deteriorating scenario must be considered as potentially cumulative significant impacts.13 To comply with CEQA, the Initial Study must consider these cumulative impacts.
The existing impacts of cannabis cultivation in California and Trinity County are substantial:
"The environmental impacts associated with marijuana cultivation have increased, and
unlawful water diversions for marijuana irrigation have a detrimental effect on fish and wildlife and their habitat, which are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the people of the state.»›14
A 2014-2015 Trinity County Grand Jury noted the impacts of the Green Rush in calling for action, stating: "The combination of excessive fuel loads in the forest, the lack of viable and beneficial timber management practice, and the massive amounts of dangerous chemicals (rodenticide) being used is the 'perfect storm' for environmental disaster for both wildlife and humans in what was once a Shangri-La."15
The County Board of Supervisors found in 2012 that:

App. 4th 1019, 1026 (holding that additional increase in noise level of another 2.8 to 3.3 dBA was significant given that the existing noise level of 72 dBA already exceeded recommended maximum of 70 dBA); Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 718 (stating that relevant question is "whether any additional amount of precursor emissions should be considered significant in light of the serious nature of the ozone problems in this air basin.") See also EPIC, 44 Cal.4th at 525 (stating that the requirement to assess "incremental
effects" of a project "signifies an obligation to consider the present project in the context of a realistic historical account of relevant prior activities that have had significant...impacts.") 14 Fish and Game Code, § 12029 (MMRSA). 15 Trinity County Grand Jury, The Final Report of the Trinity County Grand Jury (2014-2015).

[t]he proliferation of marijuana cultivation operations within the County- - particularly as pertains to operations intended to serve persons who are not Trinity County residentsposes serious threats to the health, safety, and well-being of the County and its residents. The deleterious impacts of such
widespread cultivation include, but are not limited to: degradation of the natural environment associated with large marijuana grows, including diversion of, and discharges into, streams, creeks, and other natural watercourses; taking of endangered species, such as the Coho Salmon and Northern Spotted Owl; on-site grading without regard to topography or erosion control, causing sedimentation of water bodies; erection of unpermitted and illegal buildings and structures; disposal of human waste
without connection to sewages or septic systems; disposal of garbage and
rubbish directly onto the property of grow sites; and the abandonment of grow sites without remediation of the aforementioned impacts.16
The Board went on to state that these "deleterious impacts" were "fully confirmed and supported by the great weight of evidence.»I7 Notably, the findings of these effects from the activity of cultivation were not tied to the cultivation's legal status. The County limited cultivation of marijuana to a maximum total of eight plants or 400 square feet of growing space.18 With the Ordinance, the County has changed direction dramatically, allowing a much larger legal
industry.
A larger legal industry will have greater impacts. We incorporate by reference, the comments of the Center for Biological Diversity (July 31, 2017) ("CBD Comments"), 19 with special focus on section 3 ("Assumption of static industry is not supported by substantial evidence"), including the cited and attached documents, which demonstrates that legalization leads to a larger industry. In addition, a legal industry is more likely to be more resource and energy intensive.20
The environmental impacts of the project should be considered in the context of the County's already degraded baseline.
3. The Indirect Impacts of the Project are Significant
The IS/MND failed to consider the indirect, but reasonably foreseeable, impacts of the Ordinance.21 For example:
Small growers may be disproportionately impacted by the costs of the permit-by-permit analysis precipitated by use of the CEQA exemption for this Ordinance. This, in turn, may lead to a scale-up of the average grow size in the County. This is because the cost of preparing an MND or an EIR for a small producers is relatively greater.

While a permit-by-permit system would allow for thorough CEQA analysis, the increased costs of such system may well drive some growers into unpermitted, illegal cultivation.
Once growers are no longer required to conceal illegal activity, they are likely to use more light and energy intensive growing methods.22
Under legal cover, grows may increase in size. For example since the Urgency Ordinance
(315-797) was adopted, by some measures operations have doubled and quadrupled the size of their grows (which were not located with any environmental considerations in
mind).
The impacts of the Ordinance designating areas where cultivation will be prohibited- including the largest population centers in the County and their surrounds--is not analyzed. This may force cultivation into less populated areas with more sensitive watersheds, habitat, etc. It may also make enforcement more difficult by further dispersing operations to far flung and difficult parts of the County.
4. The County Failed to Conduct a Cumulative Impacts Analysis
The IS/MND fails to evaluate the cumulative impacts of the Ordinance. Cumulative impacts are those that are significant when viewed in connection with the effect of past projects, other current projects, and probable future projects.23 Here the County has failed to consider how its adoption of the Ordinance, following on its prior regulation and policy of not taking significant
enforcement action, will impact the environment. It is worth noting that if the County ultimately
proceeds without preparing an EIR, this cumulative impacts analysis will have to be performed
for each individual permit.
5. Other Insufficiently Examined Impacts
Impacts discussed below fall into each of the categories that must be considered under CEQA,
and each rises to the level that it may cause significant impact on the environment. Virtually
none of the IS/MND's statements dismissing impacts in the EIR is supported, meaning there is no substantial evidence to support a conclusion that the project is exempt from CEQA on the basis of lack of impact.

a) Energy Consumption and Grid Capacity
Trinity County allows for mixed light marijuana cultivation and the County acknowledges the "excessive use of energy" associated with indoor and mixed-light marijuana cultivation The IS/MND fails to adequately consider the energy demand for indoor grows, and projected increase in load growth.24 We incorporate the analysis contained in the CBD Comments, section 4.5. CBD detailed the significant foreseeable increase in the scale of indoor cultivation and subsequent load growth.25 For example, half of load growth in Colorado since legalization is

22 See CBD Comments, section 3.5. 23 Pub. Resources Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(2). 24 IS/MND, pp. 12, 35; Center for Biological Diversity v. California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 225-27. 25 See also CBD Comments, pp. 3-10.

attributable to new cannabis cultivation.26 In California, indoor marijuana cultivation already accounts for an estimated 9% of household electricity use.27
Here, the IS/MND does not address potential load growth and the impacts to the County's power grid, including increased failure and fire risk. It is unknown if the projected growth can be supported. Additionally, in its failure to predict substantial growth in energy demand, the IS/MND fails to adequately address increased GHG emissions in the County and any regulatory obligations the County has under AB 32, the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California to reduce its GHG emission to 1990 levels by 2020. This impact could
be substantial as one indoor grow module accommodating four plants is estimated to consume as much energy as 29 refrigerators.28
b) Distribution on the Landscape and Growth
The Ordinance fails to contain or effectively direct growth of the industry, and the impacts of growth are either unexamined or stated in unsupported conclusions. Legalization appears to increase cultivation, even cultivation not covered by the particular legalization effort:
"Trinity County has experienced a proliferation of large MJ cultivation operations that are not in compliance with Ordinance 315-797 [June 5, 2012].$29 Using water well drilling permits as a proxy for growth of the industry, the County Grand Jury noted that "in 2014, the Country received an all-time high 260 requests to permit well drilling The increase in wells is generally considered to be due to increased MJ cultivation.»30
"In recent years, Trinity County has seen a proliferation of large marijuana cultivation
operations that falsely claim to be conducted in accordance with Proposition 215 and the
MMPA."31
"With the increase in use and cultivation of cannabis since the voters' passage of the
Compassionate Use Act (Prop 215) and the legislature's passage of AB 420, the unregulated activity of cannabis cultivation has grown increasingly year by year, with land area under cultivation increasing exponentially over the past decade.»32
See also the content of CBD Comments, Section 3.
In addition to growth spurred indirectly by the Ordinance, the Ordinance on its face allows
expansion and pioneering of new lands in the County:

The Ordinance allows for over 500 grows, without any justification for why that number is sustainable or desirable. Five hundred is apparently plucked from the Urgency Ordinance, which also contained no justification or evaluation of this number.
The Ordinance allows permittees to relocate their grow operations to previously uncultivated areas. Many previously operations were located where they could be concealed. The IS/MND does not examine the likely extent to which permittees are likely
to access this provision.
The IS/MND does not address to what extent being a welcoming county (as opposed to a county with an outright ban) will fuel illegal cultivation on both private and public lands.
The Ordinance allows permits to be transferred to new properties.33 This may even allow
pioneering in TPZ.
The Ordinance allows grows up to one acre.
The expansive effect of the Ordinance, direct and indirect, belies the IS/MND's conclusion that
the Ordinance will be of little or no environmental effect.

c) Generators

Generator-dependent operations have greater risk and environmental effect compared to less intense cultivation methods. These effects include, but are not limited to:34
Intensified fire danger;
Fuel spills and lube dumping;
Noise pollution in forestlands where they impact habitat availability, including for protected species; and
Intensified climate impacts.
The IS/MND fails to take these risks and impacts into consideration.

d) Light

The Ordinance requires that all lighting associated with the operation shall be downcast, shielded
and/or screened to keep light from emanating off-site or into the sky.35 However, the IS/MND provides no analysis as to the effects of lighting on wildlife or the surrounding area.

e Water Consumption
Mother Jones reports that during California's growing season, outdoor grows consume roughly 60 million gallons of water a day-an estimated 50% more than is used by all of the residents in

San Francisco.36 The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") has expressed concerns about the potential of marijuana cultivation to dewater and dry up streams in the areas
where cannabis farmers grow extensively (i.e. Trinity County). Additionally, CDFW has indicated in its September 15, 2017 letter to the County that the Ordinance is likely to have
significant impacts on drainage patterns, volume and velocity and frequency of existing and post- project surface and subsurface flows, polluted run-off, soil erosion and/or sedimentation, and groundwater and aquifer sources, and that these impacts must be adequately analyzed and mitigated.37 We agree, and that letter is incorporated herein by reference.
These impacts should be analyzed and mitigated. Numerous sources emphasize the strain that marijuana cultivation has on California's water resources. For example:
Bauer, et. al., Impacts of Surface Water Diversions for Marijuana Cultivation on Aquatic Habitat in For Northwestern California Watersheds, Plos One, Vol.10(9) (2015), finding that water demand for marijuana cultivation sites in the region has the potential to divert substantial portions of streamflow and even to exceed streamflow demand during low-
flow periods, with potentially lethal effects on state- and federally-listed salmon and steelhead trout and amphibian species.
California Regional Water Quality Control Board, North Coast Region, Waiver of Waste Discharge Requirements and General Water Quality Certification and Discharges Regional Waste Resulting from Cannabis Cultivation and Associated Activities or Operations with Similar Environmental Effects in the North Coast Region (Order No. 2015-0023), summarizing and seeking to address "significant waste discharges and loss of instream flows associated with improper development of rural landscapes on privately-owned parcels, the diversion of springs and streams to the cumulative detriment of beneficial uses of water. $38
Guilford, Gwynn, The U.S. Government is Helping Illegal Pot Producers Destroy California's Water Supply, Quartz (Feb. 13, 2014), describing the detrimental impacts of current conditions, including stream diversions, polluted run-off, impacts on salmon and aquatic populations, and indicating that the remedy is to be found in a legal environmental regulatory scheme.
Impacts on the County's water were not adequately assessed at the state programmatic-level. It is impractical, if not impossible, to assess the widespread and cumulative impacts on state and
county water resources as a result of marijuana cultivation on a permit-by-permit basis.
Further, it is clear that marijuana cultivation has already caused a strain on water resources which is of serious concern to the citizens of California, and it is therefore inappropriate to set the a current concerning conditions as a "baseline" for environmental analysis.

f) Water Delivery & Roads

While the IS/MND does consider impacts associated with illegal or improperly graded access roads and increased traffic, the study fails to consider the effects of water delivery. Water delivery has tremendous deleterious impacts on roads, which can burden the County with the expense of repairs. Moreover, the assumption in the IS/MND that traffic would increase "short- time" and "twice: year"39 when many indoor cultivation operations harvest four to five year and employ a substantial number of seasonal laborers is unfounded. crops a

g) Wildlife

The CBD Comments regarding the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (*MCRSA")
elaborated on the substantial potential impacts to wildlife as a result of marijuana permitting. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate a number of the same factors identified by
CBD, including:
Impacts to wildlife due to the full range of potentially available pesticides, herbicides, and rodenticides (those not requiring a California Restricted Materials permit). The
IS/MND identifies three types of repellants that may be used in and around cultivation sites.40 However, the proposed Ordinance, § I (6)(i), actually prohibits only the use of pesticides requiring a California Restricted Materials permit. The impacts of non- restricted herbicides, pesticides, and rodenticides are not addressed.
Full range of effects on wildlife caused by increased noise and lighting. The associated impacts of light and noise on wildlife are poorly assessable under ordinance protocols, and noise standards are set for human tolerances that are too high for wildlife.41
Effectiveness and hazards of Wildlife Exclusionary Fencing required under Ord. § (6)(e).
Fencing can create hazards for wildlife. The endangered pacific fisher and smaller rodents are also capable of getting through Wildlife Exclusionary Fencing, so its mitigation effectiveness is limited.
Measure BR-1, which requires an acknowledgement from CDFW for each proposed cannabis cultivation site to verify if there is potential for presence of a sensitive species, is a start.
However, impacts to wildlife occur cumulatively, on an ecosystem-wide basis. Thus, evaluating
impacts to wildlife on a site-by-site basis is ineffective to fully mitigate harmful impacts to
species.
Further, CDFW may not have the resources to do a site inspection for each and every license
and consider the full range of potential impacts. Indeed, CDFW wrote a 10-page comment letter (referenced above) to the County concerning the Ordinance in which CDFW stated that "the sheer scope of cannabis cultivation in Trinity County is overwhelming to local and State agencies," and in which it emphasized the need for "a thorough evaluation of the individual and cumulative impacts on the environment and the enforcement of regulations on active sites that

continue to operate in violation of local, State and federal law.*42 CDFW also provided an extensive list of documented impacts on species and habitat that the agency failed to take into consideration in the IS/MND.43
The following attached documents further relate the impacts on species as a result of marijuana cultivation that must be fully addressed and mitigated:
Thomson, et. al., Impacts of Rodenticide and Insecticide Toxicants from Marijuana Cultivation Sites on Fisher Survival Rates in the Sierra Nevada National Forest,
California, Conservation Letters (March/April 2013), finding that 85% of pacific fisher carcasses recovered by two research projects tested positive for rodenticides, and concluding that survival rates are directly linked to the presence and number of cultivation sites found within the animal's home range.
United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, Memorandum:
Estimating Effects of Auditory and Visual Disturbance to Northern Spotted Owls and
Marbled Murrelets in Northwestern California (July 31, 2006), which provides detailed guidance on light and noise levels which are safe for wildlife in the region and shows that safe levels are well below levels set in the Ordinance, which were set with consideration
to human, and not wildlife, needs.
Gabriel, et. al., Silent Forests? Rodenticides on Illegal Marijuana Crops Harm Wildlife, The Wildlife Professional (Spring 2013), describing the overwhelming nature and extent of illegal cultivation, the devastation of rodenticide poisoning on the pacific fisher and other wildlife, and challenges to enforcement given the extent of the problem.

C. Adoption of the 2012 Ordinance Should be the Baseline Date
The IS/MND has selected "December 21, 2016, the date the urgency ordinance was adopted by the County" as its baseline against which to evaluate the environmental impacts of the proposed a ordinance.44 As a preliminary matter, this is not the date the Urgency Ordinance was adopted. This is the date it was amended and extended. The Urgency Ordinance (No. 315-797) was adopted on August 30, 2016. While a baseline other than the present can (and should) be chosen
here, it must have some valid regulatory basis.
While Trinity County has not examined the impacts of regulating cannabis cultivation, it has taken actions (and allowed continued illegal actions) that impact the state of Trinity's environment today. A baseline should be selected that "promote[s] public participation and more
informed decision making by providing a more accurate picture of a proposed project's likely impacts."45 CEQA is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.46 In 2012 the County passed Ordinance No. 315-797 permitting 8-plant personal use marijuana cultivation (*Personal Use Ordinance").

It was after this that Trinity County experienced the "green rush" and the resultant significant environmental impacts. For this reason, the date the Personal Use Ordinance was adopted is the appropriate point from which to measure and address the impacts of further cannabis cultivation and the concerns of the people of Trinity County and the State of California.

D. Insufficient Mitigation
The IS/MND fails to identify many impacts of the Ordinance that will need to be mitigated. The conclusion that the Ordinance will not have any negative environmental impact rests largely on unsupported assumptions, such as: permittees will comply with the terms of their permit, enforcement will suddenly work (despite overwhelming historical precedent pointing to the contrary), and the existence of the Ordinance will not encourage illegal cultivation practices. Those impacts it did identify and acknowledge were insufficiently mitigated.
1. No Substantial Evidence that the County has the Capacity for Enforcement of Mitigation Measures
An agency abuses its discretion under CEQA if its determinations or decisions are not supported by substantial evidence.47 No substantial evidence supports the argument that regulating without the capacity to undertake enforcement will improve environmental (and other) conditions in the County; in fact, there is substantial evidence pointing in the other direction- -the County has been unable to manage its prior less ambitious efforts at regulating cannabis cultivation. Since there are no substantially different enforcement mechanisms proposed in the Ordinance, it is not reasonable or logical to assume that more of the same will result in a different outcome.
The IS/MND relies upon the assumption that enforcement will be effective. In fact, past regulation has served largely to give cover to the black market-many people claim to be operating legally when they are not. The following are examples of enforcement provisions in
the IS/MND that are unrealistic given the County's prior history of enforcement:
"[T]he County Enforcement Official may direct any officer or employee of the County to summarily abate the nuisance.»48 This is likely to be unpopular among growers, and potentially dangerous for County officers given the extent of illegal grows currently in operation in the County. History and practicality suggests that the County will not utilize this provision.
It is unclear whether the fees identified in Ordinance con (9)(c) cover the costs of administration and enforcement of this ordinance.49 Past experience indicates that if the fees are insufficient, the County lacks the political will to increase fees.50
The County relies upon the Water Board for enforcement, but only 5% of legal cultivation operations in Trinity County have ever had an inspection by the Water Board.

The Trinity County Grand Jury in 2014-2015, investigated environmental impacts related to marijuana grows as well as law and code enforcement problems and found that of funding and staffing to both inspect marijuana grow sites and enforce ordinances is insufficient to provide effective environmental protection and legal compliance.3
Trinity County's experiment with its Urgency Ordinance (315-797) has not demonstrated that
regulation will deter illegal activity or decrease the negative environmental impacts. despite its
purported justification of generating data to study options for managing this industry.
Additionally, an article published in 2013, describes the vast extent of illegal grow sites in the
region, stating that a volunteer trail crew has removed more than 600 large-scale marijuana
cultivation sites on public lands in only two of California's 17 national forests. The article further
describes the difficulty in detecting and removing, for example, pesticide threats.52
The problem of enforcement is monumental and needs to be realistically addressed..
2. Mitigation Measures Must be Effective and Binding
It appears there are only a few mitigation measures included in the IS/MND because of a rush to conclude (based on scant to no evidence) that there would be no environmental impacts of the Ordinance. However, measure AG-1 is included and is insufficient. Under CEQA, mitigation
measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally- binding instruments.53 Measure AG- 1 states that County Planning will "participate" and "provide information" to CAL FIRE, but does not require verification of conversion requests.

ORDINANCE NO. 315-830

AN ORDINANCE OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF TRINITY AMENDING SECTION 28 OF TRINITY COUNTY ZONING ORDINANCE NO. 315 REGARDING COMMERCIAL CANNABIS CULTIVATION REGULATIONS
The Board of Supervisors of the County of Trinity, State of California, ordains as follows:

Section I: The County hereby amends the following sections of Section 28 of the Trinity County Zoning Ordinance No.3I5 to read as follows:

(1) Definitions:
(h) "Designated Area" means the hoop-house, greenhouse, and/or outdoor area(s), identified for the planting, growing and harvesting of Cannabis. Designated Area shall not exceed 200% of the Area for the license type; canopy (mature plants) will not exceed the square footage allowed per license type and the additional square footage shall include immature plants (in a vegetative state prior to flowering) and access areas. Licensees propagating immature plants for distribution or seed for distribution to another licensee shall obtain a Nursery license.
(I) "Mixed Light" which is defined under California Code of Regulations Title 3 Division 8 Chapter 1 Article 1 section 8000, and, at the time of enactment, means the cultivation of
mature Cannabis in a greenhouse, hoop-house, glasshouse, conservatory, hothouse, or other similar structure using one of the artificial lighting models described below;
(i) "Mixed-Light Tier 1" which is defined under California Code of Regulations Title 3 Division 8 Chapter 1 Article 1 section 8000, and, at the time of enactment, means the use of artificial light at a rate of six watts per square foot or less;
(ii) "Mixed-Light Tier 2" which is defined under California Code of Regulations section 8000, and, at the time of enactment, means the use of artificial light at a rate above six and below or equal to twenty-five watts per square foot.
(n) "Outdoors" or "Outdoor Cultivation" which is defined under California Code of Regulations Title 3 Division 8 Chapter 1 Article 1 section 8000, and, at the time of enactment, means the
cultivation of mature Cannabis without the use of artificial lighting in the canopy area at any point in time. Artificial lighting is permissible only to maintain immature plants.

Subject: Proposed Trinity County Ordinance Enacting Section 28 of the Zoning Ordinance No. 315 to Create Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Regulation

Honorable Board:

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department) has reviewed the
Trinity County (County) Ordinance Enacting Section 28 of the Zoning Ordinance No.
315 to Create Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Regulation (Ordinance). The Trinity
County Planning Commission has been discussing the Ordinance for some time; the Department reviewed the current version posted on the Trinity County website September 6. The Department is primarily concerned that a permanent ordinance will be approved without appropriate California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis, mitigation, and public review.
The Department strongly supports efforts to regulate cannabis cultivation and to address the numerous and substantial environmental impacts. The Department believes
that greater regulatory oversight and enforcement by local Lead Agencies can help minimize the environmental impacts of cannabis cultivation. The sheer scope of
cannabis cultivation in Trinity County is overwhelming to local and State agencies, and efforts to further increase cannabis cultivation should not be permitted without a
thorough evaluation of the individual and cumulative impacts to the environment and the
enforcement of regulations on active sites that continue to operate in violation of local,
State and federal law.
DEPARTMENT JURISDICTION AND CEQA

The Department is California's Trustee Agency for fish and wildlife resources, and holds those resources in trust by statute for all the people of the State. (Fish & G.
Code, §§ 711.7, subd. (a) & 1802; Pub. Resources Code, § 21070; CEQA
Guidelines § 15386, subd. (a).) The Department, in its trustee capacity, has jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of those § species. (Id., § 1802.) Similarly, for purposes of CEQA, the Department is charged by law to provide, as available, biological expertise during public agency

environmental review efforts, focusing specifically on projects and related activities that have the potential to adversely affect fish and wildlife resources.
The Department expects that it may need to exercise regulatory authority as provided by the Fish and Game Code and act as a Responsible Agency as part of its consideration and issuance of discretionary approvals, described below (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15082, subd. (a)(1)(A) &15124, subd. (d)(1).), for cannabis
cultivation site activities in Trinity County.

The Department must comply with CEQA prior to issuing a CESA ITP or LSA Agreement. As such, the Department may consider the lead agency's CEQA documentation. To minimize additional requirements by the Department and/or under CEQA, the lead agency's CEQA document should fully disclose potential project impacts on CESA- or NPPA-listed species and any river, lake, or stream, and provide adequate avoidance, minimization, mitigation, monitoring and reporting measures for issuance of the ITP or LSA Agreement. Where site-specific impacts are unknown, the lead agency's CEQA document should disclose that impacts on these resources have not been fully disclosed and an additional environmental
document may be required.
State Threatened, Endangered, Candidate and Rare Species: The Department has discretionary authority over activities that could result in the "take1" of any species listed as candidate, threatened, endangered, or rare species pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) (Fish & G. Code, § 2050 et seq.) and the Native Plant Protection Act (NPPA) (Fish & G. Code, § 1900 et seq.). The Department generally considers adverse impacts on CESA- and NPPA-listed species, for the purposes of CEQA, to be significant without mitigation. Take of any CESA- or NPPA-listed species is prohibited except as authorized by state law (Fish & G. Code, §§ 2080 & 2085; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, 9786.9, subd. (b).). Consequently, if a cannabis cultivation project, including construction or any cultivation-related activity during the life of the cultivation operation, results in take of CESA- or NPPA listed species, the Department recommends that the cannabis cultivator seek appropriate authorization prior to project implementation. This may include an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) or a Consistency Determination in certain
circumstances (Fish & G. Code, §5 2080.1 & 2081.).
Rivers, Lakes, and Streams: An entity may not: substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow of; substantially change or use any material from the bed, channel, or bank of; or dispose of any debris, waste, or other material into, any river, stream, or
lake unless certain conditions are met. For such activities, the entity must provide
written notification to the Department. Based on the written notification and site- specific conditions, the Department will determine if the activity may substantially

adversely affect an existing fish or wildlife resource and issue a Lake or Streambed Alteration (LSA) Agreement to the entity that includes reasonable measures necessary to protect the resource (Fish & G. Code, § 1600 et seq.).
Water Pollution: It is unlawful to deposit in, permit to pass into, or place. where it can pass into the "Waters of the State" any (1) petroleum, acid, coal or oil tar, lampblack, aniline, asphalt, bitumen, or residuary product of petroleum, or carbonaceous material or substance, (2) refuse, liquid or solid, from any refinery, gas house, tannery, distillery, chemical works, mill, or factory of any kind, (3) sawdust, shavings, slabs, or edgings, (4) any factory refuse, lime, or slag, (5) Cocculus indicus, (6) substance or material deleterious to fish, plant life, mammals, or bird life (Fish & G. Code, § 5650.). "Waters of the state," "waters of this state" and "state waters" have the same meaning as "waters of the state" as defined in subdivision (e) of section 13050 of the Water Code (Fish & G. Code, § 89.1.). "Waters of the state" means any surface water or groundwater, including saline waters, within the boundaries of the state.

CEQA AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS

CEQA applies to significant project-related environmental impacts, including cumulative impacts. Pursuant to CEQA, a Project is defined as an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and which is any of the
following:
(a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency. (b) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in part, through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies. (c) An activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies. Because the Ordinance anticipates County issuance of licenses, approval of the Ordinance is a Project.

However, for issuance of the Ordinance the County has cited a number CEQA Exemptions, some of which are cited below:
..issuance of licenses to formerly illegal cultivation sites will allow the County to achieve an overall reduction of impacts to natural resources and the environment than existed prior to the adoption of the initial urgency ordinance, the County finds that continuation of an interim licensing scheme through this ordinance iS exempt under CEQA
Guidelines section 15307 (actions taken as authorized by local ordinance to as-sure protection of natural resources), section 15308 (actions taken as authorized by local ordinance to assure protection of

the environment), and section 15321 (action by agency for enforcement of a law, general rule, standard or objective administered or adopted by the agency, including by direct referral to the County Counsel as appropriate for judicial enforcement).'
The Department believes that the adoption and implementation of the Ordinance would result in potentially significant effects to the environment, as outlined below. Therefore, the County must first prepare an initial study (CEQA Guidelines § 15063) to review the Ordinance and the impacts associated with its implementation. Appendix G of the CEQA Guidelines identifies significance thresholds for biological resources impacts, including Mandatory Findings of Significance. These thresholds are generally considered sufficiently comprehensive when assessing project impacts. When undertaking a brief review of the Biological Resource Checklist in
light of the commonly understood impacts associated with the cultivation of cannabis, it is clear that the Ordinance would result in significant impacts to fish and wildlife resources by permitting activities that cause changes in the physical evironment, necessitating complete CEQA review.
CEQA Appendix G Biological Resources Checklist:
a) Would the Project have a substantial adverse effect, either directly or through habitat modifications, on any species identified as a candidate, sensitive, or special status species in local or regional plans, policies, or regulations, or by the Department or the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)?
Species addressed by this threshold include but are not necessarily limited to the following categories:

Listed as rare, threatened, or endangered under federal law.
Listed as rare, threatened, endangered, candidate, or fully-protected under state
law.
Listed by the California Board of Forestry and Fire Protection, U.S. Forest Service; Bureau of Land Management, or other land managing agency. California Rare Plant Rank (CRPR) of 1 through 4 http://www.cnps.org/cnps/rareplants/rankinq.php)

endangered species.

Trinity County has habitat for and presence of several special status species, including Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), and many others. The Ordinance's direct and indirect impacts on each

Board of Supervisors
Trinity County
September 15, 2017
Page 5

candidate, sensitive or special status plant and animal species and their habitats should be thoroughly addressed in a CEQA document. Impacts are based on the sensitivity of each biological resource receptor; in this case each identified species and
habitat. Documented examples are included below:

Erosion may result in sedimentation that leads to downslope impacts on
terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Clearing/grading may result in the colonization of invasive plant species that reduce habitat quality. Artificial lighting may impact wildlife in several ways (i.e., phototaxis), including impacts to navigation, changes in foraging behavior, changes in circadian
rhythms (both physiological and behavioral), predator-prey relationships, and suppressed immune response (including increased tumor growth). Impacts have been observed in birds, insects, terrestrial mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and bats. To avoid potentially significant impacts in cases where artificial lighting would be used, the Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should require that artificial light be shielded so that it does not escape beyond the cultivation area and include clear remedies for cases of violation.
Noise at even moderate levels (40-60 dB) is associated with physiological
and behavioral changes in birds, terrestrial mammals, amphibians, and bats.
For example, the USFWS has recommended guidelines for project-
generated sound levels to avoid certain impacts on northern spotted owl (Strix
occidentalis caurina) and marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). The CEQA document should analyze cannabis cultivation related noise contributions to ensure that loud pumps and generators do not significantly impact the local fauna. To avoid or minimize potentially significant impacts, the Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should require use of low-noise technology equipment, or building noise-reducing structures to house noisy equipment.
Hazardous features could trap, displace, or lead to death of wildlife.
Examples include: open vertical and horizontal pipes; open trenches and exposed excavation areas; pipe networks; materials to control erosion using gabions or non-biodegradable meshes; night lighting; stockpiled vegetation and soils; tarped areas; trash, garbage and open containers; vents on sheds and buildings; and oil leaks from heavy equipment. These potential impacts should be evaluated to reduce or eliminate risks to wildlife.
Anticoagulants and other rodenticides can have harmful impacts on non-target species, and secondary poisoning of wildlife may occur. Anticoagulants are toxins found in major rodent poisons. Anticoagulants such as bromadialone and brodifacoum prevent clotting, causing animals to bleed to death internally. As these poisons move up the food chain, other wildlife including mammalian predators and raptors are unintentionally poisoned. Mortality from secondary poisoning has been documented in several predators including mountain lion and coyotes in the Santa Monica Mountains. The Department recommends prohibiting anticoagulant use for the cannabis cultivation.

Board of Supervisors Trinity County
September 15, 2017

Pesticides with other targets than rodents may harm native insect pollinators and other desirable arthropods which can have cascading adverse ecosystem impacts in adjoining areas. Chemical pesticides should be prohibited on cannabis cultivation sites. Site inspections, enforcement, and testing should occur to maintain pesticide-free products.
Physical barriers such as perimeter fencing, screening, caging, or other means to limit access to cannabis plants by native herbivores must be constructed and maintained to minimize and reduce hazards to wildlife. The Department recommends these barriers be at least 7-feet high and preferably over 8 feet. Chicken wire and nylon netting are particularly hazardous as animals can become trapped. Fence posts or other posts which attract perching birds must be designed that do not contain holes at the top that can ensnare perching raptors. An inspection checklist could be used to identify and address hazards when
individual sites are approved for initial use, and through periodic inspections. Hazardous materials should be removed and replaced with non-hazardous materials prior to initial use:
Removing individual special status plant species or populations, disturbing associated soil seed banks sustaining populations and their genetic adaptations, clearing suitable habitat occupied by special status plant species, and removal of habitats supporting their pollinators and dispersal agents, could result in
potentially significant impacts.
Adverse edge impacts typically arise when natural habitats are disturbed and
farmed. A small grow site one acre in size or a new greenhouse in a natural
habitat area could still result in weed invasions or adversely impact a special status plant or animal population just downslope or nearby. Adverse edge impacts extend varying distances from the source of impact depending upon the issue and location. Establishing protective buffers can effectively minimize adverse edge impacts.
If greenhouses would constitute structures requiring fuel clearance under
state and or local fire codes, this is an additional potentially significant impact
to native habitats and the wildlife species. Areas subject to fuel modifications
typically become degraded, and are prone to invasion by non-native species which jeopardizes the integrity adjoining areas. Access routes should also be analyzed for biological impacts if new roads and new grading is required for cannabis cultivation sites. Construction of new access routes can lead to many substantial adverse impacts on watershed
integrity and wildlife, including an increased risk of poaching in remote areas.
Appropriate species-specific avoidance and mitigation measures should be included for each potentially significant impact. On-site habitat restoration or enhancement should be considered and detailed. If on-site mitigation is not feasible, then off-site mitigation through habitat creation and/or acquisition and preservation in perpetuity should be
considered.

Board of Supervisors Trinity County
September 15, 2017

The CEQA document for the Ordinance should require the project applicant consult with the Department for any project activity that may result in "take" of CESA- or NPPA-listed species, and that for unavoidable "take" the applicant will submit an ITP application to the Department and receive authorization prior to implementing the project. In such
cases, early consultation with the Department is encouraged because significant modification to a subsequent project activity and mitigation measures, and an additional CEQA environmental document, may be required. Additionally, "take" of species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act would require a separate authorization from the USFWS and/or National Marine Fisheries Service.

b) Would the Project have a substantial adverse effect on any riparian habitat or other sensitive natural community identified in local or regional plans, policies, regulations, or by the Department or USFWS.
Project direct and indirect impacts on riparian habitat or other sensitive natural communities should be evaluated and quantified. Appropriate mitigation measures should be included for each potentially significant impact (e.g., restoration, permanent setbacks). Plans for restoration and revegetation should be prepared by individuals with expertise in the local California ecosystem and native plant revegetation techniques.
For cannabis cultivation project activities potentially impacting ephemeral streams, herbaceous vegetation, woody vegetation, and woodlands also serve to protect the integrity of ephemeral streams and help maintain natural sedimentation processes. The Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should require effective setbacks to
maintain appropriately-sized vegetated buffer areas adjoining ephemeral streams.
The Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should require that, prior to the commencement of any project activity that will substantially divert or obstruct the natural flow of any river, stream or lake; substantially change or use any material from the bed,. channel, or bank of, any river, stream, or lake; or deposit or dispose of debris, waste, or other material containing crumbled, flaked, or ground pavement where it may pass into any river, stream, or lake, the project applicant must submit a complete LSA notification package and fee to the Department. In such cases, early consultation with the Department is encouraged. Alternatively, the Ordinance could require documentation that the applicant has a valid Lake or Streambed Alteration Agreement for the cultivation
site.

C) Would the Project have a substantial adverse effect on federally protected wetlands as defined by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (including, but not
limited to, marsh, vernal pool, coastal, etc.) through direct removal, filling,
hydrological interruption, or other means?

Cannabis cultivation project's permitted under the Ordinance with direct and indirect
impacts on wetlands should be carefully evaluated. For example, project impacts could include changes in drainage patterns on and downstream of project sites; changes in

Board of Supervisors
Trinity County
September 15, 2017
Page 8

the volume, velocity, and frequency of existing and post-project surface and subsurface flows; polluted runoff; and soil erosion and/or sedimentation in wetlands, and impacts on groundwater and aquifer sources.

Protection of water quality is a vital component for conserving fish and wildlife resources. Water quality is regulated by state and federal laws, which are primarily administered by the State Water Resources Control Board and nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Department strongly discourages development in wetlands or conversion of wetlands to uplands. Any development or conversion that would result in a reduction of wetland acreage or habitat values should include mitigation that assures "no net loss" of wetland habitat values or acreage. Development and conversion include, but are not limited to,
conversion to subsurface drains, placement of fill or building of structures within the wetland, and channelization or removal of materials from the streambed. All
wetlands and watercourses, intermittent or perennial, should be retained and provided with substantial setbacks to the maximum extent feasible, to preserve the riparian and aquatic values and maintain their value to on-site and off-site wildlife populations. Generally, the Department supports the buffers specified in the North
Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board's Waiver of Waste Discharge
Requirements.

d) Would the Project interfere substantially with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridors, or impede the use of native wildlife
nursery sites?
Any project with direct and indirect impacts on wildlife movement areas, linkages, corridors, and nursery sites. (e.g., bat maternity and roosting colonies, rookeries) should
be analyzed.

The Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should stipulate that clearing of vegetation, and other activities that may adversely affect breeding birds, should occur outside of the peak avian breeding season, which is generally from February 1 through August 31, or as early as January 15 for some raptors, as feasible, to comply with Fish and Game Code section 3503. If vegetation clearing or other activities are necessary during breeding season, the Ordinance and supporting CEQA document should require that a qualified biologist, experienced with conducting breeding bird surveys, conduct such surveys prior to work in If the area. If an active breeding site is identified, the qualified biologist should establish and demarcate a buffer zone, which may be several hundred feet, depending on the species and local conditions (e.g., ambient levels of human activity, screening vegetation, or other factors) between the project activities and
the breeding site to avoid breeding activity interruption. The buffer zone must remain in place until the young have fledged or the breeding site is no longer active, as determined by a qualified biologist.

Board of Supervisors
Trinity County
September 15, 2017
Page 9
e) Would the Project conflict with any local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources (such as a tree preservation policy or ordinance), or f) conflict with the provisions of an adopted Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), NCCP, or other approved local, regional, or state habitat conservation plan?
The Department recommends that the Ordinance and supporting CEQA document require project consistency with the aforementioned policies, ordinances, plans, and conversation land goals. Alternatively, the supporting CEQA document should analyze potential project conflicts with local policies or ordinances protecting biological resources; regional conservation planning approaches, including NCCPs, HCPs, Regional Conservation Investment Strategies (Assembly Bill 2087); conservation and mitigation banks; and conservation elements in county general plans; conserved land areas including properties with habitat conserved through conservation easements or fee title ownership by federal, state and local government; and land trusts for the purpose of conserving and restoring habitat. Such conflicts could result in significant impacts on biological resources.

Cumulative Impacts
Many impacts associated with the cannabis cultivation the Ordinance seeks to approve are not addressed by current regulatory processes of the Department and other agencies regulating natural resources impacts. For example, impacts from conversion of upland habitat (e.g., grassland, oak woodland, and forestlands). Diversions from streams, springs, and groundwater hydrologically connected to surface waters are already adversely impacting watersheds throughout the state. Many watersheds may not be able to support the existing level of diversions, and new cannabis cultivation diversions would likely exacerbate this problem. The CEQA document prepared for the Ordinance should analyze the ability of cannabis-affected watersheds to support sensitive biological resources, including but not limited to special status species and their habitats, and rare natural communities.

Exceptions

Finally, CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subd. (c), contain an exception for significant effects due to unusual circumstances which would prohibit the use of the County's aforementioned categorical exemptions. The recent expansion of the Cannabis industry in Trinity County and elsewhere in northern California is unprecedented. The Department isactively engaged with remediating direct and cumulative impacts of Cannabis cultivation on a daily basis. As summarized above, the Department believes that the Ordinance presents a reasonable possibility of significant impacts due to these. unusual circumstances, and the County should prepare an environmental document for
full compliance with CEQA.

Board of Supervisors Trinity County September 15, 2017

Department Permitting
In its role as Responsible Agency, the Department must also comply with CEQA when issuing regulatory permits. If the County fails to prepare a CEQA environmental document for approval of the Ordinance and there are no other Lead Agency environmental documents available, CDFW may be unable to issue a CESA ITP or a LSA to applicants in a timely manner. CEQA requires that when a Responsible Agency is called on to grant an approval for a project subject to CEQA for which another public agency was the appropriate Lead Agency, the Responsible Agency shall assume the role of the Lead Agency (CEQA § Guidelines 15052). Generally, the Department would send the applicant back to the appropriate Lead Agency (in this case, the County - see. CEQA § Guidelines 15051 (b)(1)) to obtain a project-specific environmental document prior to issuance of any Department permits subject to CEQA.
The Department appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Ordinance and looks forward to working with Trinity County to effectively regulate cannabis cultivation while addressing its environmental impacts.

Subject: Amendment to Trinity County's Zoning Ordinance Regarding Section 43 Allowing for Commercial Cultivation of Cannabis

Honorable Commission:

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department) has reviewed the proposed amendment to Trinity County's (County) Zoning Ordinance Regarding Section 43 Allowing for Commercial Cultivation of Cannabis (Ordinance). The Trinity County Planning Commission Staff Report regarding the amendment was attained by our

c office on October 19, 2018. The Department previously provided comments to the County on September 15, 2017, and again on October 27, 2017, regarding the impacts associated with cannabis cultivation and the appropriate level of environmental review. This letter reiterates some of the September 15, 2017 and October 27, 2017 comments, and provides additional comments on the specific text of the amended Ordinance.
The proposed amended Ordinance would include the following land use changes from the existing ordinance:

1. Increase Designated Area from 200% to 250%
2. Revise Fencing Requirements
3. Allow Multiple Licenses
4. Exclude Trinity County Waterworks District 1 from "Opt Out" area and include 1
Bucktail Subdivision
5. Restrict the use of variances on sites with multiple licenses; Sites adjacent to Non-
Recreational Public Lands, TPZ lands, and Open Space eligible for lifetime variance
The Department is California's Trustee Agency for fish and wildlife resources, and holds those resources in trust by statute for all the people of the State (Fish & G. Code, §§ 711.7, subd. (a) & 1802; Pub. Resources Code, § 21070; California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines § 15386, subd. (a)). The Department in its trustee capacity has jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of those species (ld., 1802). Similarly, for purposes of CEQA, the Department is charged by law to provide, as available, biological expertise during public agency environmental review efforts, focusing specifically on projects and related activities that have the potential to adversely affect fish and wildlife resources.

Conserving California's Wildlife Since 1870

The Department will need to exercise regulatory authority as provided by the Fish and Game Code and act as a Responsible Agency as part of its consideration and issuance
of discretionary approvals, described below (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15082, subd.
(a)(1)(A) & 15124, subd. (d)(1).) for cannabis cultivation site activities in the County.

The Department supports efforts to regulate cannabis cultivation and to address the numerous and substantial environmental impacts that may occur from unregulated activities. However, the Department believes that efforts to further increase cannabis cultivation should not be permitted without a thorough evaluation of the cumulative impacts to the environment. The Department recommends that impacts of an amended Ordinance be publically reviewed pursuant to CEQA prior to any new permits under the
amended Ordinance.

In additional, in its role as Responsible Agency, the Department must also comply with CEQA when issuing regulatory permits. If the County does not prepare a CEQA environmental document for approval of the Ordinance and there are no other Lead Agency environmental documents available, the Department may be unable to issue a California Endangered Species Act (CESA) Incidental Take Permit (Fish & G. Code, § 2081) or a Lake and Streambed Alteration (LSA) Agreement (Fish & G. Code, § 1600 et seq.) to applicants in a timely manner.

Cumulative Impacts

The Department is concerned about cumulative impacts from both permitted and
unpermitted cannabis cultivation. The Guidelines for the Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.; hereafter CEQA Guidelines) defines cumulative impacts in section 15355 as "two or more individual effects which, when considered together, are considerable..." and may include "the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects." Discussion of cumulative impacts is required by CEQA Guidelines section 15130, which also includes past, present, and probable future projects producing related or cumulative impacts, including, if necessary, those projects outside "the control of the agency...." Many impacts associated with the cannabis cultivation the Ordinance seeks to regulate are exacerbated because they are not addressed by current regulatory processes of the
Department and other agencies regulating natural resources impacts. For example, impacts from conversion of upland habitat (e.g. grassland, oak woodland, and forestlands) are not typically addressed in Regional Water Quality Control Board Order No. R1-2015-0023, State Water Resources Control Board's Cannabis Cultivation
Policy-Principles and Guideline for Cannabis Cultivation or by the Department's LSA Program. Diversions from streams, springs, and groundwater hydrologically connected to surface waters are already adversely impacting watersheds throughout the State. Many watersheds may not be able to support the existing level of diversions, and new cannabis cultivation diversions would likely exacerbate this problem. The Department recommends that a CEQA document be prepared to analyze the cumulative effects in watersheds with cannabis cultivation on sensitive biological resources including, but not

limited to, special status species and their habitats, and rare natural communities prior to the amendment of the Ordinance.

Increase Designated Area from 200% to 250%

The proposed amendment allows for the increase in the Designated Area under which cultivation activities occur from 200% of the allowable license size to 250% of the
license size. Examples of land disturbance activities that may occur in this Designated Area include construction of water storage areas, excavation, grading, site clearing, and storage of soil or amendments. This proposal allows for additional land disturbance and site expansion with no environmental review of the impacts associated with this decision. The Ordinance states that "this Ordinance is exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant Business and Professions Code section 26055(h) until July 1, 2019 because this Ordinance requires discretionary review for the individual licenses that are provided for within." As Trustee Agency for the State's fish and wildlife resources, the Department must be consulted on all discretionary CEQA approvals; however, the Department is not aware of any discretionary CEQA review occurring for any annual licenses at this time. The Department recommends that the County refrain from authorizing any additional expansion in land use activities and site disturbance until after July 1, 2019; when the County has completed a CEQA review of the Ordinance and can accurately characterize the impacts associated with the
County's cannabis cultivation licensing program. In addition, the County should consider requiring grading plans, erosion control plans, or site development plans developed by a qualified professional for all site expansion activities to minimize impacts of increased site disturbance.

Revise Fencing Requirements

"Wildlife Exclusionary Fencing" is defined in the amended Ordinance to mean "fencing designed and installed to prevent the entry of wildlife into the enclosed area, such as
cyclone or field game fencing a minimum of six feet high measured from grade." The Department recommends that prior to defining the design parameters of "Wildlife Exclusionary Fencing," the County should identify target species or mammalian size classes (i.e., to exclude any species larger than grey squirrel) and then consult with the Department on how to include suitable design features to exclude all the targeted species. Fencing designs should still be able to pass non-target species and avoiding entrapment, entanglement, and impalement hazards to all wildlife.

Physical barriers such as perimeter fencing, screening, caging, or other means to limit access to cannabis plants by wildlife must be constructed and actively monitored and maintained to minimize and reduce hazards to wildlife no matter what material or height is selected. The Department recommends these barriers be at least 7-feet-high and preferably over 8-feet-high whenever possible in order to achieve the best results. Chicken wire and nylon netting are particularly hazardous as animals can easily become trapped in these materials. Fence posts must be designed so they do not

Trinity County Planning Commission October 23, 2018
Page 4

contain holes at the top that can ensnare perching raptors. The County should also avoid authorizing fences with spikes, pickets, or barbs that protrude above the top bar
as these features can impale animals should they attempt to jump over the fence.
Although the price of plastic fencing is often times attractive when compared to other materials, the Department strongly recommends against the use of any plastic wildlife exclusion materials. Department staff have observed numerous instances of entanglement and mortality in plastic fences. In addition, the temporary nature of plastic fencing results in large amounts of plastic waste being stored onsite as the materials are often times too voluminous when disassembled to easily dispose of. When disposed of onsite, this material continues to ensnare amphibians, reptiles, and small
mammals, leading to mortality.

Type 3 License Increase

The amended Ordinance states, "On July 1, 2019, the Director may increase the number of Type 3 Licenses up to thirty (30) if the environmental documents support this increase." The Department would like clarification on what environmental documents will be used to support the decision-making process that would increase the cap and what thresholds of significance are proposed to support this decision.

Variances

Section 5(a)(viii) of the amended Ordinance allows cultivation sites with existing annual
variances that are located adjacent to Timber Production Zone (TPZ), Open Space or Non-Recreational Public Lands (public lands that have no designated improvements or facilities such as trails, campgrounds, or boat access areas) to be eligible to apply for lifetime variances to setback requirements. The Department believes that encroachment into each of these land designations warrants additional analysis as the proposal has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment and substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species.

A lifetime reduction in setbacks from TPZ may have significant impacts on wildlife species and those private timberland owners seeking to sustainably manage timberlands. For instance, the status of Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) (NSO), listed as Threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act in 1999, and then similarly listed under CESA in 2017, qualifies it as an endangered, rare, or threatened species under CEQA Guidelines, section 15380. NSO populations have declined significantly in California primarily as a result of destruction of forest habitat from logging and development. As a habitat specialist, NSO are primarily threatened by further loss, fragmentation, and degradation of their forest habitats, which is further complicated by their low reproductive rate and limited ability to disperse. Additionally, contaminants from cannabis cultivation is a growing threat to NSO. Noise from road use, generators, and other equipment may disrupt foraging NSO, which primarily use hearing to hunt. Also, exposure to vehicle noise has been shown to increase stress hormone levels in NSO, which was particularly evident in males during times when they were exclusively responsible for feeding their mates and nestlings. Owners of private

timberlands must undertake rigorous surveys within 1.3 miles of a proposed timber harvest site and must implement strong avoidance measures to avoid take of NSO, including seasonal restrictions on noise and disturbance. To date, cannabis cultivators are not employing the same level of NSO avoidance as timberland owners, even though the cultivation sites are actively removing timber stands, operating adjacent to known NSO activity centers, and permanently converting forested areas into cannabis cultivation sites. The Department recommends that prior to encroachment into TPZ setbacks, the County: (1) assess the impacts of cannabis cultivation adjacent to TPZ areas known to support NSO, and (2) require cannabis cultivators within 1.3 miles of a known NSO activity center or federally designated Critical Habitat to adhere to State and federally supported NSO avoidance and mitigation measures. The Department can provide these measures at the County's request.
The Department recommends that the term "Open Space" be defined in the amended Ordinance. If it refers to the Open Space Zoning District, the County zoning ordinance defines it as "land intended to protect significant or critical wildlife habitat areas or areas
which should not be developed due to public health or safety reasons." Many of these
Open Space areas may include wetland or riparian habitat, or occupied habitat for endangered species such as NSO and Coho Salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The Department does not support the encroachment of cannabis cultivation on critical wildlife habitat without additional CEQA review, a site-specific biological resource assessment, and additional avoidance and minimization measures, as appropriate.
The phrase "Non-Recreational Public Lands" is an inaccurate depiction of the
recreational uses taking place on the subject lands. The vast majority of public lands in
the County would fall into the category of Non-Recreational Public Lands under the current definition, although many of these sites are frequented by the Department's
constituent groups, including hunters, anglers and non-consumptive users. Unimproved areas are specifically targeted by the public for their low traffic characteristics and ability to provide higher quality experiences for outdoor enthusiasts such as hunters, anglers, and non-consumptive users, such as bird watchers. Allowing a lifetime of
reduced or eliminated buffers for cannabis cultivation adjacent to properties defined as Non-Recreational Public Lands without consideration of possible reduced access, degradation of quality of experience, and compromise to public safety should not be enacted without first evaluating the potential for substantial recreational impacts. Additionally, many of these areas currently designated as Non-Recreational Public Lands contain federally designated Critical Habitat for NSO, on which the impacts of
setback variances are described above. The definition of "Recreational Public Lands"
should be redefined to include all State and federal lands legally accessible to the
public and should not exclude unimproved areas devoid of such features such as trails, campgrounds, and boat areas. Creating lifetime variances for property line setbacks that encroach on any TPZ, recreational public land, and Open Space prevents disclosure of potential significant impacts to the public during the CEQA process. The Department recommends maintaining the current annual review of setback variances to determine if there has been a change in environmental conditions that warrant
continued renewal of the setback.

The Department appreciates the opportunity to comment on the amended Ordinance and looks forward to working with the County to effectively regulate cannabis cultivation while addressing its environmental impacts.

Transportation Concept Report

General Route Information

Introduction

This section provides general route information regarding State Route (SR) 299 such as route description, route history, regional setting, CALIFORNIA
population, county population and economic forecasts, traffic collision data, goods
movement, transportation options, right of way 299
and route inventory.

Route Description

Describing this route from west to east, the route passes through a diverse range of climates and topography. Near the Pacific Ocean, the elevation is close to sea level, the route then crosses over the coastal mountain range, winds along the Trinity River, cuts across the north end of the Sacramento Valley, and traverses through forests to high elevation desert at the Nevada State line. The route has eight mountain passes: Lord Ellis Summit (elevation 2,260 ft), Berry Summit (elev. 2,871 ft), Oregon Mountain (elev. 2,888 ft), Buckhorn Summit (elev. 3,215 ft.), Hatchet Mountain
Summit (elev. 4,368 ft.), Big Valley Mountain Summit (elev. 4,603 ft), Adin Pass (elev. 5,173 ft), and Cedar Pass (elev. 6,305 ft). These passes and the higher elevations along the route are prone to winter driving conditions including snow and ice. Table 1 provides the county Post Mile limits. Table 2 provides the length of the route and lane miles.
The California State Highway System consists of routes described in the California Streets and Highways Code. Chapter 2, Article 3. (Section 599) describes SR 299 as follows:

Route 299 is from:
(a) Route 101 near Arcata to Route 395 at Alturas. (b) Route 395 near Alturas to the Nevada state line via Cedarville.
The California Streets and Highways Code (section 253.8) identifies that Route 299 from Route 101 near Arcata to Route 395 at Alturas shall be included in the California Freeway and Expressway System. SR 299 is part of the interregional route system between US Route 101 and SR 89, and
between SR 139 and US 395.

SEPTEMBER, 2009 27 SR 299 TCR
Exhibit IET, 89

SR 299 is an east-west transportation facility designated as a high emphasis interregional route and focus route between the Pacific coast of northern California and I-5 in Redding and an interregional route between I-5 and Alturas. The route provides interregional movement of people, goods, and recreational travel linking rural communities and small urban areas across northern California. In addition, SR 299 links trucking to three major north-south routes in northern California - US 101, Interstate 5, and US 395. The western portion of the route also provides access to the Port of Eureka, which is the only deep-water port in California north of San Francisco. Recreational attractions include: the Pacific Ocean, the Trinity River (designated Wild and Scenic), Trinity Alps Wilderness Area, Trinity Lake, Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, Weaverville and Old Shasta (both on the National Register of Historic Places), the Burney Falls area, the Ash Creek Wildlife area near Bieber, the Modoc National Forest, and the Modoc Wildlife Refuge.

Regional Settings

SR 299 passes through Humboldt County in Caltrans District 1; and the following four counties in District 2, Trinity, Shasta, Lassen, and Modoc. See Appendix A for county information. The route passes through four incorporated cities (Arcata, Blue Lake, Redding, and Alturas) and numerous small communities. Just east of Cedarville, at the Nevada State line, the pavement ends and the route continues as a graveled roadway into the State of Nevada towards the city of Winnemucca.

SR 299 West of Redding

The portion of the route west of Redding begins at US 101 in the City of Arcata as a 4-lane freeway and transitions into sections of 2-lane conventional highway and expressway with intermittent passing lanes until it reaches the western city limits of Redding. Near the coast, the terrain is mostly flat and
rolling with grasslands, coastal scrub and evergreen forests. The route then passes over the coastal
range at Lord Ellis and Berry summits, traverses eastward along the Trinity River, climbs over Oregon Mountain, through the community of Weaverville, over Buckhorn Summit, and along Whiskeytown Lake to Redding.

This portion of the is route, is a designated National Forest Scenic Byway, provides access to a vast
region of over 5000 square miles and links the northern Sacramento Valley to the deepwater port in
Eureka. The majority of this portion of SR 299 has generally acceptable operations, with the two exceptions being Weaverville (particularly during the summer months) and Buckhorn grade (a notoriously narrow, steep and curvilinear section of highway that does not accommodate STAA
trucks).

SR 299 Redding

The portion of SR 299 passing through the Redding urban area has the highest volumes on the route and experiences some congestion during peak volume periods. The section of the route on the west side of Redding (SR 299) is a four-lane conventional facility with numerous driveways and signalized intersections. The areas largest high school and several other schools are located adjacent to this section of SR 299. Together the schools generate substantial traffic, causing congestion and queuing at intersections on weekdays during both morning and early afternoon periods. SR 299 shares designations with SR 273 on Market Street for 1.9 miles. The facility is four lane freeway for 3 miles
east of the I-5 separation.
