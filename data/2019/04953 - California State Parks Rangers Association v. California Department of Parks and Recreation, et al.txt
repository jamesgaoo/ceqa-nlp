21 1. Petitioner California State Parks Rangers Association petitions this Court for a

22 Writ of Mandate, directed to Respondent California Department of Parks and Recreation

23 ("Respondent" or "Parks"). Petitioner challenges Respondent's August 12, 2019 approval of

24 the Transcendence Theater Company Summer Theater Festival 2020-2024 Seasons (*Project").

25 The Project is the grant of a five-year renewal of a Special Events Permit to the Transcendence |
26 Theater Company to stage performances in the Old Winery Ruins at Jack London Historic Park.
27 The permit allows up to 4 annual theatrical productions (up to 30 performances in total) with up
28 to 860 attendees at each performance.

-

2. Petitioner also challenges Respondent's September 17,2019 approval of a five-
year Operating Agreement with Real Party in Interest Valley of the Moon Natural History m tvo Association (*VMNHA"). The Project is the grant of a five-year Operating Agreement with
VMNHA for up to 30 theater performances in the Old Winery Ruins at Jack London Historic
Park, each summer season for up to 5 years. Petitioner contends that Respondent's approval for
the Special Events Permit and Operations Agreement based upon Notices of Exemption violates
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code section 21000 et
co seq. ("CEQA"), and State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.
Petitioner also contends that the approval of the Special Events Permits and Operating - 9

13 3. Petitioner California State Parks Rangers Association ("CSPRA" or "Petitioner")

14 is an organization of active and retired State Park professionals dedicated to advancement of
the highest principles of public service, established to support and preserve California State 15

16 Parks for present and future generations. For over 50 Years, CSPRA has been the professional

17 organization that truly cares first about protecting and preserving the values of California's

18 State Park System. CSPRA provides exchange of professional thought; defends State Park

19 System integrity; supports quality Department effort; sponsors professional training; comments

20 and makes recommendations on California park management issues. CSPRA has a direct and

21 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with the laws relating to

22 environmental protection, particularly CEQA. CSPRA is affected by Respondent's failure to

23 comply with CBQA. CSPRA and its members' environmental, aesthetic and property interests

24 will be severely injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside pending full compliance

25 with CEQA and all other laws. CSPRA brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly

26 situated who are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners.

27 CSPRA is within the class of persons and entities beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by,

28. the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Accordingly, CSPRA has standing to sue.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- N0 +0O N ∞ BACKGROUND FACTS

10. Jack London State Historic Park, located in the County of Sonoma, is a listed
National Historic Landmark. The stone masonry Winery Ruins are part of the Jack London
State Historic Park and are interpreted by the public as part of the ranch compound. The
a Winery Ruins are a contributing feature of the National Register listed Cultural Landscape at
the park and protected by state and federal law.

11. TTC produced summer theater festivals at Jack London State Historic Park since
2012, within the open-air confines of the Winery Ruins on the grounds of Jack London's Beauty |

9 Ranch. Parks initially approved the production for one-year periods in the 2012 and 2013

10 seasons, and approved for a 5-year production run from 2014 to 2019.

11 12. On August 12, 2019, Respondent approved a five-year Special Events Permit to the |

12 TTC to stage performances in the Old Winery Ruins at Jack London Historic Park. The Permit

13 allows up to 4 annual theatrical productions (up to 30 performances in total) with up to 860

14 attendees at each performance. The Permit provides for TTC to erect a portable stage and 860

15 chairs within the ruins and remove them after each production. The Beauty Ranch meadow

16 serves as an area for group assembly, picnicking and entertainment with associated food and

17 wine sales.

18 13. The Permit provides for TTC to produce a minimum of four productions with up to |

19 maximum of 30 main stage performances during every summer festival. The pre-show picnic

20 begins at 5 p.m.; the main stage show begins at 7:30 p.m. and concludes at approximately 9:30

21 p.m. with all guests exiting park by 10 p.m. Venue clean up takes place between 10 p.m.and

22 10:30 p.m. with all remaining staff exiting the park by 11 p.m. TTC will return to the park on

23 days following the performances should additional cleanup be required as a result of both the 11

24 p.m. curfew and lack of light.

25 14. The Project includes an additional 20 tech-rehearsals. Each tech rehearsal ends at

26 10 p.m. All nontechnical production rehearsals must take place off site. There may be

27 alterations to this schedule due to technical or weather related issues beyond the reasonable

28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

F control of Transcendence Theater Company. Under such circumstances, both parties will
N m 7 1010 determine rescheduled dates with respect to priorities of the park.

15. The Permit provide TTC exclusive use of large part of the historic area on all
contracted dates. TTC will be given exclusive access to the winery ruins, Beauty Ranch
Meadow, upper and lower parking lots, picnicking areas within Beauty Ranch, backstage area
between Winery Ruins and vineyards, and all areas in between.

16. Festival dates will vary from year to year, but will fall within the general timeframe|
c of June through September .

17. On September 16, 2019, Petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate challenging |

10 Respondent's approval of the Special Events Permit to TTC and approval of the August 13, -

11 2019 Notice of Exemption.

12 18. On Septèmber 17, 2019, Respondents filed a "corrected" Notice of Exemption that

13 superseded the August 13, 2019 Notice of Exemption for the five-year Special Events Permit to

14 TTC to stage performances in the Old Winery Ruins at Jack London Historic Park. The

15 September 17, 2019 Notice of Exemption, however, does not state that Respondent rescinded

16 and/or vacated the approval of and issuance of the Special Events Permit was rescinded and/or

17 vacated.

18 19. The September 17,2019, Notice of Exemption provided for the five-year Operating

19 Agreement with VMNHA for up to 30 theater performances in the Old Winery Ruins at Jack

20 London Historic Park, each summer season. The Operating Agreement provides for the same or

21 similar activities as the Special Events Permit with TTC. Based upon information and belief,

22 Petitioner alleges that TTC will be the production company under the Operating Agreement.

23 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY
24
20. • Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant 25 action and have exhausted
26 any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required
by law.

N mv 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written
notice and proof of service for the August 13, 2019 Notice of Exemption is attached as Exhibit

11 23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

12 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require respondents to set aside their

13 approval of the Project(s) and approval of the Notice of Exemption. In the absence of such
14 remedies, the Respondent's approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

15 24. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the Notice of

16 Exemption dated August 13, 2019. This First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate has been

17 filed within 35 days of the Notice of Exemption September 17, 2019.

25 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question in

26 this action.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

HN CAUSES OF ACTION

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Abuse of Discretion Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.
27. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 26.
28. Respondent's action in determining the Project is categorically exempt constitutes a
violation of CEQA in that Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required by law and their
decision to approve the Project based upon a categorical exemption is not supported by 9
substantial evidence. Based upon substantial evidence in the record the Project may have a 10 significant impact on the environment.
11 29. CEQA Guidelines section 15301 provides for a categorical exemption for existing 12 facilities that involve negligible or no expansion of use beyond that existing at the time of the 13 lead agency's determination. The Project does not qualify for "existing facilities" exemption due 14 to the expansion of this same project over the last seven years now 30 performances (and an 15 additional use for 30 rehearsals) with 860 persons which is 33% over this current year of 22 -
16 performances (and additional use for 22 rehearsals) and over three-fold from 2012 for 14 17 performances of 500 persons this project is hardly negligible or no expansion. 18 30. CEQA Guidelines section 15305 provides for a categorical exemption for minor 19 alterations in land use limitations in areas with an average slope of less than 20%, which do not 20 result in any changes in land use or density, including but not limited to: (a) Minor lot line 21 adjustments, side yard, and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any new parcel; (b)' 22 Issuance of minor encroachment permits; (c) Reversion to acreage in accordance with the
23 Subdivision Map Act. Due to the number of performances and rehearsals this is a major land use a 24 and density that has changed from an historic winery into a Broadway musical entertainment 25 venue (potential significant impacts to increased traffic and congestion during peak hours, and 26 neighbors, and contribute to greenhouse gasses, noise and light pollution. 27

7 28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

31. CEQA Guidelines section 15311 provides a categorical exemption for
N m + 100 ∞0 construction, or placement of minor structures accessory to (appurtenant to) existing commercial l
industrial, or institutional facilities, including but not limited to: (a) On-premise signs; (b) Small
parking lots; (c) Placement of seasonal or temporary use items such as lifeguard towers, mobile
food units, portable restrooms, or similar items in generally the same locations from time to time |
in publicly owned parks, stadiums, or other facilities designed for public use. The Project does
not constitute a temporary uses as it is a five year contract during peak season with year round
storage; and installing entertainment venue marketing signs for theatrical venue in the beauty

9 ranch area IS not permissible due to a deed restriction (significant impact).

10 32. The Project also does not qualify for categorical exemption as the Project is

11 inconsistent with the General Plan governing Jack London State Historic Park. Parks' Project

12 Evaluation Form for the Project acknowledges that the Project is inconsistent with the

13 applicable General Plan.

14 The General Plan identifies a Primary Historic Zone and page 71 of the General Plan specifically states: An analysis of public intent has indicated a desire to keep
15 activities in this particular part of the park "low key." Based on this statement, the performances are not consistent with the goal of the General Plan to
16 "encourage low-impact activities that culturally support and historically compliment the interpretive topics [identified in the General Plan]. While the
17 event is not "low key,' the General Plan was written prior to a time when the park was managed by an association and prior to the expansion of the concept of how
18 parks are managed. The performances have also been ongoing since 2012 and the public and surrounding community fully support these events so the public intent
19 for the park has changed. These performances also provide exposure of the historic park to others who would not necessarily have been interested in visiting
20 it.

21 33. None of these form the basis for approving a Project that is inconsistent with the

22 General Plan nor does the argument address the potential impacts resulting from the

23 inconsistency with the General Plan.

24 34. Neither the Project Evaluation Form nor the Notice of Exemption address the

25 impacts or disruption issue of visitor's ability to freely view, enter, photograph or tour the

26 winery ruins and adjacent historic area.

27 35. The PEF also indicates that the Project is inconsistent with Parks' Cultural

28 Resource Management Directives.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

P 36. CEQA provides that if there is "reasonable possibility" that an activity will have a
N 0 t 0 0N 00 significant effect on the environment due to "unusual circumstances," an agency may not find
the activity to be categorically exempt from CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2(c). The
unusual circumstances exception applies when both unusual circumstances and a significant
impact as a result of those unusual circumstances are shown. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v
City of Berkeley (2015) 60 C4th 1086, 1104.)

37. In the present case, unusual circumstances exist such as the Project's inconsistency
with the General Plan, inconsistency with Public Resources Code sections 5001.9(b); 5001.96;

9 50019.53; 5019.59; 5080.03.

10 38. As the Project does not qualify for a categorical exemption under CEQA, approval
11 of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 12 (Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.; Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5) 13

14 39. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 38.

15 40. The State Planning and Zoning Law prohibits the agency from approving the

16 Project if it conflicts with its General Plan and other applicable land use plans. Local land use

17 and development decisions must be consistent with the applicable general plan. (Families

18 Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332,

19 1336 (FUTURE).) "A project is consistent with the general plan "if, considering all its

20 aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not obstruct their

21 attainment."' [Citation.] A given project need not be in perfect conformity with each and

22 every general plan policy. [Citation.] To be consistent, a project must be 'compatible with' the

23 objectives, policies, general land uses and programs specified in the general plan." (Ibid.)

24 41. As discussed above, Parks acknowledges that the Project is inconsistent with the

25 General Plan. Instead of amending the General Plan, which is a public process, Parks argues

26 that the General Plan was written prior to a time when the park was managed by an association

27 and prior to the expansion of the concept of how parks are managed. If that is the case, then the

9 28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-N0TOON' process is for Parks to update the General Plan, not approve projects/events that are inconsistent
with the General Plan and then argue that the General Plan is out-dated.

42. As the Project conflicts with the General Plan and the General Plan, approval of
the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of Public Resources Code, § 5001.9(b); Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 & 1085)
43. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42.
44: Public Resources Code section 5001.9(b) provides that: "No new facility may be -
e developed in any unit of the state park system unless it is compatible with the classification of

10 the unit."

11 45. In the present matter, the theatrical entertainment venue constitutes new facility

12 due to its excessive use and physical presence during peak season and the construction and use

13 of the stage and chairs being set up during regular park hours and for several weeks each season. |
14 The development of a facility for theatrical performances is not compatible with the

15 classification of Jack London State Historic Park.

16 46. As the Project conflicts with the section 5001.9(b), approval of the Project

17 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of Public Resources Code, § 5001.96; 19 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 & 1085)

20 47. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 46.
21 48. Public Resources Code section 5001.96 provides that attendance at state park

22 system units shall be held within limits established by carrying capacity determined in

23 accordance with Section 5019.5. Section 5019.5 provides that "Before any park or recreational

24 area developmental plan is made, the department shall cause to be made a land carrying capacity

25 survey of the proposed park or recreational area, including in such survey such factors as soil,

26 moisture, and natural cover."

27 49. Parks made no evaluation or determination that the Project will be within the

28 carrying capacity determined in accordance with section 5019.5.
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

50. As the Project conflicts with the section 5001.9(b), approval of the Project
constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of Public Resources Code, § 5019.53; Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 & 1085)

51. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 50.

52. Public Resources Code section 5019.53 provides in relevant part:
Each state park shall be managed as a composite whole in order to restore, protect, and maintain its native environmental complexes to the extent compatible with the primary purpose for which the park was established. Improvements undertaken within state parks shall be for the purpose of making the areas available for public
o 2 : enjoyment and education in a manner consistent with the preservation of natural, scenic, cultural, and ecological values for present and future generations.
Improvements may be undertaken to provide for recreational activities including,
11 but not limited to, camping, picnicking, sightseeing, nature study, hiking, and horseback riding, so long as those improvements involve no major modification of
12 lands, forests, or waters. Improvements that do not directly enhance the public's enjoyment of the natural, scenic, cultural, or ecological values of the resource,
13 which are attractions in themselves, or which are otherwise available to the public within a reasonable distance outside the park, shall not be undertaken within state
14 parks. (Emphasis added.)

15 53. Parks made no finding or determination that the Project is consistent with Public

16 Resources Code section 5019.53. Moreover, in contradiction of section 5019.53, the Project

17 becomes a facility for non-park purposes that constitutes an attraction onto itself.

18 54. As the Project conflicts with the section 5019.53, approval of the Project constitutes

19 a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 20 (Violation of Public Resources Code, § 5019.59; Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 & 1085) 3 & 22 55. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 54.

23 56. Public Resources Code section 5019.59 provides:

24 Historical units, to be named appropriately and individually, consist of nonmarine areas established primarily to preserve objects of historical, archaeological, and
25 scientific interest, and archaeological sites and places commemorating important persons or historic events. The areas should be of sufficient size, where possible,
26 to encompass a significant proportion of the landscape associated with the historical objects. The only facilities that may be provided are those required for
27 the safety, comfort, and enjoyment of the visitors, such as access, parking, water, sanitation, interpretation, and picnicking. Upon approval by the commission,
28 lands outside the primary historic zone may be selected or acquired, developed, or
11 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

operated to provide camping facilities within appropriate historical units. Upon
N N approval by the State Park and Recreation Commission, an area outside the primary historic zone may be designated as a recreation zone to provide limited recreational opportunities that will supplement the public's enjoyment of the unit. Certain agricultural, mercantile, or other commercial activities may be permitted if those activities are a part of the history of the individual unit and any developments retain or restore historical authenticity. Historical units shall be named to perpetuate the primary historical theme of the individual units.
57. Under section 5019.59 only interpretative venues should take place in Jack London

0 State Historic Park historic Beauty Ranch. Approval of theatrical performance is not consistent
with the limitations of section 5019.59.
8
58. As the Project conflicts with the section 5019.59, approval of the Project constitutes 9 a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law. 10
SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
11 (Violation of Public Resources Code, § 5080.03; Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5 & 1085) 12
59.
13 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 58.
60.
14 Public Resources Code section 5080.03 provides that:
(a) The department may enter into contracts with natural persons, corporations, 15 partnerships, and associations for the construction, maintenance, and operation of concessions within units of the state park system for the safety 16 and convenience of the general public in the use and enjoyment of, and the enhancement of recreational and educational experiences at, units of the state 17 park system.

18 (b) Concessions shall not be entered into solely for their revenue producing potential.
19

20 (c) With respect to any unit of the state park system for which a general development plan has been approved by the commission, any proposed concession at that unit shall be compatible with that plan. 21 61. The permit/concession is not consistent with the park classification or is not 22 compatible with the General Plan.
23 62. As the Project conflicts with the section 5080.03, approval of the Project constitutes 24 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.
