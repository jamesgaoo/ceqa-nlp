22 Petitioners, Protect Tustin Ranch, and Anne J. Lee, allege as follows:
23
1.
24 This action challenges the October 15, 2019 decision of the City of Tustin City
Couneil (the "City Council*), evaluating the recommendation by the City of Tustin Planning
25 Commission (the "Planning Commission,' collectively, with the City Council, "Respondents"),
26 to approve Resolution 4385, which adopted Design Review ("DR") 2018-00026 and approved a
27 Conditional Use Permit ("CUP") 2018-00018 for the project located at 2541 EI Camino Real and

1 commonly also known as the Tustin Ranch Costco Gas Station Project, which proposes to
2 demolish a Goodyear Tire Center and build thereon 56 new parking stalls and to construct a 16-

3 pump Costco gasoline fueling station (including 32 individual fucling units) with canopy and

4 related equipment (i.e., underground gasoline storage tanks, etc.) within an existing

5 retail/commercial development of approximately 12 acres (the "Project"). Current uses at the site

6 include a Costco warehouse, a large empty building, formerly a Kmart, a McDonald's restaurant,
two multi-tenant commercial buildings and the to be demolished Goodyear Tire Center.
7 2. The decision of the City Council presumes to allow the developer to demolish the
8 Goodycar Tire Center and construct thereon the Projcct pursuant to a Class 32 Categorical
9 Exemption ("Class 32 Exemption") and operates in stark contravention of the California
10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC) § 21000 et seq., the
11 CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, § 15000, et seq. ("CEQA

12 Guidelines"). Respondents' reliance on the Class 32 Exemption falls well below CEQA's

13 minimum standards as set forth below.

14 3. The significant impacts the Project would cause include traffic, air quality, soil

15 quality, ground water quality, and noise. The impacts, which Respondents have seemingly

16 ignored, would effect a terrible nuisance for the surrounding residential neighborhoods, resulting
in serious health, safety and other issues. The influx of commercial traffic and traffic backed up
17 from each of the pumps, as regularly occurs at each Costco Gas Station, will sharply clash with
18 the residential neighborhoods that are in very close proximity to the Project. This constitutes a
19 certain logistical nightmare for existing residents,

20 4. Moreover, the impacts that the Project creates will drastically and adversely affect

21 the quality of life for existing residents. The approval of Resolution 4385, in reliance on the

22 Class 32 Exemption dismissed the Project's impacts on traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground

23 water quality, noise and other issues in a cursory fashion based upon flawed and outdated

24 information that was not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners request that this Court
vacate and set aside the Project Approvals, including the approval of Resolution 4385 and use of
25 the Class 32 Exemption and to compel Respondents to undertake a reasonably appropriate
26 environmental review that should have been done under CEQA.

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
3 ("CCP") §8 187, 526, 1085, and 1094.5, and PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5. This Court also has the
4 authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the City Council to vacate and set aside the Project
5 Approvals for the Project under the CCP $§ 1085 and 1094.5. Venue for this action properly lies

6 in the Orange County Superior Court, because Respondents and the Project are located in Orange

7 County.

8 6. Petitioner, Protect Tustin Ranch ("Petitioner"), is an unincorporated association

9 of residents who rent and own property in and around Tustin Ranch, who are adversely affected

10 by this Project approval, and who are beneficially interested in the quality of life in Tustin Ranch

11 through responsible construction project planning and development.
7. Petitioner is beneficially and directly interested the actions of the City Council
12 and the Planning Commission, in approving the Project, which would directly, adversely and
13 irreparably affect Petitioner, the environment, and the larger community of the City of Tustin, as
14 described herein.

15

16 THE PARTIES

17 8. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of individuals, including, but not

18 limited to, Petitioner, Anne J. Lee, who will be adversely affected by the traffic, air quality,

19 soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other impacts generated by the Project. Petitioner

20 includes individuals and their families, who live and work in the City of Tustin, and in Tustin

21 Ranch. Because they are local residents, the individual members of Petitioner would be

22 directly affected by the traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise, and other
environmental impacts created by the Project. In addition, individual members may also work
23 on the Project itself. As such, they would be first in line to be exposed to any health and safety
24 hazards that exist on the Project site.
25 9. Respondents, the Planning Commission and the City Council, are each a local
26 government agency and a political subdivision of the State of California, charged with the
27 authority to regulate and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all

28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP $ 1094.5 ($ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

• 3

1 times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws,

2 including CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The Planning Commission is the Lead Agency

3 under CEQA for the preparation of required environmental analysis pertaining to the Project.

4 The City Council is the legislative body for the City of Tustin, and, thus, has the authority to

5 legislate land use and policy, including changes thereto, within its jurisdiction. As the

6 legislative body for the City of Tustin, the City Council is ultimately responsible for the
approval of the Project.
7
10.
8 Real party in interest, Terry Odle/MG2 (*Applicant," "Developer," or "Real
Party") is the applicant for the entitlements that constitute the Project. Based on the 9 Applicant's status as the sole identified applicant and devcloper of the Project, and on
10) Petitioner's information and belief, Applicant adequately represents the interests of any and all
11 other non-joined parties in the Project.

12 11. As result of the objections posed by its constituent members, and others,
13 Petitioner has exhausted, or is excused from exhausting, all of its administrative remedies, and
14 now seeks the assistance of the Court to tesolve the issues set forth herein pursuant to PRC §

15 21177(a).

16 12. Moreover, as a result of the actions of Respondents as hereinbefore alleged,

17 Petitioner has been compelled to engage attorneys to challenge the ultra vires actions of

18 Respondents and to advance costs in connection therewith. Petitioner will accordingly seek the

19 recovery of attorneys' fees and costs upon the successful conclusion of this case.

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 Proiect Baokground: Environmental Review and Approval

23 13. On June 11, 2019, the Planning Commission conducted a publio hearing on an
24 application for DR 2018-00026 and CUP 2018-00018 seeking to demolish the existing Goodyear
25 Tire Center and adjacent Goodyear parking area at 2541 El Camino Real and to replace that

26 structure with 56 new parking stalls and further to construct, at 2655 El Camino Real, a new 16-

27 pump (32 individual fucling units) Costco gasoline fucl station with overhcad canopy and related

.4

1 cquipment. At the meeting, 10 speakers provided Comments regarding the Project. The speakers

2 included members of Petitioner, residents, interested parties and business owners. The majority

3 of these speakers expressed concern and opposition. Two c-mails were received in favor of the

4 proposed Project. After receiving Public Comments, the Planning Commission continued the

5 public hearing to its meeting of July 9, 2019, so that its staff could address the concerns

6 expressed by the public as well as questions posed by the Planning Commission.
14. On July 9, 2019, the Planning Commission took additional public comments (15
7 people spoke in support of the Project and 10 people opposed the Project, including members of
8 Petitioner), received Planning Commission staff Responses to the Planning Commission's
9 questions, and then adopted Resolution No. 4385 approving the Project.
10 15. On July 19, 2019, a written appeal was filed concerning the Planning

11 Commission's adoption of Resolution No. 4385 approving the Project. The appeal; (i) stated that
12 the actions taken by the Planning Commission should be reversed; (ii) identified concerns related

13 to the gas station operation; and (iii) identified concerns related to the adequacy of the

14 environmental determination of the proposed Project.
16.
15 An Agenda Report, dated as of October 15, 2019, was drafted by the Community

16 Development Director to the City Manager in support of the approval of the Project (*Report").
The Report failed reasonably and/or adequately to consider the impact of the traffic, air quality,
17 soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other impacts to the community, both during
18 construction, and after the Project was built. The failure to consider these environmental issues,
19 and the Respondents' dependence on the Class 32 Exemption to avoid performing any
20 environmental assessment at all, renders the Report ineffective as an adequate informational

21 environmental document. The traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise, and

22 other environmental impacts foreseeably to be caused by the Project are significant and

23 unavoidable. Using the Class 32 Exemption avoids addressing these issues and renders the

24 approval of Resolution 4385, which adopted DR 2018-00026 and approved CUP 2018-00018,
improper. The Report, accordingly, lacks substantial evidence to support its conclusions and fails 25 to properly mitigate the Project's significant environmental impacts.

1 17. In this case, enough relevant information was presented in the Public Comments

2 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines § 15384 (see also PRC § 21082.2.), by Petitioner, and by other

3 concerned residents unrelated to Petitioner such that a fair argument could easily be made to

4 support the Petitioner's conclusions that the Respondents failed reasonably and/or adequately to

5 consider the impact of the traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other

6 environmental impacts that would be created by the Project, even though other conclusions
might also be reached. As a result, this Court must disallow the Class 32 Exemption and
7 Respondents must be ordered by this Court to conduct a thorough environmental review on this
8 Project.
9 18. In addition to the issues presented above, Petitioners noted in their Public
10 Comments, the Report does not properly assess the significance of Project-level greenhouse gas

11 impacts under CEQA and does not adequately address how specific mitigation strategies might

12 be implemented at the Project level. Respondents' adoption of the Report, and the subsequent

13 application of the Class 32 Exemption to the Project, was arbitrary and was not supported by

14 substantial evidence. On October 14h and October 15th Petitioner submitted written comments on

15 the Report which: (i) pointed to the Report's inadequate analysis of the Project's traffic, air

16 quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other environmental impacts; (ii) stated that
the Class 32 Exemption was improper; and (iii) charged that the Respondents failed to adopt
17 feasible mitigation measures to reduce these construction related and Project related
18 environmental impacts.

19 19. Specifically, the City Council designated the Project to be an "urban infill"
20 development. See CEQA Guidelines § 15332. The Project does not meet the requirements of

21 subsections (a)-(e) of the Guidelines, inter alia because it is situated within an existing

22 retail/commercial development of approximately 274,175 square feet. Although the specific

23 construction site is approximately 2.38 acres in size, it has been deliberately fragmented from the

24 overalt commercial site in which the project sits (and that would receive the greatest benefit from

25 the Project). Together, the Project site and the overall commercial site exceed the 5-acre limit
provided for in the CEQA Guidelines. Furthermore, the proposed Project site is not surrounded
26 by urban uses. Rather, it is bordered on two sides by single family residences and condominiums.

1 There are other sites within the Tustin city limits that would mect all five criteria mandated by
2 CEQA Guidelines $ 15332.

3 20. The proximity of the Project to residential neighborhoods, the planned demolition
of a Goodyear Tire Center as part of the Project, and the planned construction of a 16-pump (32
individual fucling stations) Costco gasoline fucling station with canopy and related equipment

6 (i.e., the installation of several underground storage tanks) all combine to create "unusual
circumstances" that must be analyzed for significant effects on the surrounding community as
required by CEQA Guidelines 15332.
21. The City Council conducted a public hearing to consider the Project, during
which irregularities occurred. Well over 100 people attended the hearing to voice their opinions
10 about the Project. However, the City Council stopped receiving speaker cards well in advance of
11 the beginning of the meeting. The effect was that concerned citizens, including members of

12 Petitioner, were unable to be heard. During the meeting, speakers were supposed to be given

13 three minutes each to speak. However, members of the City Council randomly curtailed

14 comments by the attorney for Petitioner, and others, who voiced opinions in opposition to the

15 Project, while granting the attorney for the developer nearly 20 minutes to speak, uninterrupted.

16 After the public hearing, the City Council approved the Project by a 4 to I vote. The Notice of
Exemption was filed on October 16, 2019. This action is timely filed, within 35 days of the
17 Notice of Exemption.
18 22. Petitioner has complied with PRC § 21167.5 by prior service upon Respondents
19 and Real Party of a Notice indicating Petitioner's intent to file this Petition. Proof of Service of

20 this notification, with the notification, is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and is made a part hereof.

21 23. Petitioner has requested that the Planning Commission and City Council each
22 prepare their respective portion of the record of proceedings in the above-captioned proceeding

23 and that they employ alternative methods of record preparation as appropriate pursuant to PRC §

24 21167.6(b)(2) in order to save costs. A true and correct copy of Petitioner's request is attached
hereto as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this reference. 25 #/

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA;

3 Use of a Class 32 Exemption is Unreasonable and a Transparent Abuse of Discretion)

4 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

5 above.

6 25. CEQA requires a lead agency for project to undertake an environmental review

7 that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public

8 review and comment on the environmental review. The environmental review must provide

9 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider

10 environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
26. Respondents improperly applied a Class 32 Exemption to the Project. The Class
11 32 Exemption substantially truncates the public environmental review process for all adjacent
12 residents who are concerned about the Project by denoting the Project to be an "infill" to an
13 existing project that will create no unusual circumstances impacting the environment.
14 27. The Class 32 Categorical Exemption (one of several categorical exemptions that

15 are set forth in the CEQA guidelines) applies to small projects (less than 5 acres), where the

16 project is an "infill" project in urbanized areas (i.e., one that is not a brownfield project). In this

17 case, the overall mall is about 12 acres, although the proposed construction site for the Project, a

18 portion of the mall, is approximately 2.38 acres. The Class 32 Exemption does not apply where

19 the project creates "unusual circumstances" that will impact the environment, Such is the case

20 with the Project.
28. CEQA's categorical exemptions (set forth in the CEQA Guidelines) are subject to
21 several exceptions that would preclude the exemption if a reasonable possibility were to exist of
22 a significant effect on the environment due to "unusual eireumstances.' (14 Cal. Code Regs co.
23 15300.2(c).) Typically, courts have analyzed this exception under two-prongs: (1) whether a 3 :0 project presents unusual circumstances, and (2) whether evidence exists of a reasonable
possibility of a significant effect due to the unusual circumstances. The "fair argüment" standard
26 of review is used for an agency's determination that the exception does not apply, A fair
& argument exists that the demolition of the Goodyear Tire Center, and the subsequent construction
28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP $ 1094.5 ($ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE $ 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

.8

and operation of 32 individual fucling units, with a canopy and related equipment (i.e.,

2 underground gasoline storage tanks) will have an effect on the environment, and is itself an

3 unusuaf circumstance that triggers the exception and precludes the Class 32 Exemption.

4 29. The construction of the Project may create the following unusual circumstances
that must be analyzed in further and more complete environmental review:

a. This is a Costco gasoline fueling station with 16 pumps (containing 32
individual fueling units). Developer plans to use a red/green light system, retractable bollards,
7 and key fobs for payment to "help shorten lines of waiting customers.' Customers must have a
Costco card to access the pumps. This means the gas station may not be for the use of the
9 adjacent residents, who will be forced to bear the brunt of the environmental impacts created by

10 this Project. Also, the Developer clearly expects large crowds of idling vehicles, as is the typical

11 experience for people who purchase gas at a Costco gas station. At a minimum, this raises the

12 fair argument that traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other issues

13 should have been studied.

14 b. The demolition of the Goodyear Tire Center will present a special set of

15 environmental impacts on its own. Common experience suggests that the site may contain oil,
rubber resins and other toxic chemicals in the soil, and inside the existing structure, that will be
16 disturbed at demolition, and during regrading of the soil. Further environmental review, be it a
17 mitigated negative declaration, or a full EIR, should have been prepared in order to study these
18 effects. Moreover, a fair argument exists that a 16-pump (containing 32 individual fueling units)
19 gas station may result in oil, gasoline and other toxins being washed into the local soil and

20 ground water. This impact must be studied so that its impacts on the local area may be fully

21 assessed and addressed.

22 c. The location of the four fueling islands with 16 pumps (containing 32

23 individual fueling units) and the site configuration on the property will accommodate the fueling

24 for 32 vehicles, with additional stacking of another 40 vehicles east of the pump islands. The
Project would also provide a dedicated westbound right turn lane into the site at Auto Center
25 Drive and El Camino Real and restriping of El Camino Real.
26
27

28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP $ 1094.5 ($ 1085): PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE S 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

: 9

1 d.

2 The Planning Commission abused its discretion by applying a Class 32

3 Exemption to this Project without properly and fully considering how this construction Project
will affect the abutting neighborhoods.

4 e.

5 If queues should extend beyond the designated queue area, two (2) queue
management plans have been included within the Developer's Traffic Analysis. If queucs cannot

6 be adequately managed by the strategies shown in the plan, the northbound right tum into the

7 parking aisle adjacent to the fuel station would be closed using retractable bollards to route

8 customers to the next parking aisle to provide more queuing area prior to affecting street
operations. In addition to the queuc management plan, the City has stipulated that during peak
9 l demands, three (3) on-site traffic attendants will be present to guide and direct traffic when.
10 fueling. Petitioner notes that the bollards and traffic attendants would most likely be deployed
11

12 after the traffic back-up occurs. These are very significant impacts that must each be further
studied.

13 30. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

14 discretion by applying the Class 32 Exemption to the Project, and by subsequently approving

15 Resolution 4385, which adopted DR 2018-00026 and approved CUP 2018-00018. Such

16 approvals do not comply with CEQA. Accordingly, Respondent City Council's certification of

17 Resolution 4385, which approved DR 2018-00026 and approved CUP 2018-00018, must be set

18 aside. The process must be reopened for a more complete environmental review process.
31.

19 The traffic, air, soil, ground water, noise and other impacts created by the Project

20 are significant, deleterious, and unavoidable. The Respondents' failure to consider these issues

21 renders the Report unreasonably inadequate as an informational environmental document.
32.

22 For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner requests that the approval of Resolution

Rö 4385 be set: aside and that this Court direct the City Council to require further environmental
review be prepared to address the Project's errors and deficiencies in the areas of traffic, air
quality, soil quality, ground water quality and noise.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CEQA; Because Respondents Short-Circuited the Environmental
Review Process With Its Improper Use of the Class 32 Exemption Respondents Did Not
Consider All Feasible Measures)

5 33. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

6 above.

7 34. Under CEQA, the City of Tustin cannot approve the Project as proposed because

8 there are feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen one or more of

9 the Project's significant environmental effects. Cal. Pub. Resources Code, § 21002. For example,

10 on information and belief, the Developer failed to consider alternative sites that might be better

11 suited for the development. There are any number of alternative sites that might have been
chosen, none of which would pose the detrimental impacts to the surrounding residential
12 communities as are posed by the current chosen site. The City of Tustin must consider
13 reasonable mitigation measures to address the environmental impacts clearly identified herein in
14 an environmental review that should be directed by this Court. See CEQA Guidelines §15088.
15 35. As demonstrated above, the Report fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and
16 mitigate the Project's environmental impacts, resulting in a legally deficient CEQA review. The

17 City of Tustin must prepare a full EIR, that addresses these inadequacies and must circulate the

18 EIR for public review to consider these critical issues.

19

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Inadequate Response to Comments)
36. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
22 above.
23 37. Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by Petitioner,
24 and by other members of the public. Instead, the responses given to numerous comments
25 regarding the Project's impacts to, traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and

26 other issues regarding the adequacy of the Report's treatment of mitigation measures and

27

28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 ($ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE 21000 ET SEQ.
(CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

11

alternatives are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-responsive and contrary to the
2 requirements of CEQA.

3 38. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed
4 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,
5 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by

6 substantial evidence.

7

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 WHEREFORE, the Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

10 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate, commanding Respondents:
11 a. to vacate and set aside approval of the Project, including the adoption of

12 Resolution 4385, which in turn adopted DR 2018-00026 and approved CUP 2018-00018, and all

13 associated approvals;
b. to vacate and set aside application of the Class 32 Exemption to the 14

15 Project;

C. to undertake a reasonable and appropriate environmental review for 16 the Project;
17 d. for reasonable attorneys' fees and costs otherwise incurred herein;
18 and/or

19 e. any such relief as this Court deems adequate and proper.
