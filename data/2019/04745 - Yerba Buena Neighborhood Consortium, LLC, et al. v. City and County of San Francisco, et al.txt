Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 1. The non-profit Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC, brings this
action in the public interest on behalf of thousands of elders and other residents of the
4

5 unique Yerba Buena/South of Market Neighborhood in San Francisco.
The Consortium seeks enforcement of mandates of the California Environmental

Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental impact report (EIR) prepared for the city's
8

9 proposed Central South of Market (SoMa) Plan fails to analyze and mitigate the

10 significant environmental impacts of the proposed influx of up to 30,000 new jobs and

11 20,000 new residents. Of particular concern is the EIR's failure to analyze and mitigate

12 Plan-related and cumulative demand for public services such as police, fire, and
13

14 recreation, or to address Plan-specific and cumulative - unstudied and unmitigated -

15 grave earthquake dangers and impacts in SoMa.

16 As held three weeks ago by the California Supreme Court in Sierra Club v.
17

18 County of Fresno, "adequate description of adverse environmental effects is necessary

19 to inform the critical discussion of mitigation measures and project alternatives at the

20 core of the EIR.' The Court clarified the de novo standard of review for EIR adequacy as

21 a question of law for a court rather than deferential review for substantial evidence.
22

23 A peremptory writ of mandamus should issue in the public interest.

24 Jurisdiction

25
2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168
26

27 et seq. and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 et seq. because the parties and Plan

28 footprint are in the City and County of San Francisco.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Parties

2 3.

3 Petitioner Yerba Buena Consortium is a California LLC that is a subsidiary

4 of the California non-profit corporation Tenants and Owners Development Corporation

5 (TODCO), founded for community-based affordable housing and neighborhood

6

7 advocacy after approval of the Yerba Buena Center Redevelopment Project in the 1970s.

8 Since 1980 TODCO has successfully provided low-income housing and resident services

9 to this community, and its Consortium continues to advocate for pedestrian safety,

10

11 community services, and community-building programs in the city's South of Market

12 neighborhood as well as for citywide issues, including both the Proposition C Child

13 Education ballot measure and the Proposition C Homeless Assistance ballot measure in

+' 14 2018. TODCO continues to renovate, improve, and manage almost 1000 units of

15

16 affordable housing and to maximize the quality of life of neighborhood residents

17 through community planning and advocacy undertaken by its Consortium. The

18 Consortium brings this petition on behalf of others similarly situated too numerous to

19 be brought before this Court as petitioners. The Consortium exhausted administrative

20

21 remedies by commenting on the Central SoMa Plan EIR and objecting to its approval.

4.

22 Respondents City and County of San Francisco, San Francisco Board of

23 Supervisors, and San Francisco Planning Department are the government agency and

24

25 its elected legislative body and appointed department that together took the role of the

26 project sponsor and lead agency, prepared and certified the EIR, and approved the

Central SoMa Plan.

1 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously named respondents whose true names and

2 capacities are currently unknown to petitioners. If and when their true names and
3 capacities are known, the Consortium will amend this petition to assert them.

5 General Allegations
6

7 7. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

8 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of
9 I proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.
10

11 Project Description and Environmental Setting

12 8. The Central SoMa Plan (the Plan) is a comprehensive plan for the area

13 surrounding the southern portion of the city's Central Subway transit line, a 1.7-mile
14
extension of the Third Street light rail line that will link the Caltrain Depot at Fourth
15

16 and King Streets to Chinatown to provide service within the SoMa area. The Plan area

17 includes 230 acres and 17 city blocks, as well as streets that connect SoMa to adjacent

18 neighborhoods: Downtown, Mission Bay, Rincon Hill, and the Mission District.
19

20 9. The Plan Area is bounded by Second Street on the east, Sixth Street on the

21 west, Townsend Street on the south, and an irregular border to the north along

22 Folsom, Howard, and Stevenson Streets. The project includes street network changes
23

24 throughout the Plan Area, affecting Howard, Folsom, Harrison, Bryant, Braiman,

25 Third, and Fourth Streets.

26 10. The Plan addresses land use; transportation infrastructure; parks, open

27
space, and recreation facilities; ecological sustainability; historic preservation; urban
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 design and urban form; and financial programs and implementation mechanisms to

2 fund public improvements.

3
11. The Plan's announced goals are to enable dense growth in SoMa by, inter
4

5 alia, (1) lessening land use restrictions; (2) amending height and bulk districts to allow

6 for taller buildings; and (3) modifying streets and circulation.

7
12. The Plan includes financial programs for its implementation, including
8

9 new fees, taxes, assessments on subsequent development projects, and creation of a

10 Housing Sustainability District.

11 Environmental Review Process

12
13. The city's Planning Department determined that an EIR was required for
13

14 the Plan and provided notice in April 2013. A draft program and project level EIR was

15 published in December 2016 and circulated for public comment. The Planning

16 Commission held a public hearing on the Draft EIR in January 2017. Public comments
17

18 were voluminous. The city's CEQA Responses to Comments was published in March

19 2018, followed by errata in April and May.

20 14. The Planning Commission certified the EIR in May 2018. Separate appeals

21 of the certification were filed by the Consortium, SFBlu, and the South of Market
22

23 Community Action Network known as SOMCAN. The San Francisco Board of

24 Supervisors heard and denied the appeal in September 2018 and upheld the EIR.

25 Project Approvals
26
15. The city approved the Central SoMa Plan on December 12, 2018, via 27

28 actions of the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor following recommendations of the

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 Planning Commission, including establishment of the Central SoMa Speciál Tax

2 District; incurring bonded indebtness and other debt for the Central SoMa Special Tax
3 District; amending the Central SoMa Special Use District; amending the
4

5 Administrative Code Special Tax Financing Law; amending the General Plan;

6 approving changes to the administrative and planning codes to include the Central

7 South of Market Area Plan; and amending the Business and Tax Regulations, Planning
8
Codes Central South of Market Housing Sustainability District. 9

10 16. The Consortium has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

11 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and
12 irreparable harm to the Consortium and San Francisco residents via approval and
13

14 implementation of the Central SoMa Plan without compliance with state law.

15 Respondents have the capacity to correct their violations of law but refuse to do so.

16 17. The Consortium has complied with Public Resources section 21167.5 by
17

18 providing the respondents with a copy of a notice of intention to commence this action.

19 The original notice and proof of service are concurrently filed with this petition. A copy

20 of this petition is being provided to the Attorney General.

21

22 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

23
18. The Consortium incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
24

25 19. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

26 law in certifying the EIR and relying upon its content to approve the Central SoMa Plan

27 without adequate environmental review. The EIR's analysis was incomplete and
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 prejudiced project approval, particularly on issues relating to analysis and mitigation of

2 the significant environmental impacts of a proposed influx of up to 30,000 new jobs
3

4 and 20,000 new residents in Central SoMa, a total daily population increase of 50,000.

5 20. The EIR failed to serve as an adequate public disclosure document in its

6 analysis of significant environmental impacts and identification of mitigation measures

*7 and alternatives to Plan-related and cumulative demand for public services such as
8

9 police, fire, and recreation, or to address Plan-specific and cumulative unstudied and

10 unmitigated - grave earthquake dangers and impacts in SoMa, among other

11 inadequacies identified in comments submitted during the initial study and EIR
12 comment process, correspondence, and comments at public hearings on the Plan.
13

14 21. The city's findings certifying the EIR and approving the Plan are

15 inadequate and are not supported by substantial evidence.

16

17 WHEREFORE, the Consortium prays:

18 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the city to
19

20 rescind its certification of the Central SoMa Plan EIR, to void all project approvals and

21 entitlements and to refrain from reconsidering approval pending recirculation and

22 certification of a revised EIR that fully complies with CEQA;

23 2. For costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5; and
24

25 3. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
