PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Campaign for Sustainable Transportation (Petitioner) brings suit

3 against Respondent California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) for its failure to

4 conduct adequate environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act

5 (CEQA) (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), in its approval of the Tier I - Corridor

6 Analysis of High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes and Transportation System Management
7 Alternatives and Tier II - Build Project Analysis of 41st Avenue to Soquel Avenue/Drive

8 Auxiliary Lanes and Chanticleer Avenue Pedestrian-Bicycle Overcrossing (Project).
9 2. According to CalTrans, the primary goal of the Project is to improve circulation
10 along an 8.9-mile section of Highway 1 in the County of Santa Cruz, stretching roughly from
11 Morrissey Boulevard to the north and west, to San Andreas Road/Larkin Valley Road to the
12 south and east.

13 3. The Project is divided into two components, or tiers. Tier II comprises
14 CalTrans' more immediately planned implementation of the Project across a 1.4-mile stretch of

15 Highway 1 from 41st Avenue to Soquel Avenue/Soquel Drive. Tier II does nothing to
16 alleviate southbound evening commutes. In fact, Caltrans own projections assume that the

17 Project will exacerbate southbound traffic congestion. Petitioner asserts that alternative

18 measures and improvements, which CalTrans refused to consider in violation of CEQA, would
19 improve circulation rather than exacerbate it. Tier I comprises implementation of the Project

20 across the entire 8.9-mile stretch of Highway 1, from 0.4 miles south of the San

21 Andreas/Larkin Valley Road interchange to 0.3 miles north of the Morrissey Boulevard
22 interchange. The Project Environmental Impact Report (EIR) analyzed Tier I at the "program"
23 level, whereas the EIR analyzed implementation of the Tier II component of the Project at the II
24 project level. Rather than provide a stable, finite Project description, CalTrans described the
25 Project in terms of three alternatives: Tier I High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lane Alternative,
26 Tier Transportation System Management (TSM) Alternative, a Tier I No Build Alternative,
27 and a Tier II Auxiliary Lane Alternative. The Draft EIR stated CalTrans would select which
28 project it would implement among the alternatives after the public circulation period of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

1 Draft EIR. The Tier I alternatives considered construction and expansion of various structures,
2 including highway mainline changes, auxiliary lane improvements (including expansion),

3 highway interchange improvements (including expansion), pedestrian and bicycle

4 overcrossings, bridge replacement, bridge widening, and retaining and sound walls. In

5 addition, all alternatives, including the No Build Alternative, considered improvements to

6 traffic signal coordination and the transportation operations system. The Tier II Auxiliary
7 Lane Alternative considered expanding the freeway to construct additional northbound and
8 southbound auxiliary lanes from 41 st Avenue to Soquel Drive, among other improvements.
CalTrans further indicated it may not implement any of the Tier I and II alternatives as they
10 were described, depending on the availability of funding. As indicated in its Notice of
11 Determination, CalTrans ultimately selected the Tier I HOV Lane Alternative and the Tier II

12 Auxiliary Lane Alternative as the Project, both focused on widening the highway along the
13 entire length of the Project site.

14 4. The Project will cause severe and irreparable impacts to the environment.

15 Highway widening and other stated improvements will facilitate increases in population
16 growth and regional traffic volumes, which will result in correspondingly large increased
17 impacts to greenhouse gases, air quality, traffic, noise, flooding, and groundwater resources.

18 Despite the severe impacts the Project will cause, CalTrans failed to conduct adequate
19 environmental review pursuant to CEQA. The EIR's numerous deficiencies include, but are by
20 no means limited to, failure to: provide a stable, finite Project description; evaluate a
21 reasonable range of alternatives to the Project; identify or select an environmentally superior
22 alternative or a "No Project" alternative; evaluate any alternatives at all to the Tier II Auxiliary

23 Lane Alternative portion of the Project; consider, evaluate, or mitigate direct, indirect, and
24 cumulative impacts to greenhouse gases, air quality, noise, population growth, hydrology,
25 water supply, coastal resources, or biological resources; and provide an accurate and

26 informative discussion of the environmental setting. Furthermore, CalTrans failed to

27 adequately respond to comments submitted by Petitioner and other commenters, or to re-

28 circulate the Draft EIR after the addition of large amounts of new substantive information,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

1 which CalTrans belatedly introduced in its Final EIR. These deficiencies of CalTrans'

2 environmental review violate CEQA.

5. Despite the numerous, fatal shortcomings of CalTrans' environmental review,

4 CalTrans approved the Project on December 14, 2018. On January 3, 2019, CalTrans filed its
Notice of Determination for the Project pursuant to CEQA, thus commencing a thirty-day
6 statute of limitations. This litigation followed.

7 II. PARTIES

8 6. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully

9 set forth herein.

10 7. Petitioner CAMPAIGN FOR SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION, also and

11 formerly known as the CAMPAIGN FOR SENSIBLE TRANSPORTATION, is an

12 unincorporated association of individuals and organizations who seek to secure informed Santa

13 Cruz County transportation policies that fully protect environmental quality. Petitioner has a

14 strong interest in protecting the environment within the County of Santa Cruz, including by

15 avoiding or reducing the environmental impacts of the Project. Members of Petitioner

16 Campaign for Sustainable Transportation are residents and taxpayers in the County of Santa

17 Cruz and enjoy participating in recreational activities, including in areas that will be affected
18. by the Project. Furthermore, members of Petitioner regularly travel Highway 1 and nearby

19 local roads, including those portions of the highway that will be affected by the Project.

20 Petitioner and its members will be adversely affected by the Project's significant

21 environmental impacts. Petitioner and its members also have a direct and beneficial interest in

22 CalTrans' compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. These interests will be directly

23 and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of the law as set forth in this

24 Petition and which will cause substantial and irreversible harm to the natural environment.

25 Petitioner submitted comments prior to the approval of the EIR that addressed the inadequacies

26 of CalTrans' environmental review.

27 8. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION is an

28 agency in the executive branch of the State of California, operating within the California State

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

Transportation Agency. It operates a multi-modal transportation system across the state, and is

2 responsible for the planning, building and maintenance of that system, including the sections of

3 Highway 1 that are the subject of this Petition for Writ of Mandamus.
9. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
Does through 20, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues said Respondents by such

6 fictitious names and will seck leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their
7 identities have been ascertained.

8 10. Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Respondents
9 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and
10 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency
11 and employment.

12 III. STANDING

13 11. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 10 as if fully

14 set forth herein.

15 12. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner.

16 Petitioner is an unincorporated association that is dedicated to protecting the environment and

17 ensuring less environmentally harmful alternatives to highway widening are adequately

18 considered, including along the portions of the Highway 1 corridor and County of Santa Cruz

19 that will be affected by the Project. Members of Petitioner reside and pay taxes in the County

20 of Santa Cruz. Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR will adversely affect these

21 interests of Petitioner and its members. Petitioner and its members, on behalf thereof, have

22 submitted comments on and objections to CalTrans' lack of compliance with CEQA.

23 Accordingly, Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code

24 § 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in this
25 litigation by individual members is not required.

26 13. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

27 Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code § 21167; CEQA Guidelines

28 § 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 other applicable laws and regulations.

2 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 14. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 13 as if fully

4 set forth herein.

5 15. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by

6 itself or others, raising each and every issue known to it before CalTrans, in compliance with

7 Public Resources Code 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5, and other

8 applicable laws. Since CalTrans does not hold public hearings after the release of a Final EIR

9 and approval of the Project is simultaneous with, or preceded by, release of the Final EIR,

10 further exhaustion of administrative remedies is not necessary. Pub. Resources Code c0?

11 21177(e).

12 16. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code §
13 21167.5 was mailed to CalTrans on January 30, 2019. (Letter and Proof of Service are

14 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

15

16 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]
18 17. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully
19 set forth herein.
20 18. CalTrans' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because, inter
21 alia, the EIR fails to provide a stable and finite Project description; evaluate a reasonable range
22 of alternatives to the Project; identify, evaluate, or select an environmentally superior
23 alternative or a "No Project" alternative; provide any alternatives at all to the Tier II Auxiliary
24 Lane Alternative portion of the Project; adequately consider, evaluate, or mitigate direct,
25 indirect, and cumulative impacts to greenhouse gases, air quality, noise, population growth,
26 hydrology, water supply, coastal resources, or biological resources; did not properly evaluate
27 conflicts with the Coastal Act, specifically those provisions protecting Environmentally
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

P Sensitive Habitat Areas; and provide an accurate and informative discussion of the

2 environmental setting. Furthermore, CalTrans failed to adequately respond to comments

3 submitted by Petitioner and other commenters, or to re-circulate the Draft EIR after the

4 addition of large amounts of new substantive information, which CalTrans belatedly

5 introduced in its Final EIR.

6 19. The EIR must contain an accurate and stable project description in order to be
7 considered adequate as an informational document. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15124.) Failure to
g provide a stable and finite project description defeats the informational purposes of CEQA and
invalidates the EIR. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 7.1 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-
10 193.) Here, the Draft EIR for the Project did not contain a stable and finite project description,
11 in violation of CEQA. Instead, CalTrans presented four alternatives as the Project and
12 purposefully withheld its selection of the proposed Project until after the close of the public
13 review period, thereby presenting commenters with an unstable, shifting Project description, in
14 violation of CEQA.

15 20. The EIR must evaluate a reasonable range of feasible alternatives, including by
16 identifying an evaluating a "no project" alternative and an environmentally superior
17 alternative. 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.6. Here, Caltrans failed to conduct a proper
18 alternatives analysis, including by not evaluating a reasonable range of alternatives, by entirely
19 failing to consider any alternatives at all to the project-level Tier II portion of the Project, by
20 failing to identify or evaluate an environmentally superior alternative, and by failing to disclose
21 and evaluate a No Project Alternative, as required by CEQA. Furthermore, no evidence
-22 supports CalTrans' dismissal of the No Build alternative, as the primary reason it provided to
23 dismiss this alternative was based on a legally inaccurate and invalid interpretation of the
24 California Coastal Act.

25 21. The EIR must provide an accurate description of the physical environmental
26 conditions in the vicinity of the Project in a manner that accurately conveys the impacts of the
27 Project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(a).) Here, CalTrans did not adequately evaluate,
28 disclose, or describe baseline environmental conditions, including regarding baseline traffic

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

P and air quality conditions. CalTrans' reliance on information that was over a decade old

2 misinformed readers regarding the effects of the Project and did not serve the informational
3 purposes of CEQA.

4 22. CalTrans failed to provide an adequate discussion of Project-related impacts and
5 mitigation measures, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts. CEQA requires that
6 CalTrans consider and disclose the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of
A the Project, and to adopt all feasible mitigation needed to reduce Project-related impacts. (14
8 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15126.2; 15130.) The analysis in the EIR was, at times, conflicting and
9 failed to accurately disclose the significant environmental effect of the Project, including its
10 direct, indirect, and cumulative effects on air quality, greenhouse gases, noise, traffic,
11 biological resources, population growth, groundwater supplies, coastal resources and conflicts
12 with the California Coastal Act (Public Resources Code 30000 et seq.) and Santa Cruz
13 County Code, and flooding. Furthermore, Respondent failed to accurately describe and
14 implement all feasible mitigation measures, and its finding that application of certain
15 unenforceable, illusory, and non-binding mitigation measures served to reduce the
16 environmental impacts of the Project is not supported by substantial evidence.
17 23. CEQA requires lead agencies, such as CalTrans, to assess the incremental effect
18 of the Project in conjunction with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future
19 projects in the vicinity. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15130; 15355.) Crucially, cumulative impacts

over a 20 can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place
21 period of time. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15355.) Here, CalTrans' discussion of cumulative
22 impacts, including regarding the above-mentioned categories, was conclusory and therefore
23 legally inadequate. For instance, CalTrans repeatedly assumed, without evidence or analysis,
24 that all other nearby projects with related impacts will adopt mitigation that will reduce these
25 projects' direct and indirect impacts to a less-than-significant level, and that these mitigation
26 measures would ensure that cumulative impacts would remain less than significant. This
27 reasoning does not support a conclusion that cumulative impacts will remain less than
28 significant, both because CalTrans failed to support its assumptions with evidence, and because

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

this analysis fails to account for the potential for impacts of the Project in conjunction with

2 other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects to be individually minor but

3 collectively significant, in violation of CEQA.
24. CEQA requires CalTrans to adopt all feasible mitigation measures that serve to

5 reduce the environmental impacts of the Project, or else, select an alternative that reduces these

6 impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. $15126.4; 15126.6.) Here, as the EIR grossly misstated and

7 underrepresented the environmental impacts of the Project, CalTrans' conclusions regarding
8 the ability of mitigation measures to reduce Project impacts to a less-than-significant level are
9 based on incorrect assumptions and are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.
10 Likewise, CalTrans did not adopt all feasible and mitigation measures necessary to reduce the
11 impacts of the Project on the environment, and certain mitigation measures adopted by
12 CalTrans were unenforceable, illusory, and non-binding, in violation of CEQA.
13 25. CEQA requires the recirculation of the EIR when the lead agency adds
14 significant new information after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for
15 public review but before certification of the EIR. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.5.) Here,
16 CalTrans was required to recirculate the EIR, inter alia, because its discussion of greenhouse
17 gas impacts in the Draft EIR was so fundamentally inadequate and flawed that this discussion
18 precluded meaningful public comment. In a tacit recognition of these severe deficiencies,
19 CalTrans substantially revised and significantly augmented its discussion of greenhouse gas
20 impacts in the Final EIR, including by providing significant new information and analysis that
21 was not included in the Draft EIR. CalTrans' failure to recirculate the EIR after it added

22 copious amounts of significant new information and analysis to the Final EIR, without
23 recirculation for public review and comment, violates CEQA.

24 26. CalTrans was required to fully and adequately respond to commenters' concerns
25 raised during the public review period. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §15088.) Here, CalTrans failed to

26 adequately respond to issues raised by Petitioner and others during the comment period, as
27 required by CEQA.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 III. INJUNCTION

2 .27. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully

3 set forth herein.

4 28. An actual controversy has arisen concerning CalTrans' failure to comply with

5 CEQA, as set forth, above.

6• 29. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, CalTrans has failed to

7 adhere to the mandates of CEQA and conduct adequate environmental review as required by

8 law and, thus, has failed to proceed in a manner according to law in approving the Project.

9 30. At all times mentioned herein, CalTrans has been able to comply with CEQA,

10 prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of the law.

11 Notwithstanding such an ability, CalTrans has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to

12 comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of the law.

13 31. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that CalTrans is
14 threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said implementation

15 of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in significant and
16| unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

17 32. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

18 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

19 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of Santa Cruz and the State of

20 California. Petitioner will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if CalTrans' actions

21 described herein are not set aside.

22 33. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
23 should issue restraining CalTrans from proceeding with development of the Project.

24 34. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

25 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying CalTrans' approval of the Project

26 and certification of the EIR.

27 IV. ATTORNEYS' FEES

28 35. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
10

1 set forth herein.

2 • 36. In pursuing this action, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the People
3 of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from CalTrans reasonable

4 attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure & 1021.5 and other
5 provisions of the law.

6 PRAYER

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

8 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering CalTrans to set

O aside any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to the approval to proceed with

10 implementation of Tier I and Tier II of the Project and certification of the EIR, unless and until

11 CalTrans takes all necessary steps to bring its actions into compliance with CEQA.

12 2. For an order staying CalTrans or other Project applicants from engaging in any
13 activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review of the Project complies with

14 California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA, and
15 until CalTrans abides by the procedural requirements set forth in all relevant State and local
16 planning and zoning laws.

17 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure §

18 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

19 4. For costs of suit; and

20 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation

Dear Ms. Berman and Mr. Gubbins:

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Campaign for Sustainable Transportation (Petitioner) will commence litigation against the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans).
This litigation challenges the actions of CalTrans in approving the Tier I - Corridor Analysis of High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes and Transportation System Management Alternatives and Tier II - Build Project Analysis of 41st Avenue to Soquel Avenue/Drive Auxiliary Lanes and Chanticleer Avenue Pedestrian-Bicycle Overcrossing Project (Project) and certifying the environmental Impact Report for the Project to allow CalTrans, inter alia, to add lanes and expand an 8.9-mile section of Highway 1 in the County of Santa Cruz stretching from south of the San Andreas/Larkin Valley Road interchange to north of the Morrissey Boulevard interchange. Petitioner alleges CalTrans violated the California Environmental Quality Act, including by its failure to provide an accurate and stable project description; evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project; disclose, evaluate, or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project; recirculate the EIR after addition of significant new information; and to adequately respond to comments submitted by Petitioner and others..
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act

Very truly yours, WITTWER PARKIN LLP
