PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2

3 1. This action involves the County of Placer's approval of the Placer County
4 Government Center (PCGC) Master Plan Update Project (the "Project"). The PCGC Master
5 Plan Update provides for significant land use and development changes at the National Register-
6 listed De Witt Hospital Historic District.

2. Petitioner Concerned Citizens for Community and Public Lands object to the
8 approval of this Project because it allows for the demolition of numerous historic buildings that

9 are contributors to the historic district. The Project also eliminates public-serving recreational
10 uses of buildings on the Project site that had existed for many years.

11 3. Further, the Project provides only : minimal amount of desperately needed
12 affordable housing. Petitioner is supportive of the multifamily residential component of the
13 Project, which includes affordable housing units and was analyzed at a project-level in the
14 environmental impact report (EIR). Petitioner does not seek to overturn the approval of this
15 affordable housing component or any of the funding approvals required for it.

16 4. The EIR prepared for the Project failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the
17 significant impacts the PCGC Master Plan Update would have due to the demolition of the 70
18 percent of the De Witt Hospital Historic District. Many of the resources planned for demolition,
19 such as the De Witt Theater, the De Witt Gym and Pool, and the Senior Center, have been sought
20 for adaptive reuse by public interest tenants. Instead, the County has sought to demolish these
21 resources to make way for commercial and office uses that a market study demonstrated are not
22 needed.

23 5. This violates the California Environmental Quality Act's (CEQA) requirements to
24 adequately disclose all potential impacts associated with a project. It also violates CEQA's
25 prohibition on approval of project's where there are feasible alternatives and mitigation
26 measures that would lessen the project's significant impacts and the requirement that any
27 claimed overriding benefit of a project be supported by substantial evidence.

28 6. The EIR's analysis of land use impacts is also inadequate because it fails to

Printed on Recycled Paper 02 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

disclose the Project's inconsistencies with general plan and community plan policies that require
2 preservation of historic resources.
7. The recreational impacts of the Project's elimination of existing recreational uses
is also not disclosed in the EIR for the PCGC Master Plan Update.
5 8. Further, the PCGC Master Plan Update proposes the private lease of large portion
6 of these County-owned lands without offering the land for affordable housing or recreational
uses, in violation of the Surplus Land Act.
8

JURISDICTION

10 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 and 1094.5 of
11 the Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"), and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources
12 Code.

13 PARTIES

14 10. Petitioner Concerned Citizens for Community and Public Lands is a citizen action
15 group that recently formed after the Board of Supervisor's approval of the PCGC Master Plan
16 Update. The purpose of Concerned Citizens for Community and Public Lands is to guard
17 against the improper treatment, use or disposition of community and public lands, especially
18 those containing cultural, recreational and/or community resources.
19 11. Respondent COUNTY OF PLACER ("County") is a political subdivision of the
20 State of California.

21 12. Real Parties in Interest named as Does 1 to 10 are given fictitious names because
22 their names and capacities are presently unknown to Petitioner.
23 STATEMENT OF FACTS
24 Project Site
25 13. The Project site for the Placer County Government Center (PCGC) Master Plan
26 Update Project is a 200-acre site located in Placer County, north of the City of Auburn and
27 within the census designated area of North Auburn. The Project site is located west of State
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 03 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Route 49, between Bell and Atwood Roads.

2 14. The Project site is surrounded by commercial and residential development.
3 Adjacent parcels to the north support commercial and office uses, including some medical
4 offices. The Timberline at Auburn Project, a 119-acre continuing care facility located north of
5 Bell Road at Richardson Drive, is currently under construction and is planned to eventually
6 accommodate 858 residential units. To the west, northwest, and southwest are suburban
7 residential and limited agriculture land uses, a self-storage business, a church, and a senior
8 assisted living facility. Southeast and south of the PCGC site are suburban-density single-family

9 residences. Commercial/light industrial development lies to the east and northeast. A Home
10 Depot store is located on the eastern side of the PCGC site, and additional commercial
11 development is present along State Route 49.

12 15. The Project site is located within the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan planning
13 area. Community Plan land use designations for the Project site include Mixed-Use and Open
14 Space. The Project site includes the following zoning designations: Office Professional;
15 Commercial Planned Development; Heavy Commercial; Medium Density Residential; and
16|| Open Space. There is also a Design Scenic Corridor zoning overlay for the site, which requires
17| projects to obtain design review approval before building permits can be issued.

18

19 History of DeWitt Center and Planning Background
20 16. In 1943, the Project site was acquired by the United States War Department and
21 developed as the De Witt General Hospital for World War II battle casualties. The hospital
22 complex contained approximately 220 acres and was comprised of permanently designed
23 buildings, including clinics, patient wards, officers' quarters, a theater, chapel, auditorium and
24 gymnasium with an oversized swimming pool.
25 17. In December 1945, the hospital was deactivated and closed as a U.S. Army
26 installation.

27 18. The State of California acquired De Witt General Hospital in 1946 and began using

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 04 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the site as a California state mental hospital. The De Witt State Hospital provided care for
2 thousands of mental-health patients until the state closed the hospital and transferred the land to
3 the County of Placer in 1972.
19. After the De Witt State Hospital was closed, Placer County transformed the site
5 into a government center for the County and also rented a substantial portion of the unused
6 buildings to businesses, churches, schools, numerous non-profits, and had six apartment
7 buildings with 92 affordable residential units. During this period, the site, commonly referred to
8 as the De Witt Center, functioned as an integrated community.
20. Although many of the original buildings from the De Witt General Hospital remain
10| on site, building demolition and construction has occurred on the Project site over the last 30
11 years, beginning with the construction of the Finance and Administration Building in the late
12 1980s. The Auburn Main Jail and Juvenile Detention Center were constructed in the early and
13 mid-1990s.

14 21. The 1993 Placer County Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan provided an
15 analysis of County general governmental, court, and health and human services spatial needs
16| through the year 2011. The 1993 plan documented how much space each department would
space needs were to be located, cost and phasing. 17 need, where

18 22. In 2004, the Board of Supervisors certified the 2003 EIR for the De Witt
19 Government Center Facility Plan (2003-2010), which provided for the construction of two
20| government buildings at the De Witt Center--a children's emergency shelter and a women's
21 shelter. The approval also allowed for the demolition of 24 specific buildings located within the
22 footprint of the new developments. The 2003 EIR determined the demolition of these 24
23 buildings would be a significant and unavoidable impact to the identified De Witt General
24 Hospital Historic District, which had been identified as potentially eligible for listing on the
25| National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historic Places. It overrode
26 the impacts of the demolition of those specific 24 buildings based upon the benefits that would
27 be provided by the children's emergency shelter and the women's shelter.
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 05 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

*

23. In April 2006, the Planning Commission approved a Home Depot store located on
2 the eastern edge of the De Witt Center as a standalone project based upon a project-specific EIR.
3 Demolition of the De Witt Hospital reservoir and the fresh water treatment facility were required
4 to make way for the Home Depot project.
24. At this time, the County continued to lease several of the De Witt Center buildings
6 to various private and nonprofit entities, many of which provided public benefits such as the
DeWitt Senior Center, a day care center, nonprofit Seniors First offices, Placer Union High
8 School District transition to adult and adult school classrooms, a public gym and pool facility in
9 the DeWitt Gym, a church, wholesale bakery, food closet, and a music and performing arts
10 center in the De Witt Theater.

11 25. Around 2006, the County started changing the terms in its tenant lease agreements.
12 Some ten-year leases were reduced to three-year leases and some tenants were placed on a
13| monthly lease. Although the majority of tenants wanted to stay at the DeWitt Center, the new
14 short-term leases made it difficult to plan for the future. A few tenants left with the initial lease
15 changes, and most tenants stopped making major building improvements over the upcoming
16| years. The County did not state a basis for reducing the length of the lease terms and when a
17 tenant left, the tenant space remained unused. As of 2006-2007, there were approximately 37
18 non-County tenants remaining at the De Witt Center.

19 26. Despite the fact there is a severe shortage of affordable housing in Placer County,
20 the County removed the 92 affordable units that had been located in the DeWitt Center.
21 27. Between 2010 and 2014, the County began a series of building demolitions that
22 included numerous buildings that were not identified for removal in the 2003 EIR. Despite
23 claims to the contrary by the County, the significant historic impacts from the demolition of
24 these resources had not been overridden by the 2004 approval of the De Witt Government Center
25 Facility Plan.

26 28. On or about March 22 and July 25, 2011, the Board of Supervisors held the first
27 meeting to update the Placer County Comprehensive Facilities Master Plan Update since the

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 06 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

previous 1993 plan was out of date. The general emphasis at these meetings was data collection
2 that would be used as the basis for the plan update, which was expected to take approximately
3 two years. The July hearing was held in Squaw Valley and the focus was on the De Witt Center.
4 At this meeting, County staff indicated that the De Witt Center may contain surplus land. This
5 was the last hearing on the Master Plan Update until 2015.
6 29. Separate from the PCGC Master Plan Update, the County began negotiating a
7 lease for a Costco on a portion of the DeWitt Center in 2011. The County claimed that the yet-
8 to-be-approved PCGC Master Plan Update "determined" there was sufficient surplus land
9 available to accommodate Costco.

10 30. Prior to approving the Costco project, tenants within the Costco footprint were
11 issued letters informing them of the Costco project and that leases would likely not be renewed
12 beyond late 2014/early 2015. Some of these tenants included: a music/performing arts nonprofit
13| in the De Witt Theater, an athletic center in the De Witt Gym and Pool, the Senior Center,
14 Seniors First nonprofit, a day care center, a wholesale bakery, Placer Union High School
15 District, Placer Adult School, and warehousing for numerous nonprofits.
16 31. In March of 2014, the County approved lease terms for the Costco project and
17 executed a development agreement without preparing environmental review for the project.
18 32. The public commented on the impacts of this Costco project on the historic
19 DeWitt Theater. A "Preserve DeWitt Theater" group formed and ultimately collected nearly
20 2,000 signatures to save the theater.

21 33. The County hired an architectural firm to evaluate the De Witt Theater, which
22 found the theater to be in generally good condition, but that upgrades were required to meet
23 code requirements. The theater group requested a six-month lease extension to address the new
24 costs to upgrade the De Witt Theater. However, the County Supervisors expressed concerns that
25 the theater may be incompatible with Costco's operations. Based on these concerns, which were
26 not assessed in an environmental review document, the County ceased negotiations with the
27 theater group.

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 07 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. To accommodate Costco, the County established June 30, 2015 as the last date of
2 occupancy for tenants located within the Costco footprint and executed the option to ground
3 lease with Costco. Litigation was subsequently filed objecting to the approval of the lease with
Costco prior to the completion of environmental review, and Costco subsequently withdrew its
5 project.
35. Operators of the De Witt Theater and De Witt Gym and Pool, all located in historic
resources not designated for demolition in the 2003 EIR, continued requesting lease extensions
8 after Costco withdrew its project, but the County refused to agree to extensions. While the
County made vague claims that the historic buildings required substantial repairs, members of
10 Petitioner were unable to find any documentation that these buildings were in a state of
11 disrepair.
12 36. The Senior Center was also required to relocate to accommodate the proposed
13 Costco development. While Costco was initially required to provide funding for the relocation,
14 when the project was withdrawn, the County then provided funding for the relocation. The
15 relocated Senior Center has experienced a reduction in membership because it is now located
16 further from the seniors that had used the center when it was located in the De Witt Center. The
17 Senior Center has also experienced financial difficulties since the relocation.
18 37. Members of Petitioner and others in the public submitted numerous comments and
19 made verbal comments at County meetings objecting to the County's eviction of these public-
20 serving tenants in the De Witt Center.
21 38. The State Office of Historic Preservation submitted a letter to the County
22 regarding the PCGC Master Plan Update and cited numerous CEQA violations concerning the
23 demolition of historic structures.

24 39. Because the County continued to allow demolition of historic De Witt Center
25 buildings without required environmental review, members of Petitioner submitted a nomination
26 for the De Witt Center for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The DeWitt
27 General Hospital is significant under National Register Criteria A, B and C in the areas of

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 08 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

health/medicine, art and architecture. It is an example of the large-scale planning and
2 construction that was required during World War II to meet national defense needs for the
3 medical treatment of wounded American soldiers. DeWitt Hospital was one of three designated
Army vascular centers in the United States and is associated with Dr. Norman Freeman who
5 pioneered important vascular surgery techniques while at De Witt. While operating as a mental,
6 hospital, De Witt was associated with psychologist Tarmo Pasto, whose research influenced the
7 development of art therapy, and with internationally recognized outsider artist, Martin Ramirez
8 who created his most notable works while in residence at De Witt. Thus, the De Witt Hospital is
9 also included under the cover of the Latinos in 20th Century California Multiple Properties
10 Submission, under the associated contexts Latinos in the Arts, as an example of the Residences
11 and Studios of Prominent Persons property type.
12 40. The State Historical Resources Commission voted unanimously to place the
13 De Witt General Hospital Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. Under
14 CEQA, it is mandatory that the County consider resources listed on the National Register as
15 significant historic resources. The Auburn Journal reported that the County paid over $100,000
16 to fight the nomination. After the De Witt General Hospital Historic District was listed on the
17 National Register, the County was required to acknowledge the historic significance of these
18 resources and update County videos to remove references claiming that the De Witt buildings are
19 not historic.

20 41. In 2015, the County restarted the PCGC Master Plan Update process.
21

22 Project Description

23 42. The PCGC Master Plan Update Project is an update to the previous plans for the
24 Project site and for Placer County government facilities. The Plan Update was intended to
25 provide for efficient delivery of Placer County government services. It also includes a mix of a
26 private land uses including retail, multifamily housing, office and mixed-use development.
27 43. The identified objectives for the Project include: consolidating government
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 09 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

departments; accommodating future government facilities needs; providing office space to
2 support functionality, productivity and collaboration; creating a vibrant mixed-use community
3 and campus; promoting sustainable energy and water efficient design; determining infrastructure

4 needs and upgrades; formulating site and building design criteria; defining a central green and
5 non-motorized connectivity throughout the site; and identifying opportunities for development
6 to maximize the value of the site.

44. The PCGC Master Plan Update provided a general layout for uses on the Project

8 and also included detailed information for two individual development projects allowed under

9 the Plan Update. The PCGC Master Plan Update defined potential anticipated uses for the

10 PCGC site, anticipating retention of approximately 650,000 square feet of existing building

11 space, as well as construction of approximately 410,000 square feet of new County facilities,
30,000 square feet of community uses, and approximately 510,000 square feet of new mixed-
12 use, including commercial and residential elements. The two individual development projects
13 identified in the Plan Update are a new Health and Human Services building and a multifamily
14 residential community to be located on the east side of 1st Street near B Avenue.

15 45. The PCGC Master Plan Update Project required General Plan, Community Plan,

16 and zoning ordinance amendments. These amendments provide for a maximum allowable

17 residential density of 30 dwelling units per acre.
46.
18 The PCGC Master Plan Update Project allows for the demolition of 35
contributing buildings to the National Register De Witt General Hospital Historic District,
19 including the auditorium, De Witt Theater, patient wards, and De Witt Gym and Pool. The plan
20 identifies retaining only 15 historic buildings, to include the chapel and four adjoining patient
21 wards in the northeast portion of the existing historic district, and 10 warehouse and utility yard
22 buildings in the southwest portion that are currently used for County operations.

23 47. The PCGC Master Plan Update does not specify when building demolitions may

24 occur for these historic structures, nor does it require a proposal for a replacement development

25 project prior to demolition.

26

27 Approval of the Project

48.
28 An initial study was not prepared for the Project. A formal Notice of Preparation

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of an EIR was issued on September 7, 2017.
49. A public scoping session was held by the County on September 18, 2017. The

3 County received 22 scoping comment letters from agencies and the public. Most public
4 comments focusd on the need to provide affordable housing and to retain historic structures.

5 50. Public workshops regarding the PCGC Master Plan Update were held in March
6 and August 2016, and January 2017. Many participant comments were in favor of providing
7 affordable housing, adaptive reuse of historic buildings, creating a destination for the arts and
8 outdoor parks, and eco-friendly walkable design. Participants also commented that they were
not in favor of additional retail, especially not "big box" stores, and more interested in keeping a
10 rural rather than urban character. Participants raised concerns over potential commercial
11 development, including compliance with the Surplus Land Act, increased traffic impacts and
12 preference for limited commercial development.

13 51. Recognizing that the relocated Senior Center was not providing benefits to enough
14 seniors, the County began discussing the potential for developing a multi-generational
15 recreational facility, which would benefit County residents of all ages. During this same time in
16 which public workshops on the PCGC Master Plan Update were held, the County also held
17 several public meetings to gather input on the development of a multi-generational recreation
18 facility for the North Auburn area. Consensus of public input was that the De Witt Center was
19 the most preferred location for the recreation center and many comments addressed how the
20 multi-generational recreational facility could be accommodated by the adaptive reuse of existing
21 buildings at the De Witt Center, such as the De Witt Theater and De Witt Gym and Pool.
22 52. In 2016, after Costco withdrew its application, the Auburn Recreation District
23 submitted a letter to the Board of Supervisors expressing interest in utilizing the De Witt Theater,
24 Senior Center, and De Witt Gym and Pool for public recreation. The County was not interested
25 in pursuing the request.

26 53. After receiving the request from the Auburn Recreation District, and after the
27 lease for the De Witt Gym and Pool had been ended, the County started placing earthen fill
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

material into the pool. A member of Petitioner noticed this activity in June of 2016 and
2 contacted the County about the possible destruction of a historic resource. The County
3 responded that the placement of fill did a not result in a permanent change to the pool and could
4 be removed in the future.

5 54. The EIR prepared for the PCGC Master Plan Update is a program EIR for the
6 Master Plan and a project EIR for the proposed multi-family development and the 135,700
7 square foot Health and Human Services Building.

8 55. The draft EIR was released on November 19, 2018, a comment period spanning
9 over three holidays, and ended on January 2, 2019. Several community members submitted
10 comments requesting an extension of the comment period or noting the difficulty in reviewing
11| the EIR during the comment period due to the holidays. The County did not extend the
12 comment period.

13 56. The draft EIR included three project alternatives:
14 Alternative 1: No Project/No Build Alternative. This alternative assumes no

15 development would occur, and the site would remain in its current condition.

16 Alternative 2: Greater Historic District Retention through Increased Residential

17 Intensity Alternative. This alternative seeks to reduce impacts to the De Witt

18 General Hospital Historic District by retaining more of the existing buildings,

19 which is accomplished by increasing the intensity of the proposed residential land
20 uses. In addition, this alternative increases the total number of dwelling units by
21 214 units compared to the proposed project.

22 Alternative 3: Greater Historic District Retention through Increased Non-

23 Residential Intensity Alternative. This alternative seeks to reduce impacts to the

24 DeWitt General Hospital Historic District by retaining more of the existing
25 buildings, which is accomplished by increasing the intensity of the new non-
26 residential uses within the project site.
27 57. The EIR failed to acknowledge or provide mitigation for the recreational amenities

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

existing at the De Witt Center including the DeWitt Theater, Senior Center, and DeWitt Gym
2 and Pool, which were in operation prior to the County's termination of leases.
3 58. While the EIR acknowledged the Project site contains a historic district and
demolition of any contributing buildings would result in a significant adverse impact, the
5 County allowed removal of interior features of several historic buildings prior to approval of this
6 Project without any mitigation.
59. The Planning Commission held a public hearing on December 28, 2018 to receive
8 comments. Comments were provided requesting that the EIR be recirculated due to: insufficient
9 project-level analysis; impacts of affordable housing had been identified as significant and
10 unavoidable based on the 1994 Auburn/Bowman Community Plan EIR; discrepancy between
11 the project description in the Notice of Preparation and the EIR; and incomplete project
12| description in the EIR.

13 60. The Final EIR was released on February 25, 2019.
14 61. In late February 2019, the County started preparing a Request for Qualifications
15 (RFQ) to find a developer for the public portion of the PCGC and developer for the
16 public/private partnership for the remainder of the center. The RFQ does not identify that the
17 Project site is on the National Register for Historic Places nor does it solicit firms with
18 experience in adaptive reuse of historic resources. The period to submit proposals was April
19| to April 30, 2019. The proposals received were not disclosed to the public prior to the approval
20| of the Project.

21 62. The public notice for the Planning Commission hearing was not released until two
22 days before the hearing. Members of Petitioner submitted a written objection about the short
23 time frame provided to the public and that the County should have provided at least a 72-hour
24 notice as required by state law. At the March 14, 2019 Planning Commission hearing,
25 additional objections were made about the lack of proper legal noticing.
26 63. The Planning Commission held a hearing on March 14, 2019 to consider the
27 PCGC Maser Plan Update. The public provided testimony to require more affordable housing
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

*

and to preserve additional historic structures, in particular the De Wittt Theater. The Planning
2 Commission closed the public hearing and made a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors
3| to certify the EIR, amend the Placer County General Plan to establish a Master Plan land use
designation, amend the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan to replace and supersede all reference
to the DeWitt Center with PCGC Master Plan Update, approve the PCGC Master Plan Update,
approve the Master Plan Update Design Guidelines, approve the rezoning, approve the text
amendments within Placer County Code Section 17.52.135 Town Center Commercial, and
8 approve the PCGC Master Plan Update Development Standards.
64. Members of Petitioner met with Supervisor Weygandt's aide on April 8, 2019 to
10 request that language be added to the Project approval so that adaptive reuse would be
11 encouraged in the private development mixed use areas and to save the historic De Witt Theater
12 and some adjoining patient wards, auditorium, and the De Witt Gym and Pool.
13 65. The Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on April 9, 2019 to consider the
14 recommendation from the Planning Commission and after holding a public hearing, continued
15 the item to the April 23, 2019 Board of Supervisors meeting.

16 66. Members of Petitioner met with Supervisor Holmes and his aide on April 18, 2019
17 and requested that the Project approval be revised to reflect that historic buildings could be
18 repurposed rather than demolished and to request a two-year moratorium on building demolition
19 of the theater area to allow time to find a nonprofit organization interested in restoring the
20 De Witt Theater and to fundraise. Members of Petitioner also noted that it would be difficult to
21 get a nonprofit involved with no guarantee that the theater would not be demolished in the near
22 future.

23 67. At the April 23, 2019 hearing, held in Kings Beach approximately 80 miles (a
24 three-hour roundtrip) from Auburn, the Board of Supervisors discussed the preservation of the
25 De Witt Theater after the closure of the public hearing.

26 68. Supervisor Gore made a motion recommending that the citizen group interested in
27 saving the De Witt Theater be given a two-year opportunity to raise funds and plan for the

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

restoration and operation of the theate Supervisors Weygandt and Holmes concurred with the
2 recommendation. Supervisor Holmes also stated that he had met with members of Petitioner
3 and noted that they requested that the language in the EIR be slightly modified to clearly state
that historic buildings identified for demolition in the mixed-use area "could", rather than

5 "would", be demolished.

69. County counsel stated that the requested change to the EIR would require
recirculation and did not advise that action. Counsel advised that the development standards for
8 the Project could be modified and would not require recirculation. Counsel presented the Board
with three options: 1) approve the Master Plan Update and all associated approvals as
10 recommended by the Planning Commission; 2) approve the Master Plan Update, Final EIR and
11 all other requested actions, except the development standard, with language allowing for the
12 retention of the theater in the development standards to be drafted and brought back to the Board
13 for consideration in the near future; or 3) the Board could take action on any proposed changes
14| to the development standards at the current hearing. Counsel then read a draft provision to
15 amend the development standards.

16 70. The Board Chairman opened the proposed change to the development standards
17 up to public comment. Members of Petitioner were not able to attend the hearing due its
18 location in Kings Beach and thus no comments were received.

19 71. After the comment period closed, the Board of Supervisors approved all requested
20 actions, expect the development standards. Supervisor Gore made a motion revise the
21 development standards with the provision drafted by Counsel. This motion passed with three yes
22 votes, one no vote and one abstention.

23 72. The County made the following approvals based on the EIR for the Project, as
24 well as the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and a Statement of Overriding a
25 Considerations:

26 Amended the Placer County General Plan to reference and recognize the PCGC
27 Master Plan Update;

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Amended the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan to replace and supersede all
references to the Dewitt Center with the Placer County Government Center Master
Plan Update and to re-designate lands for the PCGC campus;
Approved the PCGC Master Plan Update;
Approved the PCGC Master Plan Update Design Guidelines;
Rezoned portions of the PCGC campus;
Amended Placer County Code Section 17.52.135 Town Center Commercial to
allow modified development standards;
Approved the PCGC Master Plan Update Development Standards.
10

11 73. After the close of the public hearing, Supervisor Gore made a suggestion that the
12 "Save DeWitt Theater" group should work with a nonprofit to save the De Witt Theater.
13 74. On April 26, 2019, the Placer County newsletter stated the following on the
14 approval of the PCGC Master Plan: "The approval on Tuesday included a provision that could
15 allow community members up to two years to organize funding to rehabilitate the campus's
16 De Witt Theater."

17 75. Members of Petitioner requested the specific language of the revision relating to
18 the De Witt Theater as soon as the Project was approved. On May 2, 2019, members of the
19 Petitioner received the wording from Supervisor Gore's aide on the specific motion relating to
20 the opportunity for preservation of the De Witt Theater: "Projects within the mixed use
21 designation that identify the removal of the theater shall be subject to a public hearing before
22 the Board of Supervisors. This provision shall sunset on July 1, 2021." This requirement for a
23| public hearing does not include a moratorium on demolition.
24 76. A Notice of Determination was filed on April 24, 2019
25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
26 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

27
77.
28 Members of Petitioner Concerned Citizens for Community and Public Lands

Printed on Recycled Paper 16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

objected to the Project in the administrative process, and fully exhausted their administrative
2 remedies.

3 78. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
4 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate. In the absence of such remedies, the
5 County's approval of the Project will form the basis for a project that will proceed in violation
6 of state law.

79. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
8 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
9 Exhibit A.

10 80. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
11| providing the County with notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is
12 attached as Exhibit B.

13 81. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
14| attached as Exhibit C.

15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CEQA)
17 82. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
18

19

20 Improper Rejection of Feasible Alternatives and Mitigation Measures
83.
21 CEQA mandates that, pursuant to the policy stated in Public Resources Code

22. sections 21002 and 21002.1, no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an

23 environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant effects

24 on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out unless both of the

25 following occur:

26 (1) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations . . .

27 make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental

28 impact report; and

Printed on Recycled Paper 17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(2) With respect to significant effects, the public agency finds that specific

2 overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project
3 outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
4 84. The County must make both of these findings--that less impactful alternatives are
5 infeasible and that project benefits override the significant impacts--and support those findings
6 with substantial evidence.

85. The County failed to make the required finding that Alternatives 2 and 3, both of
8 which would substantially lessen the significant adverse impacts to historic resources, are
9| infeasible. The County also lacks substantial evidence to support such a finding.
10 86. The EIR found that both of these alternatives would substantially lessen the
11 Project's impacts on the historic district. It also found these alternatives would not result in any
12 new significant adverse impacts.

13 87. Neither the EIR nor documents on record for the PCGC Master Plan Update
14 provide any evidence regarding the economic infeasibility of project alternatives 2 and 3, which
15 would also meet the project objectives of ensuring that the government center campus provides
16 efficient delivery of government services as well as a mix of private land uses including retail, a
17 multifamily housing, office and mixed use development.

18 88. Mitigation measures and alternatives identified in the environmental review
19 process were also improperly rejected. Many comments were made regarding the importance of
20 preserving the historic De Witt Theater. The County failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures
21 that would have provided an opportunity for preservation of the theater and other historic
22 structures.

23 89. Development of the multi-generational center at the De Witt Center, with the
24 adaptive reuse of several historic buildings was also proposed as a feasible alternative that was a
25 improperly rejected.

26 90. Further, the Auburn Recreation District sought to adaptively reuse several of the
27| historic buildings on the Project site for public recreational purposes, but the County improperly

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

rejected this feasible alternative/mitigation measure that would have addressed both impacts to
2 historic resources and the loss of recreational facilities.

4 Failure to Support Statement of Overriding Benefits
91. CEQA Guidelines section 15093, subdivision (b) states that when a lead agency a
6 approves a project that would result in significant, unavoidable impacts that are disclosed in the
7 final EIR, the agency must state in writing its reasons for supporting the approved action. The
8| benefits identified in the Statements of Overriding Considerations must be supported by
9 substantial evidence in the record.

10 92. The Project benefits claimed by the Statement of Overriding Consideration are
11 also not supported by substantial evidence. There is no substantial evidence to support the
12| findings claim that the Project would provide the following benefits or that less impactful
13 alternatives could not provide similar benefits: create opportunities for increased economic
14 activity and multifamily housing; enable the County to maximize the value of the PCGC
15| property through land leases and other agreements that accommodate private development;
16 provide for improved environments for County staff and the public visiting County offices and
17 facilities; provide environmental benefits by prioritizing sustainable design, energy efficiency
18 and water conservation; provide a plan to upgrade infrastructure and utilities; and ensure that the
19 PCGC property provides healthy, safe, productive and comfortable indoor and outdoor
20 environments for County employees, private development employees, residents and visitors to
21 the site through the Project's Development Standards and Design Guidelines.
22 93. The claim that the Project would provide increased economic activity is not
23| supported by the Market Study prepared for the Project, which finds that the Auburn retail
24 market is well served and that retail rents "have not shown strong growth in recent years, raising
25 concerns about the overall financial feasibility of this land use, especially provided the high cost
26| of new construction". The Market Study also found that while limited types of new office
27 development opportunities exist, "stagnant rent growth coupled with high construction costs

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 19 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.

remain the largest barrier to project feasibility." Residential development is also identified as
marginally feasible and the Market Study recommended increasing density (which is included in
3 Alternative 2) negotiating land lease rates, and lowering impact fees to make residential land use
4 more attractive to developers.
94. The EIR identifies the demolition of several historic buildings for which no
6 replacement buildings have been identified. The claimed overriding benefits justifying the
demolition of these historic resources cannot be substantiated when replacement buildings are
8 not and need not be identified before demolition. No overriding benefit can be shown for

9

10 demolition of historic resources when replacement buildings are not identified.

11 Improper Manipulation of Project Baseline

12 95. The EIR's identifies the historic De Witt Theater and De Witt Gym and Pool as
13| being vacant, but these contributors to the National Register Historic District were only vacant
14 because the County unilaterally chose to end long-term leases of the properties. Leases were
15 severed in anticipation of the Costco project. After Costco withdrew, leases requested
16 extensions to their leases, which were not granted, presumably in anticipation of this Project.
17 96. There was no replacement project proposed for these sites at the time the leases
18 ended. The lessees wanted to continue their leases and continue to utilize these resources for
19| public uses--a theater company and a recreational facility.
20 97. The County's action of ending these leases improperly manipulates the baseline
21 for environmental review of this Project. By eliminating long-term tenants and requiring them
22 to find lease space elsewhere, the County essentially precommitted to the demolition of these
23 historic resources prior to the completion of environmental review.
24 98. The EIR's reliance on the theater, senior center, gym and pool as being vacant
25 fails to recognize the recreational impacts of the Project. But for the County's decision to
26 prematurely end the leases for these buildings, recreational uses would still be in use. The
27 Project's elimination of recreational opportunities for the public was required to be analyzed and

28

Printed on Recycled Paper 20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

mitigated in the EIR.

2 99. Additionally, that these buildings are currently vacant, solely by choice of the
3 County, should not be used as a factor in any assessment of the feasibility, economic or
4 otherwise, of alternatives and mitigation measures for significant adverse impacts to historic
5 resources.

Inadequate Analysis of Cultural Resource Impacts
100. The EIR failed to identify the impact of demolishing historic resources
without replacement structures.
10 •101. The Final EIR failed to address a comment that identified that the project
11 description did not specify as to when demolition would occur and noted the demolition of
12 historic resources before a replacement structure has been planned and approved would violate
13 CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21084.1. The Final EIR did not acknowledge Public
14 Resources Code 21084.1 and only stated demolition would "generally" occur in association with
15 individually approved development projects undertaken with implementation of the PCGC
16 Master Plan Update.
17 102. The EIR also failed to address the impacts of compatibility of new
18 development with the historic resources that would be preserved. The proposed Events Center
19 is located adjacent to the planned De Witt Heritage Area, but there is no analysis of the
20 compatibility of this Events Center with the remaining historic district area.

21 103. The compatibility of new development will not be analyzed in a future
22 public process as the EIR and County approval of the Project require only design review for
23 future development at the site. Design review is completed by Planning staff and the County
24 Code has identified design review as categorically exempt from CEQA review. Thus, the
25 compatibility of new development will not be analyzed in future environmental review.

26 104. Moreover, the design guidelines and development standards approved with the
27| Project only apply to new development projects; they do not address adaptive reuse of existing
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

historic resources within the Project site, with the exception of the small De Witt Heritage Area.

3 Inadequate Analysis of Land Use Impacts
105. An EIR must disclose any inconsistencies between a project and the applicable
5 land use plans. The draft EIR acknowledged that several Placer County General Plan policies
6 seek to protect and preserve historic resources, including:
The County shall require that discretionary development projects identify and

8 protect from damage, destruction, and abuse, important historical, archaeological,
paleontological, and cultural sites and their contributing environment. Such
10 assessments shall be incorporated into a Countywide cultural resource data base,
11 to be maintained by the Division of Museums. [Policy 5.D.6]
12 The County shall require that discretionary development projects are designed to
13 avoid potential impacts to significant paleontological or cultural resources
14 whenever possible. Unavoidable impacts, whenever possible, shall be reduced to a

15 less than significant level and/or shall be mitigated by extracting maximum
16 recoverable data. Determinations of impacts, significance, and mitigation shall be
17 made by qualified archaeological (in consultation with recognized local Native
18 American groups), historical, or paleontological consultants, depending on the
19 type of resource in question. [Policy 5.D.7]
20 The County shall support the registration of cultural resources in appropriate

21 landmark designations (i.e., National Register of Historic Places, California

22 Historical Landmarks, Points of Historical Interest, or Local Landmark). [Policy

23 5.D.11]

24 106. The EIR failed to discuss the Project's inconsistencies with these General Plan
25 policies due to the demolition of 35 historic resources that could be avoided.

26 107. Comments were submitted on the EIR's failure to disclose and discuss these
27 inconsistencies, but the response to comments failed to address these comments in violation of
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

CEQA.

2 108. The County has claimed that the Project is consistent with the Auburn/Bowman
3 Community Plan because the Project would preserve 15 historic buildings. This fails to
recognize the inconsistency with the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan resulting from the
5 demolition of 35 historic resources.

109. The EIR also cites to a statement in the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan
regarding the removal of the barracks buildings at the De Witt Center. The plan was prepared in
8 the 1990s, prior to the listing of these resources on the National Register. Additionally, this
statement does not address the Project's demolition of many non-barracks historic resources (i.e.
10 the De Witt Theater, auditorium, Gym and Pool Building).
110. The Cultural Resources Element of the Auburn/Bowman Community Plan is also
12 clear in requiring the preservation of historic sites as made evident by the following stated goals
13 and policies:

14 Preserve and enhance significant historical, cultural, and/or archaeologic sites and

15 the surrounding environment. (Goal a)

16 Cooperate with the City of Auburn in preserving and improving the integrity and

17 environment of the historic buildings, structures, and districts in the plan area.
(Goal b)
18 Encourage the continued provision of a wide variety of cultural activities that
contribute to the appeal of the auburn area. (Goal c)
20 Identify and protect from destruction and abuse all representative and unique
21 historical, cultural, and archaeological sites and their immediate environment.
22 (Policy a)

23 Encourage and promote existing and proposed legislation for the protection of

24 notable pre-historic and historic sites, artifacts, and visual site impact and flora.

25 (Policy b)
Encourage the development of multipurpose facilities which can function as
26 recreational sites, open space areas and for historic, cultural, and archaeological
27 preservation. (Policy c)
28

Printed on Recycled Paper 23 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Require site specific studies for archaeological or historical sites within the federal

2 government's definition of "historical context" in all instances where land

3 development has the potential to have a detrimental impact on these sites. (Policy
d)
Protection of significant cultural resource is a priority over recordation and/or
destruction. (Policy e)
6 111. In direct conflict with these policies, the Project allows demolition of 35
contributing resources to the historic district.
8

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (VIOLATIONS OF SURPLUS LAND ACT)
11 112. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
12 113. Government Code section 54420 subd. (b) provides, "there is an
13 .. identifiable deficiency in the amount of land available for recreational purposes and that surplus
14 land, prior to disposition, should be made available for park and recreation purposes or for open-
15 space purposes."
16 114. To accomplish this, Government Code section 54220 provides:
17

18 (a) A written offer to sell or lease for the purpose of developing low- and
19 moderate-income housing shall be sent to any local public entity, as defined in

20 Section 50079 of the Health and Safety Code, within whose jurisdiction the
surplus land is located. Housing sponsors, as defined by Section 50074 of the
21 Health and Safety Code, shall be sent, upon written request, a written offer to
22 sell or lease surplus land for the purpose of developing low- and moderate-

23 income housing. All notices shall be sent by first-class mail and shall include the location and a description of the property. With respect to any offer to
24 purchase or lease pursuant to this subdivision, priority shall be given to

25 development of the land to provide affordable housing for lower income

26 elderly or disabled persons or households, and other lower income households.

27 (b) A written offer to sell or lease for park and recreational purposes or open-space

28 purposes shall be sent:(1) To any park or recreation department of any city

Printed on Recycled Paper 24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

within which the land may be situated.(2) To any park or recreation department

2 of the county within which the land is situated.(3) To any regional park
authority having jurisdiction within the area in which the land is situated.(4) To
3 the State Resources Agency or any agency that may succeed to its powers.
4

5 115. The County's Placer County Government Center Master Plan Update

6 provides for the leases for and private development of portions of this County-owned site.
116. Prior to approving a Master Plan that allows for disposal of portions of the

8 Project site, the County failed to offer to sell or lease those portions of the site for affordable

9 housing or park and open space uses, and has therefore violated the Surplus Land Act.

10 117. The County also failed to offer to sell or lease portions of the Project site for

11 affordable housing or park and open space uses prior to leasing a portion for the Home Depot

12 project or approving lease terms for a Costco project, demonstrating an ongoing and continuing

13 failure to comply with the Surplus Land Act.

14

15 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

16 In each of the respects enumerated above, the County has violated its duties under law,

17 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters

18 complained of without the support of substantial evidence.

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

20 For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County:

21 A. To set aside and vacate its certification of the Final EIR for the Placer County
22 Government Center Master Plan Update, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, the

23 Statement of Overriding Considerations and its findings adopted in support thereof.

24 B. To set aside and vacate any approvals for the Project, including but not limited to:

25 i. Amendments to the Placer County General Plan to reference and recognize

26 the Placer County Government Center Master Plan Update.
