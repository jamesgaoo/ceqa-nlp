VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F INTRODUCTION

2

3 This petition challenges the City's August 30, 2019 actions related to approval of the
4 Hollywood Gower Project, including approvals of: the Project EIR; the vesting zone

5 change and height district change; the vesting tentative tract map for the merger and

6 resubdivision of the site into five above and/or below grade airspace lots; a
7 conditional use to approve the sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages; a Site Plan

8 Review; and all associated findings and approvals.

9

10 This petition also challenges the City's ongoing practice of ignoring the first goal of
11 the City's 2013 Housing Element by failing to produce "...an adequate supply of
12 ownership and rental housing that is safe, healthy and affordable to people of all
13 income levels, races, ages, and suitable for their various needs.'
14

15 This petition also challenges the City's ongoing practice of knowingly approving
16 environmental assessments which contain incomplete, misleading and incorrect
17 information, thereby allowing projects which result in significant negative impacts to
18 the health, safety and well-being of the people of Los Angeles, and generally
19 degrading the environment across the City as a whole.
20

21 The current Hollywood Gower Project (Project) is the second attempt to build a
22 structure on this parcel. About ten years ago the City granted approvals for applicant
23 6104 Hollywood, LLC to build a 20-story mixed-use development with five levels of
24 parking and 176 residential units. The approvals were met with a court challenge,
25 and the project was struck down by the judge, citing denial of due process. The City
26 had introduced over 200 of pages of "supplemental findings" into the record just
27 before the PLUM Committee meeting where the case was to be heard, offering no
28 opportunity for public review of the documents. In 2012 Judge Ann Jones rejected

- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P the EIR and ordered all approvals vacated.

2

3 In 2016 applicant 6104 Hollywood, LLC returned with a larger version of essentially
4 the same project. While the current approval process does not appear to have been

5 marred by anything as egregious as the last minute introduction of additional

6 documents, there have been unusual and confusing changes to the proposed project
7 and the conditions of approval.

8

9 The Hollywood Gower Project is located at 6100-6116 W. Hollywood Boulevard and
10 1633-1649 N. Gower Street in the Hollywood Community Plan area of the City of
11 Los Angeles. The EIR for the current version states that the Project consists of a
12 single high-rise structure comprised of a four-story podium with an 18-story
13 residential tower located atop the podium, for a total of 22 levels. Two subterranean
14 parking levels would also be provided. The EIR also states that 5% of the housing
15 provided by the project (11 units) will be set aside for Very Low Income (VLI)
16 Households. While the EIR states that the VLI units will be comparable to the
17 market rates units, there is no information given as to whether these would be studio,

18 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom units. The EIR describes two subterranean levels of
19 parking and two more levels of parking above ground.
20

21 Interestingly, in the Determination Letter dated May 16, 2019, under conditions of

22 approval we find that the number of affordable units has been increased:
23

24 A minimum of five percent of the total units shall be reserved as Very Low Income
25 affordable units for households earning no more than 50 percent of the Area Median
26 Income for Very Low Income Restricted Affordable Units, and a minimum of six
27 percent of the total units shall be reserved for Lower Income Households earning no
28 more than 80 percent of the Area Median Income for Lower Income Restricted

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Affordable Units [....] [Emphasis added.]

2

3 However, when the final conditions of approval were posted, on the night of the day
4 preceding the August 30, 2019 City Council meeting, only hours before the meeting
5 began, the conditions had changed again. The requirement for six percent additional
6 affordable units had been dropped, and replaced with the stipulation that the
7 developer contribute $2.75 million to the CD 13 Public Benefits Trust Fund. A

8 review of the CD 13 PBTF records shows no evidence that these funds are used to
9 support affordable housing.
10

11 A minimum of five (5) percent of the total units shall be reserved as Very Low Income
12 affordable units for households earning no more than 50% of the Area Median
13 Income for Very Low Restricted Affordable Units. In addition, the developer will
14 contribute $2.75 million to the Council District #13 Public Benefit Trust Fund
15  payable upon the issuance of a building permit.
16

17 Since the Council took no public comment before approving the project, there was no
18 opportunity to offer comment on this last minute change, in which needed housing
19 was removed to be replaced with a contribution to an account controlled by the
20 Councilmember.

planning and governance in the County of Los Angeles.

2

3 Respondent City of Los Angeles is a California charter city located in the County of
4 Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of the City of

5 Los Angeles.

6

7 Respondent Los Angeles City Council is the elected governing body of the City, and

8 is the body responsible for the decisions at issue in this complaint.

9

10 Petitioner is unaware of the true names of all respondents sued herein as DOES -
11 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents using those fictitious
12 names. Petitioner will amend the petition to allege their true names and to specify the
13 capacities in which they have acted when that information has been verified.
14 Petitioner is informed and believes, and upon that basis alleges, that each of these
15 fictitiously named respondents is to some degree responsible for the unlawful conduct
16 alleged in this petition. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges,
17 that these fictitiously named respondents were the agents/employees/appointees of
18 their co-respondents and were acting with the consent/permission/authority of said
19 co-respondents in committing the unlawful acts described above.
20

21 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 6104 Hollywood,
22 LLC, named as Real Party in Interest, is a Delaware limited liability company, and
23 that 6104 Hollywood, LLC is the beneficiary of all approvals granted by the City for
24 the projects located at 6100-6116 W. Hollywood Boulevard and 1633-1649 N. Gower
25 Street in Los Angeles.

26

27 Petitioner is unaware of the true names of all respondents sued herein as ROES
28 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those respondents using those fictitious

2 capacities in which they have acted when that information has been verified.

3 Petitioner is informed and believes, and upon that basis alleges, that each of these
4 fictitiously named respondents is to some degree responsible for the unlawful conduct

5 alleged in this petition. Petitioner is informed and believes, and upon that basis

6 alleges, that these fictitiously named respondents were the agents/employees of their
7 co-respondents and were acting with the consent/permission/authority of said co-
8 respondents in committing the unlawful acts described above.
9

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11

12 Jurisdiction over Respondents and Real Parties in Interest exists because each of the
13 Respondents and Real Parties named in this litigation are present and operating
14 within the jurisdictional limits of the County of Los Angeles.
15

16 Venue is proper because all of the acts and omissions that are the described in the

17 complaint in this litigation took place within this judicial district.

18

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20

21 Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by offering written and verbal
22 comments during the approval process, and filing timely appeals of both Case No.
23 VTT-74437-2A and related Case No. CPC-2016-2848-VZC-HD-CUB-SPR, which
24 were denied. No further appeals of the project are permitted.

26 BACKGROUND

27

28 Housing Crisis

- 6 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 No one can argue against the need for LA to build housing, but the key question is

3 housing for who? The project as approved is 95% market rate, and 5% affordable. If
4 this project were unique, and the City was producing ample housing for Medium and
5 Low Income households, there would be no need to argue against it. But in fact,
6 according to the 2018 Housing Element Annual Progress Report submitted by the
7 City of Los Angeles to the State of California, within the past five years the City of

8 LA's annual production of Very Low, Low and Middle Income housing COMBINED
has never been more than 12% of the total units permitted and has been as little as 7%
10 of the total units permitted. In other words, from 2014 through 2018 approximately
11 90% of units permitted by the City of LA have been for Above Moderate Income
12 households (120% or more of median income). The City has produced a ridiculous
13 excess number of units for the affluent, while it has failed to produce anywhere near
14 enough housing to serve the households most in need.
15

16 It's also important to note that last year in LA landlords withdrew 1,850 rent-
17 stabilized units from the market. If you take the number of Very Low, Low, and
18 Moderate Income Units permitted in 2018 and subtract the number of RSO units
19 withdrawn that a same year, you get a net loss of 255. While affordable units and RSO
20 | units aren't strictly comparable, the result is pretty clear. In 2018 the City of LA
21 added over 19,000 new units for households making over 120% of the area median
22  income. But households whose income falls below that threshold had 255 fewer units

23 available to them.

24

25 This is just part an egregious and ongoing failure by the City to meet the first goal of
26 its 2013 Housing Element:
27

28 Goal 1: A City where housing production and preservation result in an adequate

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F supply of ownership and rental housing that is safe, healthy and affordable to people
2 of all income levels, races, ages, and suitable for their various needs. [Emphasis

3 added.]
4

5 Unfortunately the City has seemingly forgotten this goal. Instead of actively
6 pursuing strategies to ensure the creation of new housing at all income levels, the
7 City has repeatedly granted generous entitlements to projects like Hollywood Gower

8 that produce high returns for developers but create negligible amounts of housing
9 I accessible to Low and Middle Income Angelenos. According to Rental Burden by
10 Metro, a report published in April 2019 by Freddie Mac, renters in the LA market are
11 the third most rent-burdened in the nation.

12

13 And aside from its failure to produce new housing at all income levels, the City of
14 LA has failed in many other ways to serve its Middle and Low Income households.
15 With the rise of AirBnB and other home-sharing platforms, other cities quickly
16 passed legislation to address the problem of rental housing being converted to short-
17 term rentals (STRs). But the City of LA didn't approve its Home-Sharing Ordinance
18 until December 2018, and as of this writing has yet to implement it. In 2015
19 Controller Ron Galperin pointed out that cities like San Francisco and Portland were
20 collecting tens of millions of dollars in linkage fees to produce affordable housing,

21 but LA didn't pass its own linkage fee ordinance until December 2017. And the City
22 continues to approve the replacement of residential housing with hotel uses.
23 Examples include the approval of a TORS overlay for 50 residential units at 5825
24 Sunset; approval of a TORS permit for 97 residential units at 888 S. Olive; and DCP

25 approval of the demolition of 40 RSO units at 1719 Whitley to make way for a new
26 hotel.

27

28 Will all or a portion of the Hollywood Gower Project's residential units be converted

- 8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to hotel uses? During the approval process, the City claimed that speculation along
2 those lines was groundless. But if we look at the very first item under Conditions of
3 Approval, it says:

4

5 l.

6 The use and development of the 220 multi-family units shall not be permitted

7 to operate as a Transit Occupancy Residential Structure (TORS). To enable the

8 TORS apartment/hotel hybrid use, the applicant is required to request a
9 Conditional Use Permit.

10

11 While the first sentence seems to preclude a change of use under a TORS permit, the
12 second sentence explains that the applicant can enable a TORS apartment/hotel
13 hybrid use by requesting a CUP. This appears to indicate that at least some of the
14 residential units in this project will be converted to hotel rooms.
15

16 The City has approved the Hollywood Gower Project even though it offers a paltry
17 5% affordable units in exchange for entitlements worth many millions. It is widely
18 accepted that LA is experiencing a severe housing crisis, and the presence of over
19 30,000 homeless people within the city's boundaries offers dramatic evidence of the
20 need for housing that serves all income levels. Given the severity of the crisis, the
21 first goal stated in the Housing Element of the City's General Plan should take
22 precedence over all other factors. To grant a Vesting Zone Change and Height
23 District Change for a project that offers only 5% affordable units clearly fails to meet
24 that goal. Also, Sec. 12.32. of the LAMC states that land use legislative actions
25 should only be approved when they conform "with public necessity, convenience,
26 general welfare and good zoning practice." The City's approval of these generous
27 entitlements in exchange for a negligible amount of affordable housing also fails to
28 meet these criteria.

/ 2 Transit Crisis

4 The Hollywood Gower EIR argues that the project is consistent with State and
5 Regional plans to reduce GHG emissions. It cites the Southern California

6 Association of Governments 2016 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable
7 Communities Strategy (SCAG RTP/SCS), and claims that the Project is consistent
8 with the RTP/SCS goals. But this is only true if we look at the issue in the most
9 general way, focussing on general policies regarding land use and ignoring the reality
10 on the ground. The DCP has been arguing for years that approving residential high-
11 rises near transit will increase transit ridership and decrease congestion by
12 encouraging compact neighborhoods. But the reality is actually the complete
13 opposite. In the last decade numerous large residential buildings have been built near
14 transit lines in Downtown, Koreatown, Hollywood and North Hollywood, but transit
15 ridership has declined every year since 2013. Total transit ridership in Los Angeles is
16 lower than it was 30 years ago. Over 2,000 new apartments have been built in
17 Central Hollywood since the year 2000, and yet Metro's data shows that ridership on
18 lines that serve the area, including the 217, 780, 2 and 302, has declined significantly.
19

20 The CEQA Initial Study asks, does the project:
21

22 a.

23 Conflict with an applicable plan, ordinance or policy establishing measures of
24 effectiveness for the performance of the circulation system, taking into account
25 all modes of transportation including mass transit and non-motorized travel
26 and relevant components of the circulation system, including but not limited to
27 intersections, streets, highways and freeways, pedestrian and bicycle paths and
28 mass transit?

- 10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 f.

3 Conflict with adopted policies, plans or programs regarding public transit,

4 bicycle or pedestrian facilities, or otherwise decrease the performance or

5 safety of such facilities?

6

7 The EIR cites the SCAG RTP/SCS and claims consistency with that plan's goals, but
8 the truth of this claim is questionable. In general terms, the project complies with the
9 RTP/SCS policy of encouraging dense residential uses near transit. But the Initial
10 Study's first question asks does the Project "Conflict with an applicable plan,
11 ordinance or policy establishing measures of effectiveness for the performance of the
12 circulation system [...?]"
13

14 The RTP/SCS does not set strictly measurable goals for performance of the
15 circulation system. It was designed to reduce GHG and other harmful emissions.
16 The California Air Resources Board (ARB) does monitor progress in these areas, and
17 the good news is that overall GHG emissions have been declining for years in
18 California. The bad news is that all the gains have come as a result of renewable
19 energy initiatives and increased industrial regulation, while emissions from cars and
20 trucks continue to climb. On page 4 of the 2018 Progress Report from ARB we find
21 this statement:

22

23 "A key finding of this report is that California is not on track to meet the
24 greenhouse gas reductions expected under SB 375 for 2020, with emissions
25 from statewide passenger vehicle travel per capita increasing and going in the
26 wrong direction [...]"
27

28 Traffic in LA is getting worse. It's hard to say how much worse, because the City

- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 does not seem to monitor congestion or report regularly on progress in reducing

2 traffic. On its web site, the LA Department of Transportation (LADOT) offers a link

3 to traffic volume counts, but the most recent data posted is from 2012. The site offers
a link to Navigate LA as a source of information about traffic counts, but all that
appears to be available is information about street designations and rights-of-way.

6

7 Neither does LADOT make data about ridership on its DASH busses readily
8 available. Petitioner made three PRA requests for ridership data on specific DASH

9 lines and after many months is still waiting for a response. Petitioner also requested
10 data on overall DASH ridership and received an incomplete (and seemingly
11 inaccurate) response. Petitioner was finally able to obtain DASH ridership totals
12 from reports issued by the Federal Transportation Administration and found that
13 Annual Unlinked Trips had fallen from 26,619,776 in 2013 to 19,734,177 in 2017, a
14 decline of 25.8%.

15

16 The point being that the City can only claim compliance with the RTP/SCS in that it
17 is approving huge buildings near transit. Among the goals listed in the 2016
18 RTP/SCS are:

19

20

21 Preserve and ensure a sustainable regional transportation system.

22

23 5.

24 Maximize the productivity of our transportation system.

25

26 With both Metro and DASH ridership in steep decline across their service areas, it
27 can hardly be said that the City's current approach to transit-oriented development
28 (TOD) has met those goals. Annual boardings for both systems continue to decline

- 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

as operating costs continue to rise. The evidence shows that approval of numerous
2 projects similar to Hollywood Gower have done nothing to "ensure a sustainable
3 regional transportation system." TOD can be successfully implemented, but it
4 requires careful, holistic planning. The Hollywood Gower Project is typical of the
5 City's current approach, which involves approval of dense residential projects that are

6 mostly unaffordable to LA renters, and justifying the approval by the fact that the
7 project is close to transit. The City has used this strategy to justify numerous large-

8 scale projects in Central Hollywood in recent years, including Columbia Square,
9 Eastown, El Centro, the Jefferson, the Rubix, and the Avenue. The fact that ridership
10 on transit lines serving Hollywood has been declining steadily should show that this
11 strategy has been an abject failure. By omitting any reference to transit ridership data
12 the EIR does not acknowledge this failure, and cannot be said to give an accurate
13 picture of the transit/transportation context. The EIR also offers no evidence to
14 demonstrate that residents of the Hollywood Gower Project will actually utilize local
15 transit options. Therefore it cannot be said that the Project meets RTP/SCS goals 4
16 and 5.

17

18 The RTP/SCS also lists the following among its goals:
19

20 6.

21 Protect the environment and health of our residents by improving air quality
22 and encouraging active transportation (e.g., bicycling and walking).
23

24 Does the Project meet this goal? The EIR acknowledges that the Project's impacts
25 would be cumulatively considerable, and the traffic study singles out three
26 intersections where there would be significant impacts: Argyle Ave/US 101 NB On-
27 Ramp, Gower/Hollywood, and Gower/Sunset. The traffic study also shows a low
28 Level of Service (LOS) traffic at other area intersections: Cahuenga/Hollywood,

- 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Vine/Hollywood, Vine/Sunset, Bronson/Sunset. In short, traffic is bad in Hollywood,
2 and this project will make it worse.

3

4 The primary mitigation measure offered to offset traffic impacts is the

5 implementation of a Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program, but the
6 City has been woefully inconsistent in its implementation of TDMs and there appears
7 to be no ongoing monitoring of these programs. LADOT only refers to two current

8 TDMs on its web site (Century City and Warner Center) and offers scant data
9 regarding their effectiveness. Dozens of approved projects have included a
10| requirement for a TDM to mitigate traffic impacts, but aside from the two mentioned
11 above, there seems to be zero data to show they are working. In February 2018 a
12 motion was introduced to create an ordinance that would update the City's approach
13 to TDM in coordination with the Mobility Plan 2035. The most recent action
14 recorded on that item is in June 2019 when a report from LADOT was received and
15 filed. If the City is seeking to make its TMD policies more robust, the Council is
16 certainly taking its time, and currently there is insufficient data available to show that
17 the TDM for Hollywood Gower will actually mitigate traffic impacts.
18

19 The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) evaluates cancer risk
20 from air pollution in its Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study IV (MATES IV), and
21 Hollywood is near the top of the scale. The EIR acknowledges that the project area is
22 already experiencing significant congestion, and also acknowledges that the project
23 will cause significant impacts in terms of increased trip generation. While the EIR
24 offers the possibility of replacing parking spaces with bike racks to encouraging use
25 of this mode of transit, the EIR offers no data regarding the effectiveness of this
26 strategy, and the City does not appear to have gathered any data on its effectiveness
27 in other projects. Therefore we can only conclude that, as the EIR demonstrates, the
28 Project will contribute to existing traffic problems and further degrade air quality in

- 14 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

T an area that already suffers from significant air pollution.
2

3 For these reasons, it cannot be said that the Project is consistent with Goal 6 of the
4 RTP/SCS, to, "Protect the environment and health of our residents by improving air
5 quality and encouraging active transportation (e.g., bicycling and walking)."
6

7 To sum up, the EIR's analysis of transit/transportation impacts is deficient for the
8 following reasons:

10 The EIR includes no information regarding the significant decline in ridership
11 on Metro and DASH lines that serve the area, and thus does not give the public
12 an opportunity to assess the likelihood that the Project will achieve goals for
13 encouraging transit ridership;

14

15 The City has failed to gather data or in any way to monitor the results of its
16 policies related to transit-oriented development, and offers no evidence to
17 support its claims that the project will promote transit ridership;
18

19 The EIR claims consistency with the SCAG RTP/SCS but fails to meet the
20 plan's stated goals in important areas;
21

22 The EIR offers no evidence to demonstrate that its primary traffic mitigation
23 measure, a Transportation Demand Management Program, will produce results,
24 and the City has failed to gather data and report on the effectiveness of all but
25 two exisitng TDMs.
26

27 Because of these deficiencies, the EIR must be rejected.

r Overburdened Public Services/Police

2

3 The EIR's analysis offered in the section Public Services/Police is grossly inaccurate.
4 An errata was published to correct what was supposedly "a typographical error", but
5 in fact, the crime statistics offered in the EIR do not jibe with reports published by the
6 LAPD for the Hollywood Division. According to the errata, in 2016 the Hollywood
7 Division reported 27 crimes per 1,000 residents compared to 27 crimes per 1,000
8 residents Citywide. This makes it appear that the crime rate in Hollywood is
consistent with the citywide crime rate.
10

11 But the figures cited in the EIR do not accurately reflect crime stats actually
12 published by the LAPD for the year 2016. The EIR states...
13

14 "As shown therein, based on the most recent data made available by the LAPD
15 Community Relationship Division and COMPSTAT for the year 2016,
16 approximately 4,450 crimes were reported within the Hollywood Community
17 Police Station service area and 107,570 crimes were reported citywide."
18

19 The number of crimes cited for the Hollywood area only seems to be an approximate
20 reflection of the number of property crimes committed in Hollywood in 2016, and
21 appears to omit the number of violent crimes. The COMPSTAT report for
22 Hollywood for 2016 shows a total of 5,830 Part I crimes. Also, the Citywide number
23 given in the EIR, 107,570, is far lower than the 125,430 reported in the 2016
24 COMPSTAT report.
25

26 If we calculate using the numbers actually given in LAPD's COMPSTAT reports, we
27 find that the Citywide per capita crime rate is 0.0316 and that the Hollywood rate is
28 0.0353, about 10% higher.

5 Hollywood 2016: Population - 164,736; Total Part I Crimes - 5,830; Crime Per
6 Capita - 0.0353

7

8 The EIR gives a misleading and inaccurate picture of the crime rate in Hollywood
and how it compares with the rest of the City.
10

11 Former LAPD Chief Charlie Beck wrote to City Planning in 2014 to warn about the
12 existing "oversaturation" of ABC locations and the resulting increase in crime. In
13 discussing problems associated with existing ABC locations, Beck cited robberies,
14 assault, traffic collisions involving pedestrians, rapes and shootings. Granting
15 another full-line permit in a census tract that already has 19 full-line establishments
16 will only aggravate the situation.

17

18 A number of published studies show a relationship between alcohol density and
19 violent crime, including: Bars, Blocks and Crimes Revisited, Roncek and Maier,

20 1991; and Regulating Density of Alcohol Outlets: A Promising Strategy to Improve
21 Public Health, John Hopkins, 2013. A press release issued by Johns Hopkins on the
22 release of its report states, "The authors cite several examples of the significant
23 relationship between alcohol outlet density, consumption and harms: in Los Angeles
24 County, researchers estimated that every additional alcohol outlet was associated with
25 3.4 incidents of violence per year [.]"

26

27 In citing 2016 Hollywood Division stats, the EIR fails to mention that crime in had
28 gone up 38.1% since 2014.

- 17 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 The EIR fails to acknowledge that between 2014 and 2018 violent crime in
3 Hollywood increased by over 50%.

4

While the EIR concludes that the project will not have significant impacts on law

6 enforcement services, this conclusion only applies to a threshold requiring the

7 construction of new facilities. The EIR fails to address the questions raised under
8 Mandatory Findings of Significance, which ask if the Project's impacts would be
9 cumulatively considerable, and if there would be substantial adverse impacts to
10 human beings. In light of the fact that crime in Hollywood is already higher than the
11 Citywide rate, and that violent crime in Hollywood has risen over 50% since 2014, it
12 seems likely that impacts from the Hollywood Gower Project and other approved
13 projects will be cumulatively considerable and that there is a clear risk of adverse
14 impacts to area residents.
15

16 Waste Crisis

17

18 The Hollywood Gower EIR makes a number of false and/or misleading statements in
19 the section devoted to Utilities/Solid Waste. In its analysis of solid waste impacts
20 from the project, the EIR states:
21

22 "Therefore, it is estimated that the Project would divert 50 percent of its solid
23 waste generated as required by AB 939, thereby diverting this waste from
24 landfills.'

25

26 This "estimate" is outrageously exaggerated. As a result of China's decision to close
27 its doors to recyclables from the US, at the beginning of 2019 the City revised its
28 contracts for the RecycLA program and revised its diversion target for 2023 down to

- 18 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 35%. This should make it clear that the City is currently NOT diverting anywhere
2 near 50% of solid waste collected and that this project will not be in compliance with
3 AB 939.

4

5 But the picture of the City's recycling progress presented throughout this section is
6 inaccurate and based on assumptions that are not supported by facts. In its account of
7 the City's recycling history, the EIR states....

8

"By the end of 2011, the City achieved a diversion rate of 76.4 percent."
10

11 This is misleading for two reasons. First, it uses figure that was already years out of
12| date when the project application was filed. Second, the City has no actual data to
13 support the claim that it had achieved a diversion rate of 76.4%. In 2011 Los
14 Angeles, like many other US cities, was shipping solid waste to other countries,
15 primarily China, in the mistaken belief that all of these materials were being recycled.
16 But numerous news sources have published reports that, while some solid waste
17 imported by China was indeed recycled, much of it was dumped in landfills, or
18 discarded in rivers, or burned. It may be true that 76.4% of LA's solid waste was

19 exported to China, but the claim that all of this material was diverted to recycling is
20 based on wishful thinking, not reliable data.
21

22 The EIR says that waste from the project will be sent to the Sunshine Canyon
23 Landfill. This is misleading for two reasons. A newsletter published by LA County,
24 Inside Solid Waste, Spring/Summer, 2017, reports the following information:
25

26 "Since 2009, the [Sunshine Canyon] Landfill has generated over 10,700 odor
27 complaints from nearby residents and community members and received over
28 210 Notices of Violation (NOV) from the South Coast Air Quality Management

- 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 District (SCAQMD) for violating Rule 402 (Nuisance), and California Health

3 and Safety Code Section 41700."

4

5 "On November 9, 2016, the County of Los Angeles Public Health as the County

6 Health Officer issued an Order to Abate pursuant to Condition 45N of the

7 Landfill's Conditional Use Permit after determining that the landfill generated

8 odor represents a nuisance affecting the health and wellbeing of residents.'

9 Documents on file with the City of LA show that, due to the Order to Abate,
10 Sunshine Canyon Landfill has reduced its operating hours and is currently diverting
11 solid waste to El Sobrante Landfill. This means that Sunshine Canyon has been force
12 to reduce its operations and is currently not able to receive expected deliveries of
13 solid waste.

14

15 Additionally, the EIR states that Sunshine Canyon Landfill will be closing in 2037.
16 The EIR therefore assumes a destination for future solid waste deliveries that will be
17 inactive in 18 years. The EIR goes on to offer Chiquita Canyon Landfill as a viable
18 alternative to receive waste generated by the Project. The EIR states that even though
19 Chiquita Canyon was slated to close in 2019, it had recently completed a Master Plan
20 Revision which would allow it to expand its footprint and extend its term for 30
21 years.
22

23

24 What the EIR does not mention is that the Chiquita Canyon Landfill is currently the
subject of a lawsuit filed by the Val Verde Civic Association who claim that the
25 environmental assessment produced to assess impacts of the expansion was seriously
26 flawed. If the court finds in favor of the VVCA, it could limit operations at Chiquita
27 Canyon and reduce daily deliveries below the numbers quoted in the Hollywood
28 Gower EIR.

- 20 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 But the problem is actually far bigger than flawed EIR for a single project. A May
3 2018 report from the Solid Waste Environmental Excellence Protocol makes this
4 alarming statement:

5

6 "Based on data collected by Waste Business Journal, over the next five years,

7 total landfill capacity in the U.S. is forecast to decrease by more than 15%.

8 This means that by 2021 only 15 years of landfill capacity will remain. "
9 [Emphasis added.]
10

11 The report goes on to project that the Pacific Region, which includes Los Angeles,
12 has sufficient landfill capacity to last only 17 more years.
13

14 The inability of RecycleLA to meet State mandated recycling goals and the shrinking
15 capacity of local landfills are problems that have not been adequately analyzed in any
16 of the recent environmental assessments for projects within the City of LA, including
17 the Promenade 2035 Project, Crossroads Hollywood, Citizen M Hotel, and the 713
18 East 5th Street Project. The Hollywood Gower EIR has not only seriously
19 underestimated its own solid waste impacts, but has ignored citywide cumulative
20| impacts related to solid waste.
21

22 In addition to the impacts landfills have on nearby communities, they are a significant
23 source of methane, a greenhouse gas up to 35 times as potent as CO2 as a cause of
24 climate change. And the City's increasingly desperate efforts to find landfill capacity
25 for approximately 3,600 tons per day of solid waste result in diesel trucks travelling
26 increasingly long distances and producing larger amounts of harmful emissions.

27

28 | The City of LA is facing a serious waste a crisis, which city officials have refused to

- 21 -

| acknowledge. The Hollywood Gower project will only add to the City's worsening
2 waste crisis. The EIR should be rejected.

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6

7 Vesting Zone Change, Height District Change, Subdivision into Air Space Lots

8

9 In approving the Hollywood Gower Project, the City continues its pattern and
10| practice of approving generous land use entitlements the benefit real estate investors
11 while failing to address the pressing need for housing accessible to the majority of
12 Angelenos. For the past 5 years, on average, 90% of the new housing permitted by
13 the City has been for Above Moderate Income Households, and the remaining 10% of
14 permitted units has been the combined total of Moderate, Low, and Low Income

15 housing.

16

17 The City has clearly ignored goals and objectives of the General Plan Housing
18 Element and the Hollywood Community Plan which state that the City must create
19 safe, healthy housing accessible to residents of all income levels.
20

21 Sec. 12.32. of the LAMC states that land use legislative actions should only be

22 approved when they conform "with public necessity, convenience, general welfare
23 and good zoning practice." The City's approval of these generous entitlements in
24 exchange for a negligible amount of affordable housing also fails to meet these
25 criteria.

26

27 Environmental Impact Report

28

- 22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The EIR repeatedly incorporates incorrect and misleading information in a number of

2 areas. The EIR fails to include important data and context which are necessary for

3 the public's understanding of the issues involved. Specifically, the EIR fails to meet
4 the requirements set by CEQA in the following areas:

5

6 Public Services/ Police

7 Crime data for 2016 presented in this section does not correspond to crime data

8 published by the LAPD for the same year. The numbers presented in the EIR

9 are substantially lower than the numbers reported by the LAPD, and give an
10 incorrect account of the actual crime rate. The EIR falsely presents the crime
11 rate in Hollywood as being identical to the Citywide average. In fact, crime in
12 Hollywood is significantly higher than the Citywide average.
13

14 Transportation/Traffic

15 The EIR claims conformance with the SCAG RTP/SCS without

16 acknowledging important areas in which the project fails to meet the RTP/SCS
17 goals. The EIR fails to present important context regarding transit usage in the
18 Hollywood area and the results achieved (or not) by the City's ongoing policy

19 of approving high-density residential near transit. The EIR offers no evidence
20 to show that proposed mitigation measures, including the Transportation
21 Demand Management Plan, have been successful in the past.
22

23 Utilities/Solid Waste

24 With regard to the Initial Study's question under Utilities/Solid Waste asking
25 "Would the project comply with federal, state, and local statutes and
26 regulations related to solid waste?", the only possible answer is "No." The
27 Project will be served by the City's RecycLA program. The City's contracts

28 with RecycLA were recently amended and now set a very low bar by stating

- 23 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

that waste hauling companies have until 2023 to achieve a diversion rate to

2 recycling of 35%. The EIR's claim that the project complies with AB 939, a
State law implemented through CA PRC 42900, is false. AB 939 set a
4 requirement for the diversion of 50% of municipal solid waste to recycling.
Since the City requires that structures of this size be served by the RecycLA

6 program, and the RecycLA program is nowhere meeting State-mandated

7 recycling goals, the Project will fail to comply.

8

9 For these reasons the EIR is severely deficient and must be rejected.

10

11 Conditional Use Permit for Full Line of Alcoholic Beverages

12

13 Petitioner further alleges that the City of Los Angeles/Los Angeles City Council also
14 violated Section 12.24.W of the Los Angeles Municipal Code by granting a
15 Conditional Use Permit for the sale and dispensing of alcohol on the hotel premises.
16 Under Section 12.24.W, the City must find: (1) that the proposed use will not
17 adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent community; (2) that the granting of the
18 application will not result in an undue concentration of premises for the sale or
19 dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine, in the
20 area of the City involved, giving consideration to applicable State laws and to the
21 California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control's guidelines for undue
22 concentration; and also giving consideration to the number and proximity of these
23 establishments within a one thousand foot radius of the site, the crime rate in the area
24 (especially those crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of

25. narcotics, drugs or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct), and whether
26 revocation or nuisance proceedings have been initiated for any use in the area; and (3)
27 that the proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
28 communities in the area of the City involved, after giving consideration to the

- 24 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 distance of the proposed use from residential buildings, churches, schools, hospitals,
2 public playgrounds and other similar uses, and other establishments dispensing, for
sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages, including beer and wine.

4

5 Given the already high concentration of ABC locations currently in this census tract,

6 and given the high rate of violent crime in the Hollywood area, it must be said that
7 the findings submitted by the City is support of this CUP fail to accurately assess

8 current conditions in the area.

10 CAUSES OF ACTION

11

12 First Cause of Action

13

14 In approving the Vesting Zone Change and Height District Change the City seems to
15 have made its findings in a vacuum. Boilerplate language claiming conformance
16 with the General Plan, Housing Element and Hollywood Community Plan completely
17 disregards the reality that the people of Hollywood experience every day: housing
18 costs are increasingly burdensome and homelessness is a growing crisis. The City
19 cannot credibly claim that a project which includes 95% for Above Moderate Income
20 households and 5% for Very Low Income households meets the first goal of the
21 Housing Element:

22

23 GOAL 1: A City where housing production and preservation result in an
24 adequate supply of ownership and rental housing that is safe, healthy and
25 affordable to people of all income levels, races, ages, and suitable for their
26 various needs.

27

28 And while the findings quote Objective 3 of the Hollywood Community Plan, one

- 25 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- must wonder if DCP staff actually read it before inserting it into the determination
2 letter.

3

4 Objective 3 To make provision for the housing required to satisfy the varying
5 needs and desires of all economic segments of the Community, maximizing the
6 opportunity for individual choice.
7

8 Housing data from the Department of City Planning shows that for the past five years

9 the City has on the average issued permits for about 90% Above Median Income
10| housing and 10% for all other categories COMBINED. The approval of the
11 Hollywood Gower Project is part of a pattern and practice by the City which involves
12 granting lucrative entitlements to real estate investors while shirking its
13 responsibilities to the majority of the people of Los Angeles. Given the depth of the
14 housing crisis, this must be the primary consideration of the City in granting land use
15 entitlements.

16

17 Sec. 12.32. of the LAMC states that land use legislative actions should only be
18| approved when they conform "with public necessity, convenience, general welfare
and good zoning practice." The City's approval of these generous entitlements in 19

20 exchange for a negligible amount of affordable housing also fails to meet these
21 criteria.

22

23 Second Cause of Action

24

25 The record contains substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the Project
26 may cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the environment, including but not
27 limited to transportation, traffic, air quality, public services, and health/safety, in
28 addition to significant, unmititgatable cumulative impacts when considered in the

- 26 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

context of other projects that have been recently approved and those for which
2 approval is pending.

3

4 The City has adopted the EIR in spite of the fact that substantial evidence in the

5 record shows that it repeatedly presents inaccurate and misleading information, and

6 fails in significant ways to properly assess impacts in the following areas: Public
7 Services/Police, Transportation/Traffic, Utilities/Solid Waste. Not having
8 implemented monitoring procedures to assess the effectiveness of mitigation
9 measures approved for other projects, the City presents no credible evidence to
10 support the belief that these same measures will be successful in mitigating the
11 | impacts of the Hollywood Gower Project. The EIR also fails to present important
12 context that is crucial to an understanding of the Project's impacts.
13

14 It is important to point out that while impacts related to Public Services/Police would
15 probably not meet the threshold of significance set forth in this section of the Initial
16 Study (Would the Project necessitate the construction of new law enforcement
17 infrastructure?), it most likely does meet the criteria set forth under Mandatory
18 Findings of Significance, which asks about cumulative impacts and substantial
19 adverse effects on human beings. Given the existing high crime rate in Hollywood,
20 the addition of 220 new units, along with commercial uses, along with the cumulative
21 impacts resulting from the addition of thousands of new residential units and hotel
22 rooms in the Hollywood area, it seems clear that the Project will increase the burden

23 on the LAPD, making it more difficult for officers to protect the safety of area
24 residents and tourists. These issues are not addressed in the EIR.

25

26 With regard to the Initial Study's question under Utilities/Solid Waste which asks:
27 "Would the project comply with federal, state, and local statutes and regulations
28 related to solid waste?", the only possible answer is "No." The Project will be served

- 27 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F by the City's RecycLA program. The City's contracts with RecycLA were recently
2 amended and now set a very low bar by stating that waste hauling companies have

3 until 2023 to achieve a diversion rate to recycling of 35%. This should make it clear
4 that the Project will be in violation of CA PRC 42901.(a), which mandates that

5 "Cities and counties must divert 50 percent of all solid waste by January 1, 2000,
6 through source reduction, recycling, and composting activities."

7

8 By adopting the EIR in spite of substantial evidence in the record showing significant
9 deficiencies and misrepresentations, the City has prejudicially abused its discretion
10 and failed to proceed in the manner required by Public Resources Code Section
11 21000, et seq. (CEQA), requiring this Court to issue a writ of mandamus vacating and
12| invalidating all Project approvals, including approval of the EIR, all Land Use
13 Entitlements and Conditional Use Permits.

14

15 Third Cause of Action

16

17 Petitioner further alleges that the City also violated Section 12.24.W of the Los
18 Angeles Municipal Code by granting a Conditional Use Permit for the sale and
19 dispensing of alcohol on the hotel premises. Under Section 12.24. W, the City must
20 find:

21

22 (1) that the proposed use will not adversely affect the welfare of the pertinent
23 community;

24 (2) that the granting of the application will not result in an undue concentration of

25 premises for the sale or dispensing for consideration of alcoholic beverages,
26 including beer and wine, in the area of the City involved, giving consideration

27 to applicable State laws and to the California Department of Alcoholic
28 Beverage Control's guidelines for undue concentration; and also giving

- 28 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F consideration to the number and proximity of these establishments within a

2 one thousand foot radius of the site, the crime rate in the area (especially those
3 crimes involving public drunkenness, the illegal sale or use of narcotics, drugs
4 or alcohol, disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct), and whether

5 revocation or nuisance proceedings have been initiated for any use in the area;
6 and

7 (3) that the proposed use will not detrimentally affect nearby residentially zoned
8 communities in the area of the City involved, after giving consideration to the
9 distance of the proposed use from residential buildings, churches, schools,
10 hospitals, public playgrounds and other similar uses, and other establishments

11 dispensing, for sale or other consideration, alcoholic beverages, including beer
12 and wine.

13

14 It is hard to believe that the City does not consider the current 30 active liquor
15 permits, including 19 active Type 47 permits, in this census tract, to be an undue
16 concentration.

17

18 The EIR presents an inaccurate and misleading representation of crime in the
19 Hollywood area, which precludes the possibility of making an informed decision on
20 this issue. The crime stats presented in the EIR are grossly inaccurate, and create a

21 false impression that crime rate in Hollywood is no greater than the Citywide

22 average. This is blatantly false. The addition of yet another liquor permit will likely
23 increase the incidence of drunk driving, public drunkenness and assault, three
24 categories of crime where Hollywood's stats are well above the Citywide average.

25

26 By granting approval of a full-line liquor permit based on substantially inaccurate
27 information, the City has violated Section 12.24. W of the LAMC and the approval
28 must be rescinded.
