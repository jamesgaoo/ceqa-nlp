PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the June 11, 2019 decision of the Santa Cruz City

3 Council to approve the construction of Segment 7, phase 2, of the coastal rail trail (the

4 "Project") through a sensitive ecological area abutting the Neary Lagoon Management
5 Area in the City of Santa Cruz. Neary Lagoon is a biological hotspot supporting over 220

6 bird species, western pond turtle, red-legged frog, Hoary and Pallid bats, and multiple
7 salamander species. The Project would result in the destruction of wetland and riparian
habitat that forms an important buffer between Neary Lagoon and adjacent development.
9 The Project will require the removal of at least 42 trees, including16 trees classified as
10 heritage trees by the City and a heritage eucalyptus tree in an area the City's General Plan
11 identifies as sensitive habitat for the monarch butterfly. Although alternatives exist that
12 would avoid impacts to these important natural resources, the City declined to analyze
13 them. The City also failed to adequately address or mitigate impacts from the Project. By
14 approving the Project without adequate analysis or mitigation and without preparation of
15 an environmental impact report, the City violated the requirements of the California
16 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA
17 Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations Sections 15000 et seq.

18 PARTIES

19 2. Petitioner Save Our Big Trees is an unincorporated association with
20 members who live in Santa Cruz and who are dedicated to protecting the Neary Lagoon.
21 Save Our Big Trees and its members participated in the administrative process leading up

22 to the City's approval of the Project and objected to the Project at the City's June 11, 2019
23 hearing. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on
24 the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein
25 and by ensuring that the City abides by the procedures required under law in approving
26 projects like the one at issue here. Save Our Big Trees is beneficially interested in this
27 matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that the Respondents fulfill their duties to
28 comply with CEQA for the protection of the natural resources of the Neary Lagoon.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

3. Respondent City of Santa Cruz is a charter city in the State of California
2 responsible for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The City

3 is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with
4 principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of proposed actions. The City

5 has a duty to comply with CEQA, state law, and its own ordinances.
4. Respondent City Council of the City of Santa Cruz is, and at all times herein
7 mentioned was, the duly elected decisionmaking body of Respondent City. As the
8 decisionmaking body, the City Council was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for
9 conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting
10 the various approvals necessary for the Project.

11 5. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents
12 fictitiously named Does 1 through 10 and sues such Respondents by fictitious names.
13 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named

18 Commission is a public agency organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of
19 the State of California and is located in Santa Cruz County. Real Party Transportation

20 Commission is the owner of the rail line right of way where portions of the Project would
21 be located.

22 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in
23  Interest fictitiously named Does 11 through 20 and sues such respondents by fictitious

24 names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously
25 named Real Parties in Interest may have an interest in this litigation. When the true
26 identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner
27 will amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and
28 capacities.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 8. This Court has jurisdiction of the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of

3 Civil Procedure Sections 526, 527, 1085, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code Sections
4 21168 and 21168.5.

9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
California in and for the County of Santa Cruz pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
Section 394. Respondents' main offices are located in and the activities authorized by
8. Respondents will occur in the City of Santa Cruz, which is located in Santa Cruz County.

9 10. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
10 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
11 possible and required by law. Petitioner and its members submitted numerous objections to
12 the approvals for the Project and the City's reliance on a mitigated negative declaration.

13 11. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the
14 Mitigated Negative Declaration and granting approval of the Project. Respondents have a
15 duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to
16  undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner possesses no
17 effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of
18 this lawsuit.

19 12. On July 11, 2019, Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code Section
20 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioner planned to
21 file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approvals for the
22 Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.

23 13. On July 12, 2019, Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code Section
24 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of
25 the State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true
26 and correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
27 14. Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 Petitioner is filing a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

2 15. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
3 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set

4 aside their adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approvals for the Project. In

5 the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of

6 state law, and the environment, Petitioner and the natural environment Petitioner seeks to
7 protect will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately
8 compensate Petitioner for that harm.
9 STATEMENT OF FACTS

10 16. The Project a consists a paved, 12 foot wide, pedestrian and bicycle path that
11 would run parallel to an existing rail line. Construction of the trail would require new
12 retaining walls as high as approximately 19 feet along Neary Lagoon and would entail the
13 installation of new lighting at each street intersection and along the trail. Security cameras
14 would also be installed along the trail. La Barranca Park runs along the southwest side of
15 the trail and Neary lagoon is along the northeast side of the trail.

16 17. The Project, which runs from the intersection of California and Bay Streets
17 to Pacific Avenue, is designed to fill a gap in the larger 32-mile Coastal Rail Trail that
18 extends from Davenport to Watsonville in Santa Cruz County. The Coastal Rail Trail in
19 Santa Cruz County is part of the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Scenic Trail Network Master
20 Plan. The Project will be the third section of the Monterey Bay Scenic Sanctuary Trail
21 network within the City.

22 18. The Santa Cruz County Coastal Rail Trail Commission certified a final
23 Environmental Impact Report for the Master Plan on February 6, 2014. However, the City
24 did not rely on the Coastal Rail Trail EIR when it reviewed the environmental impacts of
25 the Project. Instead, it treated the Project as an independent action and prepared a
26 Mitigated Negative Declaration. a As a result, the City did not tier off of the Coastal Rail
27 Trail EIR for its analysis of the Project's environmental impacts, and it did not include
28 mitigation identified in that EIR.
5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

19. The City circulated a Mitigated Negative Declaration and initial study of the
2 Project's impacts from July 13, 2018 to August 13, 2018. During this time period, the City

3 received comments from members of the public, including the Sierra Club, who were

4 critical of the City's failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts.

5 Among other impacts, members of the public informed the City that it had failed entirely
6 to address impacts to monarch butterflies from the Project.
20. The California Coastal Commission also submitted comments noting that the
8 City had not adequately evaluated the Project's consistency with the City's Local Coastal
Program or its impacts on the environment. For example, the Coastal Commission
10 commented that the City should consider all of the riparian and wetland habitat that would
11 be impacted by the Project to be part of the Neary Lagoon riparian area and protected as
12 such. The Commission also noted that the Project's removal of heritage trees appeared to
13 conflict with policies in the Local Coastal Program designed to maintain and enhance
14 vegetation along the Lagoon. Finally, the Commission requested that the City evaluate
15 alternative alignments that would avoid impacts to Neary Lagoon.
16 21. The City recirculated the Mitigated Negative Declaration and initial study for
17 public review on January 7, 2019. Although the City modified the Project slightly to
18 reduce the number of heritage trees that would be removed, it did not substantially modify
19 the Project nor its analysis and mitigation of environmental impacts.

20 22. Representatives of local Native American tribes also weighed in on the
21 Project. A representative of one tribes whose cultural heritage could be affected by Project
22 construction requested that they be present during ground disturbing activities within 300
23 feet of a natural water source and another representative recommended that a Native
24 American Monitor be present during any ground disturbing activities.
25 23. During the public comment period on the recirculated Mitigated Negative
26 Declaration, the Sierra Club again commented on the City's failure to adequately evaluate
27 impacts to important biological resources. Among the other deficiencies identified in the
28 Sierra Club letter, the club noted that the City had failed to account for the full impact of
6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

tree removal by improperly focusing on the removal of individual trees rather than the
2 habitat that they supported. The club also noted that the recirculated initial study and
3 Mitigated Negative Declaration did not acknowledge the importance of Monarch butterfly
4 habitat and the need for avoidance of impacts to habitat.

5 24. Prior to the consideration of the Project by the Planning Commission, the

6 Sierra Club submitted additional comments by Dr. Rachel O'Malley, an expert in impacts
7 to biological resources, particularly those in Santa Cruz area. In these comments, Dr.
8 O'Malley noted the importance of Neary Lagoon as an area of immense biological
9 diversity. Dr. O'Malley demonstrated that the City had failed to adequately evaluate
10| impacts to Neary Lagoon in the Mitigated Negative Declaration and initial study because it
11  assumed that the trail alignment was separate from, rather than part of, the larger Neary
12 Lagoon ecosystem. As noted by Dr. O'Malley, the presence of a rail line was not a barrier
13 to the movement of biological resources such as red-legged frog, birds, bats, and other
14 species. As a result, the Mitigated Negative Declaration and initial study failed to evaluate
15 impacts from operation of the Project on the Lagoon and its sensitive environment
16 resources. Dr. O'Malley also noted that the Mitigated Negative Declaration and initial
17 study improperly focused on the removal of individual willow trees and failed to recognize
18 that each "individual" tree is actually a cluster of trees that provides continuous habitat.
19 Therefore, mitigation that focused on replacement of individual trees could not adequately
20 mitigate the impacts to habitat caused by the Project. Finally, Dr. O'Malley noted that the
21 City had failed to acknowledge and adequately mitigate the Project's impacts on monarch
22 butterfly population has been decimated in recent years.

23 25. Notwithstanding this evidence f significant environmental impacts and the
24 failure to adequately mitigate them, the Planning Commission approved the project on
25 April 18, 2019.

26 26. On April 29, 2019, members of Save Our Big Trees filed an appeal of the
27 Planning Commission's approval to the City Council.

28 27. On June 11, 2019 the City Council held a hearing on the appeal. At that
7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

P hearing members of the public including members of Save Our Big Trees, testified about
2 their concerns over the inadequacy of the City's environmental review for the project and
3 its failure to adequately mitigate its impacts. Evidence presented at the City Council's June
11 meeting also established that the habitat that would be impacted by the project was in
5 fact wetlands under the definition in the City's Local Coastal Program and under the

6 Coastal Act. The City however, proceeded to approve the problem project without further
environmental review or mitigation.

8 28. The City filed a notice of determination on June 13, 2019.
29. Save Our Big Trees filed an appeal of the City's approval to the California
10 Coastal Commission on June 28, 2019.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Violation of CEQA

13 30. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
14 in their entirety.

15 31. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal
16 of long-term protection of the environment into decisions that may affect the environment,
17 consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for every
18 Californian. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause
19 a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

20 32. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that an
21 agency prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a
22 fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. The EIR
23 is the cornerstone of the CEQA process and discloses a project's potential adverse
24 environmental and human impacts. The EIR also informs decisionmakers, responsible
25 agencies, and the public of alternative mitigation measures, project elements, or project
26 designs that would lessen or avoid the project's adverse environmental impacts.
27 33. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable
28 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant
8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a
2 any of the project's significant environmental impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than
3 significant level, an agency may not rely on a Mitigated Negative Declaration and must
4 instead prepare an EIR.
34. The City's approval of the Project constitutes a discretionary act that triggers
6 its obligation to comply with CEQA.
35. The City violated CEQA when it approved the Project by failing to
8 adequately evaluate and mitigate its project impacts for the following non-exclusive list of

reasons:

10 a. The Mitigated Negative Declaration improperly segments the Project
11 from the larger Coastal Trail Project and its cumulative environmental impacts. As a result,
12 the precluded a full understanding of the Project's significant impacts and the need for
13 mitigation.

14 b. The Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to analyze all of the
15 significant impacts of the Project, including impacts to wetlands and biological resources.
16 For example, the Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to analyze the operational impacts
17 of the project, including impacts from lighting and noise, as well as bicycle use on wildlife
18 relying on the Neary Lagoon and the riparian habitat that will be impacted by the Project.
19 C. The Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to include adequate
20 mitigation for Project impacts, including impacts to wetlands and biological resources. For
21 example, the Mitigated Negative Declaration's reliance on tree replacement as a mitigation
22 for the loss of heritage trees fails to mitigate the habitat loss associated with the Project.
23 The Mitigated Negative Declaration also fails to include adequate measures for mitigation
24 of impacts to Native American resources, including those recommended by affected tribes.

25 36. The City violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when
26 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant
27 environmental impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately
28 disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated to less than significant level.
9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

37. For all of the above reasons, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and

2 failed to comply with the law.

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to
6 vacate and set aside their approval of the Project;

7 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

8 vacate and set aside the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project;
9 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents
10| to comply with the requirements of CEQA and take any other action required by Public
11 Resources Code Section 21168.9;

12 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
13 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents and Real Party in Interest and their
14 representative agents, servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with
15 Respondents or Real Party in Interest on their behalf, from taking any action to implement
16 the Project pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA;
17 5. For costs of the suit;

18 6. For Petitioner's attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure Section
19 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and
20 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
