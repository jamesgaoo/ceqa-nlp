2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On February 5, 2019, the City of San Luis Obispo, by and through its City

4 Council (collectively, "Respondents") approved the 650 Tank Farm Road Mixed-Use Project,

5 including Resolution Number 10980 and Ordinance Number 1658 (2019 Series), a General

6 Plan Amendment (GENP-1064-2017), Airport Area Specific Plan Amendment (SPEC-0398-

7 2017), and a Mobile Home Park Conversion to construct 249 residential units and 17,500

8 square fect of commercial space on a 12.75-acre parcel (APN 053-421-005) at the intersection
of Tank Farm Road and Santa Fe Road ("Project"). Respondents concurrently adopted a

10 Mitigated Negative Declaration (EID-1066-2017) ("MND") and related findings for the Project.

11 2. Petitioners Richard R. Vanhumbeck and the Southwest Regional Council of

12 Carpenters (collectively, "Petitioners") challenge the approval of the Project and adoption of

13 the MND on the grounds that the Project does not comply with the California Environmental

14 Quality Act (CEQA--Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, the MND fails

15 to: provide a stable and finite project description, accurately describe baseline conditions at the
16 Project site, and adequately or accurately discuss direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to

17 aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, greenhouse

18 gases, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use, noise,

19 population and housing, public services, traffic, and utilities. Furthermore, Respondents failed

20 to provide adequate mitigation to reduce Project impacts to less than significant, and

21 Respondents did not adequately respond to comments submitted by and on behalf of

22 Petitioners.

23 3. On February 6, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Determination, and, pursuant to

24 Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof.

25 II.

26 PARTIES

27 4. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 3 as if fully

28 set forth herein.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

5. Richard R. Vanhumbeck is a taxpayer and resident of the City of San Luis

2 Obispo, where the Project is located.

3 6. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is a labor union representing 50,000
4 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and has a strong interest in

5 well-ordered land use planning and addressing the environmental impacts of development

6 projects, such as the Project. Members of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters
7 reside in the City and in the County of San Luis Obispo, and include residents affected by the
8 Project, whose interests will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA. Southwest
Regional Council of Carpenters submitted comments on the Project that addressed the
10 inadequacies of Respondents' environmental review.

11 7. Respondent City of San Luis Obispo is a charter city. On February 5, 2019,
12 Respondent City of San Luis Obispo, acting by and through its City Council, approved the
13 Project and adopted the MND.

14 8. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
15 Does through 15, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such
16 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their

17 identities have been ascertained.

18 9. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged,

19 Respondents and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining
20 Respondents and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
21 scope of such agency and employment.

22 10. Real Party in Interest Agera Grove Investments, LLC is a Delaware-based

23 limited liability corporation listed on the Notice of Determination as the Project applicant and

24 Real Party in Interest. On information and belief, and on this basis, Petitioners allege, Real
25 Party in Interest Agera Grove Investments, LLC applied for and received approvals from

26 Respondents for the Project.

27 11. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
28 Does 16 through 30, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

2 when their identities have been ascertained.

12. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties
4 In Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real

5 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

6 scope of such agency and employment.

7 II.

8 STANDING

13. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs through 12 as if fully

10 set forth herein.

11 14. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Richard

12 R. Vanhumbeck. Petitioner Richard R. Vanhumbeck is an individual dedicated to the

13 protection of the environment and orderly land use planning in the City and in the County of

14 San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and land use policy decision making.

15 Petitioner Richard R. Vanhumbeck is a resident in the City of San Luis Obispo and is affected
16 by the Project, and whose interests in preservation of the environmental integrity of, and land

17 use planning within, the County will be adversely affected by the lack of proper environmental

18 review under CEQA and approval of the Project. Petitioner is also a member of Petitioner
19 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters. Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the

20 meaning of Public Resources Code ยง 21177.

21 15. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner

22 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters and its members. Said organization is a labor union

23 that is dedicated to also preserving the quality of the environment and ensuring orderly land

24 use planning for its members, including those residing in the County of San Luis Obispo.

25 Approval of the Project and adoption of the MND will adversely affect these interests of
26 Petitioner Southwest Regional council of Carpenters and its members. Members and
27 representatives of Petitioner Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters, on behalf thereof,

28 have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of compliance with CEQA during the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

] administrative proceedings where the Project was considered. Accordingly, Petitioner

2 Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of
3 Public Resources Code ยง 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so
4 that participation in the litigation by individual members is not required.

5 16. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

6 Procedure ยง ยง 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code ยง 21167; CEQA Guidelines
7 ยง 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

8 other applicable laws and regulations.

IV.

10 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

11 17. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs through 16 as if fully

12 set forth herein.

13 18. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

14 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

15 compliance with Public Resources Code 21177, Code of Civil Procedure ยงยง 1085 and 1094.5,

16 and other applicable laws.

17 19. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code ยง
18 21167.5 was mailed to Respondents on March 6, 2019. (Letter and Proof of Service are

19 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

20 V.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.J 23 20. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully 24 set forth herein.
25 21. Respondents' approval of the MND constitutes an abuse of discretion because,
26 inter alia, the MND fails to: provide a stable and finite project description, accurately describe 27 baseline conditions at the Project site, and adequately or accurately discuss direct, indirect, and
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
5

1 cumulative impacts to aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology
2 and soils, greenhouse gases, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality,
3 land use, noise, population and housing, public services, traffic, and utilities. Furthermore,
4 Respondents failed to provide adequate mitigation to reduce Project impacts to less than
significant, and Respondents did not adequately respond to comments submitted by and on
behalf of Petitioners.

7 22. 'The MND must contain an accurate and stable project description in order to be

8 considered adequate as an informational document. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15124.) Failure to
provide a stable and finite project description defeats the informational purposes of CEQA and
10 invalidates the MND. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-
11 193.) Here, the MND for the Project does not contain a stable and a finite project description, in
12 violation of CEQA.

13 23. An MND must "include a description of the physical environmental conditions
14 in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published."
15 (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15125(a).) Respondents did not adequately evaluate, disclose, or
16 describe baseline environmental conditions regarding a variety of resource categories,

17 including air quality, geology and soils, traffic, hazards and hazardous materials, and land use.

18 24. Respondents improperly relied on thresholds of significance they have not
19 themselves adopted and that are outdated. California law requires Respondents to determine
20 the Project's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. CEQA Guidelines allow an agency to
21 determine the significance of Project-level greenhouse gas impacts, for instance, by setting
22 quantitative emissions thresholds and by determining consistency with a Climate Action Plan,
23 consisting of regulations "adopted by the relevant public agency through a public review
24 process." (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).) To be relied on as mitigation, this plan must
25 actively "reduce or mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas

26 emissions." (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).) ยง

27 25. Respondents evaluate the consistency of the Project with, inter alia, the

28 California Air Resources Board's AB 32 Scoping Plan ("Scoping Plan") and other outdated

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 plans to conclude Project-level impacts under this significance threshold are less than

2 significant prior to mitigation. The Scoping Plan is a statewide plan designed to reduce certain
3 categories of greenhouse gases consistent with the mandate of the State greenhouse gas laws.
4 However, Center for Biological Diversity v. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2015)
620 Cal.4th 204, noted that the Scoping Plan was not designed or intended to be used at the

6 Project-level. That case held that, to rely on the Scoping Plan, an agency, such as Respondents,

7 must provide analysis that adequately explains why application of the Scoping Plan at the

8 Project-level would be suitable under the circumstances. Respondents provided no such

9 analysis and, thus, Respondents' use of the Scoping Plan is erroneous. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง

10 15064.4(b).) In addition, Respondents' use of the Scoping Plan did not serve to "reduce or
11 mitigate the project's incremental contribution of greenhouse gas emissions," as required by
12 law. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(b).)

13 26. Further, Respondents' evaluation of consistency with outdated plans and other
14 plans not adopted by Respondents for the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas impacts at the
15 Project level was confusing and failed to serve the informational purposes of CEQA. And,
16 Respondents' failure to consider Project impacts significant under the San Luis Obispo County
17 Air Pollution Control District's "bright line" greenhouse gas emissions threshold cannot be

18 seen as a good faith effort at disclosing the significance of Project-related greenhouse gas
19 impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15064.4(a).)

20 27. Respondents failed to provide an adequate discussion of other Project-related
21 direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts and mitigation measures. CEQA requires Respondents
22 to consider the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the Project, and to
23 adopt all feasible mitigation needed to reduce Project-related impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยงยง
24 15126.2; 15130.) The analysis in the MND failed to accurately disclose the significant direct,

25 indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the Project. Furthermore, Respondents failed

26 to accurately describe and implement all feasible mitigation measures.

27 28. In addition, CEQA requires that Respondents provide adequate responses to
28 comments raised during the comment period for the Project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15088.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments raised by Petitioners and others.

2 29. Respondents must prepare an adequate MND that conforms with all of the

3 procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the Project MND,

4 which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes an abuse

5 of discretion and a failure to a proceed in a manner required by law.

6 VI.

7 ATTORNEYS' FEES

8 30. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully

9 set forth herein.

10 31. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the

11 People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and

12 Real Party in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil

13 Procedure ยง 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

14 VII.

15 INJUNCTION

16 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully

17 set forth herein.

18 33. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

19 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

20 34. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

21 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

22 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

23 35. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

24 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of law.

25 Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continues to fail to perform their

26 duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

27 36. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

28 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

2 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.
37. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,
degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of San Luis Obispo, the County of

6 San Luis Obispo, and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent

7 injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

8 38: A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

9 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.
10 39. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

11 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

12 Project and adoption of the MND.

13 PRAYER

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

15 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

16 aside any and all Project approvals including, but not limited to Resolution Number 10980,

17 Ordinance Number 1658 (2019 Series), General Plan Amendment Number GENP-1064-2017,

18 Airport Area Specific Plan Amendment Number SPEC-0398-2017, and a Mobile Home a Park

19 Conversion in conjunction with the construction of the Project, and adoption of MND Number
20 EID-1066-2017, unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions

21 into compliance with CEQA.

22 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in

23 any activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review and the Project complies

24 with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA.

25 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง

26 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

27 4. For costs of suit; and

28 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.
