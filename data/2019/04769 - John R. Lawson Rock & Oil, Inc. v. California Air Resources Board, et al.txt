8 of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA and Section 11346.3(a) of the Government Code.

9 INTRODUCTION

10 1. This action concerns a rulemaking by CARB for its proposed amendments to the

11 California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles
12 ("CA Phase 2 Standards") and the proposed amendments to the Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse Gas
13 ("GHG") Regulation ("Tractor-Trailer GHG Regulation"), which are collectively referred to herein as
14 the "Proposed Amendments."

15 2. The Proposed Amendments represent just one of numerous regulations promulgated or
16 being considered by CARB that impose significant costs on the trucking industry.

17 3. CARB did not address the potential impacts of the Proposed Amendments in any

18 meaningful way. Although members of the public expressed significant concern about the cumulative

19 effects of CARB's regulations on California businesses or the Proposed Amendments' impact on the
20 environment, CARB essentially bypassed its obligation to perform any meaningful economic or

21 environmental review.

22 4. Among other things, CARB performed a truncated a analysis of economic impacts to
23 California businesses, resting on the assumption that the Proposed Amendments overlap significantly
24 with federal regulations recently adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and
25 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") on October 25, 2016, which are
26 referred to herein as the "Federal Phase 2 standards." The analysis underlying CARB's consideration
27 of the Proposed Amendments presumes the continuing existence of the Federal Phase 2 standards, and
28 CARB truncated its analysis based on the presumption that it need not study the impacts associated

I1 {6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 2.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

i

with those overlapping regulations. However, due to a stay recently issued by the D.C. Circuit, and
2 recent actions by the EPA, it now appears the Federal Phase 2 standards will not be implemented,
rendering CARB's analysis woefully incomplete, and based on an inaccurate baseline.

4 5. Moreover, although CARB is currently engaged in numerous rulemakings that will
5 affect the trucking industry, CARB entirely failed to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts

6 of the various regulations as whole, and instead myopically focused on the Proposed Amendments.
7 Based on this limited scope, CARB ultimately-and erroneously---found the Proposed Amendments

8 exempt from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources
9 Code, ยง 21000, et seq., and determined no Standardized Regulatory Impact Assessment was required
10 under the California Administrative Procedures Act, Government Code, ยง 11350, et seq. (the "APA").
11 6. Further, the Proposed Amendments, when evaluated alone, or in combination with
12 other rulemakings, effectuate a regulatory taking of property, as the actions undermine Lawson's
13 property rights and investment-backed expectations.

14 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 7. Petitioner John R. Lawson Rock & Oil, Inc. ("Lawson" or "Petitioner") is a California
16 corporation based in Fresno, California. Most of Lawson's employees are residents of the State of
17 California, and live in or around the San Joaquin Valley. Lawson operates a large fleet a of vehicles,
18 which are subject to the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2, and invested
19 millions of dollars proactively complying with numerous CARB regulations.

20 8. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims presented herein because it is beneficially
21 interested in the subject matter of the proceeding, insofar as it would be impacted by Respondents'
22 regulation of HD trucks and trailers under the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase
23 2. In addition, the interests Petitioner seeks to protect in this action include ensuring full and
24 forthright compliance by Respondents with CEQA, as well as CARB regulations implementing
25 CEQA. Petitioner will be injured by the implementation of the Regulation without full compliance
26 with CEQA and the Board's regulations implementing CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

9. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition.
2 Petitioner has exhausted any and all administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia,
participating in the administrative and environmental review process. This participation is

4 acknowledged in, among other places, the Attachment G to Resolution 18-32, Response to Comments

5 on the Environmental Analysis for Proposed California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for
6 Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles (Phase 2), prepared by Respondent in the
7 Rulemaking.

8 10, Petitioner complied with the requirements of Section 21167.5 Public Resources Code
9 by mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. Copies of the letters providing written notice

10 to Respondents, and proof of service of those letters, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A."

11 11. A copy of this Petition will be filed with the Attorney General following the filing of
12 this action pursuant to Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

13 12. Petitioner has complied with Section 21167.6 Public Resources Code by concurrently
14 filing a request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this

15 action, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

16 13. Respondent CARB is a state agency subject to the California Government Code, with
17 certain powers and duties under the California Health & Safety Code. CARB has eleven (11)

18 members, appointed by the Governor, several of whom are chosen from various air quality control

19 districts in the State, and a full-time Chairperson who is appointed by the Governor with the consent of
20 the California Legislature. CARB is the state agency that approved the Tractor-Trailer Regulation

21 Amendments and CA Phase 2. CARB must comply with CEQA prior to approving regulations such

22 as the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 at issue in this proceeding. The

23 approval of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA a Phase 2 was a discretionary action
24 for purposes of CEQA.

25 14. The current Executive Officer of CARB is Richard Corey, who is made a party to this
26 action in his official capacity only. Mr. Corey acts as the director and manager of the CARB
27 professional and other staff personnel, who all report to him.
28 15. Collectively, CARB and Mr. Corey are referred to herein as "Respondents."

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 16. Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Section 1085 of the Code of Civil

2 Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state agencies and officers to determine
whether those actions comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and (in the case of agencies that
4 conduct rulemaking under "certified" regulatory processes, such as CARB) with other regulations that
5 implement CEQA. Sections 525 and 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for an injunction

6 when it appears that Petitioner is entitled to the relief sought, and Section 1060 of the Code of Civil
7 Procedure provides for a judicial declaration of Petitioner's rights and Respondents' duties.
8 Accordingly, and based on the facts stated in this Petition, this Court has jurisdiction to grant
injunctive relief and to issue a writ of mandate on the claims presented here.

10 17. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Section 401 of the Code of Civil Procedure

11 because CARB is a state agency, Mr. Corey is a state officer, and the Attorney General of the State of
12 California has an office located in the City and County of Fresno.
13 STATEMENT OF FACTS

14 A. EPA and NHTSA's Rulemaking

15 18. On October 25, 2016, the EPA and NHTSA jointly published the final rulemaking for
16 the Federal Phase 2 standards. Federal Phase 2 follows the same regulatory structure as Federal Phase

17 and set GHG emission standards for tractors, vocational vehicles, and PUVs. Additionally, for the
18 first time, Federal Phase 2 established federal emissions requirements for trailers hauled by HD
19 tractors. The Federal Phase 2 standards were designed to be more technology-forcing than Federal
20 Phase standards, requiring manufacturers to improve existing technologies or develop new
21 technologies to meet the standards. Federal Phase 2 standards were projected to be phased-in from
22 2021 to 2027 for tractors, vocational vehicles, and PUVs. The standards for trailers were set to phase-
23 in from 2018 through 2027.

24 19. To achieve further GHG emissions reductions under Federal Phase 2, manufacturers

25 would be required to employ more advanced compliance options such as engine waste-heat recovery
26 ("WHR"), hybrids, fully electric vehicles, advanced transmissions, intelligent vehicle controls, heat
27 rejection management, electrification of ancillary equipment, and other technologies, including
28 improvements in vehicle aerodynamics and low rolling resistance tires. Trailer manufacturers would

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX}
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

be required to utilize aerodynamic technologies, including skirts, and rear fairings, as well as LRR
2 tires, automatic tire inflation systems ("ATIS"), and weight reducing materials to meet the Federal
3 Phase 2 standards. All of this, of course, comes at a significant cost to regulated parties, including
4 truckers like Lawson.

20. Due to a stay recently issued by the D.C. Circuit, and recent actions by the EPA, it now
appears the Federal Phase 2 standards will not be implemented.

B. CARB's Rulemaking Pursuant to CEQA

21. On December 19, 2017, Respondents announced a February 8, 2018, hearing to
9 consider the adoption of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2. The Proposed
10 Amendments largely, but not entirely, overlap with the Federal Phase 2 standards .
11 22. The proposed Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 were

12 accompanied by a "Staff Report: Initial Statement of Reasons, dated December 19, 2017 (the "Staff
13 Report/ISOR"), which is Respondents' "functional equivalent document" to a negative declaration
/ 14 under CARB's regulations implementing CEQA found at 13 Cal. Code Regs., ยงยง 1956.8, 1961.2,
15 1965, 2036, 2037, 2065, 2112, and 2141.

16 23. Respondents received twenty-two (22) written comments in response to the ISOR,
17 including comments from trucking interests and advocacy groups. Nearly all were opposed to the
18 Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2, or core components of the Tractor-Trailer
19 Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2.

20 24. The hearing on the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 began on
21 February 8, 2018, and approximately fifteen (15) members of the public offered comments. Again,
22 most of those comments opposed the Regulation.

23 25. On October 1, 2018, CARB adopted Resolution 18-32, which purported to "approve"
24 the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2. Resolution 18-32 includes
25 Respondents' responses to comments raised by Lawson and others.
26 26. Upon CARB's "approval" of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA
27 Phase 2 on or about October 1, 2018, Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon allege,
28 ///

I {6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- that Respondents irreversibly committed themselves to a definite course of action, despite the stay on
2 the trailer provisions of Federal Phase 2.

3 27. Prior to the adoption of Resolution 18-32, Petitioners are informed and believe, and

4 based thereon allege, that Respondents had not completed the environmental review process, in
violation of CEQA's prohibition on post hoc environmental review. For example, at the time of the
6 "approval" of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 on October 1, 2018, many

7 details of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 were still undetermined as
8 Respondents have advised that modifications requiring additional 15-day comment periods may also
be necessary in the future.

10 28. On December 21, 2018, Respondents published a Final Statement of Reasons and

11 posted a Notice of Exemption reflecting that the environmental review process was complete.

12 C. The Proposed Amendments Erroneously Presume the United States Will Implement

13 the Federal Phase 2 Standards

14 29. One of the most significant problems with CARB's analysis of the Proposed
15 | Amendments was that CARB presumed the federal government would adopt and implement the
16 2 Federal Phase 2 standards. As a result, for purposes of both its evaluation of environmental effects
17 under CEQA and its evaluation of economic impacts to California businesses under the APA, CARB

18 used a it "baseline" it believed had already factored in costs of compliance and environmental impacts

19 associated with the Federal Phase 2 standards. CARB thus suggested the impacts of the Proposed
20 Amendments would be minimal, on the basis that compliance with the federal standards was already

21 required, this allowing CARB to avoid a full evaluation of the negative consequences of the Proposed

22 Amendments on California businesses and the environment.

23 30. CARB's act of truncating its analysis based on the presumption that the federal

24 government would implement the Federal Phase 2 standards is erroneous.

25 31. For instance, on March 28, 2017, President Trump issued Executive Order 13777 ("EO
26 13777") on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth, which mandates that all agencies

27 review and identify actions that are related to or arose from President Obama's June 2013 Climate

28 ///

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Action Plan. Federal Phase 2 is within the scope of this EO 13777, because it is related to and arose
2 from the 2013 Climate Action Plan.

32. In addition, on August 17, 2017, the former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, indicated
that the EPA would revise the Federal Phase 2 trailer provisions and the issue of the EPA's authority
to regulate trailers, and would develop and issue a Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking on
this matter.

33. As a result of the above, significant portions (if not all) of the Federal Phase 2 standards

are currently being reviewed for revision (and possible elimination) by the United States. Thus, by
evaluating only the incremental differences between the Proposed Amendments and the Federal Phase
10 2 standards, CARB neglected to fully evaluate the range of economic and environmental consequences
11 that may result from the Proposed Amendments.

12 D. CARB's Analysis Ignores the Cumulative Effects of Numerous Other Substantially
13 Related Regulations, the Incremental Costs of Which will Impose Enormous Financial Burdens on the Trucking Industry
14 34. In addition, CARB is currently undertaking a vast suite of regulatory amendments and
15 enactments designed to impose yet additional burdens on the trucking industry. While the burden
16 imposed by each of the proposed rulemakings (including the Proposed Amendments), standing alone,
17 is significant, the amendments and enactments in the aggregate are sufficiently high to impose an
18 unreasonable financial burden on the industry that undermines reasonable investment-backed
19 expectations. This is particularly true in light of CARB's history of sweeping and burdensome
20 regulations, followed by under-enforcement and regulatory rollbacks.

21 35. These amendments and enactments include, but are not limited to:

22 Recent amendments to CARB's Tractor-Trailer Regulation;

23 Recent and ongoing amendments to CARB's Truck and Bus Regulation;

24 Proposed amendments to CARB's Heavy Duty Vehicle Inspection Program
25 ("HDVIP") and Periodic Smoke Inspection Fleet ("PSIP") regulations, which are

26 presently in the rulemaking process;

27 Proposed amendments to CARB's HD Warranty regulations, which are presently
28 in the rulemaking process;

6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Proposed amendments to CARB's HD On-Board Diagnostic ("OBD")

2 regulations, which are presently in the rulemaking process; and
60 + n Anticipated 2019 rulemakings affecting the trucking industry, including Heavy
Duty Zero Certification Procedures, Emissions Warranty Information and
Reporting and Recall Regulations ("EWIR"), and amendments to the Transport

6 Refrigeration Unit (*TRU") Regulation, which all relate to HD trucks and trailers.

7 36. Despite the fact that the above regulations are all related, and collectively impose

8 enormous costs on truckers and related industries, CARB took no effort to evaluate the cumulative

9 burden of these enactments from an environmental or economic perspective. Nor did CARB offer just

10 compensation or other relief for the millions of dollars truckers who seek to dutifully comply with the

11 regulations will incur.

12 37. As a result of the foregoing, Lawson was required to bring the instant action.

13 CAUSES OF ACTION

14 First Cause of Action - Failure to Perform Environmental Review Under CEQA

15 38. Lawson re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs - to 36 in
16 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

17 39. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document and
18 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made, (Pub.
19 Resources Code, ยง 21002), and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be
20 the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21001, subd, (d).) "CEQA was

21 intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the
22 environment within the reasonable scope of statutory authority." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15003(f).)
23| The overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure agencies regulating activities that may affect the
24 environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the
25 Legislature's declaration of policy that all necessary action be taken to protect, rehabilitate and
26 enhance the environmental quality of the state. (Save Our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of

27 Supers. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 177 [citing Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ.
28 of Calif. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373, 392].)

I {6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 40.

2 Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively defective,

3 reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates

4 may not have resulted in a different outcome. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21005, subd. (a).) For
example, the Court in Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421,

6 428, held that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental impacts
of the project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with the mandates
7 of CEQA would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCO
8 (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-98 [disapproved on other grounds, Voice of the Wetlands v. State

9 Water Resources Control Bd. (2011) 52 Cal 4th 499, 528-29], went so far as to declare that failure to
10 comply with CEQA procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm

11 Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, in turn, explained that an agency commits

12 prejudicial error if "the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making
13 and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." (221
14 Cal.App.3d at p. 712.)

15 41. Because CARB is a state agency that has adopted a certified regulatory program,
16 CARB is exempt from some of CEQA's requirements. However, CARB is required to comply CEQA
17 through its certified regulatory program when it seeks to adopt regulations, (see Pub. Resources Code
18 ยง 21080.5; 14 Cal. Code Regs. ["CEQA Guidelines"], ยงยง 15250-15253; 17 Cal. Code Regs. ยงยง 60005,
19 60006, 60007), as well as the applicable provisions of the Public Resources Code.

20 42.

21 CARB's certified regulatory program under CEQA plainly provides that:

22 All staff reports shall a contain a description of the proposed action, an assessment of anticipated significant and long or short term adverse and beneficial

23 environmental impacts associated with the proposed action and a succinct analysis of those impacts. The analysis shall address feasible mitigation measures and

24 feasible alternatives to the proposed action which would substantially reduce any significant adverse impact identified.

25 (17 Cal. Code Regs., ยง 60005(a) [emphasis added].) There is no authority to suggest that CARB may
26 avoid the procedures of its certified regulatory program in instances where CARB subjectively
27 believes no environmental analysis is warranted.

28 ///

I {6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

H 43. Section 60007(b) of CARB's certified regulatory program, in turn, refers to the analysis
2 in the "staff report" as the "Environmental Assessment." Notably, CARB's certified regulatory
3 program does not include

4 any mechanism for CARB to find a proposed regulatory action is "exempt"
from CARB's certified regulatory program or CEQA generally, (id. ยงยง 60005, 60006, 60007); rather,
5 the Environmental Assessment must be included for "[a]ll staff reports . . . ." (Id. con 60005(b)
6 [emphasis added].) Moreover, CARB's certified regulatory program does not authorize the filing of a
7 Notice of Exemption; rather, the only cognizable "notice" in the certified regulatory program
8 "notice of the final action" referenced in Section is the

o to as the "Notice of Decision." 60007(b), which Lawson understands CARB refers

10 44. In this case, CARB staff on December 19, 2017, released its "Staff Report: Initial
11 Statement of Reasons," for public review. Since the relevant document is a Staff Report, and "[a]ll
12 staff reports shall contain . an assessment of anticipated significant and long or short term adverse
13 and beneficial environmental impacts associated with the proposed action and a succinct a analysis of
14

15 those impacts," (17 Cal. Code Regs., ยง 60005(a) [emphasis added]), CARB was required to comply

16 with Section 60005, and prepare an Environmental Assessment - and not a Notice of Exemption.
45. Despite this mandatory requirement, CARB staff prepared a Notice of Exemption,
17 asserting no environmental review of the Proposed Amendments was necessary. CARB purported to
18 post its Notice of Exemption on December 21, 2018.

19 46.

20 Because CARB prepared a "Staff Report," and Section 60005(a) of CARB's certified

21 regulatory program imposed a non-discretionary duty on CARB to assess the "anticipated significant

22 and long or short term adverse and beneficial environmental impacts associated with the proposed

23 action and a succinct analysis of those impacts," (17 Cal. Code Regs., ยง 60005(a)), Respondents

24 prejudicially abused their discretion, and violated both CEQA and CARB's own regulations, by
approving the Proposed Amendments without performing environmental review, and instead
25 purporting to adopt a Notice of Exemption.

26 47. Even if CARB were authorized to rely upon an "exemption" where a staff report is
27 released, CARB may not rely upon an exemption here because (i) the "common sense" exemption

28 does not a 8 apply, (ii) a Class 8 exemption is not authorized because there is a reasonable possibility the

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1| project or activity may have a significant effect on the environment, (iii) unusual circumstances exist

2 such that an exemption is improper, (iv) Respondents used an improper baseline that erroneously
3 presumed the Federal Phase 2 would remain in effect, which is not the case, and (v) Respondents

4 impermissibly delegated environmental review responsibility to a member of CARB staff, who is not a a

5 decisionmaker for purposes of the Proposed Amendments.

6 48. Pursuant to Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code, Lawson is entitled to

7 petition this Court for a writ of mandate requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and the Board's
8 implementing regulations.

49. Lawson has a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of
10 their duties under CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations, and Respondents have the duty
11 and capacity to perform their duties under CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations.

12 50. Lawson also has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a mandate by
13 virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue to be adversely affected
14| by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations. The
15 failure of Respondents to perform their duties requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing a

16 them to discharge their duties under Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and
17|| Sections 21080.5, 21168, and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

18 Second Cause of Action - Piecemealing/Segmentation of Environmental Review

19 51. Lawson re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 49 in

20 their entirety, as though set forth fully herein.

21 52. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results
22 from chopping a large project into many little ones each with a minimal potential impact on the
23 environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envt'l Prot. Info. Ctr. v.
24 Calif. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503.) Thus, CEQA "forbids 'piecemeal'
25 review of the significant environmental impacts of a project." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay

26 Comm. v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs (2011) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.) Rather, when a lead agency
27 undertakes the environmental review process, the lead agency must review and consider the "whole of
28 the action," (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15378 [emphasis added]), and consider "the effects, both individual

I {6063/039/00912904.DOCX) 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21002.1, subd. (J))
2 It is only a through a complete and accurate "view of the project may affected outsiders and public
decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental cost." (Berkeley Keep Jets,
supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1358.) This allows affected outsiders and public decision-makers to
"consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal . and weigh other
alternatives in the balance." (Id. at 1358.)

53. In this case, CARB did not consider the "whole of the action." Rather, the Proposed
Amendments are only one part of a larger effort by CARB to overhaul its regulations relating to the
trucking industry, and to impose significantly greater costs and burdens on truckers. In addition to the
10 Proposed Amendments, these efforts include:

11 Recent amendments to CARB's Tractor-Trailer Regulation;
12 Recent and ongoing amendments to CARB's Truck and Bus Regulation;
13 Proposed amendments to CARB's HDVIP and PSIP regulations, which are
14 presently in the rulemaking process;
15 Proposed amendments to CARB's HD Warranty regulations, which are presently
16 in the rulemaking process;
17 Proposed amendments to CARB's HD OBD regulations, which are presently in
18 the rulemaking process; and

19 Anticipated 2019 rulemakings affecting the trucking industry, including Heavy
20 Duty Zero Certification Procedures, EWIR regulations, and amendments to the

21 TRU Regulation, which all relate to HD trucks and trailers.

22 54. These continuous and separate environmental reviews and comment periods constitute
23 impermissible segmentation of environmental review in violation of CEQA. The Tractor-Trailer
24 Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2, contemplated regulations relating to HD trucks and trailers,
25 and any modifications to those regulations and amendments, are one project and one rulemaking. Full
26 environmental review and consideration of the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase
27 2, and contemplated regulations relating to HD trucks and trailers, including all the details pertaining
28 ///

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 13

FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- thereto, were required before the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 and

2 contemplated regulations relating to HD trucks and trailers were adopted and implemented.

3 55. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described actions

4 in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed โขto proceed in the manner required by law, and
Respondent's' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Respondents
further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects of their actions prior
to approving and implementing those actions. Under Sections 21080.5, 21168, and 21168.5 of the
Public Resources Code, Lawson is entitled to petition this Court for a writ of mandate requiring
Respondents to comply with CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations.

10 56. Lawson has a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of

11 their duties under CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations, and Respondents have the duty

12 and capacity to perform their duties under CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations.

13 57. Lawson also has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a mandate by
14 virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they, are and will continue to be adversely affected

15 by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations. The

16 failure of Respondents to perform their duties requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing

17 them to discharge their duties under Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and
18 Sections 21080.5, 21168, and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

19 Third Cause of Action - Failure to Adequately Analyze Economic Impact of Amendment

20 58. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 56 in

21 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

22 59. The California APA requires a careful assessment of "the potential for adverse

23 economic impact on California business enterprises and individuals." (Govt. Code, ยง 11346.3, subd.

24 (a).) Substantial compliance with the APA requires an accurate statement of staff's estimated costs of
25 compliance with a proposed regulation at least 45 days before the public hearing on a proposed
26 regulation, and any substantial change in those estimates require a postponement of the public hearing

27 for the period of time necessary to permit 45 days to prepare testimony on the revised cost estimates
28 for the public hearing. In addition, any determination that a proposed rule will not have a significant a

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

adverse economic impact must be supported in the materials an agency makes available for public

2 review and comment by "facts, evidence, documents, [or] testimony," made available for public
3 review and comment for at least 45-days before an agency approves a regulation.

4 60. In this case, CARB violated the APA for several reasons:

CARB erroneously concluded the Proposed Amendments did not constitute a
a "major regulation," and based on that erroneous conclusion did not prepare an

7 Economic Impact Assessment (*EIA") or Standardized Regulatory Impact

8 Assessment ("SRIA") for the Proposed Amendments. Affected industry groups
a testified that the basis for CARB's findings was erroneous, and CARB neglected

10 to consider numerous direct and indirect impacts on the trucking industry.

11 CARB's analysis of economic impacts is incomplete. Because CARB staff

12 operated under the assumption that the costs of the Proposed Amendments largely

13 overlapped with the projected costs associated with the federal Phase 2 standards,
14 and CARB only considered the costs associated with the difference between the
15 two, which CARB suggested was minimal. As a result, CARB did not evaluate

16 the economic impacts associated with the entirety of the Proposed Amendments.
17 In addition to using the incorrect baseline to evaluate economic impacts, CARB
18 staff's failure to assess such impacts was based on the erroneous conclusion that
19 the federal Phase 2 standards would remain in effect, which is not the case.

20 CARB's economic analysis was limited to interstate competitiveness, although it

21 was required to consider both instrastate and interstate competitiveness. (John R.

22 Lawson Rock & Oil, Inc. v. State Air Resources Board (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 77,

23 114-115.) This is particularly true now given that the federal Phase 2 standards

24 will not go into effect.

25 CARB ignored indirect costs to California vehicle fleets.

26 CARB failed to evaluate the cumulative effect that CARB's various, related

27 rulemakings would have on California vehicle fleets. These rulemakings include,

28 but are not limited to, recent amendments to CARB's Tractor-Trailer Regulation;

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX)} 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

recent and ongoing amendments to CARB's Truck and Bus Regulation; proposed
2 amendments to CARB's HDVIP and PSIP regulations, which are presently in the
3 rulemaking process; proposed amendments to CARB's HD Warranty regulations,
4 which are presently in the rulemaking process; proposed amendments to CARB's
5 HD OBD regulations, which are presently in the rulemaking process; and

6 anticipated 2019 rulemakings affecting the trucking industry, including Heavy
7 Duty Zero Certification Procedures, EWIR regulations, and amendments to the

8 TRU regulation, which all relate to HD trucks and trailers.

9 61. In addition, in both written comments, and in oral comments at the public hearing
10 conducted on February 8, 2018, numerous owners and operators of trucks presented substantial,
11 credible evidence that the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2 regulations create
12 an insurmountable economic burden.

13 62. For example, a representative of one association commented:

14 One contributing factor is the state's unique in-use truck standards which
15 have required fleets to purchase new or newer trucks ahead of normal turnover cycles. The cost of accelerating truck purchases to meet the
16 state's deadlines has stretched financial resources and resulted in delayed purchases once the initial compliance has been met. In addition, the use of
17 technology-forcing standards have caused trucking companies to re- evaluate their investment in new trucks that are more expensive, less
18 reliable and require increased maintenance.

19 The proposed California regulation costs will further increase the cost of new trucks and trailers sold in California. Bear in mind that the federal
20 Phase 2 regulation is projected to increase the price of a new Class 8 truck by more than $12,000 and a new 53-foot box trailer by roughly $1,000.
21 While the California only Phase 2 provisions are projected to cost California fleets an additional $53 annually, this figure assumes each of
22 these fleets will be purchasing new trucks every year. In reality, only companies purchasing new trucks and trailers in California will bear these
23 costs which will likely result in higher costs.

24 While the Board has spent a significant number of hours discussing the financial impacts of the state's Truck and Bus Rule, the combined cost of
25 numerous regulations receives much less focus yet likely results in additional unintended consequences. Upcoming state regulatory activities
26 focused on truck warranties, onboard diagnostics, heavy-duty inspection and maintenance practices, and lowering NOx emissions are expected to
27 further add to the cost of purchasing and operating new trucks in California. How these combined initiatives impact fleet purchase patterns
28 and the ability of fleets to operate newer, cleaner trucks is a real concern.

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 63.

2 The regulation also affects others within the trucking industry, such as companies that

3 sell or install equipment mandated by Respondents. One representative commented:

4 Collecting additional information and imposing additional certification requirements has several impacts, the first being the additional cost and

5 delay that could result from processing two separate applications for the same engine/vehicle.

6 64. Others within the trucking industry commented:

7

8 Producing 49-state and California vehicles would significantly increase manufacturers' costs โข to develop and deploy PHEVS, and thereby

9 65. undermine the commercial viability of that advanced technology.
Despite being presented with substantial, credible evidence that the Amendments were
10 causing significant economic harm to responsible owners and operators of regulated trucks, staff did

11 not revise the economic impact assessment, or respond to the comments made by the public
12 concerning the immediate economic impacts suffered by trucking companies. Respondents therefore
13 failed to comply with the requirements of Section 11346.3 of the Government Code in a substantial

14 manner.

15 66. Respondents' conduct was a substantial violation of the Government Code, and was
16 prejudicial to the rulemaking process and the interests of Petitioner and other members of the public.

17 Without a full and accurate analysis of the Amendment's impacts on regulated parties, both the Board
18 and the public were denied the ability to evaluate the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA

19 Phase 2's consequences.

20 67.

21 There exists a clear and actual controversy between Petitioner and Respondents arising

22 from Respondents substantial failure to comply with the Government Code, arising from the failure to

23 revise the estimated compliance costs associated with the economic harm experienced by owners and

24 operators of regulated trucks, and circulate the revised analysis for public review.

68. Respondents' conduct violated the Government Code in a substantial manner, and
25 Respondents' substantial failure to perform their duties requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate
26| pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure directing them to discharge their duties.

27 69. Petitioner has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of
28 mandate by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that Petitioner will continue to be adversely

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

affected by Respondents' noncompliance with the Government Code. The substantial failure of
2 Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate
directing them to discharge their duties.

70. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and injunctive relief is
expressly authorized by Sections 526 and 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Fourth Cause of Action - Inverse Condemnation

71. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 1 69 in
8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
72. Respondent CARB a is a government-created entity that has drafted and implemented
10 emissions standards. These, regulations include both the Proposed Amendments, individually, and
11 cumulatively, along with other related regulations affecting the trucking industry, including CARB's
12 Tractor-Trailer Regulation; recent and ongoing amendments to CARB's Truck and Bus Regulation;
13 proposed amendments to CARB's HDVIP and PSIP regulations, which are presently in the
14 rulemaking process; proposed amendments to CARB's HD Warranty regulations, which are presently
15 in the rulemaking process; proposed amendments to CARB's HD OBD regulations, which are
16 presently in the rulemaking process; and anticipated 2019 rulemakings affecting the trucking industry,
17 including Heavy Duty Zero Certification Procedures, EWIR regulations, and amendments to the TRU
18 regulation, which all relate to HD trucks and trailers.

19 73: These regulations have resulted in a taking of property from Lawson, and Lawson has
20 suffered damages in an amount to be proven at the time of trial.
21 74. Respondents have performed actions in the foregoing paragraphs that have damaged
22 Petitioner's property, taking Petitioner's property without consent, prevented Petitioner from having
23  access to or using all of its property, and interfering with Petitioner's investment-backed expectations.
24 75. The actions described herein have injured Petitioner. Respondents have not paid
25 compensation to Petitioner for the damages caused to Petitioner's property that is being taken.

26 76. Petitioner is entitled to compensation from Respondents commensurate with the
27 damages caused to it pursuant to the United States Constitution Fifth Amendment and California
28 Constitution Article 1, Section 19.

{6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 77. Lawson has been required to retain legal counsel to pursue legal redress for
2 Respondents' wrongful conduct. Accordingly, Lawson is entitled to recovery of its attorneys' fees,
3 costs of suit, fees and expenses pursuant to Section 1036 of the Code of Civil Procedure and other
4 applicable laws.

5

6 78. Fifth Cause of Action - Declaratory Relief
Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 76 1 in
7 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

8 79.

9 With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First and Second Causes of Action,
there exists a clear and actual controversy between Lawson and Respondents regarding Respondents'
10 failures to comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and the Board's implementing regulations, and
11

12 Respondents' attempt to implement the Tractor-Trailer Regulation Amendments and CA Phase 2, (1)
without completing environmental review and (2) in a piecemeal fashion. Lawson contends that
13 Respondents have not complied with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and the Board's implementing
14 regulations, while Respondents contend that they have done so.
15 80. To remedy these violations of law, Petitioner requests a declaration of the duties of
16 Respondents under CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations, and a declaration that
17 Respondents have not complied with CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations. Such
18 declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of this Court's power under Section 1060 of the Code of
19

20 Civil Procedure and under Section 11350 of the Government Code, to prevent violation of the

21 Government Code, which requires that all valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with
standards prescribed by other provisions of law," including CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the
22 Board's implementing regulations.

23

24 81. Sixth Cause of Action - Injunctive Relief
Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 79 in
25 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

26 82. With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First through Seventh Causes of
27 Action, and as alleged in the foregoing paragraphs of the Petition, Respondents will continue to
28 proceed in manner that will cause Petitioner harm for which they cannot be fully compensated.

(6063/039/00912904.DOCX} 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INVERSE CONDEMNATION, DECLARATORY RELIEF, AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

83. Petitioner is therefore entitled to permanent injunction pursuant to Sections 525 - 526
2 of the Code of Civil Procedure commanding. Defendants to cease violating CEQA, the CEQA

3 Guidelines and the Board's implementing regulations as detailed above, and to follow the required
4 legal processes for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Regulation,

5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

6 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate under CEQA and the APA, as specified in Lawson's

7 First through Third Causes of Action;

8 2. For damages and just compensation for the taking of property, the precise amount to be
proven at trial, as specified in Lawson's Fourth Cause of Action;

10 3. For declaratory relief under CEQA and the Code of Civil Procedure with respect to the
11 violations of law alleged in Lawson's First through Sixth Causes of Action, as specified in Lawson's
12 Fifth Cause of Action;

13 4. For an injunction restraining the violations of law alleged in Lawson's First through
14 Seventh Causes of Action, and preventing further damage to Lawson's property, as specified in
15 Lawson's Sixth Cause of Action; and

16 5. For fees and costs available under the laws of California, incidental or necessary in

17 procuring the relief sought in Lawson's First through Sixth Causes of Action, including reasonable

18 attorneys' fees pursuant to Sections 1021.5 and 1036 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and for such
19 other relief that the Court deems just and proper under California law.

Petitioner alleges that in connection with their consideration of the proposed amendments to the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Medium- and Heavy-
Duty Engines and Vehicles and the Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse Gas Regulation), Respondents
violated CEQA and other laws by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and by
failing to support their findings by substantial evidence. Respondents' errors under CEQA were a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

Very truly yours, 9EDM John P. Kinsey

RE: Notice of Intent to Sue
Proposed Amendments to the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Medium- and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles and the Tractor-Trailer
Greenhouse Gas Regulation

Dear Members of the Board:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE under Public Resources Code ยง 21167.5, that on Or about January 22, 2019, Petitioner John R. Lawson Rock & Oil, Inc. will file a petition for writ
of mandate in Fresno County Superior Court challenging actions of Respondents the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") and Richard Corey, in his official capacity as Executive Officer of the CARB (collectively "Respondents") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, Section 21000 et seq.

(6063/039/00955715.DOCX)

WANGER JONES HELSLEY PE -
January 18, 2019
Page 2

Petitioners allege that in connection with their consideration of the proposed amendments to the California Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards for Medium- and Heavy- Duty Engines and Vehicles and the Tractor-Trailer Greenhouse Gas Regulation), Respondents violated CEQA and other laws by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and by failing to support their findings by substantial evidence. Respondents' errors under CEQA were a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

Very truly yours,
889 John P. Kinsey
