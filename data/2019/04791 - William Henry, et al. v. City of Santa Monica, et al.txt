W) INTRODUCTION

1. By and through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Request for

a Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), Petitioner WILLIAM HENRY ("Petitioner") challenges the
decision by Respondent CITY OF SANTA MONICA (Respondent") to issue building permits

8 to Real Parties in Interest DAVID VUKADINOVICH AND ELAINE VUKADINOVICH.

9

10 TRUSTEES OF THE VUKADINOVICH FAMILY TRUST DATED AUGUST 16, 2007, as

11 well as THE VUKADINOVICH FAMILY TRUST DATED AUGUST 16, 2007 (collectively!

12 "Real Parties") in connection with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit (*ADU")

13 located at 420 7th Street in Santa Monica, California ("Property"). The building permits

14 authorize Real Parties to construct a two-story ADU.

2.

15

16 Respondent violated Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 9.31.300 et seq,

17 when it approved the ADU and granted the building permits because construction of the ADU

18 does not comply with minimum setbacks requirements and applicable development standards

19 for two-story ADUs contained in the municipal code.

3.

20

21 Respondent also violated Santa Monica Municipal Code Section 9.42 et seq. when

22 it granted the building permits because construction of the ADU does not comply with

23 minimum setbacks requirements and Respondent did not issue a variance excepting Real

Parties in Interest from this requirement.

24 4.

25 Respondent also violated the California Environmental Quality Act (Publid

26

27 Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA") and the State CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs.,

28 tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.) when it issued the building permits. While review of an ADU

procedural requirements of CEQA.

13 extent that it is required to exhaust its remedies.

15.

17 mandatory duty to comply with all local, state, and federal laws, including but not limited to

18 the Santa Monica Municipal Code and CEQA, prior to issuing the approvals at issue in this

19 lawsuit. Petitioner brought this matter to the attention of Respondent, to no avail. Petitioner

20 has no remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this

lawsuit.
21

22

23 16. FULFILLMENT OF CEQA NOTICE REQUIREMENTS

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE §

ET SEQ.) - 5 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000

{ 17. On April 1, 2019, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, Petitionen

7 notice of this Petition and Complaint on the Attorney General regarding this action. A copy

8 of this notice is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

9
RELIEF REOUESTED
10

11 19. Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandamus, temporary and permanent

12 injunctive relief, and costs and attorneys' fees.

13 A. Alternative and Peremptory Writ of Mandamus (Code Civ.Pro., §§ 1085

14 and/or 1094.5, 1087; Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21168.5, 21168.9)
15
20. Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
16
to any inferion 17 section 1085, which provides that mandate "may be issued by any court .

18 tribunal, corporation, board or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law

19 specifically enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station," and the Code of Civil

20 Procedure section 1087, which provides that "[t]he writ may be either alternative or
21
peremptory.
22

23 21. Petitioner also seeks a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Public Resources

24 Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9. The former statute, applicable in traditional mandamus

25 actions involving alleged CEQA violations, provides as follows:

26

27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE § 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000 ET SEQ.) - 6

1. "in any action or proceeding, other than an action or proceeding

2 under 21168, to attack, review, set aside, void or annul a
m t 1 determination, finding or decision of a public agency on the grounds
of nonconformance with CEQA, the inquiry shall extend only to

n whether there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of
N discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner
8 required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported
9
by substantial evidence in the record."
10

11 22. Public Resources Code section 21168.9 authorizes a court, after determining that

12 respondent agency has violated CEQA, to a issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the

13 agency to void or suspend decisions for which CEQA compliance was necessary, or to take
14 other steps necessary to bring its decision into compliance with CEQA. Petitioner requests
15

16 that, pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 21168.9, the Court issue a peremptory writ requiring

17 Respondent to void its approval of the ADU and any other permits issued in reliance on the

18 approval.

19 23. Section 21168.9(b) provides that "[t]he trial court shall retain jurisdiction over the

20 public agency's proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ intil the court has
21 determined that the agency has complied with [CEQA]." 22
24. 23 Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate on the grounds that, by approving

24 the construction of the ADU, without first complying with CEQA, Respondent prejudicially

25 abused its discretion within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

26

27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE § 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000 ET SEQ.) - 7

[ 25. Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate on the grounds that, by approving

3
abused its discretion.
4

7 and Civil Code section 3422, which provide that the Court may issue temporary and/or

8 permanent injunctive relief, including preliminary injunction if the plaintiff or petitioner meets
9
specific criteria.
10

11 27. Respondent's actions result in irreparable harm to Petitioner and the public at large

12 in that approval of the ADU will result in the creation of a public and private a nuisance, and

13 Respondent actions do not consider whether the project results in significant environmental

14 impacts that require mitigation.
15
28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, 16

17 No money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the

18 harms described in this Petition.

19 C. Attorneys' Fees and Costs (Code Civ. Pro., §1032; Gov. Code, § 800.)

20 29. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Government Code section 800, which
21 awards petitioners up to $7,000.00 in attorneys' fees to overturn agency decisions, such as 22

23 those at issues herein, that are arbitrary and capricious.

24 30. Additionally, Petitioner requests costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

25 1032, subdivision (b), which provides that "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,

26 a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in an action or proceeding.'
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE coa 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000 ET SEQ.) - 8

:

31. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

t In June 2018, Respondent Santa Monica City Council approved an ordinance ta
amend the city's Zoning Ordinance regarding standards for ADUs. An ADU is a dwelling unit

6 that provides complete independent living facilities and is located on a parcel with anothen

single-unit dwelling.

- 32.

8 One principal purpose of the ordinance is to allow for an increase in the supply of

10 affordable housing while maintaining the single-unit character of neighborhoods in the city.

11 To achieve this purpose, Respondents adopted development standards for ADUs that require

12 conformance to the height, setback, parcel coverage, and other zoning requirements of the

District in which the ADU is located.

13 33.

14

15 As it relates to ADUs over one story or 14 feet in height, the ordinance modified

16 the Zoning Code to include the requirement that "[a]n ADU may be located in the rear setback

17 but shall be located at least 5 feet from the rear parcel line. The second story portion of an

18 ADU may extend into the required rear setback but shall be no closer than 15 feet from

19 the centerline of the alley or 15 feet from the rear property line." (Santa Monica Municipal

20 Code, Ch. 9.31.300 F (3)(a)(ii), emphasis added.)

34.
21

22 The ordinance also modified the Zoning Code to provide that "[a]n ADU shall have

23 the same minimum side setback requirements as the principal building on the parcel, but in no

24 5 case less than 5 feet." (Santa Monica Municipal Code, Ch. 9.31.300 F (3)(a)(i, F iii).)

35.

25 The ordinance modified the Zoning Code as it relates to the conversion of existing

26 structures to require, "a setback of 5 feet from the side and rear property lines [ .. . ] for an

27

28 ADU that is constructed above garage."(Santa Monica Municipal Code, Ch. 9.31.300 E (1).)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE §

ET SEQ.) - 9 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000

36. Petitioner is informed and believes, and therefore alleges, that Real Party applied

2 to Respondent to construct a two-story ADU on property located at 420 7th Street in Santa
3 Monica, California (the "Project").
4
37. The Project consists of the conversion of an existing garage, located at the rear of 5

6 the property, into the living and kitchen area of an ADU, with the addition of a new second

7 story bedroom and bathroom. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the

8 Project includes raising the existing roof height by 18 inches. The Project has zero setback
9
from the property immediately to its north located at 412 7th Street, and a 5-foot setback from
10

11 the property immediately to its west located at 620 Georgina Ave.

12 38. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in addition to having

13 zero setback from the property located at 412 7th Street, the Project also impermissibly

14 encroaches into the rear yard setback requirement vis-a-vie the property located at 620
15
Georgina, rendering the ADU improper even if it was a one-story project, because as new 16

17 construction it must have at least a 7-foot side yard setback and a 15-foot rear yard setback.

18 39. Despite Respondent's setback requirements for ADUs, Respondent erroneously

19 ministerially approved Real Party's application. Respondent did not make findings supporting

20 a variance from the setback requirements.
N 8 40. Variances are discretionary, requiring CEQA review and Respondent did nor

23 consider whether the Project could have reasonably foreseeable impacts on the environment.

24 nor did it mitigate those potential impacts.

1 41.

2

3

D On or about March 11, 2019, Petitioner observed construction activities at 420 7t

Ur Street and inquired with Real Parties in Interest about the scope of the Project. Petitioner had

42.

6 no prior knowledge or notice of Respondent's or Real Parties in Interest's actions.

7 43. Petitioner immediately contacted Respondent and Real Parties in interest with his

concerns, to no avail.

9 Petition.

= 5 Upon learning details of the Project, Petitioner retained counsel and filed this timely

FIRST CASE OF ACTION

12

13 44. (Violation of the Santa Monica Municipal Code, Chapter 9.31.300)

14 (CCP §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5)

15

16 - through 43 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

45. Petitioner herby realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs

17

18 46. Respondent is required to carry out the obligations it adopts in its Municipal Code.
including the requirement contained in its Zoning Code.

19

20

8 M Respondent's Zoning Code provides that "[a]n ADU may be located in the rean

22 setback but shall be located at least 5 feet from 5 the rear parcel line. The second story portion

23 of an ADU may extend into the required rear setback but shall be no closer than 15 feet from

24 the centerline of the alley or 15 feet from the rear property line." (Santa Monica Municipal
Code, Ch. 9.31.300 F (3)(a)(ii).)

47.

25

26

27 Respondent's Zoning Code also provides that "[a]n ADU shall have the same

28 minimum side setback requirements as the principal building on the parcel, but in no case less
than 5 feet." (Santa Monica Municipal Code, Ch. 9.31.300 F (3)(a)(iii).)

ET SEQ.) - 11 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000

48.

2
UJ Finally, as it relates to the conversion of existing structures, Respondent's Zoning
Code requires, "a setback of 5 feet from the side and rear property lines [.. . ] for an ADU that

49.

a is constructed above a garage." (Santa Monica Municipal Code, Ch. 9.31.300 E (1).)

zero Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in addition to having

c setback from the property located at 412 7th Street, the Project, as new construction, also

9 impermissibly encroaches into the minimum rear yard setback from the property located at 620

10 Georgina and the minimum side yard setback from the property located at 412 7th Street.

11 rendering the ADU improper even if it was a one-story conversion.

50.

12

13 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent
nevertheless approved the Project.

51.

14

15 Respondent acted outside the scope of its jurisdiction and violated its Municipal

16 Code when it approved Real Party's Project because the Project does not comply with

17

18 Respondent's setback requirements. This resulted in a prejudicial abuse of discretion for which

the approval of the ADU must be set aside.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20

21 (Violation of Government Code and Municipal Code, Chapter 9.42 et seq.)

22 52. (CCP §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5)

23

24 53. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs
through 51 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth.

25

26 Government Code section 65906 establishes the authority of the Respondent to

27 grant variances from the development standards and provisions of the Zoning Code in cases

28 where, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, the strict application of the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (CIV. CODE §
ET SEQ.) - 12 3422; CODE OF CIV. PRO. §§ 526, 1032, 1085, 1087, 1094.5; GOV. CODE § 800; PUB. RES. CODE §§ 21000

* : Zoning Code deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and
2 under identical land use zones. (See Santa Monica Municipal Code, Chapter 9.42.010.)
3
54. The Santa Monica Municipal Code sections 9.42.020-9.42.040 set out the
4
requirements, procedures, and required findings for a variance whenever there is a deviation a

6 from development standards of the Zoning Code.

7 55. Respondent approved the Project even though no variance was processed for the

8 Project to except it from the Zoning Code's minimum setback requirements and by failing to
comply with its variance laws, Respondent acted outside its authority and committed 10

11 prejudicial abuse of discretion for which Project approvals must be set aside.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 12

13 (Violation of the CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.)
14 (CCP 8§ 1085 and/or 1094.5)
15
56. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in paragraphs 16

17 1 through 55 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

18 57. Under CEQA, Respondent is required to evaluate whether a project may have

19 reasonably foreseeable impacts on the environment and it must mitigate those impacts to

20 level less than significant. CEQA applies to discretionary approvals.
21
58. Respondent should have denied the Project because it does not comply with the
22

23 ministerial setback requirements proscribed by Respondent's Municipal Code. Instead of

24 approving the Project, Respondent should have processed the project as a discretionary

25 approval and in compliance with CEQA.
