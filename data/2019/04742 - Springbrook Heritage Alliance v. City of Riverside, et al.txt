Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Introduction

2
1. The non-profit Springbrook Heritage Alliance brings this mandamus
3

4 action in the public interest to enforce California's environmental laws. The Alliance

5 challenges the city's refusal to prepare an environmental impact report before approval

6 of a massive 300,000 square-foot warehouse. The 15-acre project site is in the city's
7

8 Ward 1 Northside Neighborhood, next to recreational soccer fields in historic La Placita.

9 The nearby 1862 Trujillo Adobe may be impacted by project-related diesel truck traffic.

10 The Riverside General Plan unequivocally limits warehouse uses at the Business/

11 Office Park site to a maximum of 10,000 square feet. For that reason, as well as the
12

13 project's myriad environmental impacts likely to injure the Northside community,
_-..!.

14 long-term Ward 1 Councilmember Mike Gardner and Ward 2 Councilmember Andy

15 Melendrez passionately urged the City Council to deny approval. The City Council's
16
Land Use Committee had recommended denial based on the environmental issues.
17

18 Manifest evidence in the record supports a requisite low-threshold 'fair

19 argument' that the warehouse project may have significant impacts affecting, inter alia,

20 aesthetics/views, general plan consistency, historic resources, air and water quality,
21

22 ground-borne truck vibrations, and health risks for users of the adjacent Ab Brown

23 Sports Complex. The city must therefore conduct an EIR process before considering

24 project approval. (See Protect Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App. 5th 1129.)
25 The Alliance now seeks this Court's peremptory writ to require the city to set
26

27 aside the project and reconsider approval only if it conducts an EIR process to analyze

28 environmental impacts and identify and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives.

1 Jurisdiction

2
2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and
3

4 CCP section 1094-5. The parties and site are in the County of Riverside.

5 Parties

6
3. Petitioner Springbrook Heritage Alliance is an unincorporated association.
7

8 The Alliance seeks to save the irreplaceable natural, recreation, and historical treasures

9 of the Springbrook Arroyo Watershed. The Alliance opposes the warehouse project due

10 to adverse impacts. Members include community residents and concerned citizens who
11

12 enjoy and appreciate environmental and historical resources in the Northside. The

13 Alliance brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated too numerous to be

14 named and brought before this Court as petitioners. The Alliance objected to the city's
15 approval of the warehouse in light of potentially significant environmental impacts.
16

17 4. Respondent City of Riverside and its City Council (collectively referred to

18 as the city) is the governmental body that approved the Center Street Commerce Center

19 based on a mitigated negative declaration and acted as lead agency under CEQA.
20
5.
21 Real parties in interest Art Day and Transition Properties, LP, are the

22 applicants for the Center Street Commerce Center project.

23 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true

24 names and capacities are currently unknown to petitioner. If and when their true names
25

26 and capacities are known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.

27 7. The paragraphs below rely on information in documents relating to this

28 action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record.

4 Northside Neighborhood, rich in culture and history, initially occupied by Native

5 Americans and then by the Mission San Gabriel Rancho from 1771-1882. Settlements

6 since then include La Placita de los Trujillos in 1843, the Township of San Salvador in

7 1852, Spanish Town in 1870, Pellissier Ranch from 1905-1960, and Northside in 1912. 8

3 Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 9. Real parties applied for discretionary city approvals for design review to

2 construct the Center Street Commerce Center, a 308,000 square-foot warehouse
3

4 building, and a lot line adjustment to consolidate four contiguous parcels into a single

5 15.9-acre parcel bounded by Placentia Lane and Center Street in Ward 1 of the

6 Northside community (the project), within the area depicted on the proposed Trails

7 map. Access to the warehouse is proposed from Center Street, not Placentia Lane. The
8

9 city assigned planning case numbers P14-1033 and P14-1034, respectively.

10 10. The city's Development Review Committee reviewed and approved the

11 project application a based on a mitigated negative declaration. The Alliance appealed the
12

13 Committee's action to the Planning Commission, which held a public hearing in April

14 and denied the appeal. The Alliance appealed the Planning Commission denial to the

15 City Council. That appeal was first considered by the City Council's Land Use

16 Committee in July 2018. Issues in opposition to the project approval and reliance on a
17

18 mitigated negative declaration rather than an EIR were raised relative to, inter alia,

19 aesthetics/views, general plan consistency, flooding and runoff, air and water quality,

20 ground-borne truck vibrations, historic resources, growth-inducement, cumulative

21 impacts, piecemealing and segmentation, impacts on the pending Northside Specific
22

23 Plan including potential rehabilitation of the Trujillo Adobe, and health risks and other

24 impacts on recreation and users of the adjacent Ab Brown Sports Complex. The

25 Committee recommended that the City Council uphold the appeal.
26
11. The City Council considered the appeal at a well-attended public hearing in
27

28 October 2018 and then continued its decision to December. At the December hearing,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 members of the Alliance and many concerned citizens appeared and objected to the

2 project approval and to the city's reliance on a mitigated negative declaration rather an
3

4 EIR process. Many speakers spoke about the unstudied cumulative environmental

5 impacts of the proposed warehouse in combination with huge warehouse projects in

6 neighboring cities, including just across Center Street in Colton. Councilmembers

7 Gardner and Melendrez urged the Council to uphold the Alliance appeal due to the
8

9 environmental issues raised, and in particular the direct conflict between the site's

10 General Plan limitation of warehouse size to 10,000 square feet and the Zoning Code's

11 inconsistent allowance of up to 400,000 square feet.

12
12. The City Council approved the project and mitigated negative declaration
13

14 at the close of the December hearing, with Councilmembers Gardner and Melendez

15 opposed. The Council majority stressed the economic benefits of the project.

16 13. The city filed a Notice of Determination on December 13, 2018. This action
17

18 is timely filed on the first court day after the close of the 30-day statute of limitations.

19 14. The Alliance served a copy of this petition on the Attorney General.

20 15. The Alliance has no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief prayed for in

21 this petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and irreversible
22

23 environmental impacts to the city's environment and residents. The city can correct its

24 violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

25

26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

16. The Alliance incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

4 17. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

5 law in approving the warehouse project based on a mitigated negative declaration.

6 According to proof following certification of the record of proceedings:
7

8 a. The city unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant environmental

9 impacts without preparing an EIR to inform its discretion. The record contains
substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of potentially significant
11 environmental impacts, including, inter alia according to proof following the

13 certification of the record: aesthetics/views, general plan consistency, flooding
and runoff, air and water quality, ground-borne truck vibrations, historic and
15
16 cultural resources, growth-inducement, cumulative impacts in combination with

17 other warehouse projects, piecemealing and segmentation, inadequate project

18 description, impacts on the pending Northside Specific Plan including the

19 potential rehabilitation of the Trujillo Adobe, and health risks and other impacts

20 on recreation and users of the adjacent Ab Brown Sports Complex.
21

22 b. The city failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence in the record.

23

24 WHEREFORE, the Alliance prays:

25 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City of

26 Riverside to set aside and void all approvals relating to the Center Street Commerce

27 Center project and to refrain from further consideration of project approval until it fully
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 complies with CEQA by preparing an adequate EIR and adopting feasible altérnatives

2 and mitigation measures for project consistent with the General Plan;
3
2. That the Court enjoin the city and real parties in interest and their
4

5 employees and agents from all construction activities relating to the project while the

6 petition is pending;

7
3. For the Alliance's costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
8

9 Procedure section 1021.5; and

10 4. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
