ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the decision of the East Bay Regional Park District
3 ("Respondent" or "EBRPD") to approve the Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline Land Use Plan
4| Amendment ("Project") and certify the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for
the Project. The Project involves the redevelopment of a portion of an existing park in Contra
Costa County, including an extension of the San Francisco Bay Trail (*Trail") within the Project

7 planning area for the Miller/Knox Regional Park ("Park"). Many features of the Project are likely

8 to be of benefit to the users of the Park, and BNSF Railway Company ("Petitioner" or "BNSF")
does not oppose the overall goal of redeveloping and improving the Park, including an

10 appropriately located extension of the Trail within the Park. However, the Respondent has decided

11 that it must locate the Trail directly on top of an active, jurisdictional rail line owned by the
12 Petitioner, and has explicitly refused to consider any alternatives to this track location. Respondent
13 l also does not want to acknowledge that the railroad has the right to, and will continue to operate

14 within the Park, as it has done so for many decades, when required by Petitioner's Port of
15 Richmond shipping volumes.

16 2. By not evaluating the existing jurisdictional rail line within the Project area, the
17 Park has disregarded its obligations under CEQA, and is not acting in the best interest of its
18 constituents. Respondent was required to evaluate the features and proposed uses of the Park with

19 the existing rail line as the baseline.

20 3. Petitioner has the largest freight railroad network in North America, and is proud of
21 its long and productive operating history in the City of Richmond, including in the planning area
22 of the Project. Petitioner, including its predecessor, the Atchison Topeka Santa Fe Railroad, has

23 conducted railroad operations on Ferry Point, the location of the Project, since before 1900.
24 Today, the nearby Richmond Rail Yard, including Ferry Point within the Park District's planning

25 area, remains the terminus of BNSF's transcontinental rail service. The rail line at issue is the only
26 presently identified logistical option for assembling the largest rail cars that are an essential link in
27 BNSF's Port of Richmond rail service operations, and for interstate and indeed global commerce.

LEWIS 28
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 2
& SMITH UP
AITORNEYS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Without this rail line remaining operational, BNSF's common carrier obligations and interstate
2 commerce will be substantially impacted.

4. For many decades, BNSF has been an essential contributor to the successful
4 development of the Park. Petitioner's predecessor company built the land mass and provided

5 much of the area now comprising the Park. The one constant since the Park was first

6 conceptualized was the need for the Park and railroad operations to co-exist, as they successfully

7 have done for decades. Assisting in development of the Park was important for BNSF as a good

8 corporate citizen, but so was the need to preserve the railroad operations of BNSF's Richmond

terminal.

10 5. Today, BNSF owns a rail line at the Park on property it owns in fee extending west

11 from Dornan Tunnel to approximately Milepost 1191. From the end of this fee interest and
12 proceeding west to a point beyond the end of the Miller/Knox lagoon, BNSF owns a right-of-way

13 easement.

14 6. While Petitioner has not recently operated trains within this easement area, it has
15 notified the Park District of its expanding business at Richmond Terminal related to shipments for
16 Tesla Automotive, Honda and Kia, and other local industrial customers, necessitating the use of its

17 rail corridor within the easement in the near future. The Respondent has deliberately not engaged
18 with the Petitioner or the required regulatory authorities to find out the facts of this future rail
19 service, despite years of request from the Respondent for a dialogue.

20 7. Indeed, in a spirit of continued cooperation, the Petitioner has offered to work with

21 the Respondent on a proposed Joint Use Plan for the Park as relates to the Project, such that the
22 rail line would be relocated away from the shoreline, but still within the Project planning area, to
23 allow improved access to the coast for the Park users, as a well as a connection for the Trail through
24 the Project area. This proposal has been flatly rejected by the Respondent, and the Respondent
25 further refused to even consider this as an alternative to the Project in the EIR.

26 8. As the facts reveal, Respondent cannot blithely state that the railroad in the middle

27 of the proposed Trail, the central feature of the redeveloped Park, doesn't matter under CEQA or

LEWIS 28 California laws on land use planning. The Draft EIR states:
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 3
& SMITH LIP
AITORNEYS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

t
C "ATSF currently maintains ownership of the abandoned railroad track located upon District-owned property. Removal of the railroad tracks and development of section of the San Francisco Bay Trail

un within District jurisdiction was approved by voters for the District's Measure CC in 2004; however, ATSF has been unwilling to allow for removal to date. The LUPA recommendation acknowledges

6 the voter-approved project and assumes that the District will successfully resolve the current impediment to remove the abandoned railroad track.

7 9. (Emphasis added)

8 Respondent was required to both study the significant environment effects of the
continued existence of the rail line within the Park, and the environmentally superior alternative of
9 BNSF's proposed Joint Use It Plan. It did neither.

10 10.

11 Further, contrary to its obligations under the City of Richmond's General Plan,
State planning laws, and the requirements of CEQA, Respondent refused to even consider what
12 potentially significant environmental and planning consequences that would occur if its unfounded
13 assumptions are indeed correct, and the rail line which is necessary to the Petitioner's rail
14 operations is in fact relocated to another nearby location to serve the Richmond terminal.
15 Respondent was required to consult with state regulatory and regional planning authorities
16 pursuant to CEQA's requirements, and it failed to do so.

17 11. Respondents' approval of the Project was therefore in violation of the California
18 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., the CEQA
19 Guidelines, title 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the State Planning and
20 Zoning Law, Government Code § 65300 et seq.

21 12. Because of its refusal to consider and deal with the existence of the railroad line in
22 its planning area, Respondents prepared and relied on an EIR that falls well below CEQA's
23 minimum standards.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P 13. Petitioners request that this Court vacate and set aside the Project and related
2 approvals and the certification of the EIR because Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and
3 applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.

4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 14. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil

6 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 187, and 526, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168

7 and 21168.5.

8 15. This Court has a the authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the Respondent to
9 vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and certification of the EIR for the Project under
10 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

11 16. Venue for this action properly lies in the Contra Cost Superior Court because
12 Respondents and the Project are located in Contra Costa County and the Notice of Determination

13 in regard to the Project was filed and posted in Contra Costa County.

14 THE PARTIES

15 17. Petitioner BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY, is a Delaware company in good
16 standing in the State of California, and owns in fee simple a portion of a rail line within the Project
17 planning area, and has a superior easement right to use other land underlying the rail line within
18 the Project planning area. This property is in Contra Costa County.,

19 18. The LUPA and the EIR states in several locations that the rail line will be removed

20 once the Respondent East Bay Regional Park District obtains title to the property owned by
21 BNSF, or once the easement over another portion of the the Property is extinguished.

22 19. BNSF would be directly, adversely and irreparably affected by the Project and its
23 components, as described herein, unless and until this Court provides the relief prayed for in this

24 Petition.

25 20. Respondent EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT is a local governmental
26 agency and political subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to regulate

27 and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and

LEWIS 28 limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA and the CEQA

1 Guidelines, and Planning and Zoning Laws. The Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA for
2 the preparation of the EIR and for the approval of the Project.

3 21. The Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Does
4 through 18, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious names. Does 1 through
5 20, inclusive, are agents of the East Bay Regional Park District, municipal government, state, or

6 federal government who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition,
7 or other persons or entities presently unknown to the Petitioner who claim some legal or equitable

8 interest in the Project that is the subject of this action. The Petitioner will amend this petition to

9 show the true names and capacities of Does 1 through 20 when such names and capacities become

10 known.

11 22. The Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties
12 in Interest, Does 21 through 50, inclusive. Does 21 through 50, inclusive, are persons or entities
13 presently unknown to the Petitioner who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that

14 is the subject of this action. The Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true names and
15 capacities of Does 21 through 50 when such names and capacities become known.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 Authorized Rail Service is the Baseline of Activity in the Project Area

18 23. The EIR cannot ignore immutable facts on the ground that contradict false
19 assumptions at the core of the Project. These facts render EBRPD's "assumption" that it will
20 acquire the easement from BNSF unfounded, which in turn fundamentally and impermissibly

21 undermines the EIR's evaluation of the environmental effect of the proposed development of the

22 Bayshore Planning Area.

23 24. Respondent admits in its EIR, as well as in the response to comments, that is does
24 not have the present legal right to develop the Project because BNSF has superior easement rights

25 over that land. (See EIR at p. 3-20.) Yet, Respondent "assumes" that it will prevail in litigation
26 against the BNSF to acquire property needed for its proposed LUPA. Consequently, Respondent
27 commenced court action in 2017 to try to terminate BNSF's superior rights. (See Contra Costa

LEWIS 28| Superior Court case no. C17-01959.) In that lawsuit, EBRPD alleges two grounds in support of its
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 6
& SMIH LLP
ATIONNEYS AI LAS VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 position that BNSF's easement has terminated: (a) BNSF has not used the property for more than
2  20 years and, therefore, has abandoned it pursuant to California Civil Code section 887.010 et.
3 seq. (*statutory abandonment"); and (b) BNSF has discontinued rail service to Petromark, Ford

4 and other shippers upon the property covered by the easement and, therefore, a remote portion of
5 the easement has terminated in accordance with the terms of the written easement reservation

6 (contract termination"). Both contentions are based on demonstrably false factual predicates.

7 25. Under 49 U.S.C. section 10501, the federal Surface Transportation Board ("STB")
8 has exclusive jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier, including the movement of goods and
9 all services related to that movement. Its remedies are exclusive and expressly preempt state

10 remedies "with respect to regulation of rail transportation." (Id., § 10501(b).) The United States
11 Supreme Court held that it is within the "exclusive and plenary nature" of the STB's authority to

12 rule on carriers' decisions to abandon lines, and this federal preemption of local authority is

13 critical to the statute, which contemplates comprehensive administrative regulation of interstate
14 commerce. Chicago & North Western Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick & Tile Co. (1981) 450 U.S. 311,
15 321. Courts that have looked at this preemption of local land use authority have generally opined
16 that "it is difficult to imagine a broader statement of Congress' intent to preempt state regulatory
17 authority over railroad operations." CSX Transp.. Inc. v. Georgia Pacific Service Comm., 944 F.
18 Supp. 1573, 1581 (N.D. Ga. 1996). The rail lines in question are under STB jurisdiction and the

19 Respondent has never petitioned the STB for abandonment, and the STB has not determined that
20 the rail line in issue is abandoned.

21 26. Moreover, the uncontroverted deposition testimony of the Manager for BNSF's
22 Richmond Terminal, Anthony Fowler, establishes that, as late as 2006, BNSF was operating trains
23 within the easement area. Consequently, even if not preempted, EBRPD could not prevail on its
24 statutory abandonment claim under state law because it is an undisputed fact that BNSF was using
25 the easement area within the 20-year period immediately preceding EBRPD's lawsuit.

26 27. Respondent's contract termination theory similarly fails because, even if the
27 conditions for termination under the 1991 Stipulated Judgment have been met, only a small,

LEWIS 28  remote section of the easement would terminate. BNSF's casement over most of the Bayshore
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 7
& SMITH LIP
AITORNEYS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Planning Area would remain fully in place, and it would continue to own property necessary for
2 the project in fee. The 1991 Stipulated Judgement provided in pertinent part, as follows:

3 "Park District shall grant Santa Fe an easement for railroad purposes . so long as Santa

4 Fe's railroad operation serves Petromark, Ford or other shippers, pursuant to paragraph 5.2 of the Option Agreement Park District shall retain all of the rights set forth in paragraph 5.2, 5.2(a) and 5.2(b) of the Option Agreement, with respect to, inter alia,
5 termination of that easement ...

6 Section 5.2(b) of the Option Agreement provides in pertinent part:

7 "[U]pon the permanent cessation of and abandonment of rail service to Petromark

8 and Ford Motor Company and any other shippers for whom such facilities are utilized, which Seller shall implement upon the absence of sufficient need to provide rail service consistent with its common carrier
9 obligations, Seller's easement shall be extinguished to such property beginning approximately 400

10 feet beyond the railroad west switch of the storage tracks shown on Attachment B."

11 (Emphasis added.)

12 28. Respondent is well aware of the foregoing provisions, and the fact that the 1991
13 Stipulated Judgment only provides for partial termination of the easement, if at all. Even if
14 EBRPD can establish the conditions for termination have occurred, the easement only would
15 terminate outside most of the Miller/Knox LUPA Bayshore Planning Area. The critical area
16 needed by EBRPD to achieve the Miller/Knox LUPA objective of building an uninterrupted
17 section of the Bayshore Trail connecting to Keller Beach would remain firmly under BNSF's
18 control, regardless of the outcome of EBRPD's present litigation against BNSF.

19 29. Respondent's fallback position is its assumption that, if all else fails, it will acquire
20 BNSF's easement by eminent domain. (Final PEIR, p. 2-29) This unsupported assumption is
condemn a rail line under 21 similarly factually and legally baseless. Respondent has no power to
22 federal jurisdiction. Further, under California law, Petitioner has the right to condemn property for
23 its rail use, and has every intention of maintaining ownership of the rail line. Condemnation of
24 BNSF's property would materially interfere with BNSF's future ability to conduct its operations.
25 The easement is the only present option for staging or building long trains at the Richmond Yard
26 that will be necessary for handling the Richmond terminal's expanded business.

27 30. It is well established, based on multiple federal court and STB decisions, that

LEWIS 28 condemnation is a form of regulation, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 8
& SMTH LIP
ATORIETS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Act of 1995 therefore preempts state and local condemnation actions that would unreasonably

2 interfere with rail operations. (See, e.g., Union Pac. R. Co. V. Chicago Transit Auth., 647 F.3d

3 675, 679 (7th Cir. 2011) ["A condemnation is a peculiar type of regulation, one specifically
limited in scope to the ownership or use of one particular piece of property."]; City of Lincoln v.
5 Surface Transp. Bd., 414 F.3d 858, 858 (8th Cir. 2005) [affirming STB conclusion that ICCTA

7 Norfolk S. Ry. Co. & the Alabama Great S. R.R. Co. Petition for Declaratory Order, FD 35196,
8 2010 WL 691256, at *3 (Feb. 26, 2010) ["Condemnation can be a form of regulation, and using

9 state eminent domain law to condemn railroad property or facilities for another use that would
10 conflict with the rail use is exercising control--the most extreme type of control-over rail
11 transportation as it is defined in 49 U.S.C. § 10102(9)."])

12 31. There is nothing in the EIR or the LUPA, or in EBRPD's response to BNSF's
13 comments objecting to the EIR, controverting the foregoing facts and law and, hence, the EIR
14 must treat them as part of the factual baseline for its evaluation.
15 The EIR fails to analyze General Plan land use and transportation policies which are

16 implicated in regard to significant environmental impacts from shifted railroad operations.

17 32. 14 California Code of Regulations Section 15125(d) provides that EIRs
18 must discuss any inconsistencies between a proposed project and the applicable General

19 Plan adopted by the City of Richmond. The EIR fails to analyze whether and to what
20 extent the Project is inconsistent with important goals and policies contained in the General
21 Plan, including but not limited to Land Use and Urban Design, and Transportation and
22 Circulation. It does not recognize or evaluate the adverse impacts that stem from such

23 inconsistencies.

24 33. The City of Richmond General Plan calls for balancing railroad and other land
25 uses, including parks. These provisions require an analysis by the Park District of environmental
26 impacts associated with shifting rail service from the Park where it has been operating for over
27 100 years. For example, the Richmond General Plan states:

LEWIS 28
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1 9
& SMATH LLP
ATTORHEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Goods Movement. The Port and industrial areas of the City provide a significant source of employment and revenue to Richmond and a serve a major role in the regional economy, An efficient, safe and reliable system for goods movement via trucks and railroads is an important part of Richmond's circulation
network. Preventing confliets between Richmond's goods movement operations and surrounding uses is a top priority. (City of Richmond General Plan, Circulation Element, p. 4.10)
(Emphasis added.)
The EIR does not address any conflicts between the proposed project and goods movement
operations that BNSF has stated will be impacted.

8 34. The Transportation and Circulation Element also highlights the City of
9 Richmond's understanding of the importance of evaluating conflicts between land uses

10 where the movement of goods are involved to minimize environmental impacts:

11 "Several other locations in Richmond present train vehicle conflict issues due

12 to inherent difficulties with vehicle traffic flow, train movements and sensitive nearby land uses. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates an average of 20 trains
13 per day with train lengths varying from 10 to 100 cars. On the tracks north of

14 Garrard Boulevard, trains travel up to 55 miles per hour (mph); on tracks west and south of Garrard Boulevard, trains travel 10 mph."
15 (ld. p. 4.11) (Emphasis added.) As such, shifting railroad activity to another location near
16 the BNSF Richmond terminal has potentially significant environmental impacts that must

17 l be considered.

18 35. The City of Richmond General Plan's Findings and Goals regarding
19 Transportation and Circulation are also at issue based upon this analysis and emphasize the
20 need for "coordinated planning approach" that the Park District is here avoiding:

21 Trails and Greenway Program. Expand multi-use trails and greenways in the

22 City. Provide connector trails and linkages to improve access from neighborhoods in Central Richmond to the regional open space in the hills and along the shoreline. Address barriers such as freeways, the Richmond Parkway and railroad tracks that
23 limit shoreline access. ..

24 "Finding 4: Richmond relies on efficient and effective goods movement to support

25 economic development opportunities in industrial areas, but noise, air quality and traffic safety remain concerns. Maintaining efficient goods movement throughout Richmond is essential to the City's economic vitality. However, impacts due to
26 diesel emissions, especially in relation to quality of life in residential areas and

27 sensitive uses such as hospitals and schools have prompted residents to raise concerns about long-term impacts. Goods movement can be improved by: promoting a coordinated planning approach that emphasizes the efficient
LEWIS 28 movement of goods without compromising safety; and .,.

11 over the easement area as it has done over the past 100 years. The EIR is not compliant
12 with CEQA it because it pointedly does not evaluate at all the potential conflicts with the
13 Richmond General Plan of displaced railroad operations, Put another way, if the rail line

14 is lost here, BNSF will need to replace it elsewhere.

15 37. Displaced railroad operations, and the related environmental impacts which
16 would a be quite significant, is a foreseeable potentially significant environmental impact
17 that the Park District should have evaluated in and of itself. Moreover, this foreseeable
18 change in the environment should have been evaluated for consistency with the City of
19| Richmond's General Plan.

20 38. The Park District must also evaluate the cumulative impacts related to the

21 displaced railroad operations. Requiring BNSF to shift the tracks to a new location, or
22 causing inefficient rail operations resulting from BNSF not having the easement area for
23 rail operations, will cause potentially significant environment impacts that are inconsistent
24 with the City's General Plan. Again, the Park District certainly cannot determine such
25 impacts are not significant without analysis. The foregoing issues require significant
26 additional analysis and recirculation of the Draft EIR.

27 39. In addition, the manner in which the Park District has disregarded the joint

LEWIS 28 use plan that would allow BNSF to shift its current rail line configuration away from the

P shoreline is inconsistent with the City of Richmond's General Plan. The General Plan
2 states the following further relevant Goals and Policies:
Policy LU4.1 Richmond Shoreline. Minimize the impacts of development on the shoreline with special attention to intensity, density, and proximity to the water. 4 Conserve, protect and enhance natural and cultural resources along the Richmond shoreline. Promote a balance of uses along the shoreline that supports multiple 5 community needs such as economic development, job creation, renewable energy generation, recreation, historic preservation and natural resource protection. .. 6

7 Policy LU5.3 Land Use Compatibility. Minimize conflicts between land uses to protect wetlands, marshlands, and creeks, human and environmental health and 8 safety, preserve community character and retain job generating activities that have long-term viability. Types, intensities and ranges of use and development should be C compatible with existing uses and should minimize or eliminate conflicts that adversely impact wetlands, marshlands, creeks, mudflats, public safety, human or 10 environmental health or generate nuisances. All new development must avoid or mitigate to the greatest extent feasible potential negative impacts such as noise, 11 odors, and pollution. Consistent with the City's Industrial Buffer Zone Ordinance, prohibit the location of residential uses in the area between Harbour Way South and 12 Marina Way South and between Interstate 580 and Hall Avenue.
13 (City of Richmond General Plan, Land Use and Urban Design Element, pp. 3.62, 3.63,
14 3.70.) From these passages it is clear the City of Richmond's Land Use and Urban Design
15 Element of the General Plan requires consideration of the joint use plan which would result
16 in the Park District successfully increasing shoreline access by repositioning the rail line
17 further away from the immediate shore. The EIR is fatally flawed for not considering this
18 alternative in this context as well.

19 40. Also, the City of Richmond General Plan states in the Land Use and Urban
20 Design Element that movement of goods is to be supported with an effort to minimize
21 impacts to the City's other land uses:

22 "Policy CR4.1 Goods Movement, Promote the safe and efficient movement of goods to support Port of Richmond operations and industrial uses. Providing 23 adequate infrastructure improvements and maintenance will support industrial operations while minimizing impacts on neighborhoods and other sensitive land 24 uses. Policy CR4.2 Port of Richmond Operations. Develop long-term strategies and plans that will support efficient operation of the Port by increasing throughput 25 of goods and raw materials."
26 (Richmond General Plan, Circulation Element, p. 4.39) This means that the Park District
27 was required to consider the impacts of its proposed action to shift rail activities outside

the present location, and more specifically the impacts that such a shift would have in the

2 vicinity of the Richmond terminal and the planning area.

3 41. Further, CEQA and the Richmond General Plan also require the Park
District to coordinate with agencies that have transportation planning authority such as the
5 Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.
6 The Park District did not do so as part of its environmental review.

7 "Action CR4.A Goods Movement Plan. Work with business operators to develop and regularly update a citywide goods movement plan to integrate Port operations,
8 rail movement and truck routes, provide a high level of goods movement capacity to serve all land uses in Richmond, and promote adoption of cleaner technology
9 and fuels. Include strategies that will improve level of service while minimizing

10 health, safety and nuisance impacts. Identify priority improvements such as grade separation and safety improvements for at-grade railroad crossings to reduce conflicts between different modes of travel. Collaborate with truck and railroad
11 operations, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) to develop the plan. Consider future expansion
12 plans at ports in Richmond and Oakland. Coordinate with the Metropolitan

13 Transportation Commission (MTC) to plan for potential additional track capacity in Richmond. Through cooperative planning, ensure that track capacity expansion in Richmond is accompanied by safety improvements including grade separation at
14 crossings that carry high traffic, pedestrian and/or bicycle volumes, or have high accident rates. Include enforcement and education measures to ensure compliance
15 with rail crossing traffic control devices and right-of-way rules. Action CR4.B Truck Routes Plan Work with business operators and other stakeholders to re-route
16 diesel trucks away from neighborhood streets and sensitive uses such as homes,

17 schools, parks and playgrounds to minimize impacts from emissions and traffic conflicts. The Plan should specifically ensure that the most efficient and direct

18 routes do not negatively impact low-income residents or communities of color disproportionately more than any other groups in terms of noise, air quality or safety. Collaborate with the community representatives, Port, truck operators, local
19 businesses and regional and state transportation agencies to develop the new routes through port and industrial areas. Avoid land uses that place the construction of
20 new residential dwelling units near major industrial truck facilities. . .

21 Action LU3.H Industrial Lands Retention and Consolidation. Ensure that industrial uses are consolidated around rail and port facilities and work with
22 existing industrial operators, economists and commercial brokers to remain informed about the future demand for industrial land.

42. The EIR's assumption that there will not be rail service in the planning area
26 is defective for the additional reason that there is no discussion of the relation of the
27 existing rail line and easement to the BNSF rail hub in Richmond, which is a critical aspect

1 of the Richmond terminal. This is required by CEQA and the City's General Plan, There is
2 no mention of consultation with the MTC or the CPUC by the Park District. The multi-
3 modal facilities at the Richmond terminal are an essential link in intrastate, interstate and

4 international commerce, allowing the importation and export of goods from across the
5 globe. BNSF has stated that the continued existence of this rail line (at the present location

6 or the proposed join use location) is essential to the railroad's planned expansion for
7 additional import of vehicles and vehicle parts from companies such as Kia, Honda and
8 Tesla. Without this track which will allow switching and loading of rail cars at the BNSF

9 Richmond rail hub, BNSF will be forced to acquire other property near the Richmond
10 terminal which will have potentially significant environmental impacts that must be
11 analyzed.

12 43. The Park District, by not consulting with the railroad or the appropriate
13 regional planning and regulatory agencies, has not considered important issues related to
14 its proposed project and has not informed relevant stakeholders regarding these potentially
15 significant environmental impacts and cumulative impacts, These flaws render the Draft
16 EIR legally deficient.

17 Project Environmental Review and Approval

18 44. The subject of this action is the Land Use Plan Amendment for the Miller/Knox
19 Regional Park.

20 45. Miller/Knox is located at 900 Dornan Drive in the southwestern portion of the City
21| of Richmond. Miller/Knox is bounded by the San Francisco Bay to the west along the length of
22 the park's bay shoreline and to the south at Ferry Point. Industrial uses associated with Port
23 Richmond are located east of Miller/Knox.

24 46. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project was issued on June 26, 2017.
25 The Draft EIR was released on September 4, 2018 with the corresponding public comment period
26 ending October 19, 2018. The Draft EIR proposed to implement a Land Use Pian Amendment
27 (LUPA) for the Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline (Miller/Knox or park) which would direct the

LEWIS 28  short- and long-term use, development, and management of Miller/Knox. The proposed LUPA

AIORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 comprises recommendations specific to five planning areas within Miller/Knox. With respect to

2 the Bay Shore Planning Area, the Draft EIR contemplated a Project involving the removal of
3 railroad tracks within District Jurisdiction and development of a section of the San Francisco Bay
4 Trail between Keller Beach and Ferry Point. The EIR concluded Project impacts related to the

5 Cultural and Tribal Cultural Resources would remain significant after all feasible mitigation was
6 adopted.

7 47. The EIR also determined that the impacts to aesthetics, biological resources,
8 cultural resources, hydrology and water quality, geology and soils, noise and vibration,
transportation and circulation, and air quality were potentially significant but could be mitigated
10 below a level of significance. Despite substantial evidence to the contrary, the EIR found no other

11 impacts potentially significant, including impacts related to land use plan consistency and
12 resulting from shifted railroad operations.

13 48. Petitioner submitted extensive written comments on the Draft EIR identifying the
14 legal inadequacies of the document. These comments included, but were not limited to, the

15 following:

16 a. The Draft EIR fails to provide an accurate project description on which to base

17 the EIR's analysis by falsely assuming no rail activity at Ferry Point.

18 b. The Draft EIR's alternatives analysis is deficient since it failed to consider the

19 BNSF's Joint Use Plan alternative.

20 C. The Draft EIR failed to identify and adequately analyze numerous potentially

21 significant environmental and cumulative impacts related to conflicts between

22 an active and jurisdictional rail line use and the proposed park purposes.

23 d. The Draft EIR failed to adequately analyze and mitigate Project impacts to

24 historical resources.

25 e. The Draft EIR was So fundamentally flawed as to preclude meaningful public

26 review, and thus should have been revised and recirculated.

27 49. Respondents did not recirculate a revised Draft EIR. Instead, Respondents prepared

LEWIS 28 responses to comments and published a Final EIR on or around March 19, 2019.

ANIONNEYS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

50. Petitioner submitted comments on the FEIR which again pointed to the EIR's
inadequate project description, inconsistency with the applicable General Plan, cumulative effects,

3 failure to consult with required regulatory agencies, analysis of the Project's impacts, failure to

4 adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce Project impacts, and failure to discuss reasonable

5 project alternatives.

51. On February 7, 2019, the Executive Committee of the East Bay Regional Park
7| District Board of Directors held a meeting regarding the Project. The Project was further

8 considered at the February 25, 2019 Park Advisory Committee meeting. On March 19, 2019, the
9 Board of Directors held a meeting to certify the EIR and adopt the LUPA. On at least two

10 occasions prior to the March 19, 2019 meeting, Petitioner alerted Respondents to the inadequacy
11 of its EIR analysis, given its real property rights and intention to continue operation of the BNSF
12 rail line, and requested the Park District to address the issue. The Park District's response to
13 comments was dismissive and entirely inadequate.

14 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15 52. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written
16 comments on the Project to Respondents to request compliance with CEQA including the
17 completion of full and adequate environmental review, and compliance with Planning and Zoning
18 Law. All issues raised in this petition were raised before Respondents by the Petitioner, other

19 members of the public, or public agencies prior to approval of the Project.

20 53. The Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior
21 service of a notice upon the Park District indicating their intent to file this Petition. Proof of
22 Service of this notification, with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

23 54. The Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-

ATTONHEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 55. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
2 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112. 35. Respondents have abused their discretion and
3 failed to act as required by law in the following ways:
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)

6 56. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
7 above.

8 57. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the
requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on
10 the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient
11 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
12 consequences when acting on proposed projects.

13 58. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate
14 and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondent: a. Failed to provide an
15 adequate description of the environmental setting or "baseline" for analysis of the Project's
16 environmental impacts; b. Failed to provide a stable and consistent description of the Project; C.
17 Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's significant impacts on the environment,
18 including but not limited to, the Project's impacts on land use and planning, traffic, air quality,
19 aesthetics and public services and utilities; d. Failed to adequately analyze the significant
20 cumulative and growth-inducing impacts of the Project; e. Improperly deferred impact analysis
21 and mitigation measures; f. Failed to adequately mitigate Project impacts; and g. Failed to
22 consider a reasonable range of alternatives.

23 59. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
24| by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance
25 thercon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be
26| set aside.
27 Inadequate Description of the Environmental Setting

LEWIS 28
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1
& SMITH UP 17

OINEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

60. 14 California Code of Regulations Section Sec. 15125 requires that EIRs "must
include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as
3 they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is
4| published, at the time environmental analysis is commenced, from both a local and regional
5 perspective."

6 61. The subject EIR failed to include an adequate description of the Project's
7 environmental setting in that it failed to discuss the existence of BNSF's railroad line located

8 within the Project planning area. The required environmental analysis under CEQA regarding the
impacts on members of the public who may use the proposed Park with the new LUPA includes a
10 project description that includes the presence of an active rail line.

11 62. These failures precluded the EIR from meaningfully analyzing the impacts of the
12 Project on the existing environmental setting which necessarily includes the BNSF railroad line
13 and deprived the public, including petitioners of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on the
14 Project and its impacts on the existing environment.

15 63. The inadequate Project description also prevented the public from fairly evaluating
16 presently available alternatives, such as the Joint Use Plan, that would produce a better
17 environmental outcome than the option selected by the Respondent, which is legally infeasible.
18 Inadequate Project Description

19 64. Public Resources Code Sections 21151 and 21065 and 14 California Code

20 of Regulations Section 15378(a) requires that EIRs fully disclose and analyze projects,

21 meaning "the whole of an action." In addition, according to 14 California Code of
22 Regulations Section 15378(c), " 'Project' does not mean each separate government

23 approval."

24 65. An integral part of the Project concerns the existing BNSF railroad line. The
25 EIR does not consider its continued existence let alone describe the scope of any relocation
26 that may become necessary, its impacts, or any way to mitigate those impacts.

27 66. The EIR improperly defers environmental assessment of a Project with an

LEWIS 28 active rail line based upon false assumption that if it is wrong it can merely evaluate actual
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1
& SMITH LIP 18

ANORNETS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

feasible alternatives under subsequent environmental review, even though it has been made
aware of the defects presently.

3 67. These deficiencies and shifts in the Project description deprived the public,
4 including Petitioner of an opportunity to understand and meaningfully comment on the
5 Project and its impacts, and rendered the analyses in the EIR of the Project and its impacts

6 inadequate.
Inadequate Evaluation of Project Impacts

8 68. Public Resources Code Section 21100(a) and 14 California Code of Regulations
9 Sections 15126(a) and 15126.2 provide that an EIR must identify and focus on the significant
10 environmental effects of a proposed project, giving due consideration to both short- and long-term
11 effects. 14 California Code of Regulations Section 15151 provides that an EIR must contain a
12 "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers with information which allows them to
13 make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences."

14 69. The subject EIR fails to adequately consider the significant impacts of the
15 Project including but not limited to in the manner identified in this Petition.
16 Failure to Analyze Growth Inducing Impacts

17 70. Public Resources Code Section 21100 (g) and 14 California Code of
18 Regulations Section 15126(g) also require that an EIR must disclose and analyze a
19| project's growth inducing impacts. The subject EIR fails to adequately consider the growth
20| inducing impacts of the Project or of the extension of public services necessary to serve the
21 Project, or the impacts of shifted rail service upon nearby growth.
22 Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts

23 71. 14 California Code of Regulations Section 15130 also specifically requires
24 that an EIR must discuss significant cumulative impacts in conjunction with other planned
25 or proposed projects. The subject EIR violates CEQA in that it does not adequately discuss
26 cumulative impacts of the proposed Project in connection with other development projects
27 which are foreseeable, including the expansion or relocation of the BNSF railroad line, if

LEWIS 28

& SMITH LIP 19

AIIORNEYS AL LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

necessary, in order to accommodate increased demand for rail service at the Richmond rail
2 hub.

3 Failure to Mitigate Significant Project Impacts

72. Public Resources Code Section 21100(c) and 14 California Code of
Regulations Sections 15126(e) and 15126.4 require that EIRs contain adequate evaluations

6 of measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts. In addition, 14 California Code of
7 Regulations Section 15092(b) provides that a public agency shall not approve or carry out
8 a project which has one or more significant environmental effects unless it has
9 "[e]liminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where
10 feasible."

11 73. The EIR's discussion of mitigation measures is inadequate in numerous

12 respects, including but not limited to Respondents' refusal to consider in the EIR other
13 measures which were within respondents' jurisdiction to impose, and which given due-
14 consideration of the existing railroad line, could have achieved substantially greater
15 mitigation of project impacts.
16 Failure to Consider a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

17 74, Public Resources Code Section 21100(b)(4) and 14 California Code of
18 Regulations Sections 15126(f) and 15126.6 require that EIRs must describe a range of
19 alternatives to the proposed project which could feasibly attain the project's basic
20 objectives, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives.

21 75. The subject EIR's analysis of alternatives is inadequate because it fails to
22 adequately describe alternatives such as the Joint Use Plan proposed by Petitioner so that
23 an adequate evaluation of the comparative merits of those alternatives could be conducted.
24 In fact, none of its proposed alternatives are legally feasible. By not evaluating the Joint
25 Use Plan option, Respondent may lose the opportunity for an environmentally superior
26 outcome for the public, including improved access to the coast and improved public safety.
27 Further, the EIR fails to adequately explain why the alternatives proposed by stakeholders,

LEWIS 28 including BNSF, are not discussed. Morcover, the EIR fails to identify or analyze any
BRISBOIS

alternative sites for the Project, including the proposed trail, which could mitigate the
2 Project's impacts.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(VIOLATIONS OF CEQA; Inadequate Findings)

76. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

6 above.

77. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
10 reached.

11 78. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
12 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited
13 to, the following: the findings are conclusory, internally inconsistent, and fail to bridge the
14 analytic gap between the raw evidence and the findings, including but not limited to Respondents'
15 findings that it will acquire the legal right to develop the Trail in the proposed location, despite
16 BNSF's superior rights over that land. There is nothing in the EIR or the LUPA, or in EBRPD's
17 response to BNSF's comments objecting to the EIR, establishing how this is to occur, and what

18 would occur even if the is present litigation is successful, because at most, this will only put a
19 portion of the rail line at issue under the control of the Respondent. Further, the findings do not
20 address at all what impacts will occur if the Respondent does in fact succeed in the litigation, and
21 BNSF foreseeably shifts rail lines necessary to serve the Richmond terminal elsewhere.

22 79. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
23 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving
24 the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of
25 the Project must be set aside.

26 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

LEWIS 28
BRISBOIS
BISGAARD 4839-0062-6580.1
& SMITH LLP 21

ATORNEYS AI LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 80. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

2l above.

3 81. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft

4 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the EIR must be recirculated for public

5 review and comment.

6 82. Comments submitted to Respondent after the Draft EIR was circulated provided

7 significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and
8 CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5 including, but not limited to, information about feasibility of
9 the Project, Project alternatives, and land use plan inconsistency, and failure to complete required
10 consultation with regional planning agencies and State regulatory agencies about the impacts that
11  may result as a result of displaced railroad operations.

12 83. Despite the availability of this significant new information, Respondent failed to
13 recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR. As a result of Respondent's failure to recirculate the
14 EIR, the public and other public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review

15 and comment on the Project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new
16 information regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.

17 84. Respondent's failure to recirculate the EIR is not supported by substantial evidence
18 and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Inadequate Response to Comments)

21 85. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

22 above.

23 86. 14 California Code of Regulations Section 15088(c) provides that agencies
24 must provide a "good faith, reasoned analysis in response" to comments received on the
25 EIR and "conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice."
26 Agencies must address recommendations and objections in detail and explain why specific
27 comments and suggestions were not accepted.

I 87. Respondent failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by the Petitioners,
2 other members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the responses given to numerous

3 comments regarding the Project's impacts are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-

4 responsive, contrary to the requirements of CEQA.

5 88. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed

6 alternatives, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover, Respondent's

7 finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by substantial

8 evidence.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)

11 89. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
12 above.

13 90. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of a city to adopt a
14 general plan for the physical development of the city. The general plan is often called a
15 "constitution" for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform.
16 Accordingly, any decision of the EBRPD affecting land use and development must be consistent
17 with the general plan adopted by the City of Richmond, See Neighborhood Action Group v.

18 County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1182-86.

19 91. The Project is inconsistent with the City of Richmond General Plan because the
20 proposed Project will conflict with General Plan policies including, but not limited to, programs
21 and policies that address the following as referred to herein: land use and urban design,
22 transportation and circulation, and air quality,

23 92. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent did not proceed in the manner
24 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial
25 evidence. Accordingly, approval of the Project must be set aside.

26 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that under Public Resources Code § 21167.5, Petitioners and

24 Plaintiffs, BNSF RAILWAY COMPANY, intends to file a petition under the provisions of the

25 Calífornia Environmental Quality Act against Respondent and Defendant, the Bast Bay

26 EBRPD's decision to approve the Regional Park District, (the "EBRPD") challenging the

27 Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline Land Use Plan Amendment ("Project") and certify the

LEWIS 28 Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("RIR"). The EBRPD's finding that there was no

nced to evaluate an existing rail line within the EBRPD's planning area, and its decision to

2 refuse to even consider the only viable alternative to the Project, namely a proposal by the

3 BNSF to relocate the rail line away from the shoreline to allow better access to the beach ("Joint

4 Use Plan"), were both a violation of CEQA. The EBRPD had no basis to conclude that there

5 were no impacts to land use, particularly since it failed to consult with regional planning and

6 regulatory authorities that have jurisdiction over the rail line dispute, including the CPUC and

7 the Surface Transportation Board. Moreover, the need to balance railroad use with other uses,
8 such as through the potential Joint Use Plan, is clear in the applicable General Plan, and the
Project as approved is inconsistent with the City of Richmond General Plan. Even assuming it

10 was correct that the rail line will be moved, the EBRPD also failed to evaluate potential impacts
11 related to the relocation of this track.

12 The petition will seek the following relief; a writ of mandate setting aside the Project
13 approvals for failure to comply with CEQA, coupled with a permanent injunction barring the
14 EBRPD from implementing the Project. A copy of the petition to be filed by Petitioners is
15 attached to this notice.
