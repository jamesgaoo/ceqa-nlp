27 INTRODUCTION
28 1. This is a public interest lawsuit to protect petitioners' and the public's interest in securing

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
|RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 1-

the Board's compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources

2 Code ("PRC") section 21000 et seq., the Imperial County General Plan ("General Plan"), and the

3 Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et seq. Petitioners bring this action to

4 challenge the Board's approval on January 15, 2019 of the Laurel Cluster Solar Farm Projects ("Laurel
Cluster" or the "Project," and formerly called the "Big Rock Cluster Solar Farms Project"). The Project

6 comprises four industrial-scale solar photovoltaic ("PV") electric generation plants and associated
a 7 facilities, with a combined nominal alternative current generation capacity of 325 megawatts ("MW").

8 Laurel Solar Farm 1 ("LSF1," 40 MW capacity), Laurel Solar Farm 2 ("LSF2," 70 MW), Laurel Solar

9 Farm 3 ("LSF3," 140 MW) and Laurel Solar Farm 4 ("LSF4," 75 MW) would be located on a combined

10 total of 1,380 acres in southwestern Imperial County, south of Interstate 8, west of Drew Road, north of
11 Mandrapa Road, and east of the Westside Main Canal. The Project sites include approximately 1,344

12 acres of highly productive agricultural land. The Project would preclude all agricultural production on

13 approximately 508 acres of Prime Farmland, 827 acres of Farmland of Statewide Importance and 9 acres

14 of Unique Farmland. Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") 4.2-10. The Project would eliminate

15 and prevent agricultural uses on the Project sites for up to 40 years under the terms of the Conditional

16 Use Permit ("CUPs") for the four facilities. FEIR 3-7 to 3-8. Petitioners challenge the following

17 January 15, 2019 Project Approvals by the Board:

18 (1) Resolution 2019-12, adopting findings and approving the Water Supply Assessment

19 ("WSA") for the Project;

20 (2) Resolution 2019-13, adopting findings and certifying the FEIR for the Project (California

21 State Clearinghouse #2017121078);

22 (3) Resolution 2019-14, adopting findings and approving the Mitigation Monitoring and

23 Reporting Progräm ("MMRP") for the Project;

24 (4) Resolution 2019-15, adopting findings and approving General Plan Amendment #17-0003,

25 amending the Renewable Energy and Transmission Element to expand the renewable

26 energy overlay zone;

27 (5) Ordinance adopting findings and approving an amendment to Imperial County Land Use (or

28 "Zoning") Ordinance section 91701.01;

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE |RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 2-

1 (6) Ordinance adopting findings and approving Zoning Map No. 71 (Land Use Ordinance

2 section 92571.00);

3 (7) Resolution 2019-16, making findings and approving CUP No. 17-0027 (LSF4);

4 (8) Resolution 2019-17, making findings and approving CUP No. 17-0028 (LSF1);

5 (9) Resolution 2019-18, making findings and approving CUP No. 17-0029 (LSF2);

6 (10) Resolution 2019-19, making findings and approving CUP No. 17-0030 (LSF3);

7 (11) Resolution 2019-20, making findings and approving Variance No. 18-0003;

8 (12) Resolution 2019-21, making findings and approving Variance No. 18-0004;

9 (13) Resolution 2019-22, making findings and approving Variance No. 18-0005; and

10 (14) Resolution 2019-23, making findings and approving Variance No. 18-0006.

11 2. The Board approved the Water Supply Assessment, FEIR, MMRP, General Plan

12 Amendment, Land Use Ordinance amendments, CUPs and Variances for the Project despite the fact that

13 (1) the proposed electrical generation facilities are forbidden by the General Plan and thus by the

14 Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code §§ 65000 et seq., and (2) the EIR is inadequate under

15 CEQA.

16 3. Petitioners therefore seek this Court's declaration that the Board's actions violate

17 the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA, and this Court's writ of mandate ordering

18 the County to set aside and vacate its Project Approvals. Finally, petitioners seek an injunction

19 forbidding all activity on the Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical
20 environment until the Board has taken all actions necessary to bring the Project - and the Board's Project
21 Approvals - into compliance with the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA.

22 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

23 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP")

24 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5
25 (administrative mandate), PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA), Government

26 Code section 65009(c)(1) (judicial review under the Planning and Zoning Law), and Article VI, section

27 10, of the California Constitution.

28 5. Venue is proper pursuant to CCP sections 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 3 -

(actions generally) because the Board is the legislative body for and has its office within Imperial

2 County.

6. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations. This action is

4. timely under CEQA because it is filed within 30 days of the Board's January 17, 2019 Notice of
5 Determination ("NOD") (PRC § 21167(b)) and timely under the Government Code because it is filed

6 within 90 days of the Board's January 15, 2019 approval of the Project (Govt. Code §g 65009(c)(1)).

7 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a

8 copy of this Verified Petition and Complaint, and consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners have

9 served the Board with notice of this suit.

10 PARTIES

11 8. Petitioner FARMS FOR FARMING ("Farms") is a community organization formed in

12 2018. Farms' purpose is to preserve the rural quality of life, community character and agricultural

13 resources in Imperial County. Farms' membership includes individuals and families who farm, reside on

14 and/or own agricultural land in Imperial County, including land near the proposed Laurel Cluster Project

15 and other existing industrial-scale solar photovoltaic facilities that are situated on Prime Farmland,

16 Farmland of Statewide Importance, Farmland of Local Importance and Unique Farmland, as designated

17 by the California Department of Conservation. Farms and its members are harmed by the Project

18 Approvals because their conversion of the Project sites and their agricultural resources to industrial

19 energy production would impair the rural character of the area, reduce the supply of agricultural and

20 open space land in Imperial County, reduce the demand for and therefore undermine the viability of

21 essential agricultural service businesses, and induce the development of additional large-scale electrical

: 22 generation facilities on farmland, among other impacts. As citizens who own, use and enjoy the

23 bountiful agricultural lands and natural resources of the County, Farms' members have a clear and

24 present right to, and direct beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to

25 comply with the provisions of the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA. Waste
26 Management of Alameda County v. County of Alameda ("Waste Management of Alameda County")

27 (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1233-1239. Farms was duly authorized to and does bring this action in a

28 representative capacity on behalf of its members.

|RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

9. Petitioner DANNY ROBINSON lives in El Centro, Imperial County. Mr. Robinson is the

2 president of petitioner Farms for Farming. Mr. Robinson is also the president and co-owner of petitioner

3 Robco Farms, Inc. ("Robco Farms"). Mr. Robinson, either independently or through Robco Farms,

4 leases or owns and actively farms over 1,000 acres in Imperial County, including land near the proposed

5 Laurel Cluster Project. Mr. Robinson grows or has grown broccoli, onions, romaine lettuce, wheat,
6 alfalfa, Sudan grass, Kleingrass, Bermuda grass and seed, and other food and fiber crops. The Board's

7 Project Approvals harm Mr Robinson because, among other impacts, the Project would impair the rural

8 and scenic character of the area, reduce the supply of agricultural and open space land in Imperial

9 County, reduce the demand for and therefore undermine the viability of essential agricultural service
10 businesses, and induce the development of additional large-scale electrical generation facilities on

11. farmland near the land he farms and in the County generally. As a citizen residing in Imperial County

12 who uses, enjoys and makes a living farming the bountiful agricultural lands and natural resources

13 thereof, Mr. Robinson has a clear and present right to, and beneficial interest in, the performance by the

14 Board of its public duty to comply with the provisions of the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning

15 Law, and CEQA. Waste Management of Alameda County, 79 Cal.App.4th at 1233-1239.

16 10. Petitioner ROBCO FARMS, INC. ("Robco Farms") is a registered California corporation in

17 good standing. Robco Farms is co-owned by petitioner Danny Robinson. It is headquartered in

18 Calexico, Imperial County. Robco Farms leases or owns and actively farms hundreds of acres in

19 Imperial County. Robco Farms grows or has grown broccoli, onions, romaine lettuce, wheat, alfalfa,

20 Sudan grass, Kleingrass, Bermuda grass and seed, and other food and fiber crops. The Board's Project

21 Approvals harm Robco Farms because, among other impacts, the Project would impair the rural and

22 scenic character of the area, reduce the supply of agricultural and open space land in Imperial County,

23 reduce the demand for and therefore undermine the viability of essential agricultural service businesses,

24 and induce the development of additional large-scale electrical generation facilities on farmland near the

25 lands it owns and leases and in the County generally.

26 11. Petitioner JOSEPH TAGG lives in El Centro, Imperial County. Mr. Tagg is the vice

27 president of petitioner Farms for Farming. Mr. Tagg is also the owner and president of petitioner West-

28 Gro-Farms-Inc. ("West-Gro Farms"). Through West-Gro Farms, Mr. Tagg owns or leases and actively

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

farms over 400 acres of Imperial County farmland, including 113.5 acres that the Project - specifically

2 LSF1 and LSF4 - would convert to industrial-scale electrical generation uses.' Mr. Tagg grows wheat,

3 oats, alfalfa, Sudan grass, Bermuda grass, and other food and fiber crops on his lands. The Board's

4 Project Approvals harm Mr. Tagg because, among other impacts, the Project would impair the rural and

5 scenic character of the area, reduce the supply of agricultural and open space land in Imperial County,

6 reduce the demand for and therefore undermine the viability of essential agricultural service businesses,

7 and induce the development of additional large-scale electrical generation facilities on farmland near his

8 properties and in the County generally. As a citizen residing in Imperial County who uses, enjoys and

9 makes a living farming the bountiful agricultural lands and natural resources thereof, and who leases and

10 farms 113.5 acres that the Project would develop with industrial uses, Mr. Tagg has a clear a and present

11 right to, and beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to comply with the
12 provisions of the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA. Waste Management of

13 Alameda County, 79 Cal.App.4th at 1233-1239.

14 12. Petitioner WEST-GRO-FARMS-INC. ("West-Gro Farms") is a registered California

15 corporation in good standing. West-Gro Farms is owned by petitioner Joseph Tagg. It is headquartered

16 in El Centro, Imperial County. West-Gro Farms owns or leases and actively farms over 400 acres of
17 Imperial County farmland, including 113.5 acres that the Project - specifically LSF1 and LSF4 - would

18 convert to industrial-scale electrical generation uses.2 West-Gro Farms grows wheat, oats, alfalfa, Sudan

19 grass, Bermuda grass, and other food and fiber crops on its lands. The Board's Project Approvals harm

20 West-Gro Farms in many ways. For example, the construction and operation of industrial-scale

21 electrical generation and transmission uses on the 113.5 acres (APNs 051-330-024 and 051-310-023)

22 that West-Gro Farms currently leases and farms on the LSF1 and LSF4 sites would entirely prevent

23 West-Gro Farms from farming that land. The Board's Project Approvals also harm West-Gro Farms

24 because, among other impacts, the Project would impair the rural and scenic character of the area, reduce

25

26 Mr. Tagg, through West-Gro Farms, leases and farms 113.5 acres that the Laurel Cluster Solar
Farm Projects would develop. Those acres comprise Assessor's Parcel Numbers ("APNs") 051-
27 330-024 and 051-310-023. See FEIR 3-3 (identifying both parcels in Figure 3-2).

28 Those 113.5 acres comprise Assessor's Parcel Numbers ("APNs") 051-330-024 and 051-310-
023. See FEIR 3-3 (identifying both parcels in Figure 3-2).

the supply of agricultural and open space land in Imperial County, reduce the demand for and therefore

2 undermine the viability of essential agricultural service businesses, and induce the development of

3 additional large-scale electrical generation facilities on farmland near its properties and in the County

4 generally.

5 13. Petitioners have authorized their attorney to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate

6 their, and the public's, vital interest in securing the Board's compliance with the General Plan, the

7 Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA, in connection with its review and approval of the Project.

8 14. Respondent IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS at all material times has

9 been and is the governing legislative body of Imperial County and is authorized and required by the

10 California Constitution to regulate land use within all unincorporated areas of the County, including the

11 Project sites, in compliance with CEQA, the General Plan, and the Planning and Zoning Law. The

12 Board is the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. The Board issued the Project Approvals on

13 January 15, 2019. The Board filed its CEQA NOD for the Project on January 17, 2019.

14 15. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
15 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

16 Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this verified petition when the true names and

17 capacities of said DOE respondents have been ascertained.

18 16. Real party in interest 90FI 8ME, LLC is a Delaware domestic limited liability company,

19 which incorporated on March 7, 2016 (File Number 5982860) and registered in California on July 14,

10 18. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES
11 XXI-C, inclusive, and therefore sue such real parties in interest herein by fictitious names. Petitioners

12 are informed and believe, and based upon such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named

13 real parties are entities or individuals who have a direct and substantial economic interest in, or are the

14 recipients of, the Board's Project Approvals. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties

15 have been ascertained, petitioners will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this verified petition

16 to insert such identities and capacities.

17 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

18 19. Over the past decade, there has been growing political, financial and legal pressure on

19 farmers in Imperial County to sell or fallow their agricultural lands to make room for renewable energy
20 projects. The increase in demand for renewable energy and resultant pressure to convert agricultural

21 lands to energy production has been spurred by state and federal renewable energy mandates like
22 | California's Renewables Portfolio Standard, which was established in 2002 and steadily expanded since

23 then. Under Senate Bill 100 (de León, 2018), the Renewables Portfolio Standard requires California's

24 investor-owned utilities, electric service providers and community choice aggregators to provide 60

25 percent of their retail electricity sales from renewable energy sources by 2030. See Public Utilities Code

26 399.15. Roof-top solar could easily satisfy this mandate. But it is far more profitable for larger energy

27 companies to maintain their near-monopoly on energy production and distribution. In their rush to profit

28 from this mandate, renewable energy companies have inundated land owners and the local, state and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES 8.

federal governments with proposals to pave the deserts and agricultural lands of central and southern

2 California with solar, wind, geothermal and other ostensibly renewable energy projects. Imperial County

3 has been hit particularly hard, with dozens of these projects, particularly industrial-scale PV or
4 concentrated PV projects like the Laurel Cluster Project, proposed throughout the County. The County

5 has already allowed well over 10,000 acres of highly productive and irreplaceable farmland to be

6 converted to electrical generation and transmission uses, even before approving the Laurel Cluster

7 Project. FEIR 6-9 to 6-10.

8 20. The Laurel Cluster Solar Farms Projects involve the construction, development and
operation for up to 40 years of an industrial complex of four solar photovoltaic energy generation

10 facilities, with an anticipated nameplate generation capacity of 325 MW. FEIR ES-1. The Project would

11 use PV panels mounted on either fixed-tilt, single- or dual-axis tracking structures. The panels would

12 stand up to 20 feet high. The Project would also include the construction of numerous associated

13 facilities, including multiple inverter modules, pad-mounted transformers, an energy storage system, at

14 least one on-site substation, at least one operations and maintenance building, access roads, perimeter

15 fencing, and transmission lines carrying the power from the inverter stations to the substation(s) and

16 thence to either Imperial Irrigation District's proposed Fern Substation or an existing San Diego Gas &

17 Electric Company substation, like the Imperial Valley Substation. FEIR ES-1; Board Agenda Fact Sheet

18 for January 15, 2019 Hearing, p. 3. The entire Project would spread across 1,380 acres - over two

19 square miles - in southwestern Imperial County, including 1,344 acres of highly productive designated
20 agricultural land.

21 21. The entire 1,380-acre Project site is important ecologically, agriculturally and economically.

22 Ecologically, the site is prime nesting and foraging habitat for the burrowing owl and other special-status

23 species protected by the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act and California Fish and Game Code section

24 3513, among other laws. Draft EIR ("DEIR") 2-3; FEIR Appendix F. It is also located within a

25 designated Audubon State Important Bird Area. In addition, it is important as a hydrologic tributary -

26 via the New River and agricultural channels - to the Salton Sea, which provides critically important

27 wildlife and sport fishery habitat.

28 22. Agriculturally, the site is blessed with nearly 1,400 acres of exceptionally high quality

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES

1 farmland, including 507.53 acres of Prime Farmland, 827.29 acres of Farmland of Statewide Importance,

2 and 9.27 acres of Unique Farmland, as designated by the Department of Conservation. FEIR 4.2-10.

3 These fertile lands are also vital to the County's economy because, as stated in the General Plan's
Agricultural Element and quoted in the EIR, the "overall economy of Imperial County is expected to be

5 dependent upon the agricultural industry for the foreseeable future." Imperial County General Plan,

6 Agricultural Element (Revised 1996) ("Agricultural Element"), p. 39; FEIR 4.2-4. According to the

7 Agricultural Element, "all agricultural land in Imperial County is considered as Important Farmland, as

8 defined by Federal and State agencies, and should be reserved for agricultural uses." Agricultural
Element, p. 39 (emphasis added).

10 23. Under the General Plan, the entire Project site is designated for use as "Agriculture," with

11 A-2 (General Agriculture), A-2-R (General Agriculture, Rural Zone) and A-3 (Heavy Agriculture)

12 zoning. FEIR 1-2, 2-5. And prior to the Board's January 15, 2019 Project Approvals, the Project site

13 was located outside the renewable energy overlay boundaries (the "RE Overlay Zone") the Board set in

14 2015 to restrict renewable energy development to only those "areas determined to be the most suitable"

15 for renewable energy facilities." FEIR ES-36. Among other things, the RE Overlay Zone was intended

16 to prevent renewable energy development that would destroy productive and irreplaceable farmland or

17 "result in' any [other] significant environmental impacts." Imperial County General Plan, Renewable

18 Energy and Transmission Element ("Renewable Energy Element"), Section IV(D), p. 35.

19 24.. Despite the inherent conflict between agriculture and industrial-scale energy production

20 uses, the Project proponents decided to pursue the Laurel Cluster Solar Farm Projects. and submitted

21 applications to the Imperial County Department of Planning and Development Services ("Planning

22 Department") for preparation and approval of the Project's (1) FEIR, (2) Mitigation Monitoring and

23 Reporting Program, (3) Water Supply Assessment, (4) General Plan amendment, (5) Land Use

24 Ordinance amendments, (6) four Conditional Use Permits, and (7) four Variances.

25 25. The Planning Department issued the Notice of Preparation of the DEIR for the Laurel

26 Cluster Solar Farm Projects (then known as the Big Rock Cluster Solar Farms Project) on or about

27 December 29, 2017. On February 5, 2018, petitioners submitted written scoping comments to the

28 Planning Department.

1 26. The County Airport Land Use Commission held a public meeting on the Project on or about

2 February 21, 2018. Petitioners submitted written comments to the Commission on February 20, 2018.

3 27. On or about April 10, 2018, the County released the DEIR for public review through May

4 31, 2015. On May 30, 2019, petitioners submitted detailed comments on the DEIR. Petitioners objected

5 to the Project as being inconsistent with the General Plan's Land Use and Renewable Energy elements.

6 Petitioners also discussed and objected to the DEIR's failure to accurately describe the Project, its failure

7 to accurately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and its failure to account for and fully analyze

8 the Project's impacts on agricultural resources and the measures proposed to mitigate those harms, its

9 water resources impacts, its impacts on burrowing owls and other sensitive bird species, its wildfire

10 impacts, and its greenhouse gas emissions.

11 28. In August 2018, the County issued the Project FEIR. On October 19, 2018 petitioners

12 submitted another comment letter detailing the EIR's inadequacies and the Project's incompatibility with

13 the General Plan. On November 28, 2018, the Planning Commission held public hearing on the
14 Project. At the end of the hearing, the Planning Commission recommended the Project to the Board for

15 approval.

16 29. Despite the fact that the General Plan prohibits the proposed industrial-scale development of

17 the Project site for energy generation and transmission, despite the EIR's inadequacies under CEQA, and
18 despite the detailed written objections to the Project made by petitioners and others throughout the
19 environmental review and administrative approval process, the Board approved the Project and certified
20 the FEIR at its January 15, 2019 hearing. The Board then filed its CEQA NOD for the Project on

21 January 17, 2019.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 30. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified

24 Petition and, to the extent required, have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies.

25 31. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, within

26 the meaning of CCP section 1086. Unless this Court issues a writ of mandate ordering the Board to set

27 aside and vacate its Project Approvals, the livelihoods and environmental interests of petitioners and the

28 public will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 11 -

1 adequately compensate for the harms to petitioners and the environment that would arise if the Board's

2 unlawful conduct were allowed to stand.

3 32. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because the Project

4 threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, the Board and the real parties in interest will

5 implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing unlawful and

6 unnecessary environmental degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to the

7 Board's failure to take the steps required by law to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief

8 is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to
the environment.

10 33. An actual controversy exists between petitioners and respondents under CCP section 1060.

11 Petitioners contend that respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws, including but not limited

12 to the General Plan, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA as alleged herein, and must therefore

13 vacate and set aside the Project approvals. Petitioners are informed and believe that the Board disputes

14 this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief to Set Aside the Board's Project Approvals as Contrary to the Imperial County General Plan)
17

18 34. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

19 35. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action on the grounds that the Board's adoption of the

20 Project Approvals was ultra vires and must be set aside because the proposed industrial-scale

21 photovoltaic solar facility use is forbidden by the General Plan's Land Use Element and Renewable

22 Energy and Transmission Element.

23 36. Just as the County did in the FEIR, the Board asserts in its resolutions approving the Project

24 CUPs and Variances that the Project is "consistent with goals and policies of the adopted County

25 General Plan." Resolutions 2019-16 to 2019-19 (quote); Resolutions 2019-20 to 2019-23 (Project "is

26 consistent with the General Plan for the reasons identified in the Laurel Cluster Solar Farm EIR and

27 General Plan Consistency finding of the CUP approval resolution"). The Board's claim of General Plan

28 consistency is contrary to law and the evidence.

1 The Board May Not Approve a Conditional Use that Is Forbidden by the County General Plan

2 37. As a general law jurisdiction, Imperial County must comply in its planning, zoning and
3 permitting decisions with the state Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code section 65000 et seq.).

4 38. As elucidated in Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras ("Neighborhood")

5 (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184, the requirement that use permits be consistent with the county

6 general plan

7 is necessarily to be implied from the hierarchical relationship of the land use laws. To view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government
8 Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§ 65860); the adopted general plan must conform with state law (§§ 65300, 65302). The
9 validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. These laws delimit the authority of the permit issuing agency to act and establish
10 the measure of a valid permit. A permit action taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires as to any defect implicated by the uses sought by
11 the permit.
12 Id. (emphasis added). Land use permits are invalid where the approved project "conflicts with a [valid]
13 general plan policy that is fundamental, mandatory, and clear." Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V.

14 |County of Orange ("Endangered Habitats League") (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.

15 39. Furthermore, where the local government approves a project in its quasi-adjudicatory
16 capacity, as the Board did here, it is that government's burden to demonstrate through findings, and with

17 levidence in the record supporting those findings, that the project in question - and the use permits
18 required for that project - are consistent with the relevant general plan. CCP § 1094.5(b) ("Abuse of

19 discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law, the order or
20 decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the evidence"). The
21 Supreme Court explained the importance of findings in a seminal 1974 case as follows:

22 [A] findings requirement serves to conduce the administrative body to draw legally relevant sub-conclusions supportive or its ultimate decision; the intended effect is to
23 facilitate orderly analysis and minimize the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions.
24
25 Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles ("Topanga") (1974) 11 Cal.3d
26 506, 516. Thus, pursuant to CCP section 1094.5, judicial review of the Board's Project Approvals

27 extends not only to whether the Project and Project Approvals are consistent with the General Plan as a

28 matter of law, but also to (1) whether the Board made the requisite General Plan consistency findings, and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES 13 -

- (2) whether those findings are supported by the evidence.

2 40. Since, as shown below, the proposed solar energy generation and transmission uses are
3 specifically forbidden under the General Plan, and because the Board failed make the requisite findings or
4 support with record evidence the General Plan consistency findings it did make, the Board lacked the

5 authority to approve the Project and its Project Approvals were ultra vires. Any "permit action taken
6 without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires." Neighborhood, 156 Cal.App.3d at

7 1184.

8 The Imperial County General Plan Land Use Element Forbids the Proposed Solar Energy Generation and Transmission Uses
9

10 41. The General Plan's Land Use Element specifically forbids the Project's industrial solar uses

11 within the "Agriculture" plan designation that applies to all the Project sites. The Land Use Element

12 directs that lands designated as "Agriculture" may not be developed with uses that do not preserve and
13 protect agricultural production and related activities. It states in pertinent part as follows:

14 1. Agriculture.

15 This category is intended to preserve lands for agricultural production and related industries including aquaculture (fish farms), ranging from light to heavy agriculture.
16 Packing and processing of agricultural products may also be allowed in certain areas, and other uses necessary or supportive of agriculture. . ..
17 Where this designation is applied, agriculture shall be promoted as the principal
18 and dominant use to which all other uses shall be subordinate. Where questions of land use compatibility arise, the burden of proof shall be on the non-agricultural use to clearly
19 demonstrate that an existing or proposed use does not conflict with agricultural operations and will not result in the premature elimination of such agricultural
20 operations. No use should be permitted that would have a significant adverse effect on agricultural production, including food and fiber production, horticulture, floraculture, or
21 animal husbandry. . . .

22 | Imperial County General Plan, Land Use Element (Revised 2008) ("Land Use Element"), p. 48 (emphasis

23 added).

24 42. It is clear from the foregoing language that lands designated as "Agriculture" in the General
25 Plan must be used only for agriculture and related industries that support agricultural production. "Where
26 questions of land use compatibility arise, the burden of proof shall be on the non-agricultural use to
27 clearly demonstrate that an existing or proposed use does not conflict with agricultural operations and

28 will not result in the premature elimination of such agricultural operations." Id. (emphasis added).

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES 14 -

43. Here, it is undisputed that the proposed industrial-scale solar uses would terminate and

2 prevent all agricultural use on the Project sites for up to 40 years, and even longer if the County approves

3 new or continued non-agricultural uses on the sites after the four approved CUPs expire. FEIR 3-7 to 3-8
4 ("anticipated duration of the project" is "up to 40 years"), 4.1-14 (The Project would "convert[] existing
5 agricultural lands to a large-scale solar energy facility"), 4.10-7 ("The Project sites would be converted

6 from undeveloped agricultural land to a solar energy facility"), 6-10 (Project would cause the "loss of
7 approximately 1,344 acres" of farmland); DEIR 4.2-14 ("there would be a 30- to 40-year period where
8 existing agricultural uses within the project sites would no longer be possible until the site is restored").
9 Furthermore, even if the Project developer does reclaim the Project sites for agricultural purposes after

10 the CUPs expire, there is no guarantee that future landowners or lessees would immediately - or ever -

11 it farm it anew, let alone achieve agricultural productivity comparable to what it is today. FEIR 4.2-20
12 ("Agricultural productivity of the project sites could be reduced as a result of the projects, even after final

13 restoration of individual site components;" emphasis added).

14 44. Contrary to the Board's assertions, this is not a mere "temporar[y]" impact that can be
15 mitigated by keeping the land "within the Agricultural land use category," paying an agricultural impact

16 fee and preparing a "site-specific decommissioning and reclamation plan." Resolutions 2019-16 to 2019-

17 19, section 2(A)(5). The termination and prevention of all agricultural use on the Project sites is a per se

18 conflict with agricultural operations that is prohibited by the General Plan. It cannot be mitigated away.

19 The General Plan's text is clear. It prohibits non-agricultural uses on land designated for agriculture

20 unless the "non-agricultural use [can] clearly demonstrate that [the use] does not conflict with
21 agricultural operations and will not result in the premature elimination of [those] operations." Land Use
22 Element, p. 48 (emphasis added). The question is a whether there is a conflict, not whether the impacts of

23 that conflict can be mitigated or whether the conflict might someday end. And here, the preclusion of

24 agricultural crop production on the Project sites for up to 40 years is a per se conflict.

25 45. The Project would also impede agricultural operations on nearby lands and elsewhere in the
26 County, which is no more plainly demonstrated than by the increasingly rapid conversion of farmland to
27 non-agricultural uses in the Project area as more and more industrial-scale electrical generation and

28 transmission projects are proposed and built on farmland. See FEIR 6-3 to 6-7 (showing and describing

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES . 15 -

lexisting and proposed utility-scale solar energy projects in the Project area). This effect is no surprise.
2 Replacing agricultural or open space land with these enormous industrial facilities makes farming on
|nearby land more difficult and costly. For example, the tall and electrified structures used in most
4 industrial-scale solar energy projects impede aerial spraying both by making it more dangerous for pilots

5 to access the farmland (due, e.g., to increased risk of collision with project components and increased risk
6 of solar-panel gläre impairing pilot vision) and by increasing the likelihood of planes inadvertently
7 spraying electrical generation facilities, resulting in complaints. In addition, by removing irrigated crops,

8 these facilities increase the ambient temperatures and reduce the ambient humidity in the area, potentially
orequiring adjacent farmers to irrigate more than they otherwise would and increasing the cost of farming.
10 Furthermore, as energy projects convert more and more agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, more

11 land more agriculture-serving businesses will be forced to close. And as the quantity and quality of
12 agriculture-serving businesses decreases in the County, more and more farmers will find it uneconomical

13 or impractical to keep farming and sell, lease or use their lands for non-agriculture purposes. As former
14  Imperial County Agricultural Commissioner Connie Valenzuela noted in her February 25, 2011

15 comments on the DEIR for a similar solar project, "removal of any farmland out of production would
16 have a direct negative impact on employment, income, sales and tax revenue." FEIR 0.2-56 (emphasis

17 added).

18 46. Furthermore, implementation of the adopted mitigation measures would not replace the lost

19 crop production that the Project would cause. Nor would it prevent the Board from extending the
20 Project's use permits, or approving new use permits, once the approved CUPs expire, thereby allowing
21 non-agricultural uses on the Project sites well beyond the supposed 40-year maximum operational life of

22 the Project.

23 47. Our nation depends on Imperial County for a substantial portion of its winter production of
24 produce during months when much of the nation's farmland is under snow and ice. No substitute

25 farmlands can be created to mitigate the irretrievable loss of the Project site's rich farmland.

26 48. Because the Project's solar energy generation and transmission uses would eliminate
27 agricultural production on the Project sites for up to 40 years - or potentially longer - and thus are

28 completely incompatible with agricultural use, the Project is specifically forbidden by the General Plan.

- Thus, the Board's Project approvals were ultra vires and must be set aside.

2

3 The Project's Incompatibility with the Land Use Element's Agricultural Use Provisions Is Not Cured by Other Conflicting General Plan Provisions,
the County Land Use Ordinance or the Board's Contrary Findings

4

5 49. Despite the fact that the Project would prohibit farming on the Project sites for up to 40 years

6 or more, the Board asserted in its CUP approval resolutions that the proposed industrial-scale solar uses

7 are nonetheless consistent with the General Plan and the County Land Use Ordinance. The Board
claimed that the existing agricultural zoning on the Project site is compatible with the General Plan's
8 |**Agriculture" land use designation, and that the A-2 zone allows solar energy projects subject to a

9 conditional use permit. The Board also contended that other elements of the General Plan "reflect[] the
10 County's intent to allow alternative energy plants such as solar facilities on agriculturally designated

11 lands." Resolutions 2019-16 to 2019-19, section 2(A)(3). Further, the Board purported to find that the
12 |"Project does not conflict with any existing agricultural operations and will not result in the premature

13

14 elimination of agricultural operations." Id., Section 2(A)(5). The Board is wrong as a matter of law a and

fact.

15 50.

16 As discussed, the Project is entirely incompatible with the General Plan's explicit use

17 standards for lands designated as "Agriculture." Not only would the proposed solar energy generation

18 and transmission uses conflict with any existing or future agricultural operations and have a significant
ladverse effect on agricultural production by terminating and preventing all agricultural use on nearly
19 1,400 acres for up to 40 years or more, they would likely impede agricultural operations on nearby lands

20 and elsewhere in the County. The Board's claim that this Project's direct termination, prevention and
21 impairment of farming use does not constitute a "conflict with any existing agricultural operations" is

22 |false and completely refuted by the evidence before the Board.

23

24 51. The Board is also wrong that the County Land Use Ordinance - which by law is subordinate

25 to the General Plan - might be interpreted to allow uses such as the proposed solar energy generation and
Itransmission facilities that are inconsistent with the General Plan's land use designations. Zoning
26 provisions that are inconsistent with the governing general plan are invalid. Government Code

27

28 co. 65860(a); Neighborhood, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184. And regardless of the applicable zoning, land use
permits are invalid where the approved project "conflicts with a general plan policy that is fundamental,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 17 -

P |mandatory, and clear." Endangered Habitats League, 131 Cal.App.4th at 782. In any event, the Board
2 only purported to find that the Land Use Ordinance allows the proposed solar energy generation and

3 transmission uses in one of the three zones - A-2- in which the Project would be sited. FEIR 4.2-18
4 ("The projects would be constructed on lands currently zoned A-2, A-2-R (General Agricultural Rural

5 (Zone), and A-3 (Heavy Agriculture)); Resolutions 2019-16 to 2019-19, section 2(A)(1)-(2). It failed to

6 find that zones A-2-R and A-3 also allow the proposed uses.

7 52. The Board is similarly wrong that the Land Use Element's Compatibility Matrix, the
Agricultural Element, the Renewable Energy Element or any other element of the General Plan might be

9 read to "allow[] non-agricultural development on land within the Agricultural Category." Resolutions

10 2019-16 to 2019-19, sections 2(A)(4) (quote), 2(A)(2). To the extent any provision of the General Plan

11 purports to allow uses on designated agricultural land that conflict with the Land Use Element's strict

12 |textual land use standards, the General Plan is internally inconsistent and invalid. Government Code von

13 65300.5 ("the Legislature intends that the general plan and elements and parts thereof comprise an
14 integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency");

15 Concerned Citizens of Calaveras County Board of Supervisors ("Concerned Citizens") (1985) 166

16 |Cal.App.3d 90, 97 ("a general plan must be reasonably consistent and integrated on its face"); Sierra

17 Club v. Kern County (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704 ("Since the general plan was internally
18 inconsistent, the zoning ordinance under review . could not be consistent with such plan and was

19 linvalid when passed").

20 53. Nor does it matter whether the Project is generally consistent with the County's overall goals

21 land energy policies. Resolutions 2019-16 to 2019-19. The question here is whether the Project complies

22 with the Land Use Element's strict and mandatory use standards for designated agricultural land. While

23 the County may have some discretion to balance the General Plan's flexible and non-mandatory policies

24 in light of the plan's purpose, the Land Use Element's standards for designated agricultural land are not

25 the commonly "amorphous" general plan policies that "afford[] officials" such "discretion." FUTURE v.

14 2(A)(4) (quoting Land Use Element, p. 48).

15 The Imperial County General Plan Renewable Energy and Transmission Element Forbids
the Proposed Solar Energy Generation and Transmission Uses
16

17 55. The Renewable Energy and Transmission Element and section 91701.01 of the County Land

18 Use Ordinance allow renewable energy development within a specified Renewable Energy (*RE")
19  Overlay Zone. Renewable energy projects outside the RE Overlay Zone are generally prohibited. The

20 Board can only amend the RE Overlay Zone to cover an outside project if the project is either (1) adjacent

21 Ito an existing RE Overlay Zone, or (2) meets the requirements for an "island" overlay. The Board may
22 only approve an island overlay if the proposed project (1) is "located adjacent (sharing a common
23 boundary) to an existing transmission source,' (2) "[c]onsists of the expansion of an existing renewable
24 energy option," and (3) "[w]ould not result in any significant environmental impacts." Renewable
25 Energy Element, p. 35.

26 56. The "County acknowledges that the proposed project site is currently located outside" and
27 not adjacent to "the RE Overlay Zone." FEIR 0.2-20. But the Board nonetheless purported to create an

28 l"island" overlay for the Project by amending the General Plan and the Land Use Ordinance. Because the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 19 -

pd Project would be a new renewable energy development, the Board amended the Renewable Energy

2 |Element and Land Use Ordinance to allow island overlay creation for projects that are "adjacent to or

3 within one quarter (1/4) of a mile of an existing solar facility" rather than only those that would be an
4 lexpansion of an existing renewable energy option. Resolution 2019-15.

5 57. The Board's purported amendments, however, do not make the Project eligible for an island
6 overlay for two reasons. First, the Board failed to find - let alone show - that all four of the constituent

7 Laurel Cluster Solar Farms would be "located adjacent (sharing a common boundary) to an existing

8 transmission source" or even use the same transmission right of way. Renewable Energy Element, p. 35.

9 JIn addition, as discussed below, the Project would "result in . significant environmental impacts." Id.

10 Because the Project is thus neither located within the existing RE Overlay Zone, nor eligible for either of

11 the Overlay Zone amendment pathways, it is prohibited by both the General Plan and the Land Use

12 |Ordinance. The Board's Project Approvals were thus ultra vires. Neighborhood, 156 Cal.App.3d 1184;
13 Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 515-516; CCP § 1094.5(b) ("Abuse of discretion is established if the [agency's]

14 decision is not supported by the findings," or the findings are not supported by record evidence).

15 58. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Board lacked the authority under the Planning and
16 Zoning Law to approve the Project, and its Project Approvals were ultra vires.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Approvals as Contrary to the California Environmental Quality Act)

28 (4) adequately analyze the Project's wildfire impacts;

12 FEIR fails to fully or consistently describe the Project.

13 63. For example, the FEIR fails to consistently state the Project's operational life, alternating
14 |between a 30-year life and a 40-year life. Compare FEIR 0.2-31 ("40-year CUP") with FEIR 3-28 ("30-
15 year project life") and FEIR 0.2-31 (useful life "expected to be up to 30 to 40 years").

16 64. The FEIR also fails to identify the Project's water supplies with requisite certainty, listing
17 multiple different potential water sources and making it unclear to the public and decisionmakers where

18 in fact the Project's construction, operational and decommissioning water supplies will originate.
19 Compare FEIR 3-28 (*Water will be obtained from the landowners' water supply or delivered via truck

20 from off-site source(s)") and FEIR 4.9-16 (same) with FEIR 4.14-8 ("The project applicant is proposing

21 to use Schedule 7 General Industrial Water or enter into an IWSP Water Supply Agreement with IID to

22 meet the projects' water demands") and FEIR Appendix L (Water Supply Assessment), p. 71 ("It is

23 anticipated that IID will 7 apportion Schedule 7 Industrial Use water for this project"). Nor does the FEIR
24 provide any written assurance that the Project's water needs will in fact be met by the Imperial Irrigation

25 District ("IID") or other potential water supplier. CEQA requires more. Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 434.

26 The EIR Fails to Acknowledge and Analyze Significant Project Impacts on Agriculture

27 65. CEQA mandates that the EIR adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts in

28 lorder to foster informed decisionmaking and to allow the public to understand the Project's impacts.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 21 -

1 Public Resources Code § 21002.1; 14 Cal. Code Regs. [CEQA Guidelines ("Guidelines")] §§ 15121,
2 15126, 15126.2. The FEIR here fails to do so.

3 66. The FEIR acknowledges that the Project would convert to non-agricultural uses the existing

4 farmland on the Project sites, and even that the "loss of agricultural land designated as Prime Farmland

5 land Farmland of Statewide Importance is typically considered a significant impact under CEQA." FEIR
6 4.2-13. But it erroneously claims that the impacts would be only temporary and would be mitigated to a

7 less-than-significant level "via full restoration of the project study areas to comparable agricultural
8 (production post-project," among other measures. FEIR 0.2-31. As discussed, the site restoration plan is
q more wishful thinking than guaranteed return to farmland - the County cannot force anyone to farm the

10 land again, even if the Project operators discontinue industrial land uses on the site and restore the land to
11 farming quality. And if the site is in fact re-used for the same or another industrial use after the currently
12 proposed CUPs expire, the impacts of continued farmland conversion beyond the currently planned 30 to

13 40 years will likely go unstudied if they are not analyzed in the Project EIR. Why? Because even if the
14 l"application of another CUP would be subject to additional CEQA review," that CEQA review may well
15 use as its analytical baseline the Project's then existing non-agricultural use, rather than the' current
16 agricultural use (especially if any new CUP application is submitted before the proposed CUP expires and

17 Ibefore the land is "restored"). FEIR 0.2-31. Thus, neither the "temporary" nature of the land conversion

18 nor the potential site restoration can reduce the Project's farmland conversion impacts to a less-than-
19 significant level.

20 67. The FEIR also fails to acknowledge how the Project would significantly indirectly and
21 cumulatively affect agriculture countywide, by both inducing growth of renewable energy generation and
22 transmission projects, and reducing the resources available to sustain remaining agricultural operations.

23 As utility-scale energy projects convert more and more agricultural land to non-agricultural uses, more

24 and more agriculture-serving businesses will be forced to close, due to both declining revenues and
25 logistical problems. And as the quantity and quality of agriculture-serving businesses decrease in the
26 County, more and more farmers will find it uneconomical or impractical to keep farming and be forced to

27 sell, lease or use their lands for non-agriculture purposes. The FEIR asserts that "an economic impact is

28 not an impact on the physical environment that must be addressed in an EIR," citing Guidelines section

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 22 -

15131. FEIR 0.2-27. But the FEIR must analyze the "physical changes caused in turn by the economic

2 or social changes." Guidelines § 15131 (quote); Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of

3 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1205 ("if the forecasted economic or social effects of a
4 proposed project directly or indirectly will lead to adverse physical changes in the environment, then
5 CEQA requires disclosure and analysis of these resulting physical impacts"); California Clean Energy
6 Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 188-189 (same). One need look no further

7 than the rapidly increasing density of solar and wind energy facilities in the County to see the significant
8 impacts on the physical environment from these changing economic conditions and pressures. Over

9 10,000 acres of prime farmland and farmland of statewide importance in the County have been or are
10 planned to be converted to solar energy generation uses. FEIR 6-3 to 6-7, 6-9 to 6-10 (showing and
11 describing existing and proposed utility-scale solar energy projects in the Project area).

12 68. Furthermore, contrary to the FEIR's assertion, the existing industrial-scale energy generation
13 and transmission projects clearly have "attract[ed] or encourage[d] new development of adjacent
14 farmland." FEIR 0.2-26. The Project would not only rely on one of the two existing or planned nearby

15 substations (FEIR 2-1, 3-22, 3-23, 3-29), the FEIR relies on the existence of other nearby generation and

16 transmission facilities to conclude that some of the Project's impacts would be less than significant.

17 FEIR 2-1, 2-2, 4.1-15. For example, with respect to the Project's aesthetic impacts, the FEIR concludes
18 that "[c]onsidering the surrounding area is transitioning from agriculture to utility scale solar

19 |development, the construction of the proposed projects would be consistent with current and planned
20 development patterns and types in the area." FEIR 4.1-15. Brushing aside these cumulatively massive

21 industrial growth-inducing, and farmland-displacing, impacts violates CEQA.

22 69. The EIR also violates CEQA by failing to acknowledge and confront the Project's grave

23 inconsistencies with the General Plan. The Project's General Plan inconsistencies demonstrate a

24 significant agricultural impact. See Office of Planning & Research, CEQA Technical Advice Series,

25 "Thresholds of Significance: Criteria for Defining Environmental Significance" (September 1994) (*The
26 agency should also rely upon its general plan as a source of environmental standards. For instance,
27 policies for the conservation of agricultural land may yield a threshold based on soil type, project size,

28 land water availability."); see also The Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES .23 -

1 903, 930. And Guidelines section 15152(d) mandates that "[t]he EIR shall discuss any inconsistencies
2 between the proposed project and applicable general plans . ..." As discussed above, the General Plan
3 specifically forbids the proposed industrial-scale electrical generation and transmission uses here. The
4 EIR's contrary conclusion that the Project is consistent with the General Plan is wrong as a matter of law

5 and fact, and must be corrected.

6 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts to Birds

7 70. An EIR must discuss the significant direct and indirect environmental impacts of a project

8 "with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to

9 lmake a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." Guidelines §§ 15151
10 (quote), 15126(a), 15126.2(a); Watsonville Pilots Association v. City of Watsonville (* Watsonville")
11 (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1080. The EIR's discussion of the Project's bird impacts fails for at least

12 Ifive reasons.

13 71. First, the FEIR, like the DEIR, entirely fails to analyze the pseudo-lake effect, which occurs

14 when solar projects' reflective panels resemble water from above, and attract birds - especially migratory

15 birds - searching for water. Once tricked, the birds can - and often do - dive into the solar panels - as if

16 |they were water. This "pseudo-lake effect" is suspected to be a primary cause of migratory bird trauma

17 and death at the Desert Sunlight PV facility in Riverside County. FEIR 0.2-74 to 0.2-101. PV panel
18 collision is also estimated to kill an estimated 125 to 2,675 birds per year at the 250-MW California

19 Valley Solar Ranch PV facility, or 0.5 to 10.70 annual bird deaths per MW of nameplate electric capacity.
20 Applying that same mortality rate here, this 325-MW Project would kill between 163 and 3,478 birds per

21 vear. Furthermore, these impacts can compound in areas with multiple PV facilities, requiring a
22 |cumulative impact analysis of bird-panel collision impacts that the FEIR omits.

23 72. Second, the FEIR fails to analyze the bird habitat loss the Project would cause. Studies of

24 five U.S. PV facilities and one South African facility showed that bird species diversity was universally

25 /lower at the PV project sites than in the adjacent areas, as petitioners demonstrated in their FEIR

26 comments. Similarly, and as likewise discussed in petitioners' FEIR comments, a before-and-after study

27 of a utility-scale PV facility in south-central California demonstrated that raptor abundance was higher

28 before construction than after construction, suggesting that the raptors avoided the facility.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 24 -

1 73. Third, the FEIR's failure to analyze the Project's bird collision and avoidance impacts is
2 compounded - not remedied - by its proposed "development and implementation of an Avian Bat
3 Protection Plan (ABPP)" to purportedly mitigate and "address potential effects from the PV panels."

4 FEIR 0.2-33. Including a measure to mitigate an impact does not obviate the need to disclose and analyze

5 that impact. To the contrary, it presupposes the identification in the EIR of the significant impact to be
6 mitigated. See Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(A). Thus, it masks, rather than avoids, those impacts.

7 74. Fourth, even had the EIR analyzed the Project's bird collision and avoidance impacts, its
8 bird impact mitigation discussion would still violate CEQA because it does provide sufficient details on

9 the contents and standards of the ABPP. Rather than provide specific performance criteria to constrain

10 the measures to eventually be included in the ABPP, the FEIR provides only vague guidance, like
11 incorporating into the ABPP construction conservation measures to "[m]inimize wildfire potential" and
12 "[m]inimize activities that attract prey and predators." FEIR 4.4-14. CEQA prohibits this kind of
13 mitigation measure deferral. Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B); Endangered Habitats League, 131
14 Cal.App.4th at 793-794 (mitigation may be deferred only where it includes specific performance criteria).

15 75. Fifth, the FEIR fails to explain how the Project could comply with state and federal
16 prohibitions on killing migratory birds. As the FEIR acknowledges, the federal Migratory Bird Treaty

17 Act ("MBTA"), 16 U.S.C. section 703 et seq., "prohibits the killing of any migratory birds without a

18 valid permit." FEIR 6-13. Section 3513 of California's Fish and Game Code likewise makes it

19 /"unlawful to take or possess any migratory nongame bird as designated in the [MBTA] or any part of

20 such nongame bird except as provided by rules and regulations adopted by the Secretary of the Interior

21 lunder provisions of the [MBTA]." And with "few exceptions, most birds are considered migratory under

22 this act" (FEIR 6-13), including the burrowing owl, mountain plover, whimbrel, long-billed curlew and

23 short-billed dowitcher, all of which have "high" on-site potential, and the northern harrier, sharp-shinned
24 hawk, white-tailed kite, ferruginous hawk, Swainson's hawk, loggerhead shrike, yellow warbler and
25 Brewer's sparrow, all of which have "medium" on-site potential (FEIR Appendix F). Yet the FEIR fails
26 to discuss how the Project could - let alone would - comply with state and federal prohibitions on killing

27 these species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regulations only permit taking migratory birds for

28 limited purposes, including taxidermy, scientific collection, and banding or marking, among other

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 25 -

1 constrained purposes, nonfe of which apply to the proposed Project use. 50 C.F.R. Part 21.

2 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Wildfire Impacts

3 76. As the FEIR recognizes, global warming is increasing the frequency and severity of wildfires

4 in Southern California. FEIR 4.7-9. Yet the FEIR provides almost no substantive analysis of how the
5 Project would contribute to those increasing wildfire risks. Rather than discuss the Project's numerous
6 lignition sources and how it would impede firefighting, the FEIR summarily concludes that "[b]ecause the
7 proposed projects are not located in proximity to a wildland fire hazard area, implementation of the
lproposed projects would result in a less than significant impact related to the possible risk to people and
9 structures caused by wildland fires." FEIR 4.8-14. But the FEIR fails to explain how the Project would

10 Inot be located in "proximity to a wildland fire hazard area," when, as the FEIR separately acknowledges,

11 it would be located in a "moderate' risk area for wildland fires." FEIR 4.8-14. Nor does it explain how

12 the Project would not increase that already "moderate" wildfire risk.

13 77. The FEIR similarly fails to discuss whether the local firefighting services, as well as on-site

14 fire protection measures, are equipped for the type of electrical and chemical fires the Project could cause,

15 with electrical generation, transmission and battery storage components all on site. It is not enough to list
16 the "project design features proposed to reduce the risk of fire," the EIR must examine how those features

17 /would actually reduce the Project-specific fire risks, including the more intractable chemical and

18 lelectrical fires. The FEIR asserts that the "County of Imperial Fire Department has reviewed the
19 proposed project and determined that appropriate fire protection systems must be included in the

20 Ilproject for fire safety." FEIR 0.2-33. But it does not provide any written correspondence with the
21 County Fire Department, let alone any assurance from the Department that the "appropriate fire
22 protection systems" have been included in the Project, and that the Department is trained and equipped to

23 handle Project fires. These key evidentiary omissions render the EIR inadequate.

24 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Greenhouse Gas Emissions

25 78. The FEIR fails to analyze the Project's lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, it looks
26 solely at the Project's construction and operational emissions, without any analysis of the greenhouse

27 gases emitted to produce and transport the components used to build the Project's PV panels. The FEIR

28 excuses this failure on the grounds that (1) if the PV panels are made outside of California, the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 26 -

1 manufacturing impacts are not subject to CEQA because a "California public agency [does not have]
2 authority over the emissions,' and (2) if the PV panels are made in California, "the environmental
impacts associated with the manufacturing of those panels .. . would have been analyzed and considered
4 pursuant to CEQA as part of any discretionary approvals" associated with the manufacturing facility.
5 FEIR 0.2-35 (quoting Guidelines § 15277). The FEIR is wrong on both counts, and its omission of a
6 lifecycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions thus renders its analysis inadequate.

7 79. First, Guidelines section 15277 is inapposite. That section relates to projects outside of
8 |California, to which "CEQA does not apply." Guidelines 15277. By contrast, CEQA does apply to the
9 extraterritorial impacts of projects within California. The "Supreme Court [has] confirmed that an agency

10 must identify and attempt to mitigate the extraterritorial effects of any project it intends to carry out or
11 approve." American Canyon Community United for Responsible Growth v. City of American Canyon
12 (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 1062, 1082 (citing City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of California State
13 University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 359-360). Furthermore, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with

14 Project PV panel production abroad would still impact California, since climate change is a global a

15 Iphenomenon.

16 80. Second, even if the Project's PV panels were manufactured in California, there is no

17 |guarantee that their greenhouse gas emission impacts would have been analyzed in some prior CEQA

18 |document. Because the production of PV panels is often project-dependent, with panels made to order,

19 the panels for the Project may not be built absent the Project, making the panels' manufacturing impacts

20 indirect impacts of the Project that require analysis in the EIR. And even if the impacts had been

21 analyzed in a prior CEQA document, the County here must still disclose that analysis in the Project EIR.

22 (Prior impact analysis "does not excuse the lead agency from adequately analyzing reasonably foreseeable
23 significant environmental effects of the project." Guidelines § 15152(b).

24 81.  More broadly, the County may not use uncertainty regarding PV panel sourcing to avoid a

25 full analysis of greenhouse gas emission impacts. CEQA requires the lead agency to "use its best efforts

26 to find out and disclose all that it reasonably can," and to demonstrate it has fully "considered the

27 environmental consequences of [its] action." Guidelines § 15144.

RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 27 -

1 The EIR Fails to Identify Sufficiently Specific Water Sources for the Project

2 82. CEQA requires the County to identify in its EIR the likely water sources for the Project, and
3 analyze the "environmental impacts of exploiting those sources" and "how those impacts are to be
4 mitigated." Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 421 (quote), 434, 440-441. "An EIR that neglects to explain the

5 likely sources of water and analyze their impacts, but leaves long-term water supply considerations to
6 later stages of the project, does not serve the purpose of sounding an environmental alarm bell." Id. at
7 441 (internal quotations and citation omitted).

8 If the uncertainties inherent in long-term land use and water planning make it impossible to confidently identify the future water sources, [the] EIR may satisfy CEQA if it
9 acknowledges the degree of uncertainty involved, discusses the reasonably foreseeable alternatives - including alternative water sources and the option of curtailing the
10 development if sufficient water is not available for later phases - and discloses the significant foreseeable environmental effects of each alternative, as well as mitigation
11 measures to minimize each adverse impact.
12 ld. 434 (emphasis in original).

13 83. Here, as also discussed above regarding the FEIR's Project description, the FEIR fails to

14 [identify the Project's water supplies with requisite certainty. Instead, it lists multiple different potential

15 Iwater sources and it makes it unclear to the public where in fact the Project's construction, operational and
16 decommissioning water supplies will originate. Compare FEIR 3-28 ("Water will be obtained from the
17 landowners' water supply or delivered via truck from off-site source(s)*) with FEIR 4.14-8 ("The project
18 applicant is proposing to use Schedule 7 General Industrial Water or enter into an IWSP Water Supply
19 Agreement with IID to meet the projects' water demands") and FEIR Appendix L (Water Supply

20 Assessment), p. 54 ("potable water will be obtained for the duration of the Project from a state-approved
21 |provider"). Nor does the FEIR provide any written assurance of Project water provision from IID or other

22 Ipotential water supplier. CEQA requires more, particularly with increasingly dry conditions due to global
23 warming. Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 434; FEIR 4.7-9 ("improved climate models shift towards drier
24 conditions by the mid-to-late 21 st century in Central, and most notably, Southern California").

25 The EIR Fails to Analyze a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

26 84. CEQA requires EIRs to "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project . . . which
27 would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen
28 any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND

|Guidelines § 15126.6(a); Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 566

2 (EIRs "must consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the project . .. which (1) offer substantial
3 environmental advantages over the project proposal" and (2) may be feasibly accomplished (emphasis
4 added)). "An EIR's discussion of alternatives must contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision
5 making." Laurel Heights I, 47 Cal.3d at 404. An alternative may "not be eliminated from consideration
6 solely because it would impede to some extent the attainment of the project's objectives." Habitat and

7 Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz ("HAWC") (2013), 213 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1304 (quote);

8 Guidelines §§ 15126.6(a)-(b). "The EIR is required to make an in-depth discussion of those alternatives

9 lidentified as at least potentially feasible." HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1303 (emphasis and quotation
10 omitted). Alternatives may only be eliminated from "detailed consideration" when substantial evidence

11 in the record shows that they either (1) "fail[] to meet most of the basic project objectives," (2) are
12 "'infeasibl[e]," or (3) do not "avoid" or substantially lessen any "significant environmental impacts." Id.
13 15126.6(c).

14 85. Among other alternatives, the EIR should have, yet fails to, analyze programs to develop or
15 incentivize the development of distributed PV generation projects near energy demand centers on
16 already-disturbed non-agricultural sites such as roof-top solar in urban areas. Indeed, Objective 1.8 of

17 the County General Plan Agricultural Element "[a]llow[s] conversion of agricultural land to non-

18 lagricultural uses including renewable energy only where a clear and immediate need can be

19 demonstrated, based on economic benefits, population projections and lack of other available land
20 (including land within incorporated cities) for such non-agricultural uses." Imperial County General

21 Plan, Agricultural Element (Revised 2015), p. 30 (emphasis added). Conversion of agricultural land to
22 non-agricultural uses "shall be allowed only where" it is "supported by a study to show a lack of

23 alternative sites." Id. No such "supportive study" was ever conducted. To the contrary, as shown below,

24 the studies that have been done show just the opposite.

25 86. Distributed generation alternatives on non-agricultural sites are not only feasible, they could
26 generate far more energy than the Project, and with far fewer environmental impacts. For example, a

27 recent study shows that installing PV and concentrating solar power ("CSP") technologies throughout

28 California's built environment could substantially exceed the state's forecasted 2020 energy needs, which

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
|RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 29 -

1S also one of the County's stated objectives for the Project. FEIR 0.2-29 (stated objective), 0.2-103 to
2 109 (study). Another recent study estimates that deploying PV and CSP solely on developed land (built
3 environment), land with salt-affected soils, contaminated land and reservoirs in California's Central
4 Valley "could meet CA's projected 2025 needs for electricity consumption between 10-13 times over"

5 (for PV technologies) and "over two times over with CSP technologies." FEIR 0.2-118. The Board

6 Iviolated CEQA and its own General Plan by failing to consider less-impactful alternatives like these in

7 the EIR. CEQA § 21100; Guidelines 15126.6; Imperial County General Plan, Agricultural Element
8 (Revised 2015), p. 30. The EIR's alternatives analysis section contains no discernible analysis of a
9 distributed generation or non-farmland alternative. To the contrary, it fails to analyze any alternatives not

10 located on high-quality farmland, or provide a "study to show a lack of alternative sites." Imperial

11 County General Plan, Agricultural Element (Revised 2015), p. 30.

12 87. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Board's Project Approvals violated CEQA and must be

13 Iset aside.
