INTRODUCTION

2 1. Real Parties in Interest Ventana South, LLC, Highway 33 Pistachios, Assemi
3 Brothers LLC, and Assemi Group, Inc. (collectively "Ventana") propose to build : massive

4 pistachio processing facility on prime farmland in Fresno County. The project, as defined by

5 Ventana, includes over 300,000 square feet of buildings, 240 silos of 65 feet in height, over

6 million gallons of water tanks, and 104 twenty-seven-million btu/hour natural gas fired column

7 dryers plus other major infrastructure (the "Project"). The Project is proposed to be located

8 along West Kamm Avenue, between Interstate and Highway 33 in an unincorporated area of

9 Fresno County (the "Project Site").

10 2. Unsurprisingly, this massive facility requires multiple discretionary approvals

11 from Fresno County before it can be built. As a result, the County is required to comply with

12 California's landmark environmental protection law, the California Environmental Quality Act

13 ("CEQA"), before issuing any approvals that further the facility's construction. Ventana knows

14 this. The County knows this. However, the County is ignoring the law.

15 3. Despite CEQA's mandates, the County issued construction permits in furtherance
16 of the Project with full knowledge that discretionary permits were required for the Project, with

17 full knowledge that the discretionary permits had not been approved, and with full knowledge
18 that CEQA compliance was required. The County has refused to revoke these construction

19 permits for the Project. In fact, the County has continued to process additional approvals for the

20 facility in violation of CEQA.

21 4. Having received construction permits in violation of the County Code and in

22 violation of CEQA, Ventana doubled down and proceeded to build a number of silos that are at

23 least 60 feet in height without any permits at all. Ventana constructed these silos for the Project

24 on foundations built in violation of the law.

25 5. After Petitioner advised the County of the illegal construction on October 22,
26 2019, the County issued a limited stop work order pertaining only to the unpermitted work.

27 However, to date, the County has refused to revoke the illegally issued permits or to require

28 Ventana to remove the illegal construction. The County's failure to revoke the illegally issued
2
LATHAM&WATKINS«P
ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOs ANGELES VARDEOMPEAIFYRI YORNDAN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 permits and to require the illegal construction's removal violates the County's mandatory duty
2 under state law and the County Code.

3 6. Despite the significant potential of this massive industrial agricultural operation to

4 have irreversible adverse impacts on the environment, the County has not completed the required

5 CEQA review prior to issuing permits to authorize work in furtherance of the Project.

6 7. The County knew that it was required to comply with CEQA prior to the issuance

7 of any permits in furtherance of the Project. The County knew that necessary discretionary
8 permits were required for the Project before any construction could commence. Notwithstanding

9 this knowledge, the County has illegally issued permits for construction activities in furtherance
10 of the Project and turned a blind eye to on-going construction activities on the Project Site that

11 violate the County's Zoning Code ("Zoning Code"). In addition, the County has violated CEQA

12 by allowing continued construction work on a major development with potentially severe
13 environmental impacts prior to completing any of the required analysis of those impacts.

14 8. Continued construction at the Project Site could result in irrevocable adverse
15 environmental impacts and render the County's compliance with CEQA a mere post-hoc
16 rationalization for approving the Project-i.e., a meaningless paperwork exercise.

17 PARTIES

18 9. Petitioner Wonderful Nut Orchards LLC ("Petitioner") is a Delaware limited

19 liability company that owns pistachio farms and coordinates with related entities to process

20 pistachios in the County. Petitioner is committed to farming in a manner that minimizes

21 environmental impacts by employing sustainable farming practices including responsible water

22 management, careful soil maintenance, and a responsible integrated pest management program,
23 including employment of bio-rational pest control measures.

24 10. Respondent and Defendant County of Fresno and its Department of Public Works
25 and Planning (collectively the "County") has land use jurisdiction over the unincorporated areas
26 of the County, including the Project Site.

27 11. Real Party in Interest Ventana South, LLC is a California limited liability
28 company that, on information and belief owns the Project Site. Ventana is listed as the property

LATHAM&WATKINSw

owner on the various application materials submitted to the County associated with the Project.

2 12. Real Party in Interest Highway 33 Pistachios is listed as the applicant on the

3 Initial Study Application submitted to the County.

4 13. Real Party in Interest Assemi Brothers LLC is a California limited liability

company. Assemi Brothers LLC is listed as the address of Ventana on Construction Permit No.

6 19-104360-GR and Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC.

7 14. Real Party in Interest Assemi Group, Inc. is a California Corporation. Petitioner

8 is informed and believes that Assemi Group, Inc. completed pre-application review of the

9 Project with staff from the County's Department of Public Works and Planning prior to

10 submitting applications.

11 15. Petitioner is unaware of any other parties that CEQA or other applicable law

12 requires as named real parties or the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

13 fictitiously named herein as Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and sues each of the Real Parties in

14 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named

15 Real Parties in Interest's true names and capacities if ascertained.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 16. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the relief requested pursuant to Code of Civil

18 Procedure sections 526, 1060, and 1085 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

19 17. Venue in this court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

20 and 394, because the Project site is located in the unincorporated territory under the County's

21 land use jurisdiction.

22 18. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this Petition, including,

23 but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies or otherwise being excused therefrom
24 such requirement by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or unavailability of any other timely

25 review. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Petitioner provided Respondent

26 County with notice of intent to file this action on December 3, 2019. A true and accurate copy of
27 that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

28 19. Petitioner has standing to assert these claims because it has a material interest in

-

2 ensuring that the County properly analyzes and mitigates the effects associated with the Project

3 and otherwise complies with the law. Petitioner seeks to vindicate the substantial public interest

4 in protection of the environment and other interests alleged herein. Petitioner has no plain,
speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

5 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

6 20. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA imposes clear and substantive
7 responsibilities on agencies. CEQA requires that public agencies not approve projects that harm

8

9 the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are employed to minimize that
harm. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, subd. (b).)

10 21.

11 CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for

12 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foresecable

13 indirect physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378, subd. (a).)' "Where a
project involves an approval that contains elements of both ministerial action and a
14 discretionary action, the project will be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the
15 requirements of CEQA." (Id., 15268, subd. (d).)

16 22.

17 Agencies shall not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect
on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying
18 with CEQA. (Guidelines § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)

19 23. Under the CEQA Guidelines, "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
20 operation" must be considered in a project's Initial Study. (Guidelines § 15063, subd. (a)(1).)

21

22 The is "lead agency" is the public agency that has the principal responsibility for carrying out the

23 project and is responsible for conducting an Initial Study to determine, in consultation with other

24 relevant state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative declaration, or a
mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. a Resources Code §§ 21067;
25 21080.1, subd. (a); 21083, subd. (a).) Accordingly, public agencies may not "take any action"

26 that furthers a project "in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would

27

28 The CEQA Guidelines are codified at California Code of Regulations, title 14, sections 15000 et seq. and are hereafter referred to as the "Guidelines."

1 ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public project." (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood
2 (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138.)

3 24. Thus, CEQA does not permit the postponement of environmental review "to the

4 point where the 'bureaucratic and financial momentum'" has built up "irresistibly behind a

5 proposed project 'thus providing a strong incentive to ignore environmental concerns." (Save

6 Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at 135.)

7 25. Failure either to comply with CEQA's substantive requirements or to carry out the

8 full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed and

9 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

10 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different

11 result. (Pub. Resources Code § 21005.)

12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 A. Project Site

14 26. The Project Site, located at 34411 West Kamm Avenue in the Cantua Creek area
15 of the County, is under the land use jurisdiction of Respondent County of Fresno. The Project
16 Site is located less than one mile southwest of the California Aqueduct. The Project Site is a

17 generally unimproved, flat parcel surrounded by farms and other currently fallow farmland.

18 27. The Project Site is zoned AE-20. The AE zone, or Exclusive Agricultural

19 District, limits allowable uses to agricultural operations and uses necessary to support
20 agricultural production. The "-20" suffix indicates that the minimum lot size within the AE-20

21 zone is 20 acres.

22 28. In the AE Zone, Zoning Code (section 816.3) requires a Conditional Use Permit

23 for commercial pistachio processing.

24 29. Building height in the AE Zone is limited to 35 feet. (Zoning Code, § 816.5(D).)

25 B. Ventana Proposes the World's Single Largest Pistachio Processing Facility

26 30. Pursuant to the Project's applications, Ventana proposes to develop the project in

27 four phases.

28 31. The first phase of the Project would include 120,000 square-foot

20 storage silos, twenty 27 MMbtu/hour natural gas fired column dryers, a 21,600 square-foot huller

21 canopy, a 353,000 gallon water storage tank, two sand and media filters, two processed water

22 separators, and an 80-foot truck scale.

23 35. If all four phases of the Project are developed as proposed, Petitioner is informed

24 and believes that the Project would be the single largest pistachio processing facility in the

25 world.

26 C. The County Illegally Issues Permits for Forty-Nine Silo Foundations

27 36. The County knew about the Project's scale and the requirements for discretionary

12 Review Disclosure/Disclaimer form obtained from the County is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

13 39. On or about June 12, 2019, despite the County's prior statements that both
14 discretionary approvals were required and environmental review was required, the County issued

15 Construction Permit No. 19-104360-GR. This permit authorized Ventana to "Grade A level pad

16 for stag[e]ing area on the south side of road 1 mile w/o derrick" at the Project Site. A true and

17 correct copy of Construction Permit No. 19-104360-GR obtained from the County is attached

7 42.

8 The findings submitted in support of the Classified Conditional Use Permit and

9 Variance describe the Project and state that the Project will be developed in four phases.

43.

10 On or about August 29, 2019, Ventana, through Real Party in Interest Highway 33

11 Pistachios, submitted Initial Study Application (IS No. 7707). An Initial Study is a lead agency's

12 preliminary CEQA review of a proposed project, including all phases of construction and

27 prepare the required CEQA review. A true and correct copy of the cover letter requesting

28 comment from other County departments obtained from the County is attached hereto as Exhibit
9. The letter attached the applications, the submitted plans, and the revised findings. The letter

2 46. On or about October 30, 2019, Ventana submitted revised application materials to

3 the County, including an updated Initial Study Application.

10 as Exhibit 10. The letter attached the applications, the submitted plans, and the revised findings.

11 The letter noted that that comments must be submitted by November 11, 2019, and stated that

13 written comments related to the Project.

14 E. The County Fails to Undertake Required Corrective Actions

15 48. In the summer of 2019, Petitioner became aware that construction was occurring

16 on the Project Site. This work included grading and earthmoving activities utilizing heavy-duty

17 construction equipment.

18 49. On or about October 22, 2019, counsel for Petitioner submitted a Building
19 Codes/Zoning Ordinance Violation Complaint Form to the County detailing the illegal activities.

20 A true and correct copy of this form is attached as Exhibit 11. The complaint stated that

21 earthmoving and testing activities in furtherance of the Project were on-going on the Project Site

22 and requested that the County revoke the previously issued construction permits and issue a stop- a

23 work order until all required CEQA review was completed.

24 50. On or about October 23, 2019, counsel for Petitioner submitted to the County
25 another letter providing additional information related to the construction permits that the County

26 had issued to authorize construction work on the Project Site and again requesting that the

27 County revoke the previously issued permits and issue a stop-work order. A true and correct

28 copy of this letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 12.

address."

10 52. The October 30, 2019, letter took the position that Construction Permit No. 19-

11 107012 "was issued because the property owner is entitled as a matter of right to have 'farm
12 buildings of all kinds and that "the Department is required by law to issue this ministerial

13 permit."

14 53. On or about October 31, 2019, representatives for Petitioner documented

15 construction on the Project Site, including earthmoving work and the erection of silos and other
16 buildings. Heavy duty construction equipment was on the Project Site, indicating that work was

17 on-going.

18 54. On or about October 31, 2019, counsel for Petitioner provided additional legal
19 authority demonstrating that no construction work associated with the Project could proceed
20 prior to the County's completion of the required CEQA analysis and issuance of required

21 discretionary permits as required by the Zoning Code. A true and correct copy of this letter is

22 attached hereto as Exhibit 14. In this correspondence, counsel for Petitioner provided photos
23 demonstrating that illegal structures were constructed on the Project Site.

24 55. As shown in the below photograph taken on or about October 31, 2019, Ventana
25 has already illegally constructed multiple 60-foot tall silos, other structures, and related
26 infrastructure on the Property.

10 F. The County Continues to Process Approvals in Furtherance of The Project
11 56. On or about August 30, 2019, Ventana submitted a petition to the County to
12 cancel Agricultural Land Conservation Contract No. 1839 and partially cancel Agricultural Land
13 Conservation Contract No. 365 which are associated with the Project Site (collectively, the
14 Contracts"). A true and correct copy of that petition obtained from the County is attached hereto
15 as Exhibit 15.
16 57. The County reviewed Ventana's petition and prepared a staff report for
17 presentation to the County's Agricultural Lands Conservation Committee that recommended
18 approval of the requested cancellation of the Contracts. The staff report makes clear that the
19 cancellation of the Contracts is a necessary step in connection with the construction of the
20 Project. A true and correct copy of the staff report obtained from the County is attached hereto
21 as Exhibit 16.
22 58. Petitioner is informed and believes that on November 6, 2019, the County's
23 Agricultural Lands Conservation Committee held a hearing at which they voted to recommend
24 the cancellation of the Contracts. A true and correct copy of the agenda obtained from the
25 County is attached hereto as Exhibit 17. This hearing occurred after counsel for the Petitioner
26 had alerted the County to potential violations of CEQA associated with processing Project-
27 related approvals prior to completing the necessary environmental review.

- FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 59. (Violation of CEQA - Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et. seq.)

4 Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations contained in
paragraphs through 58, inclusive, as if set forth fully herein in full.

5 60.

6 At all times relevant to this action, Respondent County was the lead agency
responsible for reviewing the Project pursuant to CEQA.

7 61.

8 The County violated CEQA by failing to complete the required CEQA

9 compliance prior to authorizing construction work in furtherance of the Project. The County
issued Construction Permit No. 19-107012 after Ventana had submitted applications for
10 discretionary approval to authorize the conditional use permit for the Project and before the

11 County had issued such discretionary approval.

12 62.

13 Work authorized under the Construction Permits is in furtherance of the Project.

14 The County was aware that Ventana was planning to develop the Project and the County had

15 advised that the Project would require discretionary approvals. The County was also aware that
the County had not issued such Project discretionary approvals before the County issued the
16 Construction Permits.

17 63.

18 The Project is "project" under CEQA. The Guidelines define a project as "the
whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either : direct physical change to the
19 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment"

20

21 (Guidelines, § 15378 subd. (a)) and require that "all phases of project planning, implementation,

22 and operation" must be considered in the Initial Study for a project (Guidelines, § 15063 subd.
(a)(1)) prior to issuing a discretionary approval.

23 64.

24 CEQA analysis, including any EIR, "should be prepared as early in the planning
process as possible to enable environmental considerations to influence project, program, or
25 design." (Bozung v. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) CEQA review and the application of

26 CEQA procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry out the
27 legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental
28 consequences in mind." (Id. at 283.)

LATHAM&WATKINSw 13

65. Where an approval is "an essential step leading to ultimate environmental impact

2 [l it is therefore . a 'project' within the scope of CEQA. (Fullerton Joint Union High School

3 Dist. v. State Bd. of Education (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 797.)

4 66. "[T]he later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic and

5 financial momentum there is behind a proposed project." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.

6 Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.)

7 67. CEQA Guidelines section 15004 subd. (b)(2)(B) provides that public agencies
8  should not "take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner

9 that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review

10 of that public project."
11 68. While "[m]inisterial projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA"
12 (CEQA Guidelines section 15268, subd. (a)), "[w]here project involves an approval that
13 contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the project will be

14 deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of CEQA." (Guidelines {

15 15268, subd. (d).)

16 69. A discretionary project is "a project which requires the exercise of judgment or
17 deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular
18 activity." (Guidelines, § 15357.) "Approval" is defined as "the decision by a public agency

19 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to project intended to be

20 carried out by any person." (Id., § 15352, subd. (a).) CEQA requires that "[b]efore any approval

21 of a project subject to CEQA" that the lead agency shall consider final CEQA determination.
22 70. CEQA Guidelines section 15063, subd. (a)(1), requires that "[a]II phases of
23 project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the initial study of the

24 project."

25 71. Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC authorized the development of
26 foundations for 49 silos on the Project Site that are part of the Project. Construction Permit No.
27 19-104360-GR authorized construction of a staging area pad for the Project.

28 72. The issuance of Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC and Construction Permit
14
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT ! )F MANDA
LOS ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

No. 19-104360-GR are necessary components of the County's discretionary review of the

2 Project.

3 73. The Project's proposed silos require a Variance to deviate from the 35-foot height

4 limit in the AE-20 zone.

74. The Project's proposed use requires a Classified Conditional Use Permit to

6 authorize the commercial pistachio processing facility at the Project Site.

7 75. The County has confirmed that no building permits should issue for the

8 processing facility because "CUP 3658 must be approved prior to permits." Yet, the County did
issue Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC and Construction Permit No. 19-104360-GR in

10 violation of CEQA, and its own Codes. Despite requests by Petitioner to revoke the

11 Construction Permits, the County has not revoked such illegally issued permits.

12 76. The County violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

13 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its issuance

14 of Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC because, without limitation, the County failed to

15 subject Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC and the Project to an Initial Study or other
16 environmental assessment as CEQA requires.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of Zoning Ordinance of the County of Fresno : 864)

19 77. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations contained in
20 paragraphs 1 through 76, inclusive, as if set forth fully herein in full.

21 78. Zoning Code section 864 states that "[b]efore commencing any work pertaining to

22 the erection, construction, reconstruction, moving, conversion or alteration of any building, or

23 any addition to any building, a permit shall be secured from the Division of Building and Safety
24 of the Department of Resources and Development by any owner or his agent for said work, and it

25 shall be unlawful to commence any work until and unless such permit shall have been obtained."

26 79. Construction has commenced on the Project Site. Based on information and
27 belief, construction activities have proceeded well beyond what the County illegally authorized
28 under Construction Permits 19-104360-GR and 19-107012-FC. For example, silos and related
15
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATI
LOS ANGELES AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

infrastructure have been erected on the Project Site while the issued permits limited authorized

2 activities to grading and the construction of foundations.

3 80. The Real Parties violated the Zoning Code by undertaking construction activities

4 that were not authorized by the permits that had been issued.

5 81. Further, the County failed to discharge its ministerial duties under Zoning Code

6 section 864 by allowing unpermitted construction activities to commence and continue on the

7 Project Site. Petitioner is informed and believes that the County was aware of the illegal
8 construction of silos and related facilities at the Project Site.

9 82. The County has a ministerial duty to ensure that the County Code is fully

10 implemented. The County has failed to do so and has permitted Real Parties' illegal construction

11 to remain.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following:

14 A. For a writ of mandate directing the County to comply with the law and:

15 a. Directing the County to refrain from issuing any permits for the Project or any

16 other actions in furtherance of the project until such time that all required environmental review

17 is completed in compliance with CEQA;

18 b. Directing the County to rescind Construction Permit No. 19-104360-GR and

19 Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC No. within 10 days of issuance of the writ and refrain

20 from re-issuance of such permits until such time that all required environmental review is

21 completed in compliance with CEQA;

22 B. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction

23 against the County its departments, elected officials, and employees, enjoining them from
24 authorizing additional construction permits for construction work at the Project Site until such

25 time that all required environmental review is completed in compliance with CEQA

26 C. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction

27 against Real Parties enjoining them from additional construction work at the Project Site until

28 such time that all required environmental review is completed in compliance with CEQA and

Fresno, CA 93711

Dear Mr. Roberts:

Pre-Application Review No. 39674
Subject Assessor's Parcel No. 038-300-17S

Project Location: The subject parcel is located on the south side of W. Kamm Avenue, approximately one mile west of its intersection with S. Derrick Avenue.
Proposal: Allow the development of a pistachio processing facility with 36 silos, standing 54 feet in height, and a large day nursery on a 155.76-acre parcel in the AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size) Zone District.
A Director Review and Approval (DRA) is required to allow a large day nursery in the AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size) Zone District. A Classified Conditional
Use Permit (CUP) is required to allow a value-added agricultural facility not specified in the AE- 20 Zone District, to include the proposed pistachio processing facility. A Variance (VA) is required to allow any development in the AE-20 Zone District that exceeds 35 feet in height, to include the proposed silos. I am enclosing the necessary forms to return for a complete application.

Per the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), your project will require the preparation of an Initial Study. An Initial Study form has been enclosed. This form provides information from
the California Department of Fish & Wildlife (CDFW) regarding legislation and determinations of "no effect". Staff of the Development Services and Capital Projects Division cannot make a "De Minimis" Finding allowing an exception to CDFW fees involved with the preparation and posting of environmental documents. Should you believe your project has no effect on resources under the purview and/or protection of CDFW, it will be necessary for you to contact that agency directly to obtain a written determination of no effect prior to completion of your environmental
document.

Your property is enrolled in the Agricultural Land Conservation (Williamson Act) Program. As such, the uses permitted under Contract are restricted. Please contact the Policy Planning
Section of the Development Services and Capital Projects Division at (559) 600-4022 regarding
the steps you must take to identify and resolve any conflicts between your proposed uses and the existing Contract. Our staff will not be able to complete our review of the proposed
applications without a determination from the Policy Planning Section that all necessary steps

Jeffrey T. Roberts

have been taken to ensure that there are no conflicts between the Contract and the proposed
uses.

You should be aware that in order to approve a Conditional Use Permit, the Fresno County Ordinance Code requires that four mandatory Findings of Fact must exist before a Conditional Use Permit may be granted (see Conditional Use Permit Findings on the back of the application form). Additionally, in order to approve a Director Review and Approval or Variance, the Fresno County Ordinance Code requires that four mandatory Findings of Fact, specific to each project, exist before approval may be granted (see enclosed Director Review and Approval and Variance handouts). Your application will be reviewed and a staff recommendation will be made based upon these mandatory Findings.
Your property is located in an area of agricultural land use. As such, the proposal will be routed to the Fresno County Department of Agriculture for review and comment by staff of the
Agricultural Commissioner's Office. A Project Review Fee of $152.00 will be charged for review
by this Department.

You are located within the jurisdiction of the Fresno County Fire Protection District.
The Fresno County Fire Protection District conducts plan reviews on all projects to confirm that certain fire and life safety issues are addressed. Some examples of fire and life safety issues are fire apparatus access, fire lanes, gates, water supply systems, fire suppression systems, fire alarm systems, high-piled storage, evacuation plans, exiting systems, and hazardous materials storage.

It is suggested that you contact the Fresno County Fire Protection District at (559) 493-
4359 to schedule a meeting to discuss the specific fire protection requirements for the
project during the design stage of the project.

Below are the filing requirements for your project:
Application Form: This application is a green form. Please fully complete the owner, applicant, and representative portions of the application. All owners included on the Grant Deed must sign the application. An electronic version of the form is available. Please
contact us via email to receive the electronic version.

Legal Description: Submit a copy of the Grant Deed to the property with the legal description. (Note: The legal description must correlate with the property boundaries depicted on the Site Plan drawing.)
Site Plans, Floor Plans and Elevations: Four (4) folded copies of a detailed Site Plan are
required. We route projects for comments electronically, therefore we request that electronic
versions of all drawings be submitted in PDF format. If that is not possible, we require one
black-line print in either 8½"x11" or 11"x17" size so that it can be it scanned.Please refer to the back of the application for detailed requirements on preparing Site Plans. It is important that all requirements are met in order for the Site Plan to be acceptable. Therefore, you may wish to review the Site Plan with a Planner prior to submitting the application. In addition, four (4) folded copies of the Floor Plan and Elevations are required, as well as an electronic
PDF version or reduction as described above.

Variance Findings: Please submit a detailed, typed document that addresses each of the four Variance Findings that appear on the reverse side of the application. Generally, applicants will address each finding individually. These findings should be tailored to the portion of your project that requires Variance (constructing silos that are more than 35 feet in height). Please call me if you have questions regarding the Variance Findings. The Planning Commission must find that all four apply to your project in order for it to be
approved.

Project Description/Operational Statement: Please provide a complete, detailed description of the proposed use. Enclosed is a checklist of considerations that must be addressed. The Operational Statement must be on a separate sheet of a paper and should be
typed.

Photographs: Provide labeled photos of panoramic views of the property (north, south,
east, and west).
As prescribed by the Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission will make a decision on the application following a public hearing. The Planning Commission hearing should occur

approximately four to six months from the date the application is submitted; however, this time
frame will be extended if reviewers request additional information, or if review by the State Clearinghouse is needed. Please note that if review comments are not received from certain key reviewing agencies in response to our initial request for comments, staff will continue to pursue
formal comments from those agencies so as to provide for the most complete project analysis possible. This may result in additional processing time. Also, please note that an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision would add additional time because it would necessitate a hearing before the Board of Supervisors, who would then make the final decision.
In order to save time processing your application, we recommend that you or your
representative schedule a meeting to review your application submittal prior to filing a
formal application.

If you have any questions regarding the information described in this letter, or wish to schedule a meeting concerning the filing of an application, please contact me at dacrider@fresnocountyca.gov or (559) 600-9669.

PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW DISCLOSURE/DISCLAIMER

Completion of a Pre-Application Review is no longer a mandatory step necessary in order to submit a land use or mapping application to the Fresno County, Depariment of Publio Works and Planning, Development Services Division for processing. The purpose of the Pre-Application Review is to allow the customer and slaff to exchange information and confirm the necessary applicalion process, required fees, and submittal malerial prior to the customer paying the actual application fees. Specifically, during the Pre-Application Review process, staff researches and provides the following information:
If the proposed use is allowed based on the zoning of the subject parcel; the type(s) of application(s) required to permit the proposal to be processed.
If the subject aite is a legal parcel (Note: If the parcel is not legally creafed, no land use/mapping application can be processed until the legality issue is resolved).
The anticipated level of environmental review.
If the project site is under the Williamson Act Contract and If the proposed use is permilted under the Contract.

If the site is located within a special district and if special considerations may be applicable to the project.

• Required application forms, filing fees, and filing requirements/materials.
While the Pre-Application Review is an option for any prospective application, in those cases where an applicant opts not to file for completion of a Pre-Application Review, the information research noted above that typically results from the Pre-Application Revlew process may not be realized until after the application fees have been accepted and the project has been routed for comment. This being the case, unexpected issues may arise that could impact the processing timeline and cost of the application and/or impact the determinalion BS to whether the application can even continue to be processed as originally submitted. Please nole thal if the application cannot be processed as submitted, the processing fees expended thus far will not be refunded.
By opting out of the Pre-Application Review process, I hereby acknowledge the potential for addilional application processing delays and costs.

There are no caretakers living on site.

Regular traffic to and from the site will consist of 4 types of vehicles: 1) Employee vehicles
2) Harvest trucks (bring raw product on-site) 3) Shipping trucks (take processed product off-site) 4) Delivery vehicles

Emplovee Vehicles
From January to August, there will be 60 employees entering the site 5 days a week.
During harvest, there will be 100 employees entering the site 7 days a week. After harvest ends in October to December, there will be 60 employees entering the plant 5 days a week. Given the distance of the site from any major towns plus only a single shift per workday, the rideshare rate is expected to be approximately 69%.

Harvest Trucks
During harvest, 200 harvest trucks will enter the site daily, These trucks will be routed from the source orchard to Highway 33 or 15, then to the plant via West Kamm Avenue. There will not be any harvest trucks received during the off-season.

Shipping Trucks
From harvest to December the company expects to receive 12 shipping trucks a
7 day, 7 days a week. Following harvest season, this will decrease to 3 shipping trucks per day, 5 days a week. This quantity will be maintained throughout the year until the beginning of harvest in September the following year.

Delivery Vehicles There will be an estimated 10 delivery vehicles received per day at the site during Phase 1. This includes visitors, delivery trucks (UPS, FedEx, etc.), and regularly scheduled private trash service vehicles.

Water for the site will be provided by Westlands Water District. During harvest, the
water will be used primarily by the hullers. Outside of harvest, the water will be utilized
primarily by the roaster. See the below table for water use during and outside of harvest

Once utilized, the water will be collected a by a floor conveyance system and pumped through a bank of parabolic screens to remove large solids and into (2) fenced on-site settling basins. Water basins will be expanded as needed for future phases. The water will then be pumped into an existing irrigation line to be discharged onto orchards.
Sewage from the plant will be connected to new septic systems. Defrost water and
storm water runoff will be directed to a fenced ponding basin on the northeast corner of
the property.

The plant will recycle as much paper and cardboard waste as possible. The recyclable materials and trash are taken off-site by a private trash service. The hulls from
the pistachios will be pressed to reduce the moisture percentage and then shipped out
and sold as cattle feed. Twigs, leaves, and chaff from harvesting will be composted and
used or sold as mulch.

Findings for the Varlance Request for: RESD
Touchstone Pistachio Company SEP 0 5 2019
1306 W. Herndon, Suite 101 DEPARTAIENT WORKS

Fresno, CA DEVELOPMENT SERVICES OIISION

Site Location: South Side of Kamm Avenue, 1.68 miles West of Highway 33 VA 4070
APN #:038-300-17s (Renbed
Description of Variance Request: Aindings) Highway 33 Pistachios LLC, (Highway 33) is requesting a height variance to allow the construction of a pistachio processing plant on APN # 038-300-17s. The nature of the equipment used in processing and storing the pistachios requires construction of a building with a 47-2" above grade ridge height, with two Bag houses 67'-7" above gräde, silos 54'-11" above grade and conveyors and equipment at the silos with a maximum height of 64'-8" above grade.

Finding 1 The AE zone district allows the development of produce processing such as the proposed nut processing facility, so the use Is consistent with the zone district. Highway 33 owns and farms approximately 8000 acres in the adjacent area. So, the location of this facility is the ideal choice for the proposed plant. Most nut plants have equipment taller than the 35' height limitation. At this plant, due to the size of the farming operatjons, the equipment used to handle the crops is taller than some other installations. It is a better utilization of land to increase the height of the tanks for increased capacity (and related equipment) than to spread out the plant and utilize more farm land. It is also more cost-effective.

What differentiates this property from other similarly zoned properties is the unique location surrounded by the 8000 acres of farm land owned and farmed by the owners of
this property. The volume of product grown nearby is uniquely large.

Finding 2 Building the plant is allowed by Fresno County Ordinance Section 816.1.F. This is a right enloyed by other property owners in district. The construction of the project exceeding the height limitations will allow the user the right to. cost-effectively, build the plant. Without the granting of this variance, the construction would require more land to be taken out of agricultural production. The 35' height is typically exceeded in most nut processing plants as would be constructed within the zone district.

Page 1 of 2

60

Finding 3 The site is located within the central area of the owners 8000 acres of pistachios. By granting the variance and allówing the plant to be constructed cost-effectively on this site will reduce truck emissions in the area. Currently the pistachios are transported by truck to facilities over 21 miles away. Most of the harvest will be transported less than 5 miles to the new facility. Much of the transportation will be on ranch roads and not the
public way. Thus, the Granting of this variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to neighboring properties in the vicinity.
Finding 4 The granting of the variance will allow the best use of the land for an ag-related use consistent with the County's General plan, therefore; the granting of the variance is not contrary te County's General Plan.

Re: Ventana South, LLC Commercial Pistachio Processing Facility

Dear Mr. Ahmad:

We are writing regarding the commercial pistachio processing facility Ventana South,
LLC ("Ventana") has proposed along West Kamm Avenue, between Interstate 5 and Highway
33 ("Project Site").
We understand that your office is currently preparing an Initial Study (Initial Study Application No. 7707) associated with Classified Conditional Use Permit Application No. 3658 and Variance Application No. 4070 for Ventana's proposed facility (the "Project"). We also understand that earthmoving and testing at the Project Site in furtherance of the Project is ongoing. We are informed by the County of Fresno ("County") Building and Safety Code Enforcement that two permits have been issued to authorize this work.
The County's issuance of these permits was improper. The County has not completed environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Because the County has not completed environmental review, the County cannot issue any permits, ministerial or otherwise, for the Project. Therefore, we respectfully request that the County revoke these permits and order all work stopped until the County has completed the required
environmental review.

A. Environmental Review Must Precede the Issuance of ALL Project Permits
We are concerned that the work authorized by the issued permits represents the first step in the Project's development. If this is the case, environmental review must be completed prior to implementation of any activities in furtherance of the Project, including preliminary development activities that the County has already authorized and are currently underway. A
failure to consider the full environmental impacts of Ventana's massive Project as a whole would
constitute improper piecemealing in violation of CEQA.

70

It appears that Ventana is attempting to fast-track development of the Project and avoid any meaningful environmental review by commencing development of the Project prior to the County's approval of the discretionary actions required to authorize it. As the issued permits authorize work that is part of the larger Project, the required CEQA review must be conducted for the entire Project prior to the continuance of those activities. Here, the County has not even completed an Initial Study to identify the appropriate level of CEQA review, yet Ventana has already commenced construction activities for the Project.
The CEQA analysis, and any EIR "should be prepared as early in the planning process as possible to enable environmental considerations to influence project, program, or design." (Bozung V. LAFCo. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) Where an approval is "an essential step leading to ultimate environmental impact [] it is therefore ... a 'project' within the scope of CEQA. (Fullerton Joint Union High School Dist. v. State Bd. of Education (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779, 797.)
The Supreme Court has also held "that the later the environmental review process begins, the more bureaucratic and financial momentum there is behind a proposed project." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.) For those reasons, the CEQA Guidelines at section 15004 subdivision (b)(2)(B), provide that public agencies should not "take any action which gives impetus to a planned or foreseeable project a in a
manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of
CEQA review of that public project."
CEQA, the Guidelines, and long-standing precedent make clear that CEQA review must precede, and not follow, public agency action to move a forward with a planned project. The Guidelines define project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" (Guidelines §15378 subd. (a)), and require that *all phases of project planning, implementation, and operation" must be considered in the Initial Study for project (Guidelines, §15063 subd. (a)(1), emphasis added). CEQA review and the application of CEQA
procedures must be followed at all stages of project consideration, to carry out the legislative intent "to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Bozung, supra, 13 Cal.3d 263, 283.)
The Guidelines are clear that a "project" may require multiple government approvals, but that it is the overall activity, and not each individual approval, that is the "project" for CEQA
purposes. (Guidelines §15378 subd. (c).) CEQA's requirements become applicable with the taking of the first significant step towards overall approval of the project, rather than solely at final project approval; the first step in the approval process, not the last step, is when the CEQA process first applies: "EIR's should be prepared as early in the planning process as possible to enable environmental considerations to influence project, program or design.' [citation]."
(Bozung, supra, 13 Cal.3d 263, 282.) Any other approach could result in the freezing in place of project characteristics without examining or mitigating their potential to harm the environment,
and the locking out of consideration of project alternatives that are identified by later environmental review. "Decisions reflecting environmental considerations could most easily be made when other basic decisions were being made, that is, during the early stage of project conceptualization, design and planning." (Citizens for Responsible Government v. City of Albany (1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 1199, 1221 (quotations omitted).)

71

The law is clear neither a lead agency nor a project applicant can piecemeal a single,
integrated development into smaller parts to avoid conducting a comprehensive CEQA
assessment of the entire project. Where, as in the case here, a project applicant makes clear that
it has a comprehensive development plan and ministerial and discretionary approvals are necessary to complete that development, the lead agency is required to consider all ministerial actions in conjunction with the project's discretionary approvals and conduct the environmental
review required by CEQA. This means that no permits, ministerial or otherwise, may issue until environmental review for the entire Project is complete.

B. The County Must Also Analyze the Future Discretionary Actions Required for the Project's Development

CEQA's Guidelines define "project" as "the whole of an action." (CEQA Guidelines §
15378 subd. (a).) This definition includes all phases of a project that are reasonably foresecable, and all related activities that are directly linked to the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15378 subd. (a), subd. (c)-(d).) Thus, any future phases of the Project and any approvals required to authorize those development activities must be evaluated. (Pub. Res. Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines § 15378 subd. (a); Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 166-167.)
In Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,
396, the California Supreme Court set forth two-part test for determining when future actions
must be included within the definition of a "project" for purposes of CEQA: "(1) it is a
reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects." In Laurel Heights, the University of California planned to transfer
medical laboratories to an office building located within a residential neighborhood. Initially,
the laboratories were to occupy 100,000 square feet of a 354,000-square-foot building. The University claimed that it had not formally decided to occupy the entire building, but the court noted that statements by the chancellor in the final EIR, public releases in newsletters, public meeting minutes, and private correspondence all indicated the University's intent to occupy the entire building when another agency's lease expired in several years. Accordingly, there was "credible and substantial evidence" that the University's occupancy of the entire building was a
reasonably foreseeable consequence of the decision to move into the building. (Id. at 398.)
Here, development of the subsequent phases of the Project are a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the issued permits. The applicant has described these subsequent development activities within the Conditional Use Permit and Variance application submittals. The four phases of development will result in a massive processing facility that clearly has the potential to
severely impact the environment without required mitigation. CEQA requires that this larger
Project be analyzed now and prior to the issuance of any permits in furtherance of its
construction. Thus, the County must undertake a comprehensive CEQA analysis of the entire
Project now and before any additional development activities are allowed to continue.

C. Conclusion

We understand that the County has requested additional information from Ventana related to the Project to aid it in conducting the required CEQA review. Ventana must not be allowed to continue any development activities prior to the County's completion of that required CEQA review.
We respectfully request that the County revoke all issued permits and order Ventana to stop development activities immediately. The County must also complete the Initial Study and any required CEQA analysis prior to reinstating the issued permits or granting any additional actions associated with the Project.
Very truly yours,

Re: Ventana South, LLC Commercial Pistachio Processing Facility

Dear Mr. Ahmad:

Yesterday we sent you a letter regarding the ongoing construction work related to the commercial pistachio processing facility ("Project") proposed by Ventana South, LLC ("Ventana") at 34411 West Kamm Avenue, Cantua Creek, CA (*Project Site"). As we understand, Ventana submitted for a Classified Condition Use Permit, a Variance, and an Initial Study on or near the end of August 2019. We are now in receipt of a copy of Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC, which was issued by the County on September 6, 2019 and relates to construction of foundations for 49 silos on the Project Site. This permit was issued after Ventana submitted its applications and while those applications were under review by the County.
We also are in receipt of a Plan Check Triage sheet for Plan Check No. 19-0679, which is associated with the Project Site. This form relates to a permit request submitted on September 25, 2019 and includes a note stating that Conditional Use Permit Application No. 3658 (the application for Ventana's Project) must be approved prior to issuance of permits. On this sheet, the County notes that no permits for work associated with the Project can be issued prior to the
approval of the entitlements requested to authorize the Project.
As the Plan Check Triage makes clear and the County clearly understood, no permits can be issued prior to the approval of the Classified Condition Use Permit. Consistent with the acknowledgement on the Plan Check Triage sheet, the issuance of Construction Permit No. 19-
107012-FC was improper and it should be revoked.
We understand that earthmoving and testing activities are ongoing on the Project Site in furtherance of the Project. It is unclear whether those activities have been authorized by Construction Permit No. 19-107012-FC or any other permit issued by the County. We respectfully reiterate our request that the County promptly revoke Construction Permit No. 19- 107012-FC and any other permits issued for development activities relating to the Project. We

also request that the County order Ventana to immediately stop all development activities on the
Project Site.

Subject: 34411 West Kamm Avenue

Dear Mr. Mihlsten:

The Department of Public Works and Planning (Department) is in receipt of your three letters, dated October 22, 23, and 24, 2019 regarding the above address. The first two letters request the Department to take certain action. The third letter is a detailed request for public records
under the Public Records Act. This letter responds to your October 22 and 23 letters.

The Department is processing Initial Study Application No. 7707, Classified Conditional Use
Permit Application No. 3658, and Variance Application No. 4070, proposing to allow a commercial pistachio processing facility with land application of process water, and will not issue permits for any work covered by those applications until they are approved and the

adopted. required environmental review is completed with appropriate mitigation incorporated and

On October 28, 2019, the Department issued stop-work notices for all unpermitted construction that was occurring at 34411 West Kamm Avenue (Please see Attachment "A"). Nö work, to my knowledge, is currently taking place at that address.
Building Permit No. 19-107012 issued by the Department on September 6, 2019, is a ministerial a action that allows construction of foundations for 49 silos. It does not include any use requiring a conditional use permit or discretionary approval. Permit No. 19-107012 was issued because is the property owner is entitled as a matter of right to have "farm buildings of all kinds" on property
issue this ministerial permit. within the County's AE-20 zone district. We believe that the Department is required by law to

Based on your letters, it appears that you believe that Permit No. 19-107012 was issued improperly, and you refer to general CEQA law based on a general understanding of what you perceive. We would like to know whether there are specific facts that you believe we should
know about or specific legal authority that says that the Department may not issue this ministerial permit. This would help the Department give an informed reply to your first two letters. However, you informed our attorney within the County Counsel's Office, that you will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of your client, the Wonderful Company, within the next two days.

Because the Department already issued stop-work notices for the property, and because we are still open to a dialog on this matter, the Department believes this lawsuit is premature. As a result, we ask that you delay filing the lawsuit. Please send your reply to this request to Deputy County Counsel Bryan Rome at brome@fresnocountyca.gov.

Re: Ventana South, LLC Commercial Pistachio Processing Facility

Dear Mr. Rome and Mr. Kettler:

Thank you for your letter dated October 30, 2019 regarding the unpermitted construction
work occurring at 34411 West Kamm Avenue ("Project Site"). We appreciate your swift
attention to this matter and are writing in response to your letter.

We believe that all work on the Project Site, whether being done pursuant to an issued building permit or otherwise, must stop immediately to allow the County of Fresno to comply with CEQA and the County Code. Please confirm that this has occurred and that there is no construction work occurring at the Project Site.
As to the issuance of Building Permit No. 19-107012, the County issued it in error for
several reasons. Your letter states that the issuance of a permit for foundations for 49 silos is a
ministerial permit. Putting aside whether or not that is the case under the County Code, CEQA is
clear that where project requires both a ministerial and discretionary permit the project is
subject to CEQA. CEQA Guidelines Section 15268(d) is explicit on this point.
Where a project involves an approval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the project will
be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the
requirements of CEQA.

92

Whether the building permit for foundations for 49 silos is ministerial or discretionary, it is part
of the Ventana South project, and it should not have been issued until the CEQA review process was completed (as well as the associated land use actions).
Moreover, the courts have confirmed that a municipality's classification of a certain approval process as ministerial is not conclusive. "The applicability of CEQA cannot be made to depend upon the unfettered discretion of local agencies, for local agencies must act in accordance with state guidelines and the objectives of CEQA." (Day v. City of Glendale (1975)
51 Cal.App.3d 817, 822.) In fact, the silos and their related foundations require discretionary approvals as is evidenced by the County Code and by the applicant's own admission for at least
two reasons.

First, the silos exceed the 35-foot height limitation established by the County in the AE- 20 zone. Recognizing this, Ventana South has applied for a variance to permit the 65-foot tall
silos. A variance is a discretionary process under the County Code. (See Section 877.) Because
the silos require a discretionary approval in addition to building permits, they are a project subject to CEQA. Since no CEQA review has been completed for the discretionary variance, nor has the variance been issued, Building Permit No. 19-107012 was issued in error.
Second, the silos are part of an industrial facility that requires a discretionary conditional use permit. Ventana South has applied for a conditional use permit. Ventana South describes the pistachio processing plant as including 280 48' x 65° tall storage silos. (See attached Exhibit 1.) Ventana South submitted its application to the County before the County issued Building
Permit No. 19-107012. Therefore, the County was aware that the preliminary silo foundation
work was part of a larger development requiring a discretionary conditional use permit. Again, since no CEQA review has been completed for the discretionary conditional use permit, nor has the conditional use permit been issued, Building Permit No. 19-107012 was issued in error.
The County has already recognized that permits that may otherwise be ministerial cannot be issued for the processing facility becaus "CUP 3658 must be approved prior to permits." (See attached Exhibit 2.) Building Permit No. 19-107012 is no different. Because the County issued it in error, it must be revoked and all work pursuant to it or any other permit must remain
stopped until the County completes its discretionary review and complies with CEQA.
Lastly, we note that Building Permit No. 19-107012 only authorized "construction of 49 silo foundations." Per the attached pictures attached as Exhibit 3, silos have been illegally constructed at the Project Site. To the best of our knowledge, the County never issued a permit for the construction of these silos (and other associated facilities which appear to have been constructed on the Project Site). Building Permit No. 19-107012 confirms that "[n]o other work is authorized" by the permit. Further, the County's Zoning Code requires that permits must be secured for all construction work prior to commencement of those activities. (Zoning Ordinance of the County of Fresno, Section 864.)
Because Ventana South undertook construction without a permit, in addition to stopping all work, we respectfully request that you order Ventana South to remove the illegally
constructed silos and related facilities.

In Phase 1, from January to the start of harvest, around the beginning of September, there will be 60 full-time employees operating the processing equipment over (2) 8-hour shifts, 5 days a week. During harvest, roughly September to mid-October, there will be 60 full-time employees operating the processing equipment over (2) 12-hour shifts, 7 days a week. There will be 40 additional employees operating the receiving, hulling, and drying equipment over (2) 12-hour shifts per day, 7 days a week. After harvest ends in October to December, there will be 60 full-time employees operating the processing equipment over (2) 8-hour shifts, 5 days a week. In Phases 2-4, the shift hours and days will remain the same, but the number of employees will increase as shown in the table below.

There are no caretakers living on site.

Regular traffic to and from the site will consist of 4 types of vehicles: 1) Employee vehicles 2) Harvest trucks (bring raw product on-site) 3) Shipping trucks (take processed product off-site) 4) Delivery vehicles

Emplovee Vehicles
From January to August, there will be 60 employees entering the site 5 days a week.
During harvest, there will be 100 employees entering the site 7 days a week. 7 After harvest ends in October to December, there will be 60 employees entering the plant 5 days week. Given the distance of the site from any major towns plus only a single shift per workday, the rideshare rate is expected to be approximately 69%.

Harvest Trucks
During harvest, 200 harvest trucks will enter the site daily. These trucks will be
routed from the source orchard to Highway 33 or 15, then to the plant via West Kamm Avenue. There will not be any harvest trucks received during the off-season.

Shipping Trucks
From harvest to December the company expects to receive 12 shipping trucks a day, 7 days a week. Following harvest season, this will decrease to shipping trucks per day, 5 days a week. This quantity will be maintained throughout the year until the beginning of harvest in September the following year.
Delivery Vehicles
There will be an estimated 10 delivery vehicles received per day at the site during Phase 1. This includes visitors, delivery trucks (UPS, FedEx, etc.), and regularly
scheduled private trash service vehicles.

Water for the site will be provided by Westlands Water District. During harvest, the
water will be used primarily by the hullers. Outside of harvest, the water will be utilized
primarily by the roaster. See the below table for water use during and outside of harvest
per phase.

Once utilized, the water will be collected by a floor conveyance system and pumped
through a bank of parabolic screens to remove large solids and into (2) fenced on-site
settling basins. Water basins will be expanded as needed for future phases. The water
will then be pumped into an existing irrigation line to be discharged onto orchards.

Sewage from the plant will be connected to new septic systems. Defrost water and
storm water runoff will be directed to a fenced ponding basin on the northeast corner of
the property.

The plant will recycle as much paper and cardboard waste as possible. The
recyclable materials and trash are taken off-site by a private trash service. The hulis from
the pistachios will be pressed to reduce the moisture percentage and then shipped out
and sold as cattle feed. Twigs, leaves, and chaff from harvesting will be composted and
used or sold as mulch.

BACKGROUND:

The Agricultural Land Conservation Committee reviews petitions for cancellation of Agricultural Land Conservation Contracts for consistency of the petition with the purposes of the Williamson Act, pursuant to Section 51282 of the Government Code, and makes a recommendation to the
Board of Supervisors to approve or deny the petition.

This petition for cancellation of Williamson Act Contract No. 1839 and partial cancellation of
Williamson Act Contract No. 365 was filed in conjunction with Classified Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Application No. 3658 and associated Initial Study (IS) Application No. 7707, which proposes development and operation of a pistachio processing facility on a 155.76-acre parcel identified as Assessor's Parcel Number (APN) 038-300-17s and a contiguous 160.00-acre parcel identified as APN 038-300-30s.

The subject 155.76-acre parcel as well as the western 80 acres of the subject 160.00-acre
parcel are enrolled in the Williamson Act program under Contract No. 365. The eastern 80 acres of the subject 160.00-acre parcel is enrolled in the Williamson Act program under Contract No. 1839.

An agricultural processing facility could be considered a compatible use on land enrolled in the Williamson Act program when said facility is processing products grown on the same parcel, is secondary to an onsite bona fide agricultural operation, and meets the principles of compatibility listed under Government Code Section 51238.7(a). In this case, the proposed facility is not going to process products grown on the subject parcels because there iS no agricultural operation on the subject parcels. Therefore, the proposed facility does not qualify as a compatible use and the parcels involved in the CUP must be removed from the Williamson Act
program.

The subject parcels are located on the south side of Kamm Avenue, between State Route 33 (Derrick Avenue) and Interstate Highway 5, approximately four and one quarter-miles northwest of the unincorporated community of Cantua Creek [see Location Map (Exhibit "A"), Existing Zoning Map (Exhibit "B"), Existing Land Use Map (Exhibit "C"), Assessor's Parcel Map (Exhibit "D"), and Aerial Photograph (Exhibit "E")].

DISCUSSION:

The Williamson Act program is a voluntary program whereby private landowners enter into
contract with local governments for the purpose of restricting parcels of land to commercial agricultural uses or qualified open space uses. Certain other uses that are determined by the local governing body to be compatible uses on land enrolled in the Williamson Act program are also allowed. In return, landowners receive property tax assessments that are lower than normal because the assessments are based on farming and open space uses rather than full- market property value. The purpose of the Williamson Act is to provide an incentive for keeping land in agricultural use, at least for the duration of the contract, which is typically ten (10) years.

TERMINATION OF A WILLIAMSON ACT CONTRACT:

Under state law, the preferred method of contract termination is non-renewal. Williamson Act contracts are terminated by filing a notice of non-renewal either by the landowner or the local government that has jurisdiction over the contracted parcel. The landowner must give the County written notice of their desire not to renew the contract by October 1 (at least 90 days prior to the January 1 renewal date). The contract will then terminate nine (9) years from the January 1 renewal date following the recording of the notice of non-renewal.

Cancellation is an option under limited circumstances and conditions set forth in Government Code Section 51280(b). To grant tentative cancellation, the Board of Supervisors must make specific findings that are supported by substantial evidence to ensure the cancellation is consistent with the purposes of the Williamson Act. The owner's desire to use the property for another use is not sufficient justification for cancellation. In addition, the unprofitable nature of an existing agricultural a use shall not, by itself, be a sufficient reason to cancel a contract.
The petition for cancellation must contain a proposal for a specific alternative use for the property. If the Board of Supervisors grants tentative cancellation, the landowner is required to pay a cancellation fee equal to 12.5% of the unrestricted, current fair market valuation of the property as determined by the County Assessor and certified by the Board of Supervisors. The applicant will be required to satisfy certain conditions prior to the Board issuing a "Certificate of Cancellation", including payment in full of the cancellation fee and obtaining all permits
necessary to commence the alternative use of the property.

Per Government Code Section 51282(b), cancellation of a contract is consistent with the provisions of the Land Conservation Act of 1965 if the Board can make all of the findings listed under said Government Code Section. Staff's evaluation of the proposed petition against the required findings are discussed below:

1. That the cancellation is for land on which a Notice of Nonrenewal has a been served pursuant to Section 51245 of the Government Code.
An executed Notice of Nonrenewal for Williamson Act Contract No. 1839 was accepted by the County Recorder on September 20, 2019, and was assigned Document No. 2019-0108490. Said Nonrenewal is for the eastern 80 acres of the 160.00-acre parcel subject to this petition for cancellation.

An executed Notice of Partial Nonrenewal for Williamson Act Contract No. 365 was also
accepted by the County Recorder on September 20, 2019, and was assigned Document No. 2019-0108489. Said Partial Nonrenewal is for the 155.76-acre parcel and the
western 80 acres of the 160.00-acre parcel subject to this petition for partial cancellation.

Based on the facts stated above, Department staff believes that Finding No. can be
made.

2. That the cancellation is not likely to result in the removal of adjacent lands from agricultural use.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil survey identifies portions of the subject parcels as Storie Index rating Grade 1 and Grade 2. Grade 1 and Grade 2 soils are equivalent to Prime and Statewide Importance soil classifications.
The subject parcels contain soil that is classified as Farmland of Local Importance on the California Department of Conservation (DOC) Important Farmland Map. This classification applies to lands that are non-irrigated properties that are either currently producing crops or have the capacity of production. This category includes dryland grain, dairies, and other agriculturally-zoned land that is not classified as Prime, Statewide Importance or Unique Farmland, and could be important to the local economy due to its productivity.
Staff would like to note that the DOC's mapping unit downgrades the soil classification of parcels if the parcels have not been irrigated during the four years prior to the mapping date.

The applicant acquired the subject parcels in 2011 and has not utilized the parcels for
commercial agricultural purposes. Aerial photographs dating back to 2009 show no agricultural use on the subject 155.76-acre parcel, and aerial photographs dating back to 2006 show no agricultural use on the subject 160.00-acre parcel.
Surrounding parcels are designated as Agricultural in the County General Plan, are zoned AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size), are actively farmed, and are enrolled in the Williamson Act program to be preserved for farming operation. The potential for future conversion of neighboring farmlands to other similar non-farming uses exist. However, the neighboring parcels are restricted by Williamson Act contracts.
If the alternative use is not a permitted or a compatible use, removal of land from the
Williamson Act contract would require removal of the site from the Williamson Act program, similar to this project, which is a discretionary approval process.
Based on the above discussion, Department staff believes the proposed cancellation will not likely result in the removal of adjacent lands from agricultural use and therefore, Finding No. 2 can be made.
3. That the cancellation is for an alternative use that is consistent with the provisions of the County General Plan.

This petition for cancellation of Williamson Act Contract No. 1839 and partial
cancellation of Williamson Act Contract No. 365 have been filed in conjunction with Classified Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Application No. 3658 and associated Initial Study (IS) Application No. 7707, which proposes development and operation of a
pistachio processing facility on a 155.76-acre parcel and a contiguous 160.00-acre parcel. The subject parcels are designated as Agricultural in the County General Plan and are zoned AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size).

The Agriculture and Land Use Element of the General Plan sets goals and policies
promoting long-term conservation of the County's productive agricultural lands.

General Plan Policy LU-A.3 states that the County may allow by discretionary permit in areas designated Agriculture, special agricultural uses and agriculturally-related activities, including value-added processing facilities and certain non-agricultural uses
subject to the following criteria: a) The use shall provide a needed service to the surrounding agricultural area which cannot be provided more efficiently within urban areas or requires location in a non-urban area because of unusual site requirements or operational characteristics; b) The use should not be sited on productive agricultural
lands if less productive land is available in the vicinity; C) The operational or physical characteristics of the use shall not have a detrimental impact on water resources or the
use or management of surrounding properties within at least one quarter (1/4)-mile
radius. General Plan Policy LU-A.12 requires protection of agricultural activities from encroachment of incompatible uses. General Plan Policy LU-A.13 states that the County shall protect agricultural operations from conflicts with non-agricultural uses. General Plan Policy LU-A. 14 states that the County shall ensure that the review of
discretionary permits includes an assessment of the conversion of productive
agricultural land and that mitigation be required where appropriate.

The applicant acquired the subject parcels in 2011 and has not utilized the parcels for
commercial agricultural purposes. Aerial photographs dating back to 2009 show no agricultural use on the subject 155.76-acre parcel, and aerial photographs dating back to 2006 show no agricultural use on the subject 160.00-acre parcel. Further, according to the applicant, there are no water wells located on the subject parcels, nor do the subject parcels receive any surface water allocation. Therefore, with regard to Policies LU-A.3,
LU-A. 12, LU-A.13 and LU-A.14, this proposal entails the establishment of a commercial
pistachio processing facility on agricultural parcels that have been enrolled in the Williamson Act program but have not been used by the applicant for commercial agricultural operation. Therefore, the subject parcels are not qualified to be enrolled in the Williamson Act program. Additionally, the proposed alternative use will be processing agricultural products that are grown in Fresno County.

Based on the above discussion, Department staff believes that the proposed alternative
use is consistent with the County General Plan and therefore, believes Finding No. 3
can be made.

4. That the cancellation will not result in discontiguous patterns of urban development.
The proposed pistachio processing facility will not result in any discontiguous patterns of
urban development, should the proposed cancellation be approved. The subject parcels are located in a rural area away from any city or unincorporated community, and neighboring parcels are designated as Agricultural in the County General Plan, are zoned AE-20 (Exclusive Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size) and are actively
farmed.

Based on the facts stated above, Department staff believes that Finding No. 4 can be
made.

5. That there is no proximate non-contracted land that is both available and suitable for the use to which it is proposed that the contracted land be put, or that development of the contracted land would provide more contiguous patterns of urban development than development of proximate non-contracted land.

County staff provided a map and list of similar-size non-contracted parcels within a5- mile radius of the subject parcels and asked that the applicant address why the identified non-contracted parcels could not be used for the proposed alternative use. Additionally, Department staff sent letters to the owners of these non-contracted parcels requesting that said owners notify Department staff if their parcels are for sale. The Policy Planning Unit staff was not contacted by any of the landowners within the five-mile radius about
the availability of their parcels for the proposed use. Further, the applicant provided information as to why each parcel identified by Department staff is not suitable for the
proposed use (see Exhibit F). Reasons provided for lack of suitability included: parcels being too small, parcels being too far from a canal water source, topographical challenges, and parcels already developed with uses such as solar power generation
facilities.

Based on staff's inquiry and the applicant's reasons for unsuitability, staff believes there is no non-contracted parcel that can be used for the alternative use, and therefore, Finding No. 5 can be made.

ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINATION:

Initial Study (IS) Application No. 7707 being processed for Classified Conditional Use Permit (CUP) Application No. 3658 will address the potential environmental impacts associated with the cancellation of the contracts. The IS will be completed and circulated prior to the Planning Commission hearing for the Classified Conditional Use Permit application.

OTHER REVIEWING AGENCIES:

As of January 1, 2001, Government Code Section 51284.1(a) requires notification to be provided by the County to the Director of the California Department of Conservation (DOC) when a cancellation petition has been accepted as complete. Under Government Code Section 51284.1(c), DOC comments, if provided, are required to be considered by the Board of Supervisors before acting on the proposed cancellation.
The petition was forwarded to the California Department of Conservation (DOC) on September 5, 2019. Staff received a response from the DOC on September 30, 2019 stating that the DOC has no substantive comments to offer and has therefore elected not to comment on this petition. However, the DOC response states that the County consider elaborating on Finding No. 5 to more clearly demonstrate for the record that no other proximate land not under contract is both suitable and available for the proposed use.
CONCLUSION:

Based upon staff's analysis of the proposed alternative use against the consistency findings listed under Government Code 51282(b), staff believes all the findings can be made, and
therefore recommends approval of the cancellation of Agricultural Land Conservation Contract
No. 1839 and partial cancellation of Agricultural Land Conservation Contract No. 365, subject to
the conditions listed on page one of this staff report.

However, if the Committee believes that the required findings cannot be made, the Committee should recommend that the Board of Supervisors deny the cancellation of Agricultural Land
