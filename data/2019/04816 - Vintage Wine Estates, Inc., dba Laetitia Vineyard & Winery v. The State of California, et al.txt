23 INTRODUCTION EXHIBIT

24 1. Through this Verified Petition for Writ" of Mandate and Complaint for
25 Temporary Restraining Order and Injunctive Relief ("Petition"); Petitioner Vintage Wine
26 Estates, a California Corporation, dba Laetitia Vineyard & Winery ("Petitioner") seeks to
27 compel Respondents, the State of California, California Department of Transportation aka
28 Caltrans, and Does 1 through . 50, inclusive (collectively, "Respondents") to properly
1832423.5 14487-002
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS! FEES

analyze, disclose, and mitigate the significant adverse environmental impacts associated
2 with Respondents' approval of a construction project and contract award to Papich
3 | Construction Company, Inc. ("Papich" or• "Real Party") for the elimination of left-turn
Imovements from US Highway 101 onto and from El Campo Road, Tower Grove Drive/
5 Laetitia Vineyard Drive, Hemi Road, and Unnamed Road, and closure of each of those

6 crossings ("Project") within the County of San Luis Obispo.

2.. Petitioner asserts that Respondents violated the California Environmental
8 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), and the CEQA
Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA
10 Guidelines"). Specifically, Petitioner alleges that Respondents violated CEQA by
11 improperly relying on the emergency statutory exemption to CEQA, failing to prepare an
12 environmental impact report ("EIR") and/or mitigated negative declaration ("MND") for the
13 Project, failing to provide adequate notice of the Project and opportunity for public comment

14 and review, failing to adopt feasible mitigation measures, failing to analyze alternatives to
15 the Project, and approving the Project on the basis of findings that are not supported by
16 substantial evidence.

17 3. The Project will close all left turns from El Campo Road, Tower Grove Drive/
18 Laetitia Vineyard Drive (also known as "Tower Grove Drive" and "Laetitia Vineyard Drive"),
19 Hemi Road, and Unnamed Road into US 101.

20 It is unclear if Caltrans, as lead agency for the Project under CEQA, prepared

21 or approved any environmental document. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon
22 alleges, that Caltrans relied on the emergency statutory exemption from CEQA to forego
23 environmental review. Reliance on this exemption was improper where there is no
24 emergency mandating expédited approval of the Project. At least two of the at-grade
25 crossings had been considered by Caltrans for over a decade. The Project's approval is
26 motivated by political interest.
27 5. To the extent Respondents rely a categorical exemption, such reliance on an
28 exemption is inadequate because there is a fair argument supported by substantial
1832423.5 14487-002
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES •

evidence in the record that the Project will cause environmental impacts, specifically
2  including, but not limited to, impacts to transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access
3 to emergency services, air quality, and safety risks associated with each.
6. Caltrans abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required
by law in approving the Project without adequate environmental review. Petitioner is
informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Project will change the flow of traffic
and transportation patterns in the area, resulting in significant and adverse impacts to
8 transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to emergency services, air quality, and
create new safety risks associated with each. As such, the Project has the potential to pose
10 a significant risk to environmental resources.
11 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that:
12 a. The Project will have potentially significant environmental impacts.
13 Substantial evidence in this case includes analyses on environmental impacts to
14 transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to emergency services, air quality, and
15 safety risks associated with each. For these reasons, an EIR or MND should have been
16 prepared;
17 b. The Project's description is incomplete and misleading;
18 C. The technical memorandum prepared by GHD, Inc. contains flawed
19 assumptions and conclusory statements without analysis of all crossings; and
20 d.. There is no analysis in the record that addresses environmental
21 impacts specific to Tower Grove Drive/Laetitia Vineyard Drive, Hemi Road, or Unnamed
22 Road crossings.

23 8. Caltrans. failed to proceed in a manner required by law where it did not
24 provide notice of the Project or opportunity for public comment and review, as required by
25 CEQA. As such, Petitioner is required to rely on evidence published and considered by
26 other public agencies, including the San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG)
27 and San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors, to present this Petition.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

9. Given the violations of CEQA, described in greater detail below
Respondents' approval of the Project was done in violation of CEQA. (See Pub. Resources
Code §§ 21168 and 21168.5 and Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.) For these reasons, Petitioner
respectfully requests that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding
5 Respondents to rescind, set aside, and void any and all resolutions or documents related
6 to the Project approval including, but not limited to, the contract with Papich, as well as any
7 other legislative, quasi-adjudicatory, or other discretionary or ministerial approvals of the
8 Project or any portion thereof.
PARTIES

10 10. Petitioner owns and operates a vineyard and winery in San Luis Obispo
11 County on property primarily accessible at one of the Project road closure sites.

12 11. Respondent Caltrans is an executive department of the State of California,
13 headquartered in Sacramento, California, and manages the State's highway system,
14 including US Highway 101. Caltrans has the principal responsibility for carrying out its laws
15 and has a duty to comply with applicable federal and state laws, including CEQA, and is
16 therefore the "lead agency" for the Project under CEQA.

17 12. Real Party in Interest, Papich, was contracted for $250,000 to conduct the
18 work related to the Project, including construction of median barriers and signs to prevent
19  left turns at each of the crossings.

20 13. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
21 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondents Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and
22 therefore sue said Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition

23 to reflect their true names and capacities at such time that they become known.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code
26 of Civil Procedure sections 395, 401, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
27 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

28
1832423.5 14487-002 4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

15. .This Court is the proper venue for this action pursuant to Code of Civi
2 Procedure section 395 as Respondents are headquartered and operate in Sacramento

3 County.
STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 16. Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement
6 of a public duty by Caltrans. Caltrans is a public agency and has a mandatory duty to
7 comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws when approving the Project. Petitioner
8 alleges that Caltrans failed to satisfy this duty by improperly relying on the emergency
statutory exemption from CEQA review and/or by not making mandatory findings
10 demonstrating that Respondents deliberated and exercised their independent judgment in
11 approving the Project.

12 17. Petitioner, as a member of the public, taxpayer, and property owner in San
13 Luis Obispo County, has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in Respondents'
14 compliance with their statutory duties under CEQA to, where required, adequately consider
15 environmental impacts of the Project prior to approving it. Petitioner owns and operates
16 property within the Project area whose primary access will be significantly limited by the
17 closure of the crossings.

18 18. To Petitioner's knowledge, Caltrans never gave notice nor held a public
19 hearing in consideration of the Project. Despite this, Petitioner took advantage of numerous
20 opportunities where Petitioner knew Caltrans may be present in order to ensure that these
21 environmental impacts were known to Caltrans prior to approval of the Project. Specifically,
22 Petitioner submitted a letter on April 2, 2019 via mail and electronic mail to SLOCOG in
23 advance of its April 3, 2019 meeting, outlining Petitioner's concerns, copying Caltrans in
24 the transmission. At the same meeting, Petitioner, represented by its attorney Thomas D.
25 Green, submitted oral comment outlining Petitioner's concerns. Petitioner also submitted a
26 letter on April 19, 2019 via electronic mail to the San Luis Obispo County Board of
27 Supervisors, in advance of its April 23, 2019 meeting, outlining Petitioner's concerns. In

28
1832423.5 14487-002 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

taking these actions, Petitioner exhausted the requisite administrative remedies in order tc
file this Petition, as detailed in Public Resources Code section 21177.
3 19. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instan
action. Having exhausted all administrative remedies and as a property owner immediately a
5 adjacent to the Project site, Petitioner has a clear, present, and beneficial right to enforcel 6 the provisions of CEQA. All of the grounds for noncompliance with CEQA alleged herein

8 were presented to Caltrans, via the only public forums available to Petitioner, orally and in

9 writing, prior to the announcement of the commencement of the Project.

10 20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on or after
11 May 3, 2019, Caltrans' Deputy. Chief Counsel, G. Michael Harrington, stated that Caltrans
12 may have filed a Notice of Exemption for the Project ("NOE") with the State Clearinghouse 13

14 Office of Planning and Research. (See Declaration of Jeffrey Nicholson in Support of Ex

15 Parte Application in Support of Stay and/or, in the Alternative, for Order to Show Cause

16 and Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction ("Nicholson Declaration"),
17 T4.)

18 21. To date, it is unclear whether an NOE was filed. (See Declaration of Olivia
19 Filbrandt in Support of Ex Parte Application in Support of Stay and/or, in the Alternative,
20 for Order to Show Cause and Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction
21 ("Filbrandt Declaration"), TT 2-5.)

22 22. Because Respondents have taken final action on the Project and issued a
23 news release dated May 3, 2019 stating that construction will commence on May 13, 2019,
24 Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.
25 23. a Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary
26 course of law.

27

28

1832423.5 .14487-002 6 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

24. Petitioner, performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition.
2 Petitioner authorized its attorney to file this lawsuit on its behalf to assert its substantial
3 beneficial interest in securing Respondents' compliance with the law.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of the law within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Unless this Court
issues a writ of mandate setting aside Respondents' approval of the Project for improper
8 reliänce upon a CEQA exemption and/or failure to conduct adequate environmental review
and orders Respondents to comply with the law, the environmental interests of Petitioner
10 and the public that are protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed.

11 No other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harm to its beneficial
12 interests, and to the environment, occasioned by Respondents' unlawful conduct.

13 26. Petitioner is entitled to declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure
14 section 1060 because an actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents.
15 Petitioner contends that Respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws and must
16 therefore vacate and set aside the Projeot approvals. Petitioner is informed and believes

17 that Respondents dispute this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is
18 therefore appropriate and necessary.

19 27. Petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
20 526 because approval of the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless
21 enjoined, Caltrans will implement these approvals despite its lack of compliance with CEQA
22 and other applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental degradation.
23| Petitioner would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to Caltrans' failure to take the required
24 steps to evaluate environmental impacts to, among other things, transportation,
25 greenhouse gas emissions, access to emergency services, air quality, and safety risks
26 associated with each. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under Code of Civil Procedure
27 section 525, et seq. and Public Resources Code section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable

28 harm to the environment.

NOTICE OF CEQA ACTION
2 28. On May 3, 2019, •Petitioner sent a Notice of Commencement of Actior
3 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 via U.S. mail and electronic mail tc
Caltrans' District Director Tim Gubbins, thereby notifying Respondents of Petitioner's intent
5 to file this lawsuit, which seeks to set aside Respondents' approval of the Project. A copy 6 of the May 3, 2019 Notice of Commencement of Action is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD
29. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subsection (b)(2), 9 Petitioner elects to prepare the record of administrative proceedings related to this action.
10 A copy of the Notice of Election to Prepare the Administrative Record of Proceedings is
11 attached hereto as Exhibit B.

12 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE
13 30. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
14 1021.5, the private attorney general doctrine, and any other applicable legal theory to
15 enforce important rights affecting the public interest.
16 31. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit
17 on the general public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and
18 other applicable laws before approving the Project.
19 32. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the
20 enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to 21 engage in a legally adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a
22 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures
23 for the Project.

24 33. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of
25 attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party
26 will proceed with a plan and development that will cause significant, unmitigated
27 environmental impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally
28 adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures. | 1832423.5 14487-002 8 •VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

-

34. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and
Petitioner by Respondents being required to fully satisfy the requirements of the law prior

3 to approving the Project. A clear and significant benefit will be independently conferred
upon the general public by Respondents fully satisfying the requirements of CEQA. In
5 instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty. The
6 public, of which Petitioner is a member, is vitally and beneficially interested in assuring that
7 the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by Petitioner
would confer a significant benefit on a large class of people, in that fundamental rules of
law would be affected. The cost of pursuing this litigation transcends Petitioner's personal
10 stake in the matter.

11 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS

12 35. Petitioner asserts that Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously when
13 approving the Project.

14 36. In accordance with Government Code section 800, and other applicable
15 laws, Petitioner is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to overturn
16 Respondents' arbitrary or capricious actions.

17 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

18 37. Caltrans controls 'and maintains dozens of at-grade highway crossings
19 throughout the state with similar design features as the ones described in the Project,
20 however, those crossings are not proposed for closure.
21 38. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on or about
22 August 5, 2009, Caltrans issued an interagency technical memorandum explaining that

23 gap closures were necessary at the "at-grade" crossings located at EI Campo Road, Tower
24 Grove Drive, and other locations. (See August 5, 2009 technical memorandum attached
25 hereto as Exhibit C.)

26 39. The 2009 technical memorandum explains that, on September 2, 2007, the
27 Caltrans District 5 Traffic Safety Branch initiated work to "restrict all left turn movements

28
1832423.5 14487-002 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

1 throughout the project limits.' that included closing the same at-grade crossings at issue
2 the current Project, due to safety concerns for drivers.

3 40. Caltrans did not close any of the at-grade crossings or restrict left turr

4 movements despite the safety concerns apparent at the initiation of work in 2007 and

5 alleged in the 2009 technical memorandum.

6 41. On or around October 7, 2018, Jordan Grant was killed on his motorcycle

7 when a passenger car made a left turn from El Campo Road to access US 101 southbound.
8 42. As a result of that accident, Mr. Grant's parents solicited Caltrans to close the
9 crossing at EI Campo Road and US 101.

10 43. Following pressure from Mr. Grant's parents and other members of the
11 public, and despite having done nothing in the preceding decade at this intersection to
12 close or restrict left turn lanes, Caltrans again proposed the closure of El Campo Road as
13 well as three other crossings not involved in Mr. Grant's accident.
14 44. On March 27, 2019, the City of Arroyo Grande submitted a letter to SLOCOG
15 for a public meeting to discuss the Project, and explained that even though the City
16 supports the overall project goal of providing safer travel for south San Luis Obispo County
17 residents and users of Highway 101, the traffic assessment is deficient and requires further
18 analysis and inclusion of mitigation measures. (See March 27, 2019 letter from Arroyo
19 Grande City Manager James Bergman to SLOCOG attached hereto as Exhibit D.)

20 45. On April 2, 2019, legal counsel for Petitioner, Thomas D. Green, provided a
21 letter to SLOCOG, copying Caltrans, explaining the lack of adequate environmental
22 analysis for the closing of three of the four crossings. (See April 2, 2019 letter of Adamski,
23 | Moroski, Madden, Cumberland & Green attached hereto as Exhibit E.)

24 46. At the same time, other public opinions raised issues that closing the
25 intersections would create higher congestion, increased vehicle exhaust in the community,
26 and expensive health costs. (See April 2, 2019 article, Residents reject advice to fix El
27 Campo crossing, demand overpass attached hereto as Exhibit F.)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

:

47. On April 3, 2019, SLOCOG held a meeting to discuss the Project. Caltrans'
2 Deputy Director for Planning and Local Assistance, Aileen Loe, was present and active in
3 the deliberations. In addressing public comments, Ms. Loe stated "we [Caltrans] were
4 ready, willing, and able some years ago to close these [four at-grade crossings] but for
5 local support" and "we will be ready to act very soon after [SLOCOG's approval] if they

6 were to provide support, if the board doesn't provide support we'll stand down." Ms.
Loe described the Project - closing not only El Campo, the site of Mr. Grant's crash, but all
8 four at-grade crossings - as an "opportunity" and admitted that their justification for closing

9 all four at-grade crossings was that it was their "experience" that closing one crossing leads

10 people to then use the others. Ms. Loe did not provide any documentation to support this
11. position.

12 48. At the same meeting, Petitioner's counsel inquired if the traffic study to be
13 relied on by Caltrans studied the closure of all four at-grade crossings. Ms. Loe admitted

14 that the traffic study only studied the El Campo crossing point while the Project
15 assumed the closure of all four at-grade crossings.

16 49: Following the April 3, 2019, public hearing, SLOCOG issued a news release
17 detailing its support for the Project. In. the release, SLOCOG specifically identified "[mjore
18 in-depth, project specific studies, such as California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) ...
19 are required to. progress any long-term improvements and this assessment does not
20 replace the need for these studies."

21 50. On April 23, 2019, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors held a
22 meeting to discuss the Project where public comment was heard and accepted.

23 51. On May 3, 2019, Caltrans issued a news release titled, "Caltrans to begin
24 work on US Highway 101 at El Campo Road and Other Locations in Southern San Luis
25 Obispo County." The news release further stated that the Project was awarded for
26 $250,000 to Papich Construction and the work was to be completed by the end of May,
27 2019. (See news release attached hereto as Exhibit G.)

1832423.5 14487-002 •11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FORATTORNEYS' FEES

1 52. On May 3, 2019, Jeffrey Nicholson, Chief Operating Officer of Vintage Wine
2 Estates; called G. Michael Harrington, Deputy Chief Counsel of Caltrans. Mr. Harrington
explained that it was his understanding that Caltrans had filed an NOE for the Project with

4 the State Clearinghouse. (See Nicholson Declaration, 14.)
53. On May 3, 2019, counsel for Petitioner went to the State Clearinghouse, the
executive agency responsible for maintaining notices filed pursuant to.CEQA. No notice of
any kind had been filed pertaining to the Project. (See Filbrandt Declaration, T1 2-5.)
54. On May 7, 2019, Petitioner filed this Petition for writ of mandate in
Sacramento County Superior Court challenging the approval of the Project and, to the
10 extent one exists, the associated emergency exemption.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Violation of CEQA - Improper Reliance on CEQA Exemption)

13 55. Petitioner. incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
14 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

15 56. To the extent the Project was approved based on an emergency exemption,
16 that exemption is improper. Public Resources Code section 21060.3 defines an
17 "emergency" as, "a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent
18 danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or. damage to life,
19 health, property or essential public services. Emergency includes such occurrences as fire,
20 flood, earthquake, or other soil or geological movements, as well as such occurrences as
21 riot, accident, or sabotage." There was no recent accident at Laetitia Vineyard Drive, Hemi
22 Road, or Unnamed Road. Therefore, this exemption is not applicable to all of the crossings.

23 57. The 2019 technical memorandum prepared by GHD, Inc. for SLOCOG,
24 demonstrates that the only crossing that has fatalities in the past several years is El Campo
25 Road. No fatalities occurred during the study at Laetitia Vineyard Drive, Hemi Road, or
26 Unnamed Road.

27 58. Caltrans was aware of the state of these crossings since at least 2007 and
28 yet took no action. A 12-year delay in taking action is evidence per se of a lack of

1 immediacy and exceeds any reasonable amount of planning to address any alleged
2 emergency. (See 2009 technical memorandum attached hereto as Exhibit C.)

3 59. Caltrans' Deputy Director for Planning and Local Assistance, Aileen Loe, has
4 admitted that its decision to close the crossings is political and not based on an emergency.

5 Ms. Loe admitted that if SLOCOG was not supportive of Caltrans' decision, Caltrans would
6 "stand down." If this was a true emergency, the decision regarding the crossings would not
7 be based on public support.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA - Failure to Prepare an EIR)

10 60. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
11 Petition as though set forth in full herein.
12 61. CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare an EIR for a project if there is
13 substantial eviderice of a fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on
14 the environment.

15 62. Petitioner and members of the public presented substantial evidence of a fair
16 argument that the Project would have substantial, unmitigated impacts on traffic
17 congestion/delays, safety risks, an increase in vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas
18 emissions, and reduction of air quality traffic, air quality, safety. This substantial evidence

19 is included as letters from the City of Arroyo Grande, the Five Cities Fire Authority, and
20 Petitioner, among others. (See letters attached as Exhibits D and E, and article attached

21 as Exhibit F.)
22 63. Caltrans fails to consider the environmental effects of the foreseeable future
23 impacts resulting from the Project, and thus, this Project is evading environmental review.
24 Additionally:

25 a. There is no analysis of the Project's contribution to concentrations of
26 mobile-source carbon monoxide;

27 b. There is no analysis of the additional vehicle miles traveled and related
28 greenhouse gas emissions;
1832423.5 14487-002 13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

f

C. There is no analysis to safety impacts as a result of increased

2 response times for police and fire; and

d. There is no analysis of the near-term and long-term traffic congestion

4 and operational and safety implications to the Project.

5 64. There is no analysis of cumulative impact as a result of projects which are
6 being development and will use the same ramps as the diverted traffic if the crossings are
7 closed.

co 65. Despite the substantial evidence of unmitigated environmental impacts,
9 Caltrans refused to prepare an EIR and, Petitioner believes, instead either issued an NOE
10 or altogether ignored CEQA.

11 66. Respondents' failure to prepare an EIR represents a failure to proceed in the
12 manner required by law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and
13 Respondents should be ordered to prepare an EIR.

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION*

15 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration or

16 Environmental Impact Report)*

17 67. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this

18 Petition as though set forth in full herein.
19 68. CEQA requires a mitigated negative declaration or environmental impact
20 report to analyze the "whole of the project" including all phases of the project planning,
21 implementation, and operation and all foreseeable consequences of the action at issue.
22 Caltrans failed to consider the whole of the Project, omitting the reasonably foreseeable
23 environmental impacts that will occur as a result of closing the crossings. For example, fire
24 and police no longer have immediate ingress/egress to respond to emergencies by using
25 the crossings. As another example, vehicles must drive miles beyond their destinations
26 and turn around and drive back up on the highway as there are no other on/ramps and
27 off/ramps. These additional vehicle miles traveled were not analyzed for the crossings, nor

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING
ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

-**

were the associated air quality impacts from the greenhouse gas emissions. As a result,
Caltrans has failed to analyze the impacts which will foreseeably result from the Project
69. approval, leaving a

4 number of environmental impacts unanalyzed and

5 unmitigated, in violation of CEQA's requirements for a mitigated negative declaration.
70.

6 Caltrans fails to consider the environmental effects of the foreseeable future
impacts resulting from the Project, and thus, this Project is evading environmental review.
Additionally:

a. There is no analysis of the Project's contribution to concentrations of
9 mobile-source carbon monoxide;
10 b. There is no analysis of the additional vehicle miles traveled and related
11 greenhouse gas emissions;

12 C. There is no analysis to safety: impacts as a result of increased
13 response times for police and fire;
14 d. There is no analysis of the near-term and long-term traffic congestion*
15 and operational and safety implications to the Project; and

16 e. There is no analysis of cumulative impact as a result of projects which
17 are being development and will use the same ramps as the diverted traffic if the crossings
18 are closed.

19 71. Caltrans imposes no mitigation measures for impacts to traffic and
20 transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access for emergency services, air quality, or
21 any other resource area.
22 72. Respondents' *approval of the Project without compliance with CEQA
23 represents an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside.
24

25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 73. (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Public Notice and Review)
Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
27 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

28
1832423.5 14487-002 15 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES

74. CEQA requires that the public be allowed to participate in the review anc
2 consideration of proposed projects in an effort to ensure that environmental considerations
play a significant role in government decision-making. For this to occur, the public must be
afforded notice prior to decisions being made, not after. Caltrans failed to include or even
5 allow public participation, in direct violation of CEQA.
75. The truncated public comment and review period prevented informed
decision-making and left Caltrans without the benefit of hearing from the public.
76. The contents of the public notices for the Project were defective and failed to
9 comply with CEQA and applicable law. A "news release" is not a substitute for a public
10 notice of Caltrans' decision to approve the Project or issue an NOE. (See news release
11 attached hereto as Exhibit G.)

12 77. Moreover, when asked for public notices related to the Project, Jim Shivers,
13 a Caltrans public information officer, denied the request. (See Declaration of Hanspeter
14| Walter in Support of Ex Parte Application and Memorandum of Points and Authorities in
15 Support of Stay and/or, in the Alternative, for Order to Show Cause and Temporary
16 Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction, MI 4-9.)
17 78. On or around April 23, 2019, a public records act request was submitted to
18 Caltrans asking, for among other things, any records related to environmental documents
19 or assessments analyzing the impacts of the closure of the crossings. On May 7, 2019, at
20 10:05 a.m., Caltrans responded that the request "will take extra time to fulfill" and that "a
21 further more complete response [will be provided] no later than June 04, 2019",
22 conveniently after the anticipated completion date of the Project. (See Public Records Act
23 Request and Response from Caltrans, attached as Exhibit H). Caltrans is deliberately
24 thwarting public access to any records related to the project.
25 79. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's noticing requirements
26 represents a failure to proceed in a manner according to law. Accordingly, the Project
27 approval should be set aside.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 - Due Process)

80. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
Petition as though set forth in full herein.

5 81. Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 lays out that due process and the
6 trust of the public guarantee require that a public agency will act in an evenhanded, fair
manner. In order to meet these standards, a public agency must remain independent and
unaligned when processing applications for land development permits.

9

10 82: Respondents failed to meet these standards during the processing and
11 hearing of the Project and related approvals under the following additional circumstances:

12 a. Caltrans' notices for the public hearing and close of public comment
13 period, if any, were defective and renders any proceedings invalid; and,

14 b. The public comment and review period provided in SLOCOG's and
15 San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisor's deliberations were insufficient to meet Caltrans'
16 responsibilities to accept and respond to public comment; and,

17 C. The failure to provide Petitioner and other members of the public with
18 materials related to Project approvals with advanced notice, at least ten days prior to any
19 meeting to approve the Project, as required by the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act.

20 83. Under the totality of the circumstances alleged above, Respondents failed in
21 | their statutory and common law duties to provide the public with a fair hearing process.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner Vintage Wine Estates, Inc., a California corporation, dba
24  Laetitia Vineyard & Winery, respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment
25 as follows:

26 1. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate, set aside,
27 and void an emergency exemption (if one was filed) and all Project approvals, including
28 the contract or any agreements with Papich; and,

Transportation Engineer District 5 Traffic Operations Branch

Subject: Traffic Study Los Berros Road to Traffic Way Median Barrier Project
This Technical Memorandum documents the effects on local area traffic and its interface with
United States Route (US) 101 if all left turn movements were restricted from 05-SLO-101-Postmile (PM) 7.88 to 05-SLO-101-PM 12.52.

Introduction

This State Highway Operation and Protection Program (SHOPP) project proposes to improve the traffic safety characteristics of US 101 in San Luis Obispo County beginning at PM 7.88 and ending with PM 12.52. This project would provide gap closures between two existing segments of median barrier, resulting in the median closure of all at-grade intersection and crossover locations within the project limits. This includes the El Campo Road (PM 11.83) and Laetitia Winery (PM 9.66) intersections and the three crossover locations at PM 9.13, PM 10.70, and PM 11.29.

Existing Facility

US 101 is the principal north-south highway serving San Luis Obispo County. US 101 begins at Interstate 5 in Los Angeles and extends north to the Oregon Border, closely paralleling the coastline at times. It connects the Central Coast to the Bay Area to the north and Los Angeles metropolitan area to the south. US 101 bisects the City of San Luis Obispo and provides vital access to the Five
Cities Area (Shell Beach, Pismo Beach, Grover Beach, Arroyo Grande, and Oceano) and the Nipomo Mesa. US 101 is an important multifunctional route that experiences its highest traffic volumes during weekday commute hours. Through the project limits, US 101 is 'a four-lane expressway. At-Grade intersections with US 101 are located at El Campo Road (PM 11.83) and Laetitia Winery (PM 9.66). US 101 median crossover locations exist at PM 9.13, PM 10.70, and PM
11.29.

El Campo Road is a two-lane arterial that extends southerly from an at-grade intersection with US 101 to Los Berros Road, Halcyon Road, and Woodland Hills Road. El Campo Road primarily serves residential traffic in the Nipomo Mesa area.

"Caltrans improves mobility across California" EXHIBIT C

Purpose and Need
This project was initiated on September 02, 2007 by the District 5 Traffic Safety Branch. The purpose of this project is to address the potential for future cross-median collisions by providing gap closures between two existing segments of median barrier. With the construction of this project, median barrier will be present from the Santa Maria Way Under crossing (05-SB-101-84.32) to the
Cuesta Forest Crossover (05-SLO-101-36.07). This proposed project would improve the facility by minimizing the potential for cross-median collisions in the narrower areas. The cross-median collision is one of the most serious types of collision that drivers experience. A cross-median collision is strictly defined as one in which and out-of-control vehicle crosses the median of a four or more lane road and strikes, or is struck by, a vehicle from the opposite direction. This project would also lessen the severity of over-embankment collisions in the wider median areas. The primary contributor to the severity of over-embankment collisions is the height of the slope of the embankment.

Collision Data

Collision Data for US 101 between Postmile 7.88 and 12.52 for the 36 month period from 08/01/2005 to 07/31/2008 is provided in Attachment A. Table 1 provides the following summary:

Additional Considerations

1. Intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road
A recent 3-Year Table B for the El Campo Road intersection show collision rates currently exceed the statewide average. In the first six months of 2008, this intersection experienced three more "correctable" broadside injury collisions (2/6/2008, 2/20/2008, 5/24/2008), a cross centerline collision (1/24/2008), and a southbound run-off-road collision (3/24/2008). This project would reduce the number of broadside collisions at the intersection of US. 101 and El Campo Road. The collision diagram for this intersection may be found in Attachment A.

2. Correspondence - Busick Tract 1789 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) Comments

Local Agency correspondence from San Luis Obispo County (5/16/05), City of Arroyo Grande (3/9/04 & 4/28/05), and San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (3/15/04) regarding the Busick Tract Number 1789 Development identify the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road as being "deficient" and "unsafe". Full or partial closure of the intersection was suggested by the City of Arroyo Grande and County of San Luis Obispo as the appropriate solution. The
correspondence is provided in Attachment B and summarized below.
March 9, 2004 letter from City of Arroyo Grande (Rob Strong, Community Development Director) to County of San Luis Obispo (Julie Eliason, Environmental Division) regarding the Busick Tract Development. In this letter, Mr. Strong makes the following statements regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road:
"Specifically, the traffic and circulation impacts of the project on the deficient and unsafe El Campo intersection with State Route 101 are not mitigated by a "fair share" contribution toward future improvement of the El Campo Interchange, nor is this major freeway modification part of the current County traffic impact:fees.'
"The unsafe existing crossing of Highway 101 at El Campo Road should be considered for closure until a future interchange is constructed. It maÿ be inconvenient for Nipomo and Falcon Ridge, but access to northbound 101 is unsafe. at this crossing.'
March 15, 2004 letter from San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (James J. Worthley, Transportation Planner) to County of San Luis Obispo (Julie Eliason, Environmental
Division) regarding the Busick Tract Development. In this letter, Mr. Worthley makes the following statement regarding the intersection of US 101 and EI Campo Road:
"Any new demands on this deficient crossing will further exacerbate an already bad situation. Caltrans has indicated that if it becomes a hazard, it may either eliminate all left turn movements (through a barrier) or close it entirely"

April 28, 2005 letter from City of Arroyo Grande (Steven Adams, City Manager) to County of San Luis Obispo (Julie Eliason, Environmental Division) regarding the Busick Tract Development. In this letter, Mr. Adams makes the following statement regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road;
"On behalf of the City of Arroyo Grande, we would like to again express our concerns regarding the impacts of the Busick Tract project as proposed. The most serious impact is traffic circulation. The project would contribute trips to the El Campo Road intersection with State Route 101, which is currently unsafe and Level of Service "F". :

May 16, 2005 letter from County of San Luis Obispo (Richard Marshall, Development Services Engineer) to County of San Luis Obispo (Julie Eliason, Environmental Specialist) regarding the Busick Tract Development. In this letter, Mr. Marshall makes the following statements regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road:

"Caltrans improves mobility across California"

"On page V-66, section TR/Impact 1 identifies traffic at the intersection of El Campo Road
and Highway 101 as a Class . (significant and unavoidable) impact. This intersection is an at-grade crossing, and is already operating at Level of Service (LOS) F, as noted earlier in
the report."

"The specific intersection movement of greatest concern is left turns from EL Campo Road to go northbound on the highway. A secondary concern would be left turns from northbound 101 to g0 onto El Campo Road. Both of these movements are highly constrained by having to wait for acceptable length gaps in the southbound traffic on the highway.

"I would like to suggest an alternative which might mitigate the impact in a different way: eliminate the left-turning movements at this intersection. Those who wish to go north from El Campo could either go south on the highway and turn back at either the Laetitia Vineyard access or the Los Berros interchange, or they could g0 south on El Campo and use Los Berros Road to head back northerly. Similarly, those wishing to turn left onto El Campo from northbound 101 would be able to use alternate routes that are not substantially out of the
way,

3. Correspondence - San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCOG) Board Meetings
San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Katcho Achadjian (Fourth District) has expressed concern for the safety of the motoring public at the intersection of US 101 & El Campo Road during several SLOCOG Board meetings held in 2007. The meeting minutes are provided in Attachment C and summarized below.

Pages 6 and 7 of the SLOCOG March 7, 2007 Board meeting minutes provide the following account of a discussion that took place regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo
Road:

Board Member Achadjian: "Great report! I suggest that the locations of the accidents be provided so that member jurisdictions have that information to work on in their respective areas of responsibility. Thanks to Caltrans (referring to Mr. Krumholz) for the information/response regarding the safety concern I raised regarding El Campo Road in the south county. Congestion is happening because jobs and almost all businesses are located in
San Luis Obispo. The morning peak hour is the busiest fime on the road. Perhaps, in order to
improve traffic, the work hours should be shifted. Let us see if we can get our staff off the road during rush hour.'

Pages 2 and 3 of the SLOCOG April 4, 2007 Board meeting minutes provide the following account of a discussion that took place regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo
Road:

Board Member Katcho Achadjian asked if it would be possible for Caltrans to install one of those live video cameras somewhere on 101/El Campo Road (South County). He said any help on this matter would be great. Mr. Krumholz said he could look into a possibility of a video camera at that location. He noted that possibility depends on power availability, connections/conduits, etc. He indicated he would report back on this issue and that he would

like to continue to work with Board Member Achadjian on the issues of concern on that location. Mr. De Carli noted that SLOCOG staff in the past had raised a safety concern on that location.

Page 2 of the SLOCOG June 6, 2007 Board meeting minutes provide the following account of a discussion that took place regarding the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road:
Board Member Achadjian requested that Mr. Dan Woodson of the Nipomo Advisory Committee be included in that meeting. He also requested to bring the US 101/El Campo Road right turn issue to the table. Mr, De. Carli said staff could ask Caltrans to evaluate the
opportunities to address the El Campo/101 issue. He then read Caltrans' response to Board Member Achadjian's request (at the April meeting) to install a live video camera at the US 101 and Bl Campo Road intersection (Response #2 on page 5 of the Caltrans Report). He highlighted the last paragraph that says, "At this time, we have no available funding or plans to a install a live video camera at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road." Ms. Aileen Loe, Caltrans District 5 Deputy District Director for Planning and Programming, made clear that the live video cameras that Caltrans uses are for traffic management, not for near-miss
collisions.

4. Correspondence.- San Luis Obispo County request to address cross-traffic concerns

Correspondence from San Luis Obispo County Deputy Director of Public Works, Capital Projects, dated June 12, 2008 stated a desire to see at-grade intersections regulated to address cross-traffic concerns.. In particular, right turn only ingress and egress were suggested as the appropriate solution at the El Campo Road and Laetitia Winery intersections. The correspondence is provided in Attachment C and summarized below.
June 12, 2008 letter from County of San Luis Obispo (Dave Flynn, Deputy Director of Public. Works, Capital Projects) to California Department of Transportation District 5 (Rich Krumholtz (sic), District Director) regarding the Us 101 and El Campo Road intersection. In
this letter, Mr. Flynn makes the following statement regarding the intersection of US 101 and
El Campo Road:
"We understand your Traffic Safety branch that there is a minor project for improving the southbound shoulder at El Campo Road to accommodate right turn deceleration. While this is a positive operational improvement, it does not address cross-traffic concerns.
"In particular, right turn only ingress and egress may be the appropriate solution at EL Campo Road and Laetitià Winery intersections.

Traffic Counts

Average Daily Traffic (ADT) and Peak Hour volumes were collected on US 101 at the following locations:

1. ADT volumes were collected at the Laetitia Winery cross-over from February 12, 2009 February 25, 2009.

"Caltrans improves mobility across California"

2. ADT volumes were collected at the El Campo Road from October 21, 2008 -October 27, 2008.
3. AM Peak Hour counts were taken at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road on October 9, 2008

4. PM Peak Hour counts were taken at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road on October 14, 2008

The traffic study for this project is based upon existing peak hour volumes obtained from the September 2008 Laetitia Agricultural Cluster Environmental Impact Report and the Brisco Road - Halcyon Road Interchange Modification Project traffic analysis. The peak hour volumes at the intersections of US 101/Laetitia Winery and US 101/El Campo Road were adjusted to maintain consistency with the ADT volumes collected in October 2008 and February 2009. The ADT and peak hour volumes are contained within Attachments D -H.

Diversion

Closure of the El Campo Road and Laetitia Winery median access locations would result in the diversion of 942 ADT (122 AM peak hour, 77 PM peak hour). The El Campo median access accounts for 799 ADT (109 AM peak hour, 53 PM peak hour) with the Laetitia Winery median access accounting for the remaining 143, ADT (13 AM peak hour, 24 PM peak hour).
For a typical, weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) scenario, the closure of the EI Campo Road median access would result in the diversion of 799 ADT (109 AM peak hour, 53 PM peak hour). Thè predominant movement is the Eastbound left turn out of El Campo Road onto Northbound US 101. Seventy five percent (599 ADT, 82 AM peak hour, 40 PM peak hour) are expected to use adjacent State Highway facilities while the remaining twenty five percent (200 ADT, 27 AM peak hour, 13 PM peak hour) are expected to use the local street network since the origin/destination is assumed to be within the Five Cities area. Under a weekend scenario, the El Campo Road median closure would result in a diversion of 610 ADT (58 AM peak hour, 52 PM peak hour). Trip diversion is expected to occur at the following locations:
1. 200 ADT (27 AM peak hour, 13 PM peak hour) will be dispersed throughout the local street network since the origin/destination is assumed to be within the Five Cities area.

2. US 101 Northbound Ramps and Grand Avenue Intersection - 299 ADT (41 AM peak hour, 20 PM peak hour) will be diverted to the US 101 northbound on-ramp via the Grand Avenue
westbound right turn movement.
3. US 101 Northbound Ramps and Brisco Road Intersection - 300 ADT (41 AM peak hour, 20 PM peak hour) will be diverted to the US 101 northbound on-ramp via the Brisco Road northbound left turn movement:

4. El Camino Real and Brisco Road Intersection - 300 ADT (41 AM peak hour, 20 PM peak hour) will be diverted through the infersection of El Camino Real and Brisco Road via the El Camino
Real right turn movement.

"Caltrans improves mobility across California"

5. US 101 Southbound Ramps/Halcyon Road and El Camino Real Intersection - 300 ADT (41 AM peak hour, 20 PM peak hour) will be diverted through the intersection of US 101 Southbound Ramps/Halcyon Road and El Camino Real via the Halcyon Road northbound left turn
movement.

a For a typical weekday (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) scenario, the closure of the Laetitia Winery median crossover would result in the diversion of 143 ADT (13 AM peak hour, 24 PM peak hour). All diverted vehicles are expected to use adjacent state highway facilities to ingress/egress Laetitià Winery. Under a weekend scenario, the Laetitia Winery median closure would result in a diversion of 166 ADT (19 AM peak hour, 23 PM peak hour). Trip diversion is expected to occur at the following locations:
1. Thompson/Los Berros Road Interchange - 66 ADT (6 AM peak hour, 11 PM peak hour) will be diverted to the US 101 northbound on-ramp via the US 101 southbound off-ramp.
2. Grand Avenue Interchange - 77 ADT (7 AM peak hour, 13 PM peak hour) will be diverted to the US 101 southbound on-ramp via the US 101 northbound off-ramp.

Evaluation Criteria
Traffic Operations were evaluated under existing conditions with and without the project in place. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) strives to achieve LOS C operations for state-maintained facilities, but accepts LOS D as a goal in more developed and congested areas. Consistent with the Willow Road (Sponsor - County of San Luis Obispo) and Brisco Road/Halcyon Road (Sponsor - City of Arroyo Grande) Interchange Projects, LOS D will serve as the evaluation standard for the intersection (signalized and unsignalized) operational analysis. The Evaluation Criteria for the above referenced projects may be found in Attachment I.
Level of Service Analysis

The median closure of all at-grade intersection and crossover locations within the project limits. would result in the diversion of 942 ADT (122 AM peak hour, 77 PM peak hour) to the local street network and adjacent state highway facilities.
The intersections of US 101/Laetitia Vineyard Drive and US 101/El Campo Road operate at LOS F in both the morning and evening peak hours. Vehicles entering and exiting the Laetitia Winery and El Campo Road experience long delays as they wait for an acceptable gap in the high-speed traffic on US 101.

To maintain consistency with the Brisco Road - Halcyon Road Interchange Modification Project (05-0A3700), the signalized intersection analysis was based upon electronic files obtained from the City of Arroyo Grande on January 22, 2008 and approved by the Project Development Team (PDT) on 01/25/2008. The only changes made to these files were the addition of the project trips as well as modifications to the report header and footer, thus all assumptions used are identical. The project would:

"Caltrans improves mobility across California"

1. Improve the AM peak hour level of service (LOS) and vehicle delay at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road from LOS 'F' (Delay = 399.5 sec/veh) to LOS "C" (Delay = 18,2 sec/veh).
2. Improve the AM peak hour level of service (LOS) and vehicle delay at the intersection of US 101 and Laetitia Winery from LOS "F" (Delay = 82.5 sec/veh) to LOS "D" (32.9 sec/veh).
3. Improve the PM peak hour LOS and vehicle delay at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road from "F' (Delay = 823.2 sec/veh) to LOS "D" (Delay = 32.7 sec/veh).
4. Improve the PM peak hour LOS and vehicle delay at the intersection of US 101 and Laetitia Winery from "F* (Delay = 133.6 sec/veh) to LOS "E" (41:2 sec/veh).
Vehicle trips diverted to adjacent locations as a result of this project would not have a significant impact on the State Highway System or Local Street Network. All locations would continue to operate at or above the Level of Service (LOS) D' threshold. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results of the LOS Analysis. The LOS calculation worksheets may be found in Attachments J & K.

Emergency Passageways

The use of passageways shall be kept to a minimum and carefully located to provide good stopping sight distance to and from the opening along the freeway. Emergency passageways may be appropriate for highway patrol vehicles, emergency service vehicles such as tow trucks, ambulances, fire fighting apparatus and maintenance equipment. The need for such openings and their locations shall be established by the District in cooperation with the local Department of Highway Patrol office, fire district and emergency services. California Highway Patrol's Coastal Division Commander, Captain W.E. Vail was briefed on the median barrier project and proposed closure of the median crossovers. Cmdr. Vail is supportive of the median crossover closures.
Design parameters for Emergency Passageways are provided in Section 405.5(2) of the California Department of Transportation Highway Design Manual (HDM) which states in part:
"By a combination of interchange ramps and emergency passageways, provisions for access to the opposite side of the freeway may be provided for law enforcement, emergency, and maintenance vehicles to avoid extreme out-of-direction travel. Access should not be more frequent than at three- mile intervals. See Chapter 7 of the Traffic Manual for additional information of the design of emergency passageways. Emergency passageways should be located where decision sight distance is available (see Table 201.7)."

"Caltrans improves mobility across California"

Design Speed

A vehicle speed survey was conducted on June 3, 2009 to establish specific minimum geometric design elements for this project. The survey is contained within Attachment L. The results of the survey indicate the following design speeds are applicable to this project:
1. US 101 Northbound at El Campo Road - Prevailing Speed is 72 miles per hour
2. US 101 Southbound at El Campo Road - Prevailing Speed is 70 miles per hour
3. US 101 Northbound at Laetitia Winery Entrance - Prevailing Speed is 75 miles per hour
4. US 101 Southbound at Laetitia Winery Entrance - Prevailing Speed is 73 miles per hour

Conclusion

Based upon® the technical information contained within the attached analysis, Traffic. Operations has drawn the following conclusions:

1. The traffic operational analysis concludes that the median closure of all at-grade intersection and crossover locations within the project limits will not result in degradation to the state highway system or local street network. All state highway and local street facilities will continue to operate at an acceptable Level of Service.
2. This project would address the potential for future cross-median collisions by providing gap
closures between two existing segments of Median Barrier.

3. This project would lessen the severity of over-embankment collisions in the wider median areas.
4. This project would reduce the number of broadside collisions at the intersection of Highway 101 and El Campo Road.
5. This project would address the documented concerns raised by SLOCOG, City of Arroyo Grande, San Luis Obispo County, and County Supervisor Katcho Achadjian.

Recommendation

The recommendation is to restrict all left turn movements throughout the project limits. This would provide gap closures between two existing segments of Median Barrier, resulting in the median closure of all at-grade intersection and crossover locations within the project limits. This includes the El Campo Road (PM 11.83) and Laetitia Winery (PM 9.66) intersections and the three crossover locations at PM 9.13, PM 10.70; and PM 11.29.

Dear Ms. Ellason;
On behalf of the City of Arroyo Grande, we would like to again express our concerns regarding the impacts of the Busick Tract project as proposed. The most serlous impact 1.1 is traffic circulation. The project would contribute trips to the El Campo Road intérsection with. State Route 101, which is currently unsafe and Level of Service "F". Trafflo: Impact fees curtently collected by the County do not Include the potential construction" of a much needed interchange or improvements to El Campo Road between 101 and Los Berros. Road. Additionally, small contributions from reaidential suburben subdlvisions will not be sufficient to mitigate the circulation deficlenty. The recitculated DEIR correctly concludes that the traffic Impacts of this project are Class l, signifiçant, adverse and unavoldable, requiring findings and stetement of overriding considerations for approval,
Other impacts, Including inadequate publlc facilities and services such as fire protection are also adverse and only partially mitigated by measures outiined In the recirculated 1.2 DEJR. Whlle these ate potentially Class Il It mitigated, they are not resolved by fee payments alone. Neither the Januery 2004 Draft hor the March 2005 Recirculated DEIR address the tack of safe fire response time provided to the project area. The nearest CDF station in Nipamo is probably more than ten minutes away and even the City Fire Department may'be more than six minutes. At minimum, the City fire impact. fees should be collected, but the burden of City service to, County development Is: Inequitable: 1.4

TO: Julle Ellason, Environmental Specialist

FROM: Richand Mershal., Development Senviços Engineer LV
SUBJECT: Busick Tract 1789 - Re-Circulated Draft EIR
Thank you for the opportunity to review the Re-Circulated Draft EIR för the Buslok Tract: I have the following comments:
On page V-56, section TR/Impact 1 identifies trafflo at the intersection of El Campo Road and Highway 101 as a Class I (significant and unavoidable) Impact, This intersection is an 4.1
at-grade crossing, and is already operating at Level of Service (LOS) F, as noted earlier in the report. As such, the addition of project traffic to this facility constitutes a significant. impact. • ..
The specific Intersection movement of greatest concern is left tums from El Campo Road to: go: notthbound on the highway. A secondary concem would be léft turns from 4.2
northbound 101 to go onto EI Campo Road. Both of these movements are highly constrained by having to wait for acceptable length gaps in the southbound traffic on the highway. While there is some long-term potential for modifying this location into e grade separated Interchange, It is not reasonably related to the Impact of the proposed 16 lofs of this tract to require this developer to construct such an improvement. Short of requiring construction by this applicant, there is no mechanism In place for collecting a proportional share financlal contributlon. Thus, It has been conoluded that there is no improvement or other measure which adequately mitigates the identified signifipant impact,
Alternative mitigation to consider, I would like to suggest an alternative which might mitigate the Impact ine O # different way; éliminate the lefttuming movements at this • 4.3
intersection, Those who wish to go north from El Campo could elther go south on thé highway and turn back at elther the Laetitia Vineyard access or the Los Berros inferchange, or they could go south on El Campo and use Los Berros Road to head back northerly. Similarly, those wishing to turn left onto El Campo from northbound. 101 would

be able to use altematè routes that are not substantially out of the wäy, 4.3 (cont'd)
Re-routing trafflo with such a turn-movement restriction could result in adverse impacts at othet locations, The traffic consultant should evaluate this proposal to determine whether this would be the case. If there ate no adverse .impacts, then I suggest that a mitigation measure could be worded like this:
Prior to recordation of the final map, the applicant shell modify the El Campo/Route 101 Iintersection to eliminate. left-turn movements, under an encroachment permit from the Calitomia Depertment of Transportetion.

Board Member Ferrara seconded, and the motion carried on a voice vote, with Board Member Romero voting "no" and •Board Members Gibson, Ovitt, and Reiss absent.

President Patterson recessed the meeting at 10:14 a.m. and reconvened at 10:30 a.m.

A-3 Draft 2006 Transportation System Performance Indicators Report: Mr. Mike Harmon
summarized the draft 2006 Transportation System Performance Indicators Report, highlighting Its purpose and need - Respond to Federal and State Mandates for development of RTP; Address State requirements for RTP; and Improve the Planning Process to address local and regional needs by assessing performance and modifying programs, and noting the findings and recommended action for each performance indicator. He also noted the overall conclusions: 1) Traffic Congestion is increasing and funding inadequate to provide needed improvements; 2) Need to implement more aggressive and comprehensive demand management strategy; 3). Need to increase public transit, park-and-ride lots, vanpools, bicycling, & walking; and 4) Must address long-term transportation, housing, and land use issues. Mr. Harmon indicated that the staff recommendation is for the Board to accept the report.
Board Member Ferrara commented about the proposed action for the indicator - Travel. Time to Work (Implement smart growth strategies and principles that help reduce vehicle miles of travel), noting that there are other forces at play that have nothing to do with smart growth principles. He inquired If the major employers in this county (i.e., the County, Cal Poly, Cuesta College, the City of San Luis Obispo, etc.) are operating vanpools; if not, he asked what the Board could do to encourage and ensure employers provide that service. Mr..De Carli indicated there are several vanpool programs operated by Cal Poly, Caltrans, and Regional Rideshare. What is needed is to expand those efforts throughout the county and be more aggressive. Mr. Peter Rodgers noted that in the last two years, SLOCOG funded the vanpool program with Ride-On. However, it has been a topic of debate at the advisory committee meetings because of what some committee members believe to be potential conflict of funding, funding both the fixed route and vanpools at the same time.
Public Comments: Mr. Mark Shaffer, Ride-On. Transportation Director, brought to attention that Ride- On operates 25 vanpools throughout the county: He briefly discuissed the vanpool costs and ridership and stressed that vanpools are not in competition with the fixed route service because transit is cheaper.
Ms. Lisa Quinn, Regional Rideshare Program Manager, noted that the Regional Rideshare Program is currently promoting the Commute Plus Program and is increasing the number of people participating in ridesharing by offering: Incentives (i.e., Lucky Buck Program; the County's Pre-tax dollars Program). Board Member Ferrara talked about an innovative approach to vanpooling, citing as an example a .vanpooling started by a teacher, giving students a ride on shift basis. Ms. Quinn pointed out that Regional Rideshare's new online database for commute match will be effective in matching people to do ridesharing and vanpooling. In working with the San Luis Coastal Unified School District, staff found that the district is looking at having their own vanpool fleet.
President Patterson commented that it is obvious. that the results of the study are alarming. He then reminded the Board to be mindful that they still have other agenda items to address.
During the extensive discussion that occurred, the following comments were given: Board Member Achadjian: "Great report! I suggest that the locations of the accidents be provided so that member jurisdictions have that information to work on in their respective areas of responsibillty. Thanks to Caltrans (referring to Mr. Krumholz) for the information/response regarding the safety concemn I raised regarding EI Campo Road in the south county.

SLOCOG MINUTE. March 7, 2001 PAGE 7

Congestion is happening because jobs and almost all businesses are located in San Luis Obispo. The momning peak hour is the busiest time on the road: Perhaps, in order to improve traffio, the work hours should be shifted. Let us see if we can get our staff off the road during rush hour.". Mr. De Carli noted that improving traffic is part of the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) adopted policies (employer outreach; encourage vanpooling, use of transit & flex work hours). However, there is no single solution to this issue. He further noted that SLOCOG, Caltrans and the County are currently doing "flex hours," to help reduce employee commutes during peak hours. The different programs currentiy available can be expanded and improved. Mr. Krumholz said, "The Report shows how closely Caltrans monitor the system. We are happy to provide the information regarding El Campo road. The information is indicative of whaf is going on in the whole Highway 101 system. On congestion, It takes a very comprehensive program to address the problem, a problem that seems to significantly grow everyday. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) changeable messagé signs would provide a better detection system to alert motorists to accidents when they happen.
President Patterson: "We cannot let this issue just go away. We need to keep the discussion going at the advisory committee level.as well as the executive committee level. Include this Issue in the next Executive Committee agenda.' Board Member Peters: "It is wonderful to get all-those services (Passenger Rail, Commercial Airline, and Bike and Pedestrian Facillities), but we need to get those passengers to where they want to go after they get off the trainiplane. Is Travel Time to Work' based on congestion or is it because people live far from their jobs?" Mr. Harmon responded that It is based on the average speed - measure of the distance, not congestion. •Board Member Fred Strong: "Our planning practices need to change. want to remind staff and Caltrans to keep an eye on an Intersection in Paso Robles - Route 46 E and Airport Road - because a Water Park will soon 'be built at the comer of that infersection. The road improvement project for that intersection was just below the cutting line for funding. It needs to move forward as that intersection would become a safety issue (a lot of children will be
crossing).
Board Member O'Malley: "We all know there is a jobs/housing/shopping imbalance. We need to support each other to address issues. I have done my part relative to travel time; l am now retired and found I saved miles by commuting less. I suggest that maybe for employees, workload should be distributed, whereby they can telecommute and use the computers at home (especially those administrative-type of work). On the reduction of Park and Ride lots, the City of Atascadero is working on addressing the issue. We all need to be proactive. / would like to point out that the Transit Center in Atascadero is the City's priority." Board Member Lenthall: "Thank you Mr. Harmon for the report, It helps us out. Currently, the County has a $100m Capital Improvement Program (referring to the San Luis Obispo Regional Airport). We are looking forward to increasing the ridership to the airport (ridership population)." Vice President Shoals: "Staff did a very good job! Let us all continue the efforts on improving transit and rail; start funding altemative modes of transportation."
President Patterson asked for any public comments. Mr. Greening thanked staff for an excellent report. He noted that vanpools and transit do not need to compete if each would do what each system does best. "We deeply need options for single vehicle occupancy, Single occupant drivers need to pay their way and parking fees need to be built into the cost of driving. Economic incentives should go where they are needed." Mr. Greening brought to attention that the Hope Dance magazine has an article on modal shift,
etc.

Vice President Shoals moved to accept the report and directed staff to bring this issue back to the Executive Committee for consideration of future action. The motion was seconded by Board Member Achadjian, and passed on a voice vote, in the absence of Board Members Gibson, Ovitt,
and Reiss.

legislators lobbying for apportionment of funding for rail projects); and 3) Agenda |tem D-11, Revised Draft Callfornia Association of Councils of Governments (CALCOG) Policies to Implement Propositions 1C. and 84 Regional Growth Related Grants (which includes policies from the Califoria State Association of Counties [CSAC] and the League of California Cities. Mr. De Carli noted the upcoming CALCOG 14th Annual Regional Issues Forum (April 12*-13th, Monterey, California) and the California • Transportation Commission (CTC) meeting (April 25th-26th San Luis Obispo, Califomnia), updating the Board on the CTC meeting activities and major agenda items. He highlighted the CTC approval of additional funding of $710K to complete the Cottonwood Pass Climbing Lane on Highway 41, and briefly discussed the share of funding that the San Luis Obispo Region/SLOCOG will be receiving from Proposition 1A and Proposition 1B.
Public Comments: Referring to the last two lines on the bottom of page 2 of the Executive Director's Report that says, 'The region will likely to receive a total of $112 to $120 million in Proposition 1B funding...," Mr. Greening stated that the citizens of this region will Ilkely pay a little less than 1% of the statewide Bond repayment cost over the next 30 years if that responsibllity is conservatively estimated at $360m. He noted that the cost to the region would be approximately three times the estimated benefits and urged everyone to be more cautious in the future, if anything like Proposition 1B would come into the ballot agaln. He pointed out that it would be the youth of today who will be indentured to pay the debt in the next 30 years.
President Patterson called for any comments from the Board and further comments from the public; there were no comments.

CALTRANS DISTRICT 5 DIRECTOR'S REPORT: Mr. Rich Krumholz, Caltrans District 5 Director, said that as Mr. De Carli mentioned in. the Executive Director's Report, Caltrans has began a major repaving project for Highway 46 between Cambria and Paso Robles. He indicated that Caltrans continues its commitment to be environmentally friendly by using rubberized asphalt on this project. Mr. Krumholz stated he is happy to report that the Cottonwood Pass Climbing Lane project on Highway 41 near the San Luis Obispo/Kern County line (a project that SLOCOG co-funded) will be going to construction, because the much needed additional funding of $710k has been approved by the CTC. He thanked Mr. De Carli for the show of support during the CTC hearing where Mr. Krumholz made an appeal for the additional funding. Mr. Krumholz brought to attention Caltrans' continued emphasis on detection out on the state highway system. Caltrans now has live video streaming and it is now
available ät more locations - Pismo Beach (three cameras at various locations), Paso Robles, and Atascadero. Three more are coming on line - one at the 101/58 junction and two in San Luis Obispo (Broad Street/101 & 101/Grand). He encouraged everyone to visit Caltrans website and check out the
live videos. He also reminded everyone to time their commute wisely in order to avoid traffic congestion and to slow down for the "cone zone.".
President Patterson asked for any comments from the Board and the public. There were no public
comments.

Board Member Bruce Gibson inquired about the improvements on Highway 41 in the Cottonwood Pass area. Mr. Krumholz said that a climbing lane/passing lane (about a mile in length; in the Kern County side, & administered by Caltrans District 6) is currently under construction. He noted that the Cottonwood project is going to extend that climbing lane project another mile.
(Board Member Fred Strong arrived at 8:45 a.m.)
Board Member Katcho Achadjian asked if it would be possible for Caltrans to install one of those live video cameras somewhere on 101/EI Campo Road (South County). He said any help on this matter would be great. Mr. Krumholz said he could look into a possibility of a video camera at that location.
He noted that possibility depends on power avallability, connections/conduits, etc. He indicated he

would report back on this issue and that he would like to continue to work with Board Member Achadjian on the issues of concern on that location. Mr. De Carll noted that SLOCOG staff in the past had raised a safety concern on that location. At that time, Caltrans responded with a proposed "Minor B" project. However, after further evaluation, the project was found to have exceeded the Minor B project capital llmit, so the project did not go through. Per Project Study Report (PSR) that was completed on this project, the.cost of constructing an interchange at that location would be between
interchange project. $20-60m. Mr. De Carll pointed out that a significant development on that area would help fund an

TRANSPORTATION ITEMS:
A-1 2007/08 Unmet Transit Needs - Findings: Mr. Tim Glllham discussed the staff report, reviewing the Unmet Transit Needs Criteria and the unmet transit needs findings, and highlighting the requests found to be unmet transit needs that were evaluated for "reasonableness to meet" criteria 1) Expand weekend evening service on San. Luis Obispo (SLO) Transit; 2) Expand weekly evening service on SLO Transit; 3) Extend South County Area Transit (SCAT) bus service to serve the Oceano Senior Center; 4) Provide shuttle service from Cambria to the North County; and 5) Increase RTA Route 12 coverage (early evening) at Cuesta College campus in SLO. Mr. Gillham noted that the request to extend the SLO Transit Route 4 to serve the Del Rio/Prefumo Canyon Road stop was found to be operational in scope, not an unmet transit need. SLO Transit-may consider a route change upon completion of the Irish Hills
Commercial Center and/or pending the update on their Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP). Mr. Gillham pointed out that the staff recommendation is to approve the Resolution finding there are no "unmet transit needs" that are "reasonable to meet" for the 2007/2008 fiscal year and to reschedule for further review Request #3 and #5 (as outlined above) to the June 2007 SLOCOG Board meeting.
Referring to Table A-1-7 (a table on agenda page A-1-17 that compares the projected cost-effectiveness performance of three different scenarios used in the evaluation of the request to provide shuttle service from Cambria to the North County), Board Member Glbson questioned if the nature or size of the vehicle being used (e.g., full size buses för RTA fixed route = 25 dally riders, versus - smaller shuttle = 15 daily riders) could influence ridership. He added that given the nature of this county and because smaller vehicles incur less cost, they could be programmed to run more frequently; thus, improving the overall transit system. Mr. Peter Rodgers noted that Cambria to the North County is a long distance to travel and that the operating costs on small vehicles are not much lower than those of the full size vehicles. He H Cnd added that in their evaluation of this request, staff could not find anything (under the three scenarios outlined in the staff report) comparable with similar services (areas that connect fixed route with small vehicles). Mr. De Carli recommended continuing this issue for further analysis, noting that based on the current analysis, this service request would not result in adequate ridership level. He said staff could meet with RTA and Ride-On to further analyze the issue and see if they can come up with a different conclusion. • Board Member Harry Ovitt noted that ridesharing is probably a better solution. Board Member Gibson remarked that if further analysis would be useful, he would support it.
Board Member Fred Strong recommended conducting a separate analysis on route loops (i.e., Paso Robles-Cambria-SLO-Paso Robles & Paso Robles-SLO-Cambria-Paso Robles), noting the possible positive effects on tourism and that it may reduce traffic congestion. Mr. Rodgers indicated staff did not look at more creative routes such as the one suggested by Board Member Strong; however, they could bring back a recommendation to that effect. Mr. De Carli said a more detailed analysis on the East/West connections could be done under the Short Range Transit Plan (SRTP). It will be a more comprehensive detalled evaluation, which would be the basis on assessing how the Issue can be addressed. Board Member Janice Peters stated she certainly supports looking at a loop that would go through Morro Bay to Cambria, saying it would benefit tourism. Noting that the other two items (Request #3 & #5) both do not meet the farebox ratio, Board Member Peters inquired if there would be further study to find ways for those two to meet the farebox ratio reguirement. On Request #5 (Increase RTA Route 12 coverage [early evening] at Cuesta College campus in SLO), Mr. De Carli indicated there a is a huge need; however, both

unrepresented communities into the planning and outreach. He added that he is pleased to see that the SLOCOG Board will confront the stupidity of the Governor's budget. President Patterson thanked Mr. Greening for his comments, saying, "Let us hope we can rise to the challenge." Mr. Ronald De Carli brought to attention that included in the agenda is an item on the Governor's budget, noting that staff has been working very hard in getting input from stakeholders on Community 2050 issues. He further noted that Consent Agenda Item E-14 deals with getting a Request for Proposals (RFPs) out to conduct a public opinion survey, one way to engage the public more.

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR'S REPORT: Mr. De Carli discussed the Executive Director's Report, summarizing the following: State Transportation Programming, Regional Visloning, Projects under construction or going to bi; Projects being approved by the California Transportation Commission (CTC); Projects scheduled for CTC approval in July meeting; Arroyo Grande (AG) pursuing SR 227 relinquishment in AG Village for street design improvements; and a number of Upcoming issues in August. Mr. De Carli then brought to attention that staff recently received a letter from the Department of Housing and Community Development regarding the Regional Housing Need Determination, and Housing Element Update Schedule. It details the state mandate for Councils of Govemments (COGs) to start the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) process and to develop a proposed methodology for distributing regional housing need numbers to each city and county beginning June 30, 2007.. Staff will start that process and will give the Board an update on this issue in August.
Board Member Katcho Achadjlan reminded the Board how the cities and the county had difficulty last time because of differences. He said he hopes that this time around member Jurisdictions would be much smarter and will move together and be more united on this issue. He asked about the funding status of the project in the south county (I.e., Halcyon area). Mr. De Carli indicated that the funding for that (which will allow four auxilliary lanes in the south county) looks promising, adding that the CTC will likely vote on It by tomorrow (June 7th). Board Member Achadjian Inquired about Caltrans' concem on the Tefft Street (Nipomo) project redesign. Mr. Philip Chu said he spoke with the County Engineering staff and was Informed that they (the County) are resubmitting the Project Study Report (PSR) of that project to Caltrans. It is currently under review and SLOCOG staff will update the Board on this issue at a future meeting. Mr. De Carli noted staff would set up a meeting with Caltrans on this issue. Board
Member Achadjian requested that Mr. Dan Woodson of the Nipomo Advisory Committee be included in that meeting, He also requested to bring the US 101/El Campo Road right turn issue to the table. Mr. De Carli said staff could ask. Caltrans to evaluate the opportunities to address the El Campo/101 issue. • He then read Caltrans' response to Board Member Achadjian's request (at the April meeting) to install a live video camera at the US 101 and El Campo Road Intersection (Response #2 on page 5 of the Caltrans Report). He highlighted the last paragraph that says, "At this time, we have no available funding or plans to a install a live video camera at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road." Ms. Alleen Loe, Caltrans District 5 Deputy District Director for Planning and Programming, made clear that
the live video cameras that Caltrans uses are for traffic management, not for near-miss collisions.
Board.Member Tony Ferrara brought to attention that the US 101/Brisco Road off ramp in Arroyo Grande is temporarily closed to traffic. The City of Arroyo Grande is monitoring the dispersion patterns at that interchange as part of exploring alternative solutions to congestion.
Board Member Harry Ovitt pointed out an issue that just started to surface relative to the Proposition 1B funds - low supply of aggregate materials. He noted that the Nacimiento Water project in particular is going to put a tremendous demand on aggregate materials; this County may not be able to keep up with the demand.

CALTRANS DISTRICT 5 DIRECTOR'S REPORT: Ms. Alleen Loe, Caltrans District 5 Deputy District Director for Planning and Programming, brought to attention that included in the agenda packet is the Caltrans Report, which covers the current Caltrans construction projects in the county as well as

Dear Mr. De Carli:

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS RAISED DURING APRIL 4, 2007 BOARD MEETING
This is in response to questions raised to the Department of Transportation (Caltrans) during the San Luis Obispo Council of Govemnments' board meeting held April 4, 2007.
1) SLOCOG staff requested an.updato on Caltrans' Minor B candidate shoulder-widening project located at the intersection of El Campo Road and US 101.
Response: This shoulder-widening projcct was initiated for southbound US 101 drivers turning west onto EI Campo Road. Its purpose is to provide additional paved shoulder for deceleration. The estimated $112,000 project is tentatively scheduled to start construction in Spring 2008.
2) Board Member Achadjian requested a live video camcra at the interscction of US 101 and El Campo Road to better determine the number of near-miss collisions at that location.
Response: Caltrans has a well-developed accident surveillance and analysis system in place tracking actual collisions uniformly throughout the state. The live video cameras are not intended to monitor near-miss collisions.

Caltrans Transportation Management Centers use the live images from closcd-circuit television cameras to verify reported incidents and dispatch the appropriate response. Additionally, Caltrans makes somc live video available on the Caltrans web pagc so commuters can makè informed decisions regarding congestion, such as when to take a trip on a certain frceway.
Currently, we have five live video cameras in San Luis Obispo County at the following locations: US 101 at Highway 46 East in Paso Robles
US 101 at. Curbaril Avcnue in Atascadero
US 101 at Highway 1 in Pismo Beach US 101- at Fourth Strcet in Pismo Beach® US 101 at Mattic Road in Pismo Beach

Caltrans plans to activate the following camera locations later this year: US 101 at Highway 58 in Santa Margarita US 101 at Broad Street and Grand Avenue in San Luis Obispo
At this time, we have no available funding or plans to install a live video camera at the intersection of US 101 and El Campo Road.
3) Board Member O'Malley requested an update on the City of Atascadero's Signal/Roundabout Study at US 101 and Santa Barbara Road.
Response: The City's consultant, W-Trans of Santa Rosa, is conducting operational® improvement studies on all cight interchanges on US 101 within the city limits. The City expects to send the Signal/Roundabout Study to Caltrans for review and comment within the next few weeks.
4) Board Member Romcro asked Caltrans to expedite the Olive Street/Highway 1 right-turn channclization Project Study Report/Project Report.
Respouse: Caltrans is preparing Project Initiation Document (PSR/PR) as a candidate for the 2008 State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). The estimated $800,000 project is located on southbound Highway I at Olive Street in the City of San Luis Obispo. The project proposes to incrcase the capacity of the southbound right-turn lane on Highway (Santa Rosa Strect) and Olive Street by lengthening the right-turn lane to extend to Montalban Strect.
The project will require right of way acquisition, widening the existing roadway, utility relocation and construction of new curb, gutter, and sidewalk. The environmental document is expected to be a Categorical Exemption. If the project were funded in the 2008 STIP, construction would probably begin in late 2010 or early 2011. The long lead-time is due to the usual 18 to 24 months required to purchase right of way property.
Wc hopc thesc responses have adequatcly answered your questions. If you have any further questions, please contact Cindy Utter at 805-549-3648 or cindy_utter@dot.ca.gov.

San Luis Obispo, CA 93401
Subject: Median Access/At-Grade Intersections. 05-SLO-101; PM 7.9/12.1

Dear Mr. Krumholtz:

The Public Works •Department would request that the median along Route 101 from access points El Campo Road to Los Berros Road interchange be evaluated for operations and safety. We would like to see an overall plan on what measures may be taken at these locations and have our agencies agree on the means to manage existing and future conditions on this stretch of highwaÿ.
We understand from your Traffic Safety branch that there is a minor project for improving the southbound shöulder at El Campo Road to accommodate right turn deceleration. While this is a positive operational improvement, it does not address cross- traffic concerns, Traffic Safety also indicated that a median barrier project was under consideration south of Arroyo Grande. If that is to move forward, we would like to.see how the at-grade intersections may be regulated. In particular, right turn only ingress and egress may be the appropriate solution at EI Campo Road and Laetitia Winery intersections. For the latter, there is a development EIR currently in process and now is the time to provide clear direction regarding future access regulations  that should be addressed in the EIR.
For the long term planning of the corridor, our office had participated in the development of the City's El Campo Road interchange PSR. If there General Plan Amendments approved in the North Mesa area, the County would likely tie the development to such a project with the City; to the extent practical from traffic impacts and serviceability of El Campo Road.. The placement of an interchange

in this area should be at a location which best serves freeway operations and elimination of other median openings to the south of El Campo Road. Nearer Los Berros interchange, a frontage road or alternative local route for Laetitia Winery entrance will need to be developed.
We appreciate your attention to this matter and the guidance your staff can provide to the implementation of an overall plan. If you have any questions, please contact me at (805) 781-4463.
Sincerely;
Dove Fuim DAVE FLYNN Deputy Director of Public Works, Capital Projects

Evaluation Criteria

Traffic operations were evaluated under existing (Year 2003) conditions and Year 2030 traffic
conditions with and without the project altematives in place. San Luis Obispo County has identifled LOS D as the criterion for acceptable operations. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) strives to achieve LOS C operations for state-maintained facillties, but accepts LOS D as a
goal in more developed and congested areas, which will include Nipomo by 2030. Therefore, LOS D will serve as the evaluation standard for the freeway ramp junction and intersection (signalized and unsignalized) operations.

2. Thresholds of Significance
Significance criteria for evaluating project impacts on traffic conditions derive from the CEQA Guidelines Appendix G and the County of San Luis Obispo Initial Study Checklist. The project would have a significant impact if any of the following conditions occur.

The project causes traffic conditions to exceed, either individually or cumulatively, level of service Di;
The project causes an increase in traffic which is substantial in relation to the existing traffic load and capacity of the street system; The project increases vehicle trips to the local or area-wide circulation system; The project results in inadequate emergency access; The project substantially increases hazards due to a design feature or incompatible uses; The project conflicts with adopted policies, plan, or programs supporting alternative transportation;
The project results in a change in air traffic patterns, including either an increase in traffic levels
or a change in location that results in substantial safety risks;

San Luis Obispo County and Caltrans have both established LOS C as a Countywide target on all County- and State-maintained roads and highways. However, LOS D is accepted in more developed and congested areas, which will include Nipomo by 2030.

INTRODUCTION & BACK GROUND
In 2001, the City of Arroyo Grande completed a Project Study Report (Project Development Support) [PSR(PDS)] to develop and study alternatives to improve the operation of the Brisco Road - Halcyon Road interchange on State Route 101 (SR 101) in the central portion of the city.  The approved PSR(PDS) identified five "build" alternatives, and recommended that three "build" alternatives and the "no-build" alternative be carried forward for further evaluation. The current effort was initiated in 2005 as part of the Project Approval & Environmental Determination (PA&ED) phase intended to further refine the project alternatives, complete environmental analysis for the interchange improvements, and to obtain Caltrans District 5 (and SLOCOG) approval of a Project Report (PR) to define a project for design and construction. Wood Rodgers prepared a technical memorandum titled SR 101/Brisco Rd/Halcyon Rd I/C Modifications Traffic Forecasting and Operations Analysis (dated 08/08/2005) in order to quantify traffic operations for the four project alternatives (the "no-build" and "build" alternatives 1, 2 and 3). Per City request, three supplemental technical memorandums (Wood Rodgers, dated 06/04/2007, 11/19/2007, and 12/21/2007) were completed to evaluate additional alternatives/options and phasing concepts. A "summary memorandum" (Wood Rodgers, dated 11/21/2007) was also completed to help assist in the Council and PDT selection of a "preferred" alternative and a phasing strategy for the project. Subsequent to discussions between City, Caltrans and SLOCOG staff, it was agreed that an "operational improvernent" project (essentially a first phase of Alternative 1, whereby the Brisco ramps are kept open) be further refined as an interim solution to alleviate some of the existing operational issues on Brisco Road at the undercrossing. To that end, Wood Rodgers completed Synchro/SimTraffic analysis that quantified current operational deficiencies at the intersections adjacent to the Brisco Road Undercrossing, and reviewed the analysis files with Caltrans Traffic Operations staff. Caltrans staff indicated formal approval of the "existing conditions operational analysis" at the project discussion meeting held on 01/25/08.
City staff subsequently directed that Alternative 3 (as described in the 08/08/2005 memorandum) be taken up for further consideration. Several variants of the Alternative 3 concept were explored at meetings with City staff held on 03/04/2008 and 04/28/2008. A variation of Alternative 3 - now referred to as "Alternative 3A" - was developed through this process. This memorandum has been prepared to document cumulative (year 2030) operational analysis for the newly proposed Alternative 3A:

"ALTERNATIVE 3A" DESCRIPTION
"Alternative 3A" is a variant of Alternative 3 as originally proposed in the PSR(PDS). Appendix Exhibit 1 illustrates "Alternative 3A" concept, which includes the following design features:
Closure of SR 101 northbound on- and off-ramps at Brisco Road and removal of the traffic signal equipment at the ramp intersection.
Lengthening the Brisco Road Undercrossing to accommodate four lanes on Brisco Road: (Note: This feature may not be implemented during the first phase of construction for Alternative 3A. This analysis includes an estimate of the required schedule for the widening of Brisco Road.)
Closure and removal of the SR 101 northbound on-ramp from East Grand Avenue.
Realignment of West Branch Street to intersect East Grand Avenue at the current location of the SR 101 northbound on-ramp. . West Branch Street, to the east of the proposed realignment, would be reconstructed so that access to adjacent properties is maintained. The existing West Branch Street approach to East Grand Avenue will be terminated as a cul-de-sac.
Construction of a niew SR 101 northbound hook on- and off-ramps to intersect with West Bränch Street across from Old Ranch Road, and implementation of appropriate intersection control (traffic signal or roundabout).
East Grand Avenue / SR 101 Northbound Off-Ramp intersection modifications - "Pork chop" islands (at both the SR 101 northbound off-ramp approach and West Branch Street approach) will be constructed to permit only left- and right-turn traffic movements from the SR 101 northbound off-ramp and southbound West Branch Street. The eastbound left-turn movement from Grand Avenue to W. Branch Street will be retained. The pork chop configuration will prevent through traffic movements between the northbound off-ramp and West Branch Street. The Grand Avenue
eastbound approach stop bar will be moved approximately 150 feet west to provide space for safe left turns from the off-ramp to westbound Grand Avenue. An exclusive right-turn lane will be provided on the westbound Grand Avenue approach for vehicles turning onto W. Branch Street. The single left-turn lane on the SR. 101 northbound off-ramp will be retained for vehicles turning onto westbound Bast Grand Avenue.
Relocation of the southbound SR 101 on-ramp at East Grand Avenue to opposite the existing SR 101 southbound off-ramp, and associated traffic signal phasing modifications.
Lengthening the SR 101 southbound off-ramp to Halcyon Road.
Construction of an auxiliary lane on SR 101 between the Halcyon Road southbound on-ramp and the East Grand Avenue southbound off-ramp and construction of a retaining wall adjacent to this auxiliary lane. Note: This auxiliary lane is being constructed as a separate SLOCOG project, so may not be considered a part of Alternative 3A..
Under "Alternative 3A", the following optional features are also evaluated in this memorandum:
Schedule for lengthening the Brisco Road Undercrossing - The potential for deferring the widening of Brisco Road by lengthening the Brisco Road Undercrossing to a later stage of the project is evaluated. Restriping Brisco Road under the existing undercrossing to accommodate two southbound (westbound) lanes and one northbound (eastbound) lane is considered as an interim improvement until more than three lanes are required, making the structure modification necessary.
Control Configuration for West Branch Street/Old Ranch Road intersection - This intersection is evaluated for operations as a traffic signal-controlled intersection versus a roundabout intersection.
Old Ranch Road Closure - The impacts of terminating Old Ranch Road near its connection to West
Branch Street are evaluated. The southerly segment of Old Ranch Road would terminate as a cul-de- sac just east of West Branch Street to provide driveway access to the proposed Sports and Fitness

"YEAR 2030 ALTERNATIVE 3A" OPERATIONS
Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the cumulative ""Y ear 2030" traffic volume forecasts for Alternative 3A. The City of Arroyo Grande completed a "before/after" test study in May-June 2007, to determine traffic redistribution due to a temporary closure of the SR 101 northbound on/off ramps at Brisco 1 Road. The Alternative 1 traffic forecasts adjusted based on findings from the City's "before/after" study were included in the 11/19/2007 memorandum. The "Alternative 3A" forecasts included in this memorandum are revisions to the "Alternative 3" forecasts (as reported in the 08/08/2005 memorandum); with further adjustments based on the findings of the City's "before/after" study.
INTERSECTION OPERATIONS
Year 2030 "Alternative 3A" intersection operations were quantified using the year 2030 traffic volumes shown in Appendix Figure 1, and Alternative 3A improvements illustrated in Appendix Exhibit 1. Table 1 presents the resulting intersection levels of service (LOS).

Mitigation strategies for LOS "E" conditions at this Intersection are discussed in the memorandum text. Results are based on Rodel software used in conjunction with the FHWA roundabout design guidelines.

As shown in Table 1, all study intersections are projected to operate at acceptable LOS conditions in year 2030, except the Camino Mercado/West Branch Street/SR 101 northbound on-off ramps intersection, which is projected to operate at LOS "E" in the afternoon peak hour, Furthermore, the Grand Avenue eastbound left turn lane from Grand Avenue to West Branch Street is projected to experience queues that exceed available capacity under AM and PM peak hour conditions in 2030.
The projected LOS "E" condition at the Camino Mercado/West Branch Street intersection is similar to the projected "Alternative 1" operations (indicated in the 11/19/2007 memorandum) at this intersection in 2030. The potential mitigation strategies for the Camino Mercado/West Branch Street/SR 101 Northbound Ramps intersection include the following:

TRAFFIC SIGNAL VS. ROUNDABOUT AT WEST BRANCH STREET / OLD RANCH ROAD/ SR 101.
NORTHBOUND RAMPS INTERSECTION
As indicated in Table 1, the West Branch Street / Old Ranch Road / SR 101 Northbound Ramps intersection was evaluated under two different intersection control scenarios - traffic signal and roundabout
Traffic Signal - A preliminary analysis using California MUTCD-based peak hour volume signal warrant #3 criteria indicates that a traffic signal would be warranted at the West Branch Street / Old Ranch Road / SR 101 Northbound Ramps intersection. As shown in Table 1, a traffic signal is projected to provide acceptable intersection LOS operations in year 2030, with minor modifications (i.e., addition of left-türn lanes). However, long queues (>700 feet) are projected during the peak hour periods for the westbound (northbound) West Branch Street left-turn traffic movement. The
provision of dual left-turn lanes for this movement could reduce the maximum queue lengths to approximately 200 feet during the peak hour periods. However, dual left-turn lanes would require provisioni of two receiving lanes on the SR. 101 northbound on-ramp, which may not be acceptable to Caltrans, so. a single northbound left turn lane is retained.
Roundabout - The projected 2030 PM peak hour circulating flow is close to the HCM-2000.based allowable maximum of 1,200 vehicles per hour for an urban single-lane roundabout. Therefore, large diameters and entrance angles would be needed for efficient roundabout operation. The Rodel software was used in this roundabout feasibility evaluation. Rodel is a recognized British roundabout analysis software (also widely accepted in the US) that provides interactive feedback on roundabout operations based on user-inputted geometric characteristics. Rodel uses roundabout capacity thresholds calibrated based on field-measured "at capacity" conditions for roundabouts operational in Britain. HCM-2000 (and Synchro software) analysis methods (which use theoretical upper and lower bound volume/capacity ratios, dependent on intersection approach flows and circulating flows) are not considered accurate for evaluation of multi-lane roundabouts and/or roundabouts with circulating flows exceeding 1,200 vehicles per hour. As indicated in Table 1, preliminary evaluation using the Rodel software indicates that peak hour LOS "D" or better roundabout operations can be achieved at the West Branch Street/Old Ranch Road/SR 101 Northbound Ramps intersection in 2030 if the
following geometrics can be provided:
Single-lane roundabout with a minimum inscribed circular diameter (D) of 120 feet.
Entrance width (E) of 20 feet for westbound (northbound) West Branch Street approach and 16 feet for all other approaches. Flare length (L') of 180 feet for westbound (northbound) West Branch Street approach and 80 feet for all other approaches.
Street half-width section (i.e. lane width, V) of 11 feet.
Entry radius (R) of 65-feet on all approaches
Entry angle (phi) of 25 degrees.

As shown in Table 4, the mainline-ramp (diverge) junction at the SR 101 northbound off-ramp to West Branch Street is projected to operate at LOS "D" or better conditions with the existing four-
lane mainline section. All other study ramp junctions are projected to operate at LOS "E" or worse in one or both peak hours in year 2030 with the existing four-lane mainline cross-section. With the planned future six-lane mainline section, all study ramp junctions are projected to provide LOS "D" or better operations. With four-lane mainline, the provision of a northbound auxiliary lane between the Old Ranch Road on-ramp and the Camino Mercado off-ramp would improve ramp junction operations to LOS "D". However, this improvement may require widening the Brisco Road Undercrossing structure.
FREEWAY MAINLINE WEAVING OPERATIONS
Freeway mainline weaving operations analysis was completed using the Leisch methodology outlined in the Caltrans Highway Design Manual. The results of the weaving segment analysis are shown in Table 5.

As shown in Table 5, all study weaving segments on SR 101 are projected to operate at LOS. "C" or better conditions in 2030 with the existing four-lane mainline section plus auxiliary lanes (in the southbound direction).
TIMING FOR BRISCO ROAD UNDERCROSSING LENGTHING IMPROVEMENTS
Consistent with the findings of the 08/08/2005 memorandum for Alternatives 1 and 3, the Brisco Road intersections with El Camino Real and West Branch Street are projected to provide, acceptable peak hour LOS "D" or better operations through year 2030 under "Alternative 3A" with re-striping of Brisco Road under the existing undercrossing to provide two southbound (westbound) lanes, and one northbound (eastbound) lane (plus 100-foot northbound left-right shared pocket at West Bränch Street). Although these critical intersections provide acceptable Year 2030 LOS operations with
süch re-striping, queue spillbacks were anticipated between closely-spaced adjacent intersections. Lengthening the existing undercrossing to provide at least four lanes on Brisco Road is necessary to accommodate the projected queues on the southbound and northbound Brisco Road approaches to El •Camino Real and Branch Street, respectively. Therefore, the reconstruction of the existing Brisco Road undercrossing is included as a "year 2030" feature under Alternatives 1, 3, and 3A. A phasing analysis was performed in order to evaluate how many years the existing undercrossing would provide adequate operations (queuing) before structure reconstruction is necessary.
The closure of the Brisco Road on- and off-ramps (in the first phase of Alternative 3A) will decrease traffic demands and queuing on Brisco Road under the undercrossing. Under project opening day (year 2010) conditions, the Brisco Road intersections are projected to operate acceptably from an LOS standpoint and the existing three-lane section under the undercrossing is not projected-to experience queue spillovers. Therefore, on project opening day (year 2010) it is recommended (and assumed) that the Brisco Road Undercrossing is not lengthened. The Brisco Road intersections at the undercrossing are projected to operate acceptably from an LOS standpoint under Year 2030 "Alternative 3A" conditions. However, the queuing/stacking issues on Brisco Road are projected to reoccur at the undercrossing well before year 2030. A re-striped Brisco Road with two southbound lanes and one northbound lane, without physical widening, is projected to experience queues that exceed storage capacity under year 2030 conditions. The available queue storage length between El Camino Real and West Branch Street is approximately 270 feet (from stop bar to end of curb return). Based on a review of traffic operations (using SimTraffic 7 software), the critical southbound left- 7
turn movement is projected to experience queues under the undercrossing that would exceed
available storage capacity by approximately year 2020. Therefore, it appears that the widening of Brisco Road to four lanes by reconstruction of the undercrossing would be needed by approximately year 2020 to provide adequate queue storage capacities on Brisco Road, and avoid spillbacks through adjacent intersections.
OLD RANCH ROAD CLOSURE
A preliminary analysis of the impacts of closing and realigning Old Ranch Road was also completed. This concept would terminate Old Ranch Road near its connection to West Branch Street as a cul-de- sac providing driveway access to/from the proposed Sports and Fitness Center located southeast of the West Branch Street/Old Branch Street intersection. The northerly segment of Old Ranch Road would be realigned to connect to Vernon Street. This concept is anticipated to cause only minor redistribution of Old Ranch Road traffic volumes (less than 50 peak hour vehicles) to adjacent streets and intersections in the local vicinity. Based on a preliminary review, no significant change to the study intersections, roadways, freeway mainline, and/or freeway ramp junctions LOS operations are projected due to the closure/realignment of Old Ranch Road. Furthermore, the closure of Old Ranch Road is not anticipated to increase the feasibility of the roundabout option at the West Branch Street/ Old Ranch Road/SR 101 northbound ramps intersection.

Subject El Campolsoutti County Freeway Conversion Trattid Displacement Assessment
Dear Mr: Rogers:
Thank you for including the City of Arroyo Grande (City) as à Stakehölder for the very important consideration of impending access modification to Highway 101 immediately south of the Cily. City staft has reviewed the El Campo Road/South County Freaway Conversion Traffic Displacement. Assesement Report (Assessment) prepared by GHD Company. for SLOCOG, March 2019, and has the following comments:
City staff supporte the project goal of providing safer travel for South County residents and users af Highway 1ot. The SLOCOS boerd is requesting that Caltrans implement jeft tum movement restrictions (continuing to allow rightin and right-out onty aocese) at four at grade interssctions on US 101 between Traffic Way and Los Berros Road (the project ).. The intersections indlude Él Campo, Unnamed Road, Tovier Grove DrivelLaeutia Winery, and Hemi Road, and all are E Jocated within the County of San Luis Obispa The Assessmeht provides Inforiation regarding detour routes. and operalional and uataty Implicatone to the rosdways due to the project, ana provides recommendations for near-temm and longer-term salutions The concluslons clearly demonstrale that the City recelves the brunt of impacts due to the proposed projedt in addition.fo already existing regional trips from growth in the County Withiout funding sorresponding regional cin ciroulation projects. This is due to South County residents utilizing (pcal roules through the City to access the highway.
Trips from the South County have siready been partially diverted from directly aocessing Highway 101 at the subjact four al-grade crossings over time by virtue of increased growth in the south cpunty (estimated to pontinue to Increase by 2.3% vear) and increased traffé volumes of Highway 101 and the resuting percatved karely concems for travelers making iefi tum movements at these crossings: These thps are referred to as latent demand in the Assessment and, as the projéct was not scoped: to calculate delays associated with these tripe it should be acknowledged thet they are not reflected in total estimate:
One of the shont temm conseduences mey resul from the restricted furn modificatione as Identified in the assessment is the number of U tumns that may occur at Highway 101 honh bound oif ramp and south bound on ramp ei Traffic Wey. It has been shown that people will choose the shortest route to get to their desired tocation. The city has several projects cumently ünder consiruction in this generst vidinity.  These oh and oft rampa will need all three unsdietions to provide solution for this unintended consequence. The ceport recommends signage to detour Reaple to the south bound on ramp at Grand, the City ane its police depariment are not convinded that this will be sufficient to deter people from making the llegat U tum.

Re: EI Campo Road/South County Highway Access Modifications
Dear Mr. Rodgers:

We have been retained to represent Vintage Wine Estates, the new owners of Laetitia Winery, with respect to various matters including the potential closure of Tower Grove Drive from southbound Highway 101. Tower Grove Drive provides ingress and egress to the winery and tasting room. The closure of Tower Grove Drive is being considered in conjunction with the partial closure of the El Campo Road and Highway 101 intersection due to safety concerns following à recent fatal collision at that intersection. We want to make it clear that Vintage favors taking action at the El Campo access point to improve the safety of our community and avoid another tragedy such as befell Jordan Grant, his family and friends.

However, we do have some questions .and. concerns as to why and how Tower Grove Drive has become a part of the El Campo problem. It seems from the very limited staff report, the concern is that vehicles exiting El Campo that cannot access northbound Highway 101 will turn south to take the two mile trip to Tower Grove Drive, cross the median, and enter Highway 101 northbound to make the two mile return trip to their starting point. This scenario seems highly unlikely and certainly doesn't justify the closure of the Tower Grove Drive access or the resulting impact on the long-established business at Laetitia Winery. It would seem that, even if there are some who might be inclined to take the circuitous route from El Campo to Tower Grove and back again, there are ways to ensure that this alternative is either eliminated or minimized by preventing northbound turns from Tower Grove to Highway 101. This would appear to be a measured and reasonable approach addressing both safety concerns and the property interests of Vintage Wines Estates, who has deeded access to Tower Grove Drive over Highway 101.
We also question whether or not the closure of Tower Grove Drive will be subject to review under the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). There is nothing in the staff report that indicates any type of CEQA review was or will be undertaken prior to the closure decision. Certainly, the closure of Tower Grove Drive is discretionary and therefore a "project" within the definition of CEQA and therefore requires environmental review. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21100, subd. (a), 21151, subd. (a).) "An [EIR] is an informational document which,

when its preparation is required shall be considered by every public agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a project." (§ 21061.) We see no evidence of CEQA compliance.
The failure to reference CEQA in connection with Tower Grove Drive is even more puzzling because one of the actions recommended by Staff is to amend the Regional Transportation Plan to include findings regarding the closure of Tower Grove Drive. Will these findings be included in the "new" RPT that is the subject of Agenda Item A-3? If so, will the Draft EIR be amended to address the environmental impacts of and alternatives to the closure of: Tower Grove Drive?

Given the speed at which this project is moving and the timeline for implementation of the closure, it appears that there are no plans to subject this project to CEQA review. We have considered the possibility that this might be proceeding a under a categorical exemption from CEQA as "an emergency." However, we have reviewed both-CEQA and the CEQA guidelines and determined that this project does not qualify for the emergency exemption.
In closing, we request clarification as to how the closure of Tower Grove Drive is being handled under CEQA. If no CEQA review is planned for the Tower Road closure, we must respectfully object to approving any project relating to the closure of Tower Grove Drive unless and until environmental review has been completed.

Very truly yours,

April 2, 2019
OPINION by VICTOR LUND
Highway 101 in southern San Luls Obispo County is flooded with traffic. Residents claim that San Luis Obispo Council of Governments (SLOCO has failed to meet the obligation of pooling together the resources of San Luis Obispo County, CalTrans, and local cities to make the necessary Improvements' to handle growth. This failure has resulted In dramatic Increase in traffic accidents, caused countless lifelong injuries, and contributed to the the death of Cal Poly student, Jordan Grant.
The family of Jordan Grant has appealed to SLOCOG to Sponsored Links
close the  dangerous intersection at' El Campo Road and Victor Lund Highway 101 to improve safety. Jordan was struck while traveling southbound on Highway 101 at the El Campo crossing. The driver causing the accident did not see Jordan.
In response to the accident, SLOCOG commissioned a study to review many alternatives to improving safety at the intersection. SLOCOG published the results of that study and proposed closing three highway 101 crossings - El Campo, Laetitia Winery, and another unnamed crossing. South County residents are rejecting the proposal to SLOCOG citing non- compliance with the requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
California has laws in place that require environmental studies when there are changes in the community that impact the system of roads. SLOCOG is In violation of this law if they proceed with this partial. closing, The ad hoc study of impacts was limited to signaled intersections and only during 15-minute intervals during a small window of the day. Moreover, the study does not analyze the Impact to evacuation routes In the event of a fire* or Diablo Canyon emergencies. Search Cal Coast News.Com
Residents want the two-lane overpass that has been planned for 20 years Custom Search Search |
The dangers of these crossings are not at Issue here: There is agreement that something Sponsored Links needs to be done. The concern is that SLOCOG has had designs for an overpass near the current El Campo road crossing since It was added to the long-range plan in 1999 and adopted in 2000.

Residents see this latest effort to partially close •the intersections as a Band-Aid to a systemic problem that will not cure the dangers around the system of roads that support the community. The state, county, and local communitles have been collecting revenue to fund the long range plan for years, but they have failed to follow the plan.
Closing the crössings on Highway 101 will create greater congestion on roads that the report Indicates are already over capacity. These roads•include the primary streets around the Arroyo Grande High School, Arroyo Grande Hospital, and the Highway 101 entrances at Grand Avenue and Brisco Road.
•Based upon data from the study, the proposed partial closure will also have a significant environmental impact from exhaust by producing nearly 9 million additional miles of travel a year. Based upon the IRS mileage allowance of $0.545 per mile, residents will incur $4 million in additional travel expenses equating to $8,640 per household. Recent And Most Commented

• Recent topics SLOCOG is in the process of allocating over $22 million to make improvements to Brisco Most viewed
road, which is necessary to resolve congestion: But residents believe that the prioritization. Most commented
is wrong. Nobody has lost their life or had severe injury at Brisco Road.
Residents want to SLOCOG to move forward immediately to resolve the crossing at El Campo road that is costing people's lives. Fifteen thousand area residents have signed a petition on Change.org. Hopefully SLOCOG will do what is right, not what is expedient.

just want a correction noted. SLOCOG, is not allocating 22million to Brisco Rd, their portion is now 6.6million. The city of AG, has to comè up with the rest.

Maybe this might help people understand 2 really basic things.
1.SLOCOG is an organization In itself that rewards Itself very lucratively financially and achieves very little for the responsibilities that it is supposed to have.

2.Maybe now more people, the money makers, will see that you just can't open the doors to the party and Invite everyone. Once you hit capacity bad things start to happen le: like the fwys. in LA that have turned into moving parking lots.

Could go on and on but we'll see?

Something seems wrong in the author's conclusion: "Based upon the IRS mileage allowance of $0.545 per mile, residents will Incur $4 million in additional travel expenses equating to $8,640 per household."

So, if I did live in AG, and I was a typical family, he's saying that I will spend what comes out to an extra $23 day in automotive/gasoline costs. That seems unreajistically high. Every family would have to traverse the affected streets more than once a day.

What am I missing?

I agree the math may have errors but the concept of pricing this hidden cost is valid. estimate the partial closure will cause midpoint 2,000 miles per day in reroutes with the bigger number being rerouted from people who have self regulated already by choosing to not use this dangerous crossing (maybe anöther 4,000 to 8,000 reroute miles per day). So if you price that out you have

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

CALTRANS TO BEGIN WORK ON US HIGHWAY 101 AT EL CAMPO ROAD AND OTHER LOCATIONS IN SOUTHERN SAN .LUIS OBIPSO COUNTY
SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY - Caltrans will begin an operational improvement project to reduce conflict points at four at-grade median intersections along US 101 between Los Berros Road in Nipomo and Traffic Way near Arroyo Grande beginning on Monday night, May 13.
This project will eliminate left-turn movements from US 101 onto and from El Campo Road, Tower Grove Drive and at two additional median crossover locations. Roadwork is planned only in the highway median so access to all local businesses and residences will be maintained.
Motorists will encounter lane closures along northbound US 101 weeknights during the overnight hours from 7 pm to 6 am and southbound from 8 pm to 8 5:30 am. Median access will be maintained for emergency responders at Hemi Road and Telephone Road (between El Campo and Los Berros Road).

"We are pleased with how quickly Caltrans is working to restrict left turn access at these four at-grade intersections on U.S. Highway 101. SLOCOG looks forward to the continued collaboration among state, regional, county, and city agencies that got us to this point, as it will be essential to developing a long-term solution for this section of the 101-corridor," said SLOCOG Executive Director Peter Rodgers.
