VERIFIED PETITION

INTRODUCTION
2 1. By this action, Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice
("Eastyard" or "Petitioner") challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Commerce and its
agents (collectively "City" or "Respondent") in approving the 1,007,202 square-foot ("SF") of

5 mixed-use development expansion of the Citadel Mall (*Project") located on the 44-acre site

6 generally east of the Interstate 5 Freeway and south of Atlantic Boulevard comprised of three

7 distinct geographic areas referred to as Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3 (collectively "Site") at and

8 adjacent to the existing Citadel Mall located in the City of Commerce, California. Specifically,

9 the City Council approved a 30-year ground lease ("Ground Lease") on June 18, 2019; adopted
10 the Project's Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") (State Clearinghouse No. 2016091024)
11 under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") on July 2, 2019; and made final
12 approval of Development Agreements ("DA") Nos. 18-032 and 18-032, various zone changes,

13 and Master Sign Plan Approval (dated March 25, 2019) on July 16, 2019 (collectively

14 "Entitlements"). As alleged herein this Petition, the City granted the Ground Lease, Final EIR,
15 and Entitlements (collectively "Project Approvals") absent substantial evidence in the record-as

16 required under CEQA, the Commerce Municipal Code ("CMC" or "Code"), and other State laws

17 governing the Project Approvals.

18 JURISDICTION

19 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 (i.e., CEQA
20 actions), Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 or 1094.5 (i.e., mandamus actions), and/or Code Civ. Proc. §§

21 526a, 860 et seq. The parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County with the

22 City responsible for the Project's compliance with applicable local/state zoning laws and serving,

23 via its agents, as the lead agency under CEQA. The within action has been timely brought within
24 90 days of the City's granting of the Project Approvals pursuant to Gov. Code § 65009.

25 Additionally, pursuant to Health & Saf. Code 33500(d), this action has been filed within two

26 years after the City's failure to find and/or determine the fair market value of the best and highest

27 use of properties subject to the Project Approvals, as required under State Community

28 -2.

VERIFIED PETITION

-

2 Redevelopment Laws (Health & Saf. Code §§ 33000-33985). Furthermore, the within action is

3 timely brought within 30 days after the City's filing of the Final EIR's Notice of Determination

per

4 Pub. Res. Code § 21167(c) and 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15112(c)(1).

5 Petitioner served a Notice of Intent to File this Petition on the City Clerk pursuant to Pub. Res.
Code § 21167.5 by mail on August

6 1, 2019 as reflected in Exhibit A attached hereto. Concurrent

7 with the filing of this action, Petitioner will timely notify the Attorney General of the State of

8 California of the filing of the action in accordance with the requirements of Pub. Res.

21167.7. Code §

o 10 3. PARTIES

11 Petitioner East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice ("Eastyard" or

12 "Petitioner") is a non-profit corporation with its headquarters at 2317 Atlantic Boulevard,

13 Commerce California 90040 roughly 0.6 miles from the Project Site whose members include

14 affected individuals and taxpayers who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this
Petition. Eastyard

15 was established in 2001 by residents of the Commerce/East Los Angeles area

16 who were concerned with the increasing environmental health impacts of industrial pollution in

17 their community, as well as several pending expansion projects adjacent to homes, schools and

18 parks. Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development in the I-710

19 corridor and informed decisionmaking by public officials in Commerce concerning consistency

20 with development regulations in the City and for the Site. Through its members and counsel,

21 Eastyard commented on the Draft and Final EIR, and testified (orally and in writing) before the

22 City at multiple public hearings held in 2019 before the City Planning Commission and City

23 Council regarding the Project Approvals. Furthermore, because its members include City-

24 residents/taxpayers, Eastyard has standing to bring actions challenging governmental waste,

25 validation actions, and determinations regarding redevelopment properties. See e.g., Taxpayers

26 for Accountable School Bond Spending v. San Diego Unified School Dist. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th

27 1013, 1032 (listing numerous cases finding association standing in Code. Civ. Proc. § 526a

28 actions); Gilbane Building Co. v. Superior Court (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 1527, 1531 (citing

-3-

VERIFIED PETITION

Taxpayers, court held association had associational standing to bring a taxpayer action because it

2 had at least one member who was a taxpayer and resident within the district); Regus V. City of
Baldwin Park (1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 968, 972 (held unincorporated association composed of city
residents had standing to bring a validation action challenging redevelopment project approved by

5 the city).

6 4. Respondent City of Commerce with its elected City Council and Public Works &

7 Development Service Department (collectively "City" or "Respondent") is a California municipal

8 corporation chartered under the Constitution and laws of the State of California and located in the
County of Los Angeles, California that permits the Project and serves, via its agents, as lead
10 agency for the Project's compliance with CEQA.

11 5. Real Party in Interest Citadel Holdings Group, LLC and Craig Realty Group
12 Citadel, LLC (collectively "Citadel Group") are believed to be Delaware limited liability

13 companies. Real Party in Interest Wash-Tel Commerce, LLC ("Wash-Tel") is believed to be a

14 California limited liability company. Real Party in Interest Silverado Management and Holding

15 Company ("Silverado Mgmt.") is believed to be a Nevada business entity. Citadel Holding,

16 Wash-Tel, and Silverado Mgmt. (collectively "Real Parties") are believed to be operating in Los
17 Angeles County and recipients of the Project Approvals granted in furtherance of the Project.

18 6. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate or otherwise of Respondents and

19 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioner who,

20 therefore, sues said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

21 Petition to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

22 7. Petitioner, individually and through its members and counsel, commented on the

23 Draft/Final EIRs and objected to the Project Approvals orally, in writing, and/or by filling
24 speaker cards during the public comment period before the close of the Project's public hearing.

25 Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies, the City's determinations are final, and no

26 further administrative appeals are available under State or local law. All issues submitted for

27 judicial review in this Petition were sufficiently raised and disputed with the City before the

28 -4.

VERIFIED PETITION

1 Project was approved. The City was given notice and the opportunity to act in compliance with

2 CEQA, the CMC, and other applicable laws but failed to do so.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 00 v Un 8. This action, in part, is an in rem proceeding under Code. Civ. Proc. §§ 860 and 863
("Reverse Validation") to invalidate certain agreements relating to the Project Approvals,
vO including the Ground Lease and DAs approved and/or authorized by the City on or around June

7 18 and July 16, 2019, respectively. Under the Validation statutes, all persons interested in those

8 contracts are also parties to this case.

0 9. PROJECT & SITE: The proposed Project would enable the development of up to

10 1,007,202 SF of new development and establish new regulations for future development within

11 the 44-acre Project Site including: 270,000-SF of entertainment/recreation uses; 16,540-SF of

12 restaurant uses; 700 hotel rooms and related uses; 55,000-SF of industrial uses; 70,000-SF of

19 previously approved Purchase and Sale Agreement (*PSA") between the City and Real
20 Party Citadel Group, and another DA for the approximate 10-acre Area 3 (i.e., DA 18-
21 033) for a purported value of $8.32 million pursuant to a previously approved PSA

22 between the City and Real Party Wash-Tel.

23 b) Various zone changes ("ZC"*) including two ZCs from M-2 (Heavy Industrial) to C-2

2 c) A 30-year ground lease ("Ground Lease") between the City and Real Party Silverado

3 Mgmt. whereby Silverado Mgmt. would construct and lease back the property to the City

4 after constructing a sheriff station and City Hall facility located on Area 3 that would

5 house the City's law enforcement personnel and serve additional City Hall functions.

6 The Ground Lease allows the City to use the proceeds of the above-mentioned Wash-Tel

7 PSA to pay Silverado Mgmt. for the construction of the sheriff station/City Hall facility,

8 and Silverado Mgmt. would pay the city one dollar annual for the next 30 years.

70 d) A Master Sign Plan intended to establish criteria and guidelines governing tenant signage
within the Project Site.

11 e) Adoption of the Project's Final EIR (i.e., State Clearinghouse No. 2016091024), inclusive

12 of its Response to Comments ("RTC"), Mitigation Monitoring Report Program

13 (*MMRP"), and Statement of Overriding Considerations ("SOC").

11.

14. AREA 2 & 3 REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY HISTORY: The City's former

15 redevelopment agency, the Commerce Community Development Commission, originally

16 purchased properties within Area 2 and 3 for redevelopment purposes. Pursuant to AB x1 26 and

17 AB 1484, the Legislature dissolved all redevelopment agencies with assets transferring to

18 successor agencies. Pursuant to Health & Saf. Code § 34173(g), successor agencies are required

19 to dispose of properties previously owned by the redevelopment agencies and to unwind the

20 affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies. Pursuant to Health & Saf. Code § 34191.5,

21 within six months after receiving a Finding of Completion from the Department of Finance

22 ("DOF"), each successor agency was required to submit for approval to its oversight board and

23 the DOF, a Long Range Property Management Plan ("LRPMP") that addresses the disposition

24 and use of the real properties of the respective former redevelopment agencies. AB 1484

25 mandates that a LRPMP identify real property held by the agency and the intended use or

26 disposal of said properties, such as: (1) to fulfill an enforceable obligation; (2) retention for future

27 development, including possible sale of the property; or (3) retention of property for
governmental use.

VERIFIED PETITION

- 12.

2 Here, the City elected to take on the duties as successor agency to its former

3 redevelopment agency. In May 2013, the City received a Finding of Completion from the DOF
and approved the City's LRPMP in May 2014 to wind down the affairs of the City's former

5 redevelopment agency. To this end, the City, as a successor agency, entered into a variety of a

6 agreements since DOF approved the City's LRPMP, the relevant history briefly described below:

7 a) AREA 2: According to the LRPMP, 478-971 SF of Area 2 was acquired by the City

8 between 1981-2009 for $2.04 million and valued in 2013 for an estimated $22.5 million.

In 2015, the City, acting as a successor agency, approved a Purchase and Sale Agreement

10 ("PSA") to sell 25.29-acre to Real Party Citadel Group and others for a purported value of

11 $24.0 million contingent upon the City approving a DA that would allow retail

12 development on at least 75 percent of the property and industrial uses on the remaining 25

13 percent of the property. In May 2018, the City, acting as a successor agency, approved an

14 amendment to the contingent PSA that removed all references to potential industrial uses

15 and required the subsequent DA to ensure the property would be valued at no less than

16 $45.0 million by the sixteenth month of operation of the retail businesses. In September

17 2018, the DOF oversight board did not approve the amended contingent PSA because it

18 was unsure whether the land was sufficiently appraised and asked the City to return with

19 (a) the original PSA, (b) the original appraisal of the land in 2013, and (c) a current
appraisal of the land.

20

21 b) AREA 3: According to the LRPMP, the 462,607 SF of Area 3 was acquired by the City in

22 1996 for $3.79 million and valued in 2013 for an estimated $10.5 million. In May 2017,

23 the City, acting as a successor agency, approved a contingent PSA with Real Parties

24 Citadel Group and Wash-Tel contingent on approval of a subsequent DA that would allow

25 restaurant uses. To this end, in May 2018, the City entered into a PSA to transfer the

26 property from the City (as a successor agency) to the City (as a non-successor agency) for

27 one dollar with the intention of subsequently selling 8.82 acres of the property to Real

28 Party Wash-Tel for a value purported at $8.32 million, and using the proceeds to construct

-7-

VERIFIED PETITION

2

uA w a City public safety facility to serve as a Los Angeles County Sheriff station on the
remaining 1.8 acres of the property. In July 2018, DOF approved an amendment to the
LRPMP to allow the construction of the public facility on the site subject to constructing
the public facility within two years. In August 2018, the City, acting as a successor

3 agency, approved an amendment to the 2017 contingent PSA in furtherance of selling the

co property with the intent to use the proceeds to construct a public facility on the property.

9 In September 2018, the DOF oversight board did not approve the amended contingent

10 PSA because it was unsure whether the land was sufficiently appraised and asked the City

11 to return with (a) the original PSA, (b) the original appraisal of the land in 2013, and (c)
a current appraisal of the land.

13.

12

13 To the best of Petitioner's knowledge, the City has yet to provide the public a copy

14 of the original PSA, the original appraisal of properties within Areas 2 and Area 3, or a current

15 appraisal of said properties certainly none was provided in the documents associated with the
Project Approvals.

14.

16

17 CIRCULATION OF DRAFT EIR: In February 2019, the City released for public

18 comment an unfinished, incomplete administrative draft of the Draft EIR that included errors

19 previously identified by City staff but left uncured. In March 2019, in response to numerous

20 objecting commenters, the City recirculated a revised Draft EIR with public comments due by

21 May 10, 2019. Prior to the close of the comment period, numerous commenting parties provided

22 critical comments on the adequacy of the analysis contained therein, including more than 100

23 pages of comments from South Coast Air Quality Management District ("SCAOMD") and
several experts in the fields of air quality, greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, noise, and traffic.

15.

24

25 PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVAL OF THE ENTITLEMENTS & EIR: Prior to the

26 close of the Draft EIR comment period, the City initially scheduled approval of the Entitlements

27 and "Final" EIR by the City Planning Commission and City Council on May 22 and 28

28 (respectively)-an apparent fast-tracking of the City's approval processes and ignoring the
gravity of comments received and the extent of corrections that were in fact necessary to cure the

-8-

VERIFIED PETITION

-

2 Project's EIR deficiencies. Subsequently, the City re-scheduled and held Planning Commission

3 hearing on the Entitlements and Project EIR on May 29, 2019, including the recommendation to

4 approve the Entitlements and certify the "Final" EIR - yet did so before any such Final EIR,

5 RTC, MMRP, or SOC was actually prepared. Minutes before the start of the May 29, 2019

6 Planning Commission hearing, the City included a hardcopy draft RTC, which would not be

7 provided to Petitioners until days after the hearing. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of the May

8 29, 2019 hearing, the City Planning Commission recommended approval by the City Council of
the Entitlements and "Draft" EIR.

o 16.

10 CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF THE GROUND LEASE: On June 16, 2019, the City

11 Council considered the Ground Lease between the City and Real Party Silverado Mgmt. to serve

12 as a framework for the City to lease the property to Silverado Mgmt. in return for it to construct a it

13 public safety facility (e.g., sheriff station, City Hall building) covering approximately 1.8 to 4.5

14 acres. Despite objections made by Petitioners and other commenters that the Ground Lease was

15 an integral part of the Citadel Mall Expansion Project, that CEQA-compliant Final EIR was not

16 yet completed, and CEQA's bar against project piecemealing and pre-commitment to Project

17 before completing adequate CEQA analysis, the City approved the Ground Lease taking the

18 position that it was not subject to CEQA.

17.

19 FINAL EIR: On or around June 20, 2019, the City released its Final EIR,

20 including minimal changes and new air modeling data buried in the appendices that failed to cure

21 the fatal flaws identified in previous Draft EIR comments. The Final EIR also included a final

22 RTC, MMRP, and SOC equally fatally flawed. For example, the 42-page SOC contained only

23 one page that listed purported overriding considerations-utterly void of any analysis or tethered

24 to facts or substantial evidence. Similarly, more than three-quarters of the 202-page final RTC

25 was mere recitation of original comments submitted by commenting parties, single-sentence

26 acknowledgment of the comments (e.g., comment noted for the record), or blanket copy-and-

27 paste sections of the Draft EIR void of any discussion. Additionally, the remaining one-quarter of

28 the RTC contained generic, vague claims absent any facts, evidence, analysis, or discussion how

-9-

VERIFIED PETITION

the Final EIR addressed the significant environmental issues raised by commenting parties.
'2 Moreover, the final RTC failed to acknowledge, much less respond with substantial evidence, to

3 any of the expert air quality, GHG, noise, or traffic expert letter; which according to one expert
(emph. original):
5

6 "In our 20+ years of performing CEQA analysis and submitting comments on the public record in scores of land use cases across the State, we have never failed to
7 receive acknowledgment and substantive response from the Lead Agency responsible for the particular CEQA proiect under environmental review."
8

9 18. CITY COUNCIL APPROVAL OF THE ENTITLEMENTS & EIRS: On July 2, 2019,
10 over the near-unanimous opposition from the public and numerous commenters including
11 Petitioner, the City approved certification of the Final EIR and made the first reading of the
12 approval of the Entitlements. The City filed its first premature Notice of Determination ("NOD")
13 on July 3, 2019. On July 16, 2019, the City made the second reading of the approval of the
14 Entitlements with no substantive changes to CEQA or anything else, making said Project
15 Approvals final. The City filed a second NOD on July 17, 2019.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
17 CEQA VIOLATIONS (WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS-CODE CIV. PRO. § 1094.5)

18 19. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-18, as if fully set forth herein.
19 20. CEQA requires lead agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
20 actions in an environmental impact report ("EIR"). See e.g., Pub. Res. Code § 21100; Cmtys. for
21 a Better Env't v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310. The EIR is the very
22 heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The "foremost
23 principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford
24 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory
25 language." Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Res. Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109; see

VERIFIED PETITION

1 (citing CEQA Guidelines § 15002, "[t]he fundamental goals of environmental review under

2 CEQA are information, participation, mitigation, and accountability.").

3 21. CEQA'S PURPOSE: CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to

4 inform decision makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a

5 project. See CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1). To this end, public agencies must ensure that its

6 analysis "stay in step with evolving scientific knowledge and state regulatory schemes."

7 Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497,

8 504 ("Cleveland II'). Hence, an analysis which "understates the severity of a project's impacts

9 impedes meaningful public discussion and skews the decisionmaker's perspective concerning the

10 environmental consequences of the project, the necessity for mitigation measures, and the

11 appropriateness of project approval." Id., on remand 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 444 ("Cleveland IIT');

12 see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 (quoting

13 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,

14 392 [Laurel Heights]).

15 22. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

16 by requiring the implementation of environmentally superior alternatives and all feasible

17 mitigation measures. See CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) & (3); see also Citizens of Goleta

18 Valley, 52 Cal.3d at 564. If a project has significant effect on the environment, the agency may

19 approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant

20 effects on the environment where feasible" and that any significant unavoidable effects on the

21 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." CEQA Guidelines § 15092(b)(2)(A) &

22 (B); see also Pub. Res. Code 21081.

23 23. STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR EIRS: For EIRs, courts apply an abuse of discretion

24 standard whereby a lead agency abuses its discretion if it "has not proceeded in the manner

25 required by law or if the determinations or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.'"*

26 Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 392-393 (quoting Pub. Res. Code § 61168.5); see also Vineyard

27 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412,

2 435. Although courts review an EIR using an 'abuse of discretion' standard, that standard does

3 not permit a court to "uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project

4 proponent in support of its position ... [] [a] clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to

5 no judicial deference." Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs. (2001) 91

6 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 (quoting Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n. 12). A prejudicial abuse of
discretion occurs "if the failure to include relevant information precludes informed

7

8 decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the

9 EIR process." San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27

10 Cal.App.4th 713, 722; see also Galante Vineyards v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management

11 Dist. (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1117; County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency
(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 946.

12 24.

13 For a lead agency's factual determinations, courts apply the "substantial evidence"

14 test. Substantial evidence is defined as "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences

15 from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

16 conclusions might also be reached . . . ." CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a). Under CEQA,

17 substantial evidence includes facts, a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact, or expert

18 opinion supported by fact; not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative,

19 clearly inaccurate or erroneous evidence, or evidence of social or economic impacts that do not
contribute to, or are not caused by, physical impacts on the environment. See e.g., Pub. Res.

20

21 Code §g 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(5), 15384. As such, courts will not

22 blindly trust bare conclusions, bald assertions, and conclusory comments without the "disclosure

23 of the 'analytic route the .. . agency traveled from evidence to action.33 Laurel Heights, 47

24 Cal.3d at 404 405 (quoting Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles

25 (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 [Topanga]); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley, 52 Cal.3d at 568-569;

VERIFIED PETITION

1 25. CITY'S ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN CERTIFYING THE FINAL EIR: Here,

2 substantial evidence from Petitioner, public agencies, and other comment parties--including

3 more than 100 pages of critical Draft and Final EIR comments submitted by South Coast Air

4 Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") and several other experts in the field of air quality,

5 GHG emissions, noise, and traffic that basically were not responded to-raise significant

6 concerns with the fatally flawed Project EIR, including but not limited to the issues highlighted

7 below:

8 a) PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The EIR failed to provide an accurate and stable project

9 description, including but not limited to failing to identify the City's intent to locate
10 various sheriff/municipal facilities of a changing size ranging between 1.8 to 4.5 acres on

11 Area 3 (known by the City well before the circulation of the Draft EIR).

12 b) IMPROPER BASELINE: The EIR improperly relied on a baseline of development
13 assumptions under the City's General Plan as compared to the existing development at or

14 near the Site.

15 c) AIR QUALITY: As raised by multiple experts and SCAQMD, the EIR's air quality

16 analysis failed to adequately analyze the Project's air impacts, such as: failing to

17 adequately analyze overlapping construction and operational emissions, failing to

18 adequately analyze concurrent construction of multiple Areas implicit to the EIR's

19 narrative timeline, failing to impose all feasible mitigations measures tethered to analysis,
20 and failing to discuss what mitigation measures were considered but rejected and on what

21 basis.

22 d) GHG EMISSIONS: As pointed out by multiple environmental experts, the EIR's GHG

23 analysis used inaccurate date, relied on compliance with nearly ten-year-old GHG plans,

24 and ignored more recent GHG plans and regulatory framework, such as the California Air

25 Resources Board 2017 Scoping Plan or compliance with new state law requiring further
26 GHG reductions by 2030 (i.e., SB 35). Additionally, the EIR failed to consider feasible
27 mitigations measures to further lessen admittedly significant GHG impacts.
28 -13-

VERIFIED PETITION

- e) HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: Despite the Site containing numerous hazardous materials
2 (e.g., Tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, total petroleum hydrocarbons, etc.) and that
0* no further mediation has occurred at some regions of the Site for nearly ten years, the EIR
failed to characterize potential risks from exposure of these hazardous materials, nor did
4o the EIR provide any performance criteria to govern future remediation of the Site as part
of the Project's deferred mitigation.
f) HYDROLOGY & UTILITY: The EIR failed to disclose the Project's Water Supply

8 Assessment as required for development of this magnitude under Water Code §§ 10910-
9 10915. Nor did the EIR adequately assess the increase need in law enforcement personnel

10 caused by the Project, instead the City relied on the promise by Real Party that it would

11 provide an additional 30+ private security professionals during the Project's operation,

12 despite no mitigation measure in the MMRP or condition within the DAs requiring this.

13 g) POPULATION, HOUSING, LAND USE INCONSISTENCY & GROWTH INDUCING IMPACTS:

14 Despite the EIR admitting the Project would induce population growth and increase

15 demand for housing, the Final EIR failed to explain with substantial evidence how a single
16 project creating 1,750 new employees in approximately three to five years and accounting

17 for nearly 40 percent of the City's anticipated growth in a 20-year timeframe without

18 being considered a significant growth-inducing project. Furthermore, the EIR failed to

19 properly take into consideration the City's lack of existing housing and consistent record
20 of not meeting its housing obligations, which when combined by the Project's induced

21 population, will conflict and be inconsistent with policies and goals under the City's

22 General Plan.

23 h) NOISE: As pointed out by a noise expert, the EIR's noise analysis was untethered to

24 substantial evidence - the EIR provided only noise worksheets with raw data absent any

25 technical study or discussion. Nor did the EIR establish the existing noise baseline via

26 field measurements taken at or near the Project Site, identify noise sensitive-receptors on

27

28 - 14-

VERIFIED PETITION

-

2 the Project Site, account for noise sources from the Interstate 5 freeway, or consider

3 applicable Caltrans thresholds when assessing the Project's noise impacts.

4 i) TRAFFIC: So too are the EIR's traffic mitigation measures unsupported by substantial

5 evidence. As pointed out by a traffic expert, the EIR relied on a Traffic Demand

6 Management ("TDM") program comprised mostly of measures intended to reduce

7 commuter trips (e.g., resident/worker trips) and known to be ineffective for reducing

8 sporadic trips (e.g., patrons traveling to regional retail shopping centers as is the case

0
5Ez, here). Additionally, the EIR's traffic analysis failed to consider the diminishing returns of
the proposed TDM given the Site is already subject to an existing TDM program of
unknown effectiveness. Furthermore, the MMRP relied on "potential" physical
improvement measures without any performance criteria to determine if the physical

13
14 improvements would be considered feasible, or provide alternative mitigation measures
could have been considered.

15 j) RELIANCE ON ILLUSORY MITIGATION MEASURES: As raised by multiple experts, the

16 EIR relied upon vague, unenforceable mitigation measures untethered to good-faith

17 analysis or specific performance criteria-particularly but not limited to as it relates to

18 impacts on air quality, GHG, noise, and traffic. Furthermore, the EIR conflated

19 compliance with regulatory laws as mitigation measures. As a result, the Project's EIR

20

21 evades any meaningful mitigation measures to reduce significant impacts either conceded
in the EIR or masked by the fatally flawed EIR analysis.

22 k) ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS: The City's EIR failed to provide an adequate alternative

23

24 analysis. Its analysis contained vague descriptions, absent facts or any technical analysis,

25 and comprised solely of conclusory and often contradictory claims regarding comparative

26 benefits of the alternative versus the Project. Additionally, the analysis failed to consider

27 any alternative that would admittedly reduce significant impacts. Despite claims in the

28 RTC that the alternative analysis would be revised and flushed out in the Final EIR, no
changes were made (as discussed infra).

-15-

VERIFIED PETITION

I) FAILURE TO RECIRCULATE: As pointed out by multiple commenters and experts, the

2 Draft EIR was fundamentally inadequate to provide a meaningful review by the public
007 12 0 and required to be recirculated. Instead, the City released the Final EIR with minimal
changes, an unresponsive RTC, uncured of fatal errors, and with a new, flawed air
quality/GHG modeling buried in the Final EIR's appendix.
m) RESPONSE TO COMMENTS ("RTC"): The Final EIR, including RTC, failed to provide

7 good-faith response comments to the Draft EIR, as evidenced by the City Planning's

co approval of the Project Approvals a mere 19 days after the close of the Draft comment
9 period and before being presented with the Final EIR or final RTC. Furthermore, when
10 the RTC was finally produced, it failed to mention, much less respond with substantial
11 evidence, to the more than 100-pages of expert comments related to air quality, GHG,
12 noise, and traffic impacts. According to at least one expert (emph. original): "In our 20+

13 years of performing CEQA analysis and submitting comments on the public record in
14 scores of land use cases across the State, we have never failed to receive acknowledgment
15 and substantive response from the Lead Agency responsible for the particular CEQA

16 proiect under environmental review."

17 n) STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDERATIONS ("SOC"): Numerous commenters

18 reminded the City of its obligation to adopt a SOC supported by substantial evidence.

19 However, the Final EIR provided only a single page listing purported overriding

20 considerations that were entirely untethered to facts and analysis.

21 o) PROJECT PIECEMEALING & PRE-COMMITMENT: Here, the City improperly piecemealed

22 the Project Approvals. For example, the City approved Project's Ground Leasean

23 integral component to the Project--before the release of the Project's Final EIR, RTC, or

24 SOC--again indicating the City's pre-commitment to approve the Project regardless of

25 the evidence produced before them.

1 26. In summary, the City abused its discretion when it approved the fatally flawed

2 Project EIR where it (a) failed to include necessary relevant information that precluded informed

3 decisionmaking and informed public participation; and (b) relied on bare conclusions, bald

4 assertions, and conclusory comments untethered to evidence in the record reasoned analysis. See
San Joaquin Raptor, 27 Cal.App.4th at 722; see also Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 404-405

6 (quoting Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 515).

7 27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

8 sought in this Petition. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals and
allow the development of the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from
10 which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence,

11 and significant adverse impacts on the environment would occur, contrary to State and local law.
12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
13 VIOLATIONS OF APPLICABLE LAND USE LAWS (WRIT OF MANDATE AND ADMINISTRATIVE
MANDAMUS CODE CIV. PROC. S§ 1085, 1094.5)
14 28. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-27 as if fully set forth herein.

15 29. The California Supreme Court has described General Plans and zoning schemes in

16 many ways. See e.g., DeVita V. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 (as a 'constitution,'

17 "for future development located at the top of 'the hierarchy of local government law regulating

18 land use); Topanga, 11 Cal.3d at 517-518 (as a 'contracts,' where "each party foregoes rights to

19 use its land as it wishes in return for the assurance that the use of neighboring property will be

20 similarly restricted, the rationale being that such mutual restriction can enhance total community

21 welfare"); Orange Citizens for Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 159

22 (as a 'yardstick,' where "one should be able to 'take an individual parcel and check it against the

23 plan and then know which uses would be permissible"). While planning agencies enjoy some

24 discretion interpreting their zoning laws, "deference has limits," and courts are not bound by

25 unreasonable interpretations contrary to the plain language of regulations and statutes. Id. at 146,

26 156-157 (rejecting attempts to "downplay the facial inconsistency," Court held city abused its

27 discretion finding residential project consistent with general plan designation where "no

28 -17-

-

'2 reasonable person could conclude that the Property could be developed without a general plan

3 amendment"); see also Stolman v. City of Los Angeles (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 925 (vacating

4 variance based on zoning administrator's interpretation contradicted by the plain language of the
municipal code).

5 30.

6 Here, Petitioner is informed and believes that granting the Project Approvals

7 constituted : prejudicial abuse of discretion by the City by failing to proceed in the manner

8 required by law or making the necessary land use findings supported by substantial evidence
as required under the City Code. This includes but not limited to the City's failure to make the

10 necessary land use findings, supported by substantial evidence, to grant the Entitlements (e.g.,

11 DAs, ZCs, Ground Lease), including but not limited to the following Code-required findings:

12 a) "That the proposed change of zone or zoning ordinance text amendment is consistent with

13 the goals, policies, and objectives of the general plan." CMC § 19.39.310.A, emph.
added; see also Gov. Code § 65867.5.

14

15. b) "That the proposed change of zone or zoning ordinance text amendment will not adversely

16 affect surrounding properties." CMC § 19.39.310.B, emph. added.

17 C) "That the proposed change of zone or zoning ordinance text amendment promotes public

18 health, safety, and general welfare and serves the goals and purposes of this Title 19 [of
the Code]." CMC § 19.39.310.C, emph. added.

19 31.

20 Furthermore, absent adequate analysis under a CEQA-compliant EIR, the City

21 could not make the public safety land use findings supported by substantial evidence.

32.

22 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

23 sought in this Petition. If the City does not revoke the Project Approvals and allow the

24 development of the Project, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm from which

25 there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations commence, and

26 significant adverse impacts occur contrary to State and local law.

33.

27 In sum, the City abused its discretion by granting the Project Approvals in clear

28 violation of the plain language of applicable zoning laws, absent substantial evidence, and

-18-

without the underlying facts and analysis to fill the analytical gap justifying the granting of the

2 Entitlements.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
UNCONSTITUTIONAL GIFTS AND WASTE OF PUBLIC FUNDS (TAXPAYER ACTION, WRIT & DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF- CAL. CONST., ART. XVI § 6; CODE CIV. PROC. § 526A)
34. Petitioner restates and realleges Paragraphs 1-33 as if fully set forth herein.

6 35. Petitioner seeks to invalidate each of the Project Approvals - particularly the DAs,

7 Master Ground Lease, and like documents for the reasons set forth in this Petition/Complaint,

8 including but not limited to:

o a) Approving the Project Approvals without disclosing the original PSA and original/current

10 appraisals for Area 2 and Area 3 (as required by the Department of Finance) and,

11 therefore, failing to make the required determination supported by substantial evidence

12 that the "the sale price or total rental amount is less than the fair market value of the

13 interest to be conveyed or leased, determined at the highest and best use consistent with

14 the redevelopment plan, then the agency shall provide as part of the summary an

15 explanation of the reasons for the difference." Health & Saf. Code § 33433(a)(2)(B)(iii),

16 emph. added.

17 b) Conveying the Properties to Real Parties without determining the fair market value of the

18 best and highest use of said properties resulted in an unconstitutional gift and waste of
19 public property in violation of the California Constitution and State Law. See Cal. Const.,

20 art. XVI, § 6; Code. Civ. Proc. § 526a. §

21 36. An actual controversy and dispute now exist between Petitioner and the City as to

22 the value and legality of the DAs, Ground Lease, and like documents allowed by the Project

23 Approvals. It is necessary and appropriate for this Court to declare that the DAs and Ground

24 Lease are invalid, illegal, and unenforceable until the City satisfies the procedural and substantive

25 requirements applicable under the State Constitution and law, including but not limited barring

26 the City from waste and unconstitutional gifting of property and development rights at less than

Dear Ms. Shumway and Mr. Tapia:

This is to inform you that Petitioner East Yard Communities For Environmental Justice ("Eastyard" or "Petitioner") will be filing suit against the City of Commerce and its agents (collectively "City" or "Respondents") challenging its approval of the Citadel Mall Expansion development ("Project"), which includes the approval of a 30-year ground lease, Development Agreement Nos. 18-032 and 18-033, multiple zone changes and other zoning approvals, and the adoption of the Project's Environmental Impact Report (SCH # 2016091024) ("EIR") (collectively "Project Approvals").

As agents of the Respondents, please take notice, under Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5, that
Petitioner intends to file a petition and include a cause of action alleging that the City's granting of the Project Approvals during June and July 2019 violated the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), challenging the City's determination, its failure to make a good-faith effort at disclosing impacts as required by CEQA, among other violations, and its approval of the Final EIR, Mitigation Monitoring Report and Program, and Statement of Overriding Considerations.
You will be served with the Petition shortly.

Figure 3: Project Setting & Existing Uses (excerpt Final EIR, p. 45)

The Planning Area consists of urban development that includes a range of land uses consisting of commercial, industrial, warehousing, surface parking areas, and vacant land. The majority of the existing vacant land is included in Area 2 and Area 3. However, all of the existing vacant land includes parcels that
were formerly developed. The affected area encompasses a total land area of approximately 44 acres that include approximately 8 acres im Area 1; 26 acres in Area 2; and 10 acres in Area 3. The environmental
setting of the three project areas are summarized below:

Area includes an area located within the existing Citadel shopping center complex consisting of
approximately 8 acres. Area 1 is predominately located within the northeast portion of the Citadel,
which is presently occupied by surface parking and two warehouses,s

Area 2 consists of approximately 26 acres and is located is east of the existing Citadel complex and
continuing easterly for an approximate distance of 2,100 feet. Area_2_is_occupied_by three
buildings, two of which are vacant.

Area 3 consists of approximately 10 acres of land located on the northwest corner of Washington
Boulevard and Telegraph Road. Washington Boulevard extends along the east side of Area 3 while
Telegraph Road extends along the south side. The majority of the site is vacant though a single
buflding used as a furniture outlet retailer occupies the western portion of Area 3,8

The existing land uses and development within the three areas are summarized below in Table 2-1.
