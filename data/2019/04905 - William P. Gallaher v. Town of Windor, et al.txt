21 follows: Petitioner and Plaintiff William P. Gallaher, an individual (*Petitioner"), alleges as

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 1. Petitioner is an individual, over the age of eighteen who regularly conducts business
24 in the Town of Windsor,

25 2. Respondent and Defendant Town of Windsor ("Town") is and at all relevant times
26 was a political and legal subdivision of the State of California, duly organized and existing under
27 and pursuant to the laws of the State of California.
28

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -]-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INTINCTIVR RRI IPR

I 3. Respondent and Defendant Town Council of the Town of Windsor ("Council") is,

2 and at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the Town existing

3 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The Council is, and at relevant times
4 was, the local body charged with proposing, drafting, amending and passing legislation governing
land use and the Town's municipal affairs, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all

6 applicable federal, state, and local law.

4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued
8 herein as DOES through 25, inclusive, and will amend this complaint to set forth their true names

9 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based
10 thereon alleges, that some fictitiously named Respondents were the agents and employees of the
11 other fictitiously named, or actually named, Respondents and, acting within the course of scope of
12 such employment or agency, took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are the
13 principals and took some part in such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-named
14 Respondents are liable to Petitioner for the relief prayed for herein.
15 5. Respondents and Defendants identified in paragraphs 2 through 4 above, inclusive,
16 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "Respondents."
17 6. This action challenges the approval by the Town of a so-called "reach code" via
18 "An Ordinance of the Town of Windsor Amending Windsor Municipal Code Title VII, 'Building
19 and Housing,' to Add Chapter 7, 'All-Electric Residential Reach Code'" ("Reach Code"), which
20| ordinance was passed by the Council on second reading on October 16, 2019.

21 7. A "reach code" is so called because it "reaches" beyond the ordinary standards of a
22 building or energy code to impose greater restrictions on building and development. Reach codes
23 in California are optional and can only be enacted if specific procedures are followed. Here, the
24 Reach Code forbids the inclusion of natural gas or propane plumbing in new low-rise residential

25 construction in the Town.

26 8. Despite the fact that enactment of the Reach Code constituted a discretionary
27| project affecting the use and occupancy of land and structures in the Town, and having the

28 potential for reasonably foreseeable and potentially significant adverse physical changes in the
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environment, the Town enacted the Reach Code without undertaking environmental review as

2 required by, and therefore in violation of, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA";
3 Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) and its implementing CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs.,
4 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.)..

5 9. The enactment of a reach code is governed by section 10-106 of the 2019 Building

6 Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings, title 24, part 6 of the

7 California Code of Regulations ("Reach Code Law"). Before enacting the Reach Code, the Reach

8 Code Law required that the Town adopt "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective."
(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The Town's determination was based on a
10 document entitled "2019 Cost-effectiveness Study: Low-Rise Residential New Construction"
11 dated July 17, 2019 ("Study"), whose material conclusions are contradicted by a separate study
12 entitled "Residential Building Electrification in California." The Reach Code Law also requires
13 the submittal of an application to the Executive Director of the California State Energy Resources
14 Conservation and Development Commission that includes "[a]ny findings, determinations,
15 declarations or reports, including any negative declaration or environmental impact report,
16 required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section
17 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.)
18 10. On November 6, 2019, the Town Council introduced and held a first reading of an
19 ordinance adopting the 2019 edition of the California Building Standards Code, including the

20 Reach Code. As of the date of this petition the Town Council has not yet held the second reading
21 of that ordinance. Any further action to implement or adopt the Reach Code is invalid and illegal
22 for the reasons set forth herein. Petitioner may amend this petition and complaint at such time as
23 the Town takes such further action.

24 11. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the Town's full compliance with the law
25 regarding the Town's approval of the Reach Code, including adhering to the requirements of
26 CEQA. Petitioner has personal, professional, environmental and other interests which will be
27 severely injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA and the Reach Code Law.
28 Petitioner lives close by the Town and regularly does business there, including developing projects
| GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 that would be subject to the Reach Code. Moreover, the Reach Code's impacts are necessarily
2 regional in nature, thereby impacting residents throughout Sonoma County.

12. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by
4 the Town's failure to comply with CEQA and approval of the Reach Code. Petitioner has
expressed his concerns and objections to the approval of the Reach Code at meetings and in
6 correspondence to the Town. Before approving the Reach Code, the City owed a mandatory duty to
7 comply with the legal duties which Petitioner alleges were violated. Petitioner has the right to
8 enforce the mandatory duties which the CEQA imposes on the Town.

9 13. The Town is the lead agency for purposes of CEQA compliance.
10 14. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the Town's
11 approval of the Reach Code is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.
12 15. Petitioner objected to the approval of the Reach Code orally and in writing during
13 the public comment period and prior to the close of the public hearing on the Reach Code, and
14 before the Town's filing of: Notice of Exemption for the approval on October 21, 2019, All
15 alleged grounds for non-compliance with CEQA and the Reach Code Law were presented to the
16 Town during the public-comment period prior to the close of the public hearing on the Reach Code
17 and the Town's issuance of the Notice of Exemption.
18 16. The Town filed a Notice of Exemption for the Reach Code with the Office of the
19 County Clerk for the County of Sonoma on or about October 21, 2019. Petitioner will timely file
20 this Petition for Writ of Mandate on before November 25, 2019, a date not more than thirty-five
21 (35) days after the filing of the Notice of Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section
22 21167, subdivision (d).

23 17. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Intent to File Suit to be served on the Town as

24 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent
25 to File Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

26 18. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Office of the
27

28

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Attorney General for the State of California not more than ten (10) days after the commencement of
2 this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure

3 section 388.

4 19. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general to vindicate his own legal
5 and constitutional rights and those of residents of the Town and all others who may be impacted by
6 the Reach Code. Petitioner seeks, on his own behalf and the behalf of said others, that Respondents
7 obey the clear law, conduct required environmental reviews of their discretionary actions, require
8 appropriate and feasible mitigation for their significant impacts, and not act in unlawful, bad faith,

9 arbitrary, capricious, and confiscatory fashion in noticing, analyzing, enacting and enforcing local
10 land use legislation.

11 20. For these reasons, and others set forth in this Petition and Complaint, the Town's
12 actions described herein and the Reach Code are unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioner
13 therefore requests this Court issue a writ of mandate invalidating the Reach Code and declaring it,
14 and any actions undertaken thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioner also
15 seeks declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and temporary,
16 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Reach Code in any
17 manner.

18 21. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner, on the one hand, and
19 Respondents, on the other hand, relating to the legal rights of the respective parties. The
20 controversy is well-defined and imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of,
21 judicial determinations at this time is warranted.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of CEQA -

24 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5 -

25 Against All Respondents)

26 22. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 21, above, are hereby incorporated herein by
27 reference as though set forth in full.

28

Il GLLR156389\2186906.2 -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 23. The ordinance adopting the Reach Code is a "project" that is subject to CEQA
2 review. The CEQA Guidelines, in relevant part, define "project" as "the whole of an action, which
has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
4 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following: (1) An
activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to... enactment and
amendment of zoning ordinances...." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed,
under CEQA's broad definition of a "project," municipal ordinances, laws and regulations affecting
8 the use of land or structures have consistently been held to be CEQA "projects" over the course of

9 many decades.

10 24. The Notice of Exemption for the Reach Code cites two exemptions: the class 8
11 exemption under section 15308 of the Guidelines, and the "common sense" exemption under
12 section 15061, subdivision (b)(3).

13 25. CEQA's co-called "common sense" exemption may properly be invoked only when
14 the lead agency can declare "with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question
15 may have a significant effect on the environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)
16 Thus, it is the Town's burden to provide support for application of the common sense exemption,
17 not Petitioner's burden to disprove its applicability. Any legitimate reasonable question about
18 whether a project might have a significant impact means the project cannot be exempt under the
19 "common sense" exemption. The Town was required to consider factual evidence and data relating
20 to possible environmental impacts of the Reach Code, and that consideration must be supported by
21 evidence in the administrative record.

22 26. With respect to the class 8 exemption, such can only be used for an action that
23 constitutes a preservation of the environment. The Reach Code cannot be said to rise to this
24 standard as it merely substitutes one source of energy for another, without any sufficient analysis as
25 to whether that substitution will actually yield any benefit to the environment. (Dunn-Edwards
26 Corp. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644; International
27 Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App.3d 265.)

28 The Town cannot undertake a "net benefit" environmental analysis - i.e., reasoning that the
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

project's environmental benefits in one area outweigh its significant adverse effects in another area
2 or areas of environmental impact - as such is not permitted under CEQA. (County Sanitation Dist.

3 No. 2 v. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1577, 1580.) "There may be environmental
costs to an environmentally beneficial project, which must be considered and assessed."
5 (California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143
6 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)

7 27. Neither the common sense nor the class 8 exemption applies here. The Reach Code
8 may have a number of significant impacts on the environment, none of which the Town has
9 analyzed. These include the following:
10 a) Hazards/Public Safety. The Reach Code was passed at a time when the supply of
11 electrical power to the Town and surrounding communities may be less reliable and
12 subject to more and longer planned outages than ever before. In October of 2019 the
13 Town and surrounding area were subject to prolonged electricity blackouts and
14 wildfires which may have been caused by electrical infrastructure. But the Town
15 failed to analyze how all-electric residential construction would exacerbate these

16 impacts. Without adequate battery storage of electricity, or an alternative power
17 source, such as natural gas which powers backup generators cook-stoves and grills,
18 and other appliances, "all-electric" homes and businesses will be subject to hazards

19 and risks to public safety during outages when heat, life-saving medical equipment,
20 lighting, water, refrigeration, food, and air conditioning may be unavailable. Given
21 the risk of blackouts, some residents will rely on propane or gasoline generators or
22 other combustible sources of power, which are more prone to accident or spillage

23 than fixed natural gas lines. There has been no study or analysis of the risks or

24 impacts associated with such increased usage, including air quality, GHG, and fire

25 impacts.

26 b) The 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history, was apparently caused by
27 electrical transmission lines. There is no analysis whatsoever in the administrative

28 record as to any potential increase in fire risk from expanded electrical service
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 facilities which the Reach Code would necessitate. Instead, the Town claims,

3 without supporting evidence, that "natural gas infrastructure is a potentially

4 significant source of fire." The Town cannot assert (without supporting evidence)
that natural

5 gas presents a wildfire risk while ignoring the fact that electric
transmission lines gave

6 rise to the most lethal California wildfire ever less than a

year ago.

7

8 c) Utilities/Service Systems/Wildfire. The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G checklist -

o a template for the initial study the Town is required to conduct under CEQA -

10 requires evaluation of the question of whether the project would "[r]equire or result

11 in the relocation or construction of new or expanded ... electric power, natural gas,

12 or telecommunications facilities, the construction of which could cause significant

13 environmental effects?" Projects requiring significant new construction to rely

14 solely on electricity as a power source clearly have the potential to result in the

15 installation, upgrading, and/or maintenance of associated infrastructure (e.g., roads,

16 fuel breaks, power lines), and where such occurs in or near areas of high fire hazard

17 the resulting environmental impacts must also be studied. (See Appendix G, Section

18 XX WILDFIRE [listing potential impacts such as impairment of adopted emergency

19 response and evacuation plans, exacerbation of wildfire risks, and other human

20 safety and environmental risks and impacts].) And, as noted above, the most deadly

21 fire in California history was started not by natural gas facilities, but by electrical

22 lines. Moreover, also as noted above, increased generator use may give rise to its
own increased risk of fire.

23

24 d) Similarly, the administrative record does not analyze whether the existing electrical
grid is sufficient to satisfy the demand of all new construction under a 100%

25

26 electricity standard. Given PG&E's warnings about potential blackouts, the grid's

27 ability to handle this new demand is questionable at best. Moreover, the Town did

28 not sufficiently discuss the sources of the additional electricity required under the
reach Code, nor the impacts related to those sources. Electric power generation
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

powered plants fueled by natural gas or other non-renewable energy sources will
2 obviously negate the supposed benefit of gas-free construction. Wind and solar

3 sources also have their own well-known adverse impacts relating to wildlife,
4 aesthetics, etc. They are also subject to supply issues depending on weather and

5 other conditions. And hydroelectric power comes with its own suite of adverse

6 impacts as well, including harm to anadromous fish and other species and the risk of

7 failure and flood (as with the Oroville Dam crisis of 2017). In fact, hydroelectric
facilities in California and the west are being removed, making this source of power
9 uncertain for future electricity needs.
10 e) GHG/Air Quality. In passing the Reach Code the Town assumed that GHGs are
11 the only environmental concern and impact at issue; such a facile assumption is
12 clearly incorrect. The Reach Code would eliminate gas-powered heaters, stoves,
13 water heaters, built-in outdoor barbeques, gas burning fireplaces, fire pits, and, as
14 noted above, gas-powered backup generators to protect against losses, disruptions
15 and safety problems from blackouts of a fragile and overburdened electrical grid.
16 Alternative fuel sources - such as wood, gasoline or charcoal - exist for many of
17 these amenities, and could be substituted for the cleaner-burning natural gas that the

18 proposal would eliminate, leading to greater GHG emissions and air quality impacts.
19 Such unintended, but clearly reasonably foreseeable, adverse environmental
20 consequences must be fully evaluated under CEQA. (See, e.g., Rodeo Citizens
21 Association V. County of Contra Costa (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 214 [recognizing that
22 to extent captured butane and propane were used to displace use of other fuels such
23 as coal, home heating fuel, fuel oil, diesel, kerosene, gasoline and ethanol, they
24 would also displace GHG emissions otherwise resulting from use of those alternate
25 fuels].) For example, propane barbeques produce only one-third of the GHG
26 emissions of charcoal barbeques (id. at p. 226), and natural gas is similarly a much
27 cleaner burning fuel than charcoal, wood or gasoline. Moreover, the increased use

28

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -9.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

of gasoline, diesel, or propane generators may also give rise to air quality and/or
2 GHG impacts that are completely unanalyzed in the administrative record.

3 f). Population and Housing/Human Impacts. Projects that would displace substantial
4 numbers of people or housing, or render housing unaffordable, may have significant
5 adverse impacts on the environment and human beings that require CEQA analysis

6 and mitigation. (See CEQA Guidelines, Appdx. G, Section XIV.) To the extent the

7 Reach Code could, for example, substantially increase the cost of new multi-family

8 apartment dwelling construction and/or retrofitting, it could lead to increased rents,
unaffordable housing, and tenant displacement from the same, with resulting adverse
10 human impacts. Alternatively, renters or home buyers may prefer residences with
11 traditional gas appliances and therefore show a greater propensity to move outside of
12 the Town and commute. This may also impact the supply of housing in the Town.
13 Residential displacement, in and of itself, has been recognized as a significant
14 adverse environmental impact subject to CEQA analysis and mitigation. (Lincoln
15 Place Tenants Assn. V. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425 [holding
16 CEQA mitigation measures designed to mitigate tenant displacement impacts of
17 project, contained in a vesting tentative map, were enforceable and did not conflict
18 with Ellis Act].) Public entities possess the power under existing law "to mitigate

19 adverse impacts on displaced tenants." (San Francisco Apartment Assn. V. City and
20 County of San Francisco (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 463, 484, citing Pieri v. City and

21 County of San Francisco (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 886, 892; see Gov. Code,
22 7060.1.) As explained by the Lincoln Place Court of Appeal, "CEQA... is made

23 relevant... by the Ellis Act's explicit exceptions for a public agency's power to

24 regulate, among other things,... the mitigation of adverse impacts on persons

25 displaced by reason of the withdrawal of rental accommodations. Such items are the

26 common focus and byproducts of the CEQA process...." (Lincoln Place Tenants

27 Assn., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at 451, emph. added.) Indeed, the Supreme Court has

28 recently reaffirmed "that CEQA addresses human health and safety" and "that public
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 health and safety are of great importance in the statutory scheme." (California

3 Building Industry Assn. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th

4 369, 386, citations omitted.) CEQA's "express language... requires a finding of a
"significant effect on the environment" ([Pub. Resources Code,] § 21083(b)(3))
whenever the "environmental effects of a project will cause substantial effects on
human beings, either directly or indirectly." (Id. at p. 386, emphasis in original.)

8 g) Land Use/Planning. Given the foregoing, the Town failed to adequately analyze

9 the Reach Code's consistency with its General Plan. While the Town has discretion

10 in interpreting and applying its General Plan, it cannot do so in a way that frustrates

11 the purpose of the General Plan. (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa

12 County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-381.) The analysis in

13 the administrative record is far too brief to fully address the proposed ordinance's

14 28. consistency with the General Plan and its overall purpose.
Given the foregoing, the Reach Code may have any number of potentially significant
15 impacts on the environment, which makes the Town's reliance on the common sense and class 8
16 exemptions improper.

17 29. Even if the Reach Code were subject to a categorical exemption, it is clear that the
18 unusual circumstances exception would apply, rendering the exemptions inapplicable. (Cal Code
19 Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports a finding that the project
20 presents unusual circumstances giving rise to the impacts discussed herein. These unusual
21 circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following: PG&E's express planned electricity
22 service interruptions and/or blackouts that will potentially last for days in this and other Sonoma
23 County areas, creating very serious health and safety problems if power is actually out that long and
24 not resumed from a non-grid source; the jurisdiction and cumulative study area jurisdictions are in
25 very high fire danger areas, increasing both the likelihood and seriousness of electricity blackouts;

26 there are well-known serious traffic problems on Highway 101 making even longer commutes to
27 Santa Rosa from northern cities by displaced homebuyers and renters who want a choice other than
28 all-electric more environmentally harmful. Accordingly, even assuming arguendo a categorical
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

exemption applies, there is more than a fair argument that the adoption of the ordinance may have
2 significant adverse environmental effects due to unusual circumstances which require actual

3 analysis in a legally adequate initial study pursuant to CEQA.
30. The Town's reliance on exemptions also overlooks the Reach Code's potential for

5 contributing to significant and adverse cumulative impacts. (Cal Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2,
6 subd. (b).) If other jurisdictions in Sonoma County or Northern California more broadly enact

7 similar ordinances, the increase in the demand for electricity will be potentially much greater than
8 that from the Town's alone, and so would the related impacts.

9 31. Section 10-106 of the Building Energy Efficiency Standards upon which the Town

10 relied to enact the Reach Code requires the submission of materials in support of an application for

11 a reach code. The specific submittals required do not extend to a notice of claimed exemption but a
12 "negative declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California
13 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
14 24, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4).) The provision clearly does not contemplate the use of an exemption
15 because the Reach Code will invariably require at least an initial stud and appropriate
16 environmental analysis under CEQA. Thus, the reliance on an exemption here is in error under the
17 very authority upon which the Town has relied to enact it.

18 32. The Town's purported reliance on an initial study and negative declaration
19 ("IS/ND") for the statewide 2019 Energy Code is also unavailing. The Town is, in effect,
20 attempting to "tier" environmental analysis on a negative declaration, which is not permitted under
21 CEQA. A lead agency can only tier off of an existing EIR, not a negative declaration. (Pub.
22| Resources Code, §§ 21068.5, 21093, 21094; 14 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15152, 15168.) Indeed,
23 the fact that the California Energy Commission conducted an initial study for the 2019 Building
24 Energy Efficiency Standards demonstrates that the Reach Code is not exempt from CEQA review.
25 Thus, the Town's citation to the IS/ND to justify their reliance on CEQA exemptions is self-
26 defeating as a matter of law. Moreover, even where an EIR has been previously prepared, in order
27 to lawfully tier off of that EIR "an initial study shall be prepared to assist the lead agency in making
28 the determinations required by this section. The initial study shall analyze whether the later
GLLR\56389\2186906,2 -12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 project may cause significant effects on the environment that were not examined in the prior

2 [EIR]." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21094, subd. (c).) As the State's IS/ND did not evaluate any of
3 the local conditions pertaining to the Town's adoption of the Reach Code (including, but not limited
4 to, its impacts on housing, traffic, PG&E shutoffs, increased wildfire risk, public safety, the use of
5 generators, etc.), there is no way for the Town to lawfully rely upon the IS/ND. Indeed, the
6 provisions of the Reach Code are not even addressed in the IS/ND. It also engages in a "net

7 benefit" analysis contrary to the authority addressed above. (IS/ND, § III, p. A-3.) Finally,
8 adoption of the Reach Code is a discretionary act not specific to the Town, and the IS/ND does not
9 break out its provisions or impacts, so it provides no basis to conclude as to whether the Reach
10 Code results in lesser or greater environmental impacts that may or may not be "balanced out" by
11 the far more numerous provisions in the remainder of the Energy Code.

12 33. Accordingly, there was no basis in law or fact for the Town to conclude that
13 adoption of the Reach Code was exempt under CEQA.

14 34. Under CEQA, a lead agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to
15 proceed in the manner required by law; or (2) its decision is not supported by the evidence. (Pub.
16 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) By deeming the Reach Code exempt from CEQA review,
17 Respondents abused their discretion in failing to comply with CEQA and failing to proceed in the
18 manner required by law. As a result a of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner and other
19 members of the public have been harmed in that they were not fully informed about the significant

20 environmental impacts of the Reach Code prior to Respondents' enactment of the same.
21 Petitioner, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief

22 requested herein is not granted, as the Reach Code will be implemented in the absence of a full
23 and adequate environmental review under CEQA. For the foregoing reasons, inter alia, Petitioner
24|| seeks an immediate stay of the Reach Code.

25 35. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him to
26 address Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required and not excused, and any further
27 attempts would in any event have been an idle and futile exercise even if available. Petitioner has
28 no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the Reach Code,
GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and a writ of ordinary mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 is the
2 prescribed remedy for violations of this type. Petitioner is herewith or shortly will be filing and
3 serving on Respondents his election to prepare the supplemental administrative record pursuant to
4 Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (b)(2), and all other applicable laws. Petitioner

5 has also performed all other conditions precedent to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service
6 of written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the
requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and mail service of the petition on the
California Attorney General no more than ten (10) days after its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., 388).
9 36. The adoption of the Reach Code, and the Town's subsequent passage of an
10 ordinance amending its Municipal Code to incorporate the Reach Code, are in violation of CEQA
11 and the CEQA Guidelines.
12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
13

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106 -

16 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5 -

17 Against All Respondents)

37.
18 The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 36, above, are hereby incorporated by

19 reference as though set forth in full.

38.
20 Section 10-106 of the Reach Code Law requires that a jurisdiction enacting a reach

21 code satisfy certain substantive and procedural requirements. As noted above, the Town was

22 required to make "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24,

23 pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The Town relied upon the Study to make this determination.

24 However, the Study is materially contradicted by a separate study entitled "Residential Building
Electrification in California.» The Town could therefore not make the proper determination under 25

26 the Reach Code Law to pass the Reach Code.

39.
27 The Reach Code Law also requires the submittal of an application to the Executive

28 Director of the California State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 includes "[a]ny findings, determinations, declarations or reports, including any negative
2 declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California Environmental
3 Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, §

4 subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.) As noted above, the Town did not a prepare a negative declaration or
5 EIR in support of the Reach Code. Accordingly, it cannot make the requisite submittal under the
6 Reach Code Law.

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
10 Against All Respondents)

11 40. The allegations of paragraphs ! through 39, above, are hereby incorporated by
12 reference as though set forth in full.

13 41. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and the
14 Respondents. Petitioner contends that the Reach Code is invalid due to Respondents' failure to
15 follow CEQA and/or the Reach Code Law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis

16 alleges, that Respondents contend that the Reach Code is valid and enforceable and was properly

17 enacted.

18 42. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the validity of the Reach Code. In
19 particular, Petitioner desires declaration that the Reach Code is invalid and unenforceable due to
20 Respondents' failure to follow CEQA and the Reach Code Law.

21 43. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Petitioner
22 and similarly situated persons understand their rights and obligations with respect to the Reach

23 Code.

24 44. Petitioner also seeks to enjoin Respondents from applying or enforcing the Reach
25 Code, and to require that Respondents rescind their approval of the Reach Code.

CEOA ACTION

19

20 Petitioner and Plaintiff William P. Gallaher, an individual ("Petitioner"), alleges as
follows:
21

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

1.
23 Petitioner is an individual, over the age of eighteen who regularly conducts business
in the Town of Windsor. 24
2.
25 Respondent and Defendant Town of Windsor ("Town") is and at all relevant times

26 was a political and legal subdivision of the State of California, duly organized and existing under

27 and pursuant to the laws of the State of California.

28

|/ GLLR\563892186906.2 --
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

3. Respondent and Defendant Town Council of the Town of Windsor ("Council") is,
2 and at all relevant times was, inter alia, the duly organized legislative body of the Town existing
3 under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California. The Council is, and at relevant times

4 was, the local body charged with proposing, drafting, amending and passing legislation governing
5 land use and the Town's municipal affairs, subject to, and in a manner complying with, all
6 applicable federal, state, and local law.

4. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued
8 herein as DOES through 25, inclusive, and will amend this complaint to set forth their true names
9 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based
10 thereon alleges, that some fictitiously named Respondents were the agents and employees of the
11 other fictitiously named, or actually named, Respondents and, acting within the course of scope of
12 such employment or agency, took some part in the acts or omissions hereinafter set forth, or are the
13 principals and took some part in such acts or omissions, by reason of which said fictitiously-named
14 Respondents are liable to Petitioner for the relief prayed for herein.
15 5. Respondents and Defendants identified in paragraphs 2 through 4 above, inclusive,
16 are sometimes referred to collectively herein as "Respondents."
17 6. This action challenges the approval by the Town of a so-called "reach code" via
18 "An Ordinance of the Town of Windsor Amending Windsor Municipal Code Title VII, 'Building
19 and Housing,' to Add Chapter 7, 'All-Electric Residential Reach Code' ("Reach Code"), which
20 ordinance was passed by the Council on second reading on October 16, 2019.

21 7. A "reach code" is so called because it "reaches" beyond the ordinary standards of a
22 building or energy code to impose greater restrictions on building and development. Reach codes
23 in California are optional and can only be enacted if specific procedures are followed. Here, the
24|| Reach Code forbids the inclusion of natural gas or propane plumbing in new low-rise residential
25 construction in the Town.

26 8. Despite the fact that enactment of the Reach Code constituted a discretionary
27 project affecting the use and occupancy of land and structures in the Town, and having the
28 potential for reasonably foreseeable and potentially significant adverse physical changes in the

Il GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -2-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environment, the Town enacted the Reach Code without undertaking environmental review as
2 required by, and therefore in violation of, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA";
3 Pub. Resources Code cop 21000 et seq.) and its implementing CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs.,
4 tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.).

5 9. The enactment of a reach code is governed by section 10-106 of the 2019 Building

6 Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings, title 24, part 6 of the
7 California Code of Regulations ("Reach Code Law"). Before enacting the Reach Code, the Reach
8 Code Law required that the Town adopt "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective."
9 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The Town's determination was based on a
10 document entitled "2019 Cost-effectiveness Study: Low-Rise Residential New Construction"
11 dated July 17, 2019 ("Study"), whose material conclusions are contradicted by a separate study
12 entitled "Residential Building Electrification in California." The Reach Code Law also requires
13 the submittal of an application to the Executive Director of the California State Energy Resources
14 Conservation and Development Commission that includes "[a]ny findings, determinations,
15 declarations or reports, including any negative declaration or environmental impact report,
16 required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section
17 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.)
18 10. On November 6, 2019, the Town Council introduced and held a first reading of an
19 ordinance adopting the 2019 edition of the California Building Standards Code, including the
20 Reach Code. As of the date of this petition the Town Council has not yet held the second reading
21 of that ordinance. Any further action to implement or adopt the Reach Code is invalid and illegal
22 for the reasons set forth herein. Petitioner may amend this petition and complaint at such time as
23 the Town takes such further action.

24 11. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the Town's full compliance with the law
25 regarding the Town's approval of the Reach Code, including adhering to the requirements of
26 CEQA. Petitioner has personal, professional, environmental and other interests which will be
27 severely injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA and the Reach Code Law.
28 Petitioner lives close by the Town and regularly does business there, including developing projects

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -3-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P that would be subject to the Reach Code. Moreover, the Reach Code's impacts are necessarily
2 regional in nature, thereby impacting residents throughout Sonoma County.
3 12. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by
4 the Town's failure to comply with CEQA and approval of the Reach Code. Petitioner has
expressed his concerns and objections to the approval of the Reach Code at meetings and in
6 correspondence to the Town. Before approving the Reach Code, the City owed a mandatory duty to

7 comply with the legal duties which Petitioner alleges were violated. Petitioner has the right to
8 enforce the mandatory duties which the CEQA imposes on the Town.
13. The Town is the lead agency for purposes of CEQA compliance.
10 14. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the Town's
11 approval of the Reach Code is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.
12 15. Petitioner objected to the approval of the Reach Code orally and in writing during
13 the public comment period and prior to the close of the public hearing on the Reach Code, and
14 before the Town's filing of a Notice of Exemption for the approval on October 21, 2019. All
15 alleged grounds for non-compliance with CEQA and the Reach Code Law were presented to the

on the Reach Code 16 Town during the public-comment period prior to the close of the public hearing
17 and the Town's issuance of the Notice of Exemption.
18 16. The Town filed a Notice of Exemption for the Reach Code with the Office of the
19 County Clerk for the County of Sonoma on or about October 21, 2019. Petitioner will timely file
20 this Petition for Writ of Mandate on before November 25, 2019, a date not more than thirty-five
21 (35) days after the filing of the Notice of Exemption as required by Public Resources Code section
22 21167, subdivision (d).
23 17. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Intent to File Suit to be served on the Town as
24 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent
25 to File Suit is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

26 18. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Office of the
27

28

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -4-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Attorney General for the State of California not more than ten (10) days after the commencement of
2 this proceeding, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure
3 section 388.

19. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general to vindicate his own legal
5 and constitutional rights and those of residents of the Town and all others who may be impacted by
6 the Reach Code. Petitioner seeks, on his own behalf and the behalf of said others, that Respondents
7 obey the clear law, conduct required environmental reviews of their discretionary actions, require
8 appropriate and feasible mitigation for their significant impacts, and not act in unlawful, bad faith,
arbitrary, capricious, and confiscatory fashion in noticing, analyzing, enacting and enforcing local
10 land use legislation.

11 20. For these reasons, and others set forth in this Petition and Complaint, the Town's
12 actions described herein and the Reach Code are unlawful, invalid, and unenforceable. Petitioner
13 therefore requests this Court issue a writ of mandate invalidating the Reach Code and declaring it,
14 and any actions undertaken thereunder or pursuant thereto, unlawful, null, and void. Petitioner also
15 seeks declaratory relief regarding the parties' respective legal rights and obligations and temporary,
16 preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting enforcement of the Reach Code in any
17 manner.

18 21. An actual and substantial controversy exists between Petitioner, on the one hand, and
19 Respondents, on the other hand, relating to the legal rights of the respective parties. The
20 controversy is well-defined and imminent in nature, such that the need for, and appropriateness of,
21 judicial determinations at this time is warranted.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Mandamus - Violations of CEQA -
24 Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5 -
25 Against All Respondents)
26 22. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 21, above, are hereby incorporated herein by
27 reference as though set forth in full.

28

I GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

23. The ordinance adopting the Reach Code is a "project" that is subject to CEQA
2 review. The CEQA Guidelines, in relevant part, define "project" as "the whole of an action, which
a 3 has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
4 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following: (1) An
5 activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to... enactment and

6 amendment of zoning ordinances..' (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a)(1).) Indeed,
7 under CEQA's broad definition of a "project," municipal ordinances, laws and regulations affecting
the use of land or structures have consistently been held to be CEQA "projects" over the course of
9 many decades.

10 24. The Notice of Exemption for the Reach Code cites two exemptions: the class 8
11 exemption under section 15308 of the Guidelines, and the "common sense" exemption under
12 section 15061, subdivision (b)(3).
13 25. CEQA'S co-called "common sense" exemption may properly be invoked only when
14 the lead agency can declare "with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question
15 may have a significant effect on the environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)
16 Thus, it is the Town's burden to provide support for application of the common sense exemption,
17 not Petitioner's burden to disprove its applicability. Any legitimate reasonable question about
18 whether a project might have significant impact means the project cannot be exempt under the
19 "common sense" exemption. The Town was required to consider factual evidence and data relating
20 to possible environmental impacts of the Reach Code, and that consideration must be supported by
21 evidence in the administrative record.

22 26. With respect to the class 8 exemption, such can only be used for an action that
23 constitutes a preservation of the environment. The Reach Code cannot be said to rise to this
24 standard as it merely substitutes one source of energy for another, without any sufficient analysis as
25 to whether that substitution will actually yield any benefit to the environment. (Dunn-Edwards
26 Corp. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644; International
27 Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App.3d 265.)
28 The Town cannot undertake a "net benefit" environmental analysis - i.e., reasoning that the

Il GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -6-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

project's environmental benefits in one area outweigh its significant adverse effects in another area
2 or areas of environmental impact - as such is not permitted under CEQA. (County Sanitation Dist.
3 No. 2 y. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544, 1577, 1580.) "There may be environmental

4 costs to an environmentally beneficial project, which must be considered and assessed."

5 (California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143
6 Cal.App.4th 173, 178.)

7 27. Neither the common sense 8 nor the class 8 exemption applies here. The Reach Code
may have a number of significant impacts on the environment, none of which the Town has
analyzed. These include the following:
10 a) Hazards/Public Safety. The Reach Code a was passed at a time when the supply of
11 electrical power to the Town and surrounding communities may be less reliable and
12 subject to more and longer planned outages than ever before. In October of 2019 the
13 Town and surrounding area were subject to prolonged electricity blackouts and
14 wildfires which may have been caused by electrical infrastructure. But the Town
15 failed to analyze how all-electric residential construction would exacerbate these
16 impacts. Without adequate battery storage of electricity, or an alternative power
17 source, such as natural gas which powers backup generators cook-stoves and grills,
18 and other appliances, "all-electric" homes and businesses will be subject to hazards

19 and risks to public safety during outages when heat, life-saving medical equipment,

20 lighting, water, refrigeration, food, and air conditioning may be unavailable. Given
21 the risk of blackouts, some residents will rely on propane or gasoline generators or
22 other combustible sources of power, which are more prone to accident or spillage

23 than fixed natural gas lines. There has been no study or analysis of the risks or

24 impacts associated with such increased usage, including air quality, GHG, and fire

25 impacts.

26 b) The 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest in California history, was apparently caused by
27 electrical transmission lines. There is no analysis whatsoever in the administrative

28 record as to any potential increase in fire risk from expanded electrical service

| GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 facilities which the Reach Code would necessitate. Instead, the Town claims,
2 without supporting evidence, that "natural gas infrastructure is a potentially
3 significant source of fire." The Town cannot assert (without supporting evidence)
that natural gas presents a wildfire risk while ignoring the fact that electric
transmission lines gave rise to the most lethal California wildfire ever less than a

6 year ago.

7 c Utilities/Service Systems/Wildfire. The CEQA Guidelines Appendix G checklist -
8 a template for the initial study the Town is required to conduct under CEQA -
a requires evaluation of the question of whether the project would "[r]equire or result
10 in the relocation or construction of new or expanded ... electric power, natural gas,
11 or telecommunications facilities, the construction of which could cause significant
12 environmental effects?" Projects requiring significant new construction to rely
13 solely on electricity as a power source clearly have the potential to result in the
14 installation, upgrading, and/or maintenance of associated infrastructure (e.g., roads,
15 fuel breaks, power lines), and where such occurs in or near areas of high fire hazard
16 the resulting environmental impacts must also be studied. (See Appendix G, Section
17 XX WILDFIRE [listing potential impacts such as impairment of adopted emergency
18 response and evacuation plans, exacerbation of wildfire risks, and other human
19 safety and environmental risks and impacts].) And, as noted above, the most deadly
20 fire in California history was started not by natural gas facilities, but by electrical
21 lines. Moreover, also as noted above, increased generator use may give rise to its
22 own increased risk of fire.

23 d) Similarly, the administrative record does not analyze whether the existing electrical
24 grid is sufficient to satisfy the demand of all new construction under a 100%

25 electricity standard. Given PG&E's warnings about potential blackouts, the grid's
26 ability to handle this new demand is questionable at best. Moreover, the Town did

27 not sufficiently discuss the sources of the additional electricity required under the

28 reach Code, nor the impacts related to those sources. Electric power generation

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 powered plants fueled by natural gas or other non-renewable energy sources will
obviously negate the supposed benefit of gas-free construction. Wind and solar
3 sources also have their own well-known adverse impacts relating to wildlife,
aesthetics, etc. They are also subject to supply issues depending on weather and
other conditions. And hydroelectric power comes with its own suite of adverse
6 impacts as well, including harm to anadromous fish and other species and the risk of
7 failure and flood (as with the Oroville Dam crisis of 2017). In fact, hydroelectric
8 facilities in California and the west are being removed, making this source of power
uncertain for future electricity needs.
10 e) GHG/Air Quality. In passing the Reach Code the Town assumed that GHGs are
11 the only environmental concern and impact at issue; such a facile assumption is
12 clearly incorrect. The Reach Code would eliminate gas-powered heaters, stoves,
13 water heaters, built-in outdoor barbeques, gas burning fireplaces, fire pits, and, as
14 noted above, gas-powered backup generators to protect against losses, disruptions
15 and safety problems from blackouts of a fragile and overburdened electrical grid.
16 Alternative fuel sources - such as wood, gasoline or charcoal - exist for many of
17 these amenities, and could be substituted for the cleaner-burning natural gas that the
18 proposal would eliminate, leading to greater GHG emissions and air quality impacts.
19 Such unintended, but clearly reasonably foreseeable, adverse environmental
20 consequences must be fully evaluated under CEQA. (See, e.g., Rodeo Citizens
21 Association v. County of Contra Costa (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 214 [recognizing that
22 to extent captured butane and propane were used to displace use of other fuels such
23 as coal, home heating fuel, fuel oil, diesel, kerosene, gasoline and ethanol, they
24 would also displace GHG emissions otherwise resulting from use of those alternate
25 fuels].) For example, propane barbeques produce only one-third of the GHG

26 emissions of charcoal barbeques (id. at p. 226), and natural gas is similarly a much

27 cleaner burning fuel than charcoal, wood or gasoline. Moreover, the increased use

28

| GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -9.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 of gasoline, diesel, or propane generators may also give rise to air quality and/or
GHG impacts that are completely unanalyzed in the administrative record.

4 f) Population and Housing/Human Impacts. Projects that would displace substantial

5 numbers of people or housing, or render housing unaffordable, may have significant

6 adverse impacts on the environment and human beings that require CEQA analysis

7 and mitigation. (See CEQA Guidelines, Appdx. G, Section XIV.) To the extent the

8 Reach Code could, for example, substantially increase the cost of new multi-family
apartment dwelling construction and/or retrofitting, it could lead to increased rents,

10 unaffordable housing, and tenant displacement from the same, with resulting adverse
Et human impacts. Alternatively, renters or home buyers may prefer residences with
traditional

12 gas appliances and therefore show a greater propensity to move outside of

13 the Town and commute. This may also impact the supply of housing in the Town.

14 Residential displacement, in and of itself, has been recognized as a significant a

15 adverse environmental impact subject to CEQA analysis and mitigation. (Lincoln

16 Place Tenants Assn. V. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425 [holding

17 CEQA mitigation measures designed to mitigate tenant displacement impacts of

18 project, contained in a vesting tentative map, were enforceable and did not conflict

19 with Ellis Act].) Public entities possess the power under existing law "to mitigate

20 adverse impacts on displaced tenants." (San Francisco Apartment Assn. v. City and

21 County of San Francisco (2016) 3 Cal.App.5th 463, 484, citing Pieri v. City and

22 County of San Francisco (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 886, 892; see Gov. Code,

23 § 7060.1.) As explained by the Lincoln Place Court of Appeal, "CEQA... is made

24 relevant... by the Ellis Act's explicit exceptions for a public agency's power to

25 regulate, among other things,... the mitigation of adverse impacts on persons

26 displaced by reason of the withdrawal of rental accommodations. Such items are the

27 common focus and byproducts of the CEQA process...." (Lincoln Place Tenants

28 Assn., supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at 451, emph. added.) Indeed, the Supreme Court has
recently reaffirmed "that CEQA addresses human health and safety" and "that public

I/ GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -10-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

H

2 health and safety are of great importance in the statutory scheme." (California
Building Industry Assn. V. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th
369, 386, citations omitted.) CEQA's "express language... requires a finding of a

5 "significant effect on the environment" ([Pub. Resources Code,] § 21083(b)(3))

6 whenever the "environmental effects of a project will cause substantial effects on

7 human beings, either directly or indirectly."" (Id. at p. 386, emphasis in original.)

8 g) Land Use/Planning. Given the foregoing, the Town failed to adequately analyze
the Reach Code's consistency with its General Plan. While the Town has discretion

10 in interpreting and applying its General Plan, it cannot do so in a way that a frustrates

11 the purpose of the General Plan. (Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa

12 County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-381.) The analysis in

13 the administrative record is far too brief to fully address the proposed ordinance's

14 28. consistency with the General Plan and its overall purpose.
Given the foregoing, the Reach Code may have any number of potentially significant
15 impacts on the environment, which makes the Town's reliance on the common sense and class 8
16 exemptions improper.
17 29. Even if the Reach Code were subject to a categorical exemption, it is clear that the
18| unusual circumstances exception would apply, rendering the exemptions inapplicable. (Cal Code
19 Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports a finding that the project
20 presents unusual circumstances giving rise to the impacts discussed herein. These unusual
21 circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following: PG&E's express planned electricity
22 service interruptions and/or blackouts that will potentially last for days in this and other Sonoma
23 County areas, creating very serious health and safety problems if power is actually out that long and
24 not resumed from a non-grid source; the jurisdiction and cumulative study area jurisdictions are in
25 very high fire danger areas, increasing both the likelihood and seriousness of electricity blackouts;
26 there are well-known serious traffic problems on Highway 101 making even longer commutes to
27 Santa Rosa from northern cities by displaced homebuyers and renters who want a choice other than
28 all-electric more environmentally harmful. Accordingly, even assuming arguendo a categorical

| GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -11-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

exemption applies, there is more than a fair argument that the adoption of the ordinance may have
2 significant adverse environmental effects due to unusual circumstances which require actual
3 analysis in a legally adequate initial study pursuant to CEQA.

4 30. The Town's reliance on exemptions also overlooks the Reach Code's potential for
5 contributing to significant and adverse cumulative impacts. (Cal Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15300.2,

6 subd. (b).) If other jurisdictions in Sonoma County or Northern California more broadly enact
7 similar ordinances, the increase in the demand for electricity will be potentially much greater than
that from the Town's alone, and so would the related impacts.
31. Section 10-106 of the Building Energy Efficiency Standards upon which the Town
10 relied to enact the Reach Code requires the submission of materials in support of an application for
11 a reach code. The specific submittals required do not extend to a notice of claimed exemption but a

12 "negative declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California
13 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit.
14 24, § 10-106, subd. (b)(4).) The provision clearly does not contemplate the use of an exemption
15 because the Reach Code will invariably require at least an initial stud and appropriate
16 environmental analysis under CEQA. Thus, the reliance on an exemption here is in error under the
17 very authority upon which the Town has relied to enact it.
18 32. The Town's purported reliance on an initial study and negative declaration
19 ("IS/ND") for the statewide 2019 Energy Code is also unavailing. The Town is, in effect,
20 attempting to "tier" environmental analysis on a negative declaration, which is not permitted under
21 CEQA. A lead agency can only tier off of an existing EIR, not a negative declaration. (Pub.
22 Resources Code, §§ 21068.5, 21093, 21094; 14 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15152, 15168.) Indeed,
23 the fact that the California Energy Commission conducted an initial study for the 2019 Building
24 Energy Efficiency Standards demonstrates that the Reach Code is not exempt from CEQA review.
25 Thus, the Town's citation to the IS/ND to justify their reliance on CEQA exemptions is self-
26 defeating as a matter of law, Moreover, even where an EIR has been previously prepared, in order
27 to lawfully tier off of that EIR "an initial study shall be prepared to assist the lead agency in making

28 the determinations required by this section. The initial study shall analyze whether the later

I GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -12-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

project may cause significant effects on the environment that were not examined in the prior
2 [EIR]." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21094, subd. (c).) As the State's IS/ND did not evaluate any of
3 the local conditions pertaining to the Town's adoption of the Reach Code (including, but not limited
4 to, its impacts on housing, traffic, PG&E shutoffs, increased wildfire risk, public safety, the use of
5 generators, etc.), there is no way for the Town to lawfully rely upon the IS/ND. Indeed, the

6 provisions of the Reach Code are not even addressed in the IS/ND. It also engages in a "net
7 benefit" analysis contrary to the authority addressed above. (IS/ND, § III, p. A-3.) Finally,
8 adoption of the Reach Code is a discretionary act not specific to the Town, and the IS/ND does not
9 break out its provisions or impacts, so it provides no basis to conclude as to whether the Reach
10 Code results in lesser or greater environmental impacts that may or may not be "balanced out" by
11 the far more numerous provisions in the remainder of the Energy Code.
12 33. Accordingly, there was no basis in law or fact for the Town to conclude that
13 adoption of the Reach Code was exempt under CEQA.

14 34. Under CEQA, a lead agency prejudicially abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to
15 proceed in the manner required by law; or (2) its decision is not supported by the evidence. (Pub.
16 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) By deeming the Reach Code exempt from CEQA review,
17 Respondents abused their discretion in failing to comply with CEQA and failing to proceed in the
18 manner required by law. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner and other
19 members of the public have been harmed in that they were not fully informed about the significant
20 environmental impacts of the Reach Code prior to Respondents' enactment of the same.
21 Petitioner, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief
22 requested herein is not granted, as the Reach Code will be implemented in the absence of a full
23 and adequate environmental review under CEQA. For the foregoing reasons, inter alia, Petitioner
24 seeks an immediate stay of the Reach Code.

25 35. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies made available to him to

26 address Respondents' unlawful conduct to the extent required and not excused, and any further
27 attempts would in any event have been an idle and futile exercise even if available. Petitioner has

28 no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to challenge the Reach Code,

GLLR156389\2186906.2 -13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F a and a writ of ordinary mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 is the
2 prescribed remedy for violations of this type. Petitioner is herewith or shortly will be filing and
3 serving on Respondents his election to prepare the supplemental administrative record pursuant to
4 Public Resources Code section 21167, subdivision (b)(2), and all other applicable laws. Petitioner
has also performed all other conditions precedent to issuance of a writ of mandate, including service

6 of written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the
7 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and mail service of the petition on the
8 California Attorney General no more than ten (10) days after its filing (see Code Civ. Proc., § 388).

9 36. The adoption of the Reach Code, and the Town's subsequent passage of an

10 ordinance amending its Municipal Code to incorporate the Reach Code, are in violation of CEQA
11 and the CEQA Guidelines.

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
13
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 14
(Writ of Mandamus - Violations of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106 - 15
Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5 - 16
Against All Respondents) 17
37. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 36, above, are hereby incorporated by 18

19 reference as though set forth in full.

38. Section 10-106 of the Reach Code Law requires that a jurisdiction enacting a reach 20

21 code satisfy certain substantive and procedural requirements. As noted above, the Town was

22 required to make "[a] determination that the standards are cost effective." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24,

23 pt. 6, § 10-106, subd. (a)(1).) The Town relied upon the Study to make this determination.

24 However, the Study is materially contradicted by a separate study entitled "Residential Building
Electrification in California." The Town could therefore not make the proper determination under 25
the Reach Code Law to pass the Reach Code.
26
39. The Reach Code Law also requires the submittal of an application to the Executive 27
Director of the California State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission that 28

GLLR\56389\2186906.2 -14-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

includes "[a]ny findings, determinations, declarations or reports, including any negative
2 declaration or environmental impact report, required pursuant to the California Environmental
3 Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code Section 21000 et seq." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 24, pt. 6, § 10-106,
4 subd. (b)(4), emphasis added.) As noted above, the Town did not prepare a negative declaration or
5 EIR in support of the Reach Code. Accordingly, it cannot make the requisite submittal under the
6 Reach Code Law.

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as hereinafter set forth.
8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
10 Against All Respondents)
11 40. The allegations of paragraphs 1 through 39, above, are hereby incorporated by
12 reference as though set forth in full.

13 41. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and the
14 Respondents. Petitioner contends that the Reach Code is invalid due to Respondents' failure to
15 follow CEQA and/or the Reach Code Law. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis
16 alleges, that Respondents contend that the Reach Code is valid and enforceable and was properly
17 enacted.

18 42. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the validity of the Reach Code. In
19 I| particular, Petitioner desires a declaration that the Reach Code is invalid and unenforceable due to
20 Respondents' failure to follow CEQA and the Reach Code Law.

21 43. Such a declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that Petitioner
22 and similarly situated persons understand their rights and obligations with respect to the Reach
23 Code.

24 44. Petitioner also seeks to enjoin Respondents from applying or enforcing the Reach
25 Code, and to require that Respondents rescind their approval of the Reach Code.
