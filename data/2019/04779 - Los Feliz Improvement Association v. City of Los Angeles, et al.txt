12. The Letter of Determination issued by the City states the following: "The subject
7 property consists of a rectangular lot with a 50-foot frontage along the northerly side of Russell

13 13. The Letter of Determination goes on to state: "The applicant requests a Project 8
SII!H AUBAIE 14 Permit Compliance to permit the demolition of the two (2) existing single-family dwellings, and
15 the construction, use and maintenance of a three-story, 4,816 square foot, four-unit residential

18 unit within private garages and one uncovered guest parking space located in the rear. A new six-
19 foot tall gate is proposed along the southerly and westerly side of the lot."

20 14. In order tò facilitate the Project, the developer sought a Project Permit
21 Compliance Review pursuant to LAMS Section 11.5.7 C and the Vermont/Western Station
22 Neighborhood Area Specific Plan.
23 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

24 15. The Planning Director issued a Planning Director's Determination and approved a

25 Project Permit Compliance Review for the Project on September 18, 2018. The Planning
26 Director also determined that the project was exempt from CEQA. Appeals were timely filed and
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 an appeal hearing was held before the City Planning Commission (*Planning Commission") on

2 November 27, 2018. Despite testimony in support of the appeal, the Planning Commission
3 denied the appeal and a Letter of Determination was issued on December 12, 2018. The

4 Planning Commission also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA. Petitioner filed

5 a CEQA appeal to the City Council. pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c) which

6 is still pending.
CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

8 16. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
10 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
11 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
d77 § LLZ06 12 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
13 8 EnS "PAIE EUJYSI!M 00Z8 MET |auueYO 'dnois governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects

SIl!H AueAg 14 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
15 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
16 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
17 17. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
18 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. Mitigated negative declarations are
19 prepared when a project applicant revises a project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
20, by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
21 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
22 incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
23 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
24 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
25 agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
26 declaration. An agency adopting mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative

2 declaration.

3 18. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency

4 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a

5 result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an
environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the

7 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to

8 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
9 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to
10 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible

MET |ouueys d11 'dnoJg 8 11 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead
BynS "pAa eysim ooZs -LZ06 12 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration.
13
8 19. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a
2 14| complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
Beverly 15 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
16 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
17 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
18 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
19 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
20 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
21 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
22 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
23 segmenting project into several smaller projects.
24 20. When a government agency adopts a negative declaration, mitigated negative
25 declaration or an EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis.

LOS ANGELES CITY CHARTER AND MUNICIPAL CODE

2 21. The Los Angeles City Charter ("Charter") and the Los Angeles Municipal Code

3 ("LAMC") govern the grant of all types of quasi-judicial approvals such Planning Director's
Determinations pursuant to LAMC Section 11.5.7 C and Project Permit Compliance Reviews.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Project Does Not Comply with CEQA)

22. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental clearance
10 document that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide
11 for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. The MET |3uueys Group, d17 L1Z06 12 City's environmental clearance document must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
13 8 00& eHN pAa eJJySI!M 00Z8 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on
SII!H Áueneg 14 proposed projects.
15 24. Respondents violated CEQA by determining that the Project was exempt from
16 CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
17 a. Failed to analyze potential carcinogenic contaminants from the adjacent dry cleaners to
18 the project site.
b. Failed to analyze potential carcinogenic contaminants from the former gas station 19

20 adjacent to the project site.
21 C. Failed to analyze the impacts associated with construction near a fault line running down
22 Franklin Avenue.

23 25. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW AND LOCAL LAW)

3 26. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 27. The City's determination that the Project was consistent with the SNAP was in

6 error and not supported by substantial evidence. Section 7.D of the Vermont/Western Specific
7 Plan states that the maximum height of any new building within Subarea A shall not exceed a

8 height that is within 15 feet of the height of the shortest adjacent building on any adjacent lot

10 limit of the underlying R2-1XL Zone. The Specific Plan further stipulates that roofs and roof 9 within the same Subarea. However, in no circumstance can the project exceed the 30- foot height

11 structures for the purposes specified in the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Section § d17 Group, MET jeuueya - LZ06 12

13 8 e}ns "pAE EJIJySI!M 0078 12.21.1 B.3 of the Code and architectural rooftop features may be erected up to 10 feet above the
transitional height limit, if the structures and features are set back a minimum of 10 feet from the
'SIl!H ÁueAg 14 roof perimeter and screened from view at street level. The adjacent property to the east is located
15 within Subarea B and therefore was not considered by the City. Rather the City considered the
16 height of the adjacent residential building to the west, which was approximately 23 feet in
17 height, thereby allowing a maximum transitional height limit of 38 feet on the subject property.
18 28. The City erred in using the adjacent building to the west because it was not the
19 shortest adjacent building. Rather, the "shortest adjacent building" is 4515 1/2 West Russell

20 Avenue the guest house in back of 4515 West Russell Avenue which is original to 4515 West
21 Russell Avenue. The SNAP specifically used the term "shortest adjacent building" because it's
22 not just the street view that is important to the SNAP - especially in an R2 neighborhood where
23 there are whole families living in guest houses. The SNAP was written to take sunlight/shadow
24 and privacy into consideration. The grant of Project Plan Compliance Review was therefore in
25 error and not supported by substantial evidence.
