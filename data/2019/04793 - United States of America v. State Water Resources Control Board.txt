VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

The United States of America, through its undersigned attorneys, by the authority of the

2 Attorney General, and at the request of the United States Department of the Interior, through its
3 Bureau of Reclamation (*Reclamation"), petitions this Court for a writ of a mandate under sections

4 1094.5 and 1085 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168, 21168.5, and

5 21080.5 of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.,

6 directing Respondent California State Water Resources Control Board to vacate and set aside its
7 December 12, 2018 decision to adopt Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving and adopting
amendments to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San

9 Joaquin Delta Estuary and the related Substitute Environmental Document.

10 INTRODUCTION

11 1. On December 12, 2018, the California State Water Resources Control Board
12| ("Board") approved and adopted amendments to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San
13 Francisco Bay/Sacramento -San Joaquin Delta Estuary ("Amended Plan'l) and the related
14 Substitute Environmental Document ("Final SED").

15 2. The Amended Plan adopts new flow objectives for the Lower San Joaquin River and
16 its tributaries.

17 3. In approving the Amended Plan and Final SED, the Board failed to comply with the
18 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), CAL. PUB. RES. CODE §§
19 21000-21189.57 (West 2019), in the following ways:
20 The Board failed to provide an accurate, stable, and finite project description,
21 because the Board analyzed a project materially different from the project
22 described in the project description;
23 • The Board improperly masked potential environmental impacts of the Amended
24

25

26 The Amended Plan is found at Appendix K to the Final SED. The Board's website for the
Amended Plan is located at: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/
27 programs/bay_delta (last visited March 28, 2019). The revisions to the Amended Plan are found at: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/bay_delta/ 28 bay_delta_plan/water_quality_control_planning/2018_sed/docs/appx_k.pdf (last visited March 28, 2019) and also include Change Sheets #1, 2, and 3.

Plan by including mitigation measures in the form of carryover storage targets
2 and other reservoir controls in its impacts analysis and by not analyzing the
3 impacts of the Amended Plan on the environment without such mitigation
measures and

The Board failed to adequately analyze the impacts of the Amended Plan,
6 including with respect to water temperature and related water quality conditions,

7 and water supply.

8 4. The United States holds water rights that are managed by Reclamation for the federal
New Melones Dam and Reservoir project (*New Melones Project"), located on the Stanislaus River,
10 that is subject to the Amended Plan. The New Melones Project is owned by the United States and
11 operated by Reclamation under federal Reclamation laws? and is a component of the federal Central
12 Valley Project ("CVP").

13 5. The United States will be directly, substantially, and adversely impacted by the
14 Board's actions, which include, but are not limited to, substantial operational constraints on the New
15 Melones Project, loss of available surface water supplies for New Melones Project purposes,
16 including CVP water service contracts, and involuntary dedication of federal reservoir space for
17 Board purposes.

18 6. The New Melones Project is located on the Stanislaus River, approximately sixty
19 miles upstream from the river's confluence with the San Joaquin River. The dam was authorized
20 by Congress under the Flood Control Act of 1944, ch. 665, 58 Stat. 887, and re-authorized by the
21 Flood Control Act of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-874, 76 Stat. 1173. While originally authorized as a
22 flood control project, in reauthorizing the dam, Congress mandated that it become an integral part
23 of the CVP, operated and maintained by the Department of the Interior under the federal
24 I| Reclamation laws. The Flood Control Act of 1962 also included preservation and propagation of
25 fish and wildlife in the New Melones Project, and regulation of streamflow for the purpose of

28 Act of June 17, 1902, ch. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, and Acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto.

1 downstream water quality control as authorized purposes. Id. at 1191. The dam was completed in

2 1979:

3 7. The CVP, operated by Reclamation, is "the nation's largest federal water

4 management project." San Luis & Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. United States, 672 F.3d 676, 681-
5 82 (9th Cir. 2012). The CVP was re-authorized by section 2 of the Act of August 26, 1937, 50 Stat.
6 850.

7 8. The New Melones Project has a storage capacity of approximately 2.4 million acre
8 feet ("af'). Reclamation has entered into contracts, pursuant to the federal Reclamation laws, with
9 water districts for the delivery of water from the New Melones Project for irrigation and municipal
10 and industrial purposes.

11 9. The new flow objectives in the Amended Plan would significantly reduce the amount
12 of water available in New Melones reservoir for meeting congressionally authorized purposes of the
13 New Melones Project, including irrigation, municipal and industrial purposes, power generation,
14 and recreational opportunities at New Melones. The reduced water available for New Melones
15 Project purposes would also impair Reclamation's delivery of water under contracts it presently
16 holds with irrigation and water districts.

17 10. The Court should therefore grant this Petition for a writ of mandate directing the
18 Board to set aside its approval of the Amended Plan and the Final SED.
19 PARTIES

20 11. Petitioner is the United States of America. The U.S. Department of the Interior is a
21| Cabinet-level agency and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is a federal agency within the Department
22 of the Interior. Reclamation operates the New Melones Project as part of the CVP.
23 12. Respondent is the State Water Resources Control Board.
24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this Petition for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to
26 California Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

1094.5 and 1085.3

14. Venue is proper in the County of Sacramento, California, under Code of Civil
3 Procedure sections 393, 395 and 401, because the Board is an agency of the State of California with

4 offices located in Sacramento.

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15. The United States has fully exhausted all administrative remedies. The United States
7 submitted comments to the Board on the Amended Plan. Each of the legal deficiencies asserted in

8 this Petition were raised before the Board by the United States, or by others, prior to the Board's

9 adoption of the Final SED and approval of Amended Plan.
10 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

11 16. On December 12, 2018, the Board approved and adopted the Amended Plan and
12 Final SED. Pursuant to the California Administrative Procedure Act, Government Code section
13 11353, the Board then submitted the Amended Plan, together with the administrative record of the
14 action, to the Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") for approval. On February 25, 2019, OAL
15 approved the Amended Plan and the Board's action to approve the Amended Plan became final
16 upon transmission to the Secretary of State for filing.
17 17. On February 26, 2019, the Board filed a Notice of Decision with the Secretary of the
18 California Natural Resources Agency, which filing commenced the applicable thirty-day statute of
19 limitations under section 21080.5(g) of the Public Resources Code.
20 18. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with California Public Resources Code
21 section 21080.5(g).
22 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT
23 19. Petitioner has complied with California Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
24| providing written notice of commencement of this action to the Board prior to filing this Petition.
25

26

27 Although the United States believes that only section 1085 of the California Code of Civil Procedure and section 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code would apply to its petition
28 for writ of mandate under California law, the government also includes citations to sections 1094.5 and 21168 out of an abundance of caution.

- A true and correct copy of the notice with proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

2 ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

3 20. Petitioner elects to prepare the CEQA administrative record in this proceeding

of 4 pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2). A true and correct copy

5 such notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

6 CONCURRENT FEDERAL COURT ACTION

7 21. Petitioner has concurrently filed a substantially similar action in the United States
8 District Court for the Eastern District of California.

9 22. That action in federal district court preserves Petitioner's preferred choice of a
10 federal forum to resolve its claimsa choice of forum that Congress established by specifying that
11  "civil actions, suits, and proceedings" can be brought in federal court when the United States acts
a 12 as a plaintiff. 28 U.S.C. § 1345.

13 23. This Petition is brought in this Court only out of an abundance of caution in the event
14 that, for any reason, Petitioner's federal suit is not adjudicated on the merits in federal court and to
15 ensure that the state statute of limitations was scrupulously complied with.
16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 24. In 1978 the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
18 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary ("Bay-Delta Plan") pursuant to its water quality
19 authority under California's Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act ("Porter-Cologne Act"), CAL.
20 WATER CODE §§ 13000-16104 (West 2019). The Board subsequently amended the Bay-Delta Plan
21 three times: in 1991, 1995, and 2006.

22 25. In 2009, the Board again initiated proceedings to amend the Bay-Delta Plan. On
23| December 31, 2012, the Board released a Draft SED for public review and comment. On September
24 15, 2016, the Board recirculated a revised draft SED. On July 6, 2018, the Board released its
25 proposed Final SED.

26 26. On December 12, 2018, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2018-0059, approving the
27 Amended Plan. The Amended Plan, among other things, modified the Bay-Delta Plan flow
28 objectives for the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries ("LSJR flow objectives").

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

27. The Amended Plan's LSJR flow objectives include both narrative objectives and
2 numeric flow criteria. The LSJR numeric flow objectives require maintenance of 40% of
unimpaired flow ("UIF"), measured on a seven-day running average, for each of the Stanislaus,

4 Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers from February through June. Final SED, App. K, at 25. The

5 narrative objectives require that the Board "[m]aintain inflow conditions [in the relevant reaches]

6 sufficient to support and maintain the natural production of viable native San Joaquin River water

7 shed fish populations migrating through the Delta.3 Id. at 15.

8 28. The Amended Plan includes "adaptive implementation" measures such as flow

9 shaping and flow shifting. Specifically, the Amended Plan provides that:

10 The percent of unimpaired flow may be adjusted to any value within an adaptive
11 range of 30 to 50% UIF on either a short or long-term basis;
12 • The percent of unimpaired flow for February-June may be managed as a total
13 volume of water and released on an adaptive schedule during that period;
14 As long as at least 30% UIF is provided during the February-June time frame,

15 flows may be shifted from the February- June time frame to other times of year
16 to prevent adverse temperature effects; and

17 The February-June Vernalis base flow requirement may be adjusted on an annual

18 or long-term basis to any value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.
19 Id. at 26-27.

20 29. In Chapter 3 of the Final SED, the Board describes "LSJR Alternative 3" as follows:

21 LSJR Alternative 3 implements the 30-50 percent numeric flow water

22 quality objective range by initially requiring maintenance of 40 percent of unimpaired flows at the confluences of each of the
23 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers with the LSJR from February-June based on a 7-day minimum running average. As
24 described above in Section 3.3.3, Adaptive Implementation, the flow requirements could be adaptively adjusted in the same manner for 25 LSJR Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. The following discussion describes
26 aspects of adaptive implementation as specifically applied to LSJR Alternative 3.
27 1. Adjust the minimum unimpaired flow objective within a range of
28 30 percent to 50 percent.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

3 2. Implementing this method would allow an increase or decrease of up to. 10 percent in the February-June 40 percent minimum

4 unimpaired flow requirement (with a minimum of 30 percent and maximum of 50 percent).

Ur 3. Manage the February-June percent of unimpaired flow as a total

6 volume of water and release the water on an adaptive schedule

7 during that period where scientific information indicates a flow pattern different from that which would occur by tracking the

8 unimpaired flow percentage, would better protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses. Applying this method, the total volume of water

o released would be the same as LSJR Alternative 3 without adaptive implementation; however the rate could vary from the

10 actual (7-day running average) unimpaired flow rate and the volume for each month could vary.

11

12 4. Allow a portion of the total February--June unimpaired flow volume to be held and released after June in order to prevent

13 adverse effects to fisheries, including temperature, that would otherwise result from implementation of the February--June flow

14 requirements. If the requirement is greater than 30 percent but less

15 than 40 percent, the amount of flow that may be released after June is limited to the portion of the unimpaired flow requirement

16 over 30 percent. If the requirement is 40 percent or greater, then 25 percent of the total volume of the flow requirement may be released after June.

17

18 5. The minimum required LSJR base flow objective for February- June of 1,000 cfs, based on a minimum 7-day running average, at

19 Vernalis may be adjusted to a value between 800 and 1,200 cfs.
Final SED at 3-15 to 3-16.
20 30.
21 31. LSJR Alternative 3 is the alternative that the Board adopted as the Amended Plan.

22 The Board's description of LSJR Alternative 3 in Chapter 3 does not mention,

23 describe, or otherwise discuss carryover storage targets, or other reservoir controls, that would

24 directly impact the New Melones Project. Nor does its discussion of the potential impacts on

25 Agricultural Resources (Chapter 11) or Service Providers (Chapter 13) mention such targets or

controls.
26 32.
27 In contrast, the Board's hydrologic modeling used for its impacts analysis assumes

28 the imposition of a precise 700,000 af end-of-September carryover storage target, maximum storage
withdrawals, and that certain drought-refill criteria are met by the New Melones Project.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

33. Elsewhere in the Final SED, the Board explains that "adaptive implementation" of
2 the LSJR flow objectives and carryover storage targets are necessary to prevent adverse
3 environmental impacts of the daily unimpaired flow percentage based on a running average of no
4 more than seven days:

6 Through adaptive implementation, however, a portion of the
February-June flows could be shifted to other months to avoid adverse temperature impacts on fish and wildlife. Without this flow
shifting there could otherwise be insufficient water available to

8 achieve temperature criteria in the summer and fall. In addition, when implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board will

'0 include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other

10 requirements to help ensure that implementation of the flow objectives will not have adverse temperature or other impacts on fish

11 and wildlife or, if feasible, other beneficial uses, and does not impact supplies of water for minimum health and safety needs, particularly

12 during drought periods.

13 Final SED, Executive Summary, at ES-14.

34.
14 In Appendix K to the Final SED, the Board states that

15 When implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board

16 will include minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to help ensure that providing flows to meet the flow

17 objectives will not have. significant adverse temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, on other beneficial uses.
18 Final SED, App. K, at 28 (emphasis added).

19 35. The Board prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
20 required by law in its review and approval of the Amended Plan and Final SED. The Board's
21 adoption of the Amended Plan and Final SED was arbitrary, lacking in evidentiary support, and
22 contrary to law, for the reasons alleged herein.

23 36. The United States has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course
24 of law. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the Board to set aside its
25 adoption of the Amended Plan and Final SED, the Board's decisions will remain in effect in
26 violation of state law.

27 37. The Board's water quality control planning program is a certified regulatory program
28 under section 21080.5 of CEQA. The Board is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for

4 (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Provide Accurate, Stable and Finite Project Description)

38. The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each 5

6 and every allegation in paragraphs through 37 of this Petition.

39.
7 In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its

8 discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.

40.
9 The Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law, because the Final SED fails

10 to provide "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description." Rio Vista Farm Bureau Ctr. V. Cty.

11 of Solano, 7 Cal. 7 Rptr. 2d 307, 314 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1992) (internal citation omitted).

41.
12 The "project description" for purposes of CEQA constitutes the Board's description

13 of LSJR Alternative 3 in the Final SED.

42. The Board violated CEQA because its project description is inconsistent with its 14

15 analysis of the project. In brief, the Board modeled and analyzed the environmental effects of a

16 project that is materially different from that described in the project description.
43. The project description lacks any discussion of reservoir controls, yet, when the 17

18 Board analyzed the impacts of the Amended Plan the Board imposed reservoir controls on the New

19 Melones Project, specifically: (i) a minimum end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000
storage over the irrigation season in order to achieve the 20 af; (ii) maximum allowable draw from

21 700,000 af end-of-September carryover storage target; and (iii) end-of-drought storage refill criteria.

22 Final SED, App. F.1, at F.1-31 to 1-32; F.1-36; Final SED, Master Response 3.2: Surface Water

23 Analyses and Modeling, at 49-50.

44. The Board does not, except in the modeling done for its impacts analysis, identify a 24

25 precise 700,000 af carryover storage target that would apply to the New Melones Project. Final

26 SED, App. F.1, at F.1-36.

45. In other places in the Final SED, the Board states it will "include minimum reservoir 27

28 carryover storage targets or other requirements ... ." Final SED, App. K, at 28. The Board also

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

states that a different target, or other measures, may be adopted following a site-specific analysis.
2 Final SED, Master Response 2.1, at 35; Final SED, Master Response 3.2, at 49, 55.

46. The Board also violated CEQA, because it failed to disclose in the project description
4 that the carryover storage targets and reservoir controls it modeled as part of its impacts analysis

5 were mitigation measures and not part of the project itself.

6 47. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
7 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

8 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion
9 is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law and/or
10 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore should
11. a issue a writ of mandate directing the Board to set aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption

12 of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from implementing them unless and until the Board
13 complies with CEQA.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1085)

16 (Violation of CEQA-Improper Compression of Impacts and Mitigation)
48.
17 The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each

18 and every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 47 of this Petition.

19 49. In adopting the Final SED and the Amended Plan, the Board prejudicially abused its

20 discretion and failed to proceed in a matter required by law.

50.
21 The Final SED violates CEQA by unlawfully compressing the analysis of impacts

22 and mitigation measures, specifically with regard to carryover storage targets, in violation of the

23 principle set forth in Lotus v. Department of Transportation, 167 Cal. Rptr. 3d 382, 388, 391 (Cal.

24 Dist. Ct. App. 2014). In other words, CEQA requires impacts of a project to be disclosed without

25 mitigation and the Board failed to do so here.

51.
26 The carryover storage targets are mitigation measures, and the Board consistently

27 describes the carryover storage targets as mitigation or otherwise indicates that the targets constitute

28 mitigation measures.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

52. The Board included carryover storage targets and other reservoir controls in its
2 impacts analysis in order to mask the true potential environmental impacts of the flow objectives.

53. The Board's conclusions that the project would not adversely impact water
4 temperature and related water quality conditions were based on an analysis that improperly included
mitigation measures, specifically the carryover storage targets, maximum allowable draw from

6 storage, and drought-refill criteria.

7 54. Because mitigation measures are improperly included in the impacts analysis it is
8 impossible for Reclamation or the public to determine the true impact of the Amended Plan,
9  including on river temperatures and related water quality conditions, water supply reliability, flood
10 control and power operations, as well as on recreation at New Melones.

11 55. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
12 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public

13 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion

14 is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law and/or
15 the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore should
16 issue a writ of mandate directing the Board to set aside its approval of the Final SED and adoption
17 of the Amended Plan and enjoin the Board from implementing them unless and until the Board
18 complies with CEQA.

19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1094.5, 1085)

21 (Violation of CEQA-Failure to Adequately Evaluate Impacts)

22 56. The United States realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each

23 and every allegation in paragraphs 1 through 55 of this Petition.

57.
24 The Final SED fails to sufficiently evaluate the Amended Plan's significant or

25 potentially significant impacts on the New Melones Project, in particular, the Amended Plan's

26 impacts on temperature and related water quality conditions.

58.
27 According to the Board's technical analysis, the Amended Plan does not result in

28 detrimental impacts on water temperatures in the tributaries and on the mainstem of the San Joaquin

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

1 River. But that analysis is fundamentally flawed, because the Board incorporated carryover storage
2 and other reservoir controls, i.e., mitigation measures, into its modeling. Doing SO reserved
3 hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water in reservoir storage at New Melones that may otherwise
4 have been used for New Melones Project purposes, and serves to mask the true impacts of the
5 Amended Plan on stream temperatures and related water quality conditions.

6 59. In violation of CEQA, the Board fails to disclose and analyze the impacts the

7 Amended Plan would have on water temperatures and related water quality conditions absent the

8 imposition of an end-of-September carryover storage target of 700,000 af. In violation of CEQA,

9 the Board fails to disclose and analyze the impacts the Amended Plan would have on water
10 temperatures and related water quality conditions without the imposition of maximum allowable
11 draw and drought-refill requirements on the New Melones Project.

12 60. The Board also fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the Amended Plan without
13 carryover storage or other reservoir controls on Reclamation's CVP water service contractors. The
14 impacts of the Amended Plan on Reclamation's CVP contractors will exceed the Board's estimated
15 impacts.

16 61. Imposing reservoir controls on top of the water supply impacts of the 40%
17 unimpaired flow objective will mean that even less water is available from the New Melones Project
18 for congressionally authorized purposes. The Board's impacts analysis assumes that water will be
19 distributed out-of-priority such that junior water rights holders do not absorb the entire shortfall.

20 62. The Board fails to adequately analyze the impacts of the reservoir controls it imposes
21 on the New Melones Project by including them as modeling assumptions in its impacts analysis.

22 63. The Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Amended Plan thereby
23 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public
24 Resources Code, and sections 1094.5 and 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of discretion

Plaintiff and Petitioner, the United States of America, intends to file a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in federal district court in Sacramento as well as a Verified Petition for Writ

Resources Code § 2100 et. seq. by and through the Board's approval and adoption of amendments
to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
Estuary ("Amended Plan") and the related Final Substitute Environmental Document ("Final
SED").

The federal Complaint seeks (a) a declaratory judgment that the Board violated CEQA in its approval and adoption of the Amended Plan and Final SED; (b) a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting the Board from taking any action to implement and/or enforce the Amended Plan unless and until the Board fully complies with the requirements of CEQA; (c) alternatively, for a necessary and appropriate writ in the nature of mandamus issued pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651 directing the Board to (i) vacate and set aside its Final SED and any adoption and approvals thereof; (ii) suspend all activity under its approval of the Amended Plan and Final SED, including action to commence an implementation phase of the Amended Plan until the Board has taken action to bring the Final SED into compliance with CEQA; and (iii) prepare, circulate, and consider

the stay is being requested in conjunction with an application for an alternative
writ).
Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3.1204.
In addition, CCP § 1094.5 (g) and (h) require that proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent accompany an application for a stay. See
subdivisions (g) and (h) for required manner of service.

2. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an ex parte hearing date and time and to determine whether the assigned writ department requires any of the documents

this notification in the declaration regarding notice prepared pursuant to rule 3.1204.
Note: The court prefers at least 48 hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, will accept less notice.
If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the ex parte hearing, file and serve the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing. (See rule 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court).

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 4 of 11

At the ex parte hearing, depending on the nature of the factual and legal issues raised by the stay application and the practical exigencies of the matter, the court will either rule on the stay application immediately or issue the proposed OSC with or without a temporary stay order pending the hearing on the OSC at a specified date and time.

If the court grants a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OsC, the court will sign and file the proposed stay order and set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The court clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the
petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, in the alternative writ.

If the court denies a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court, upon
petitioner's request, will set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The clerk will record the hearing date and in time in the notice of hearing on the petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, in the alternative writ.

Applying for a
Temporary Stay in Traditional Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1085):
Step Action

Follow the statutory and regulatory provisions for obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO), an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued (OSC), and/or a preliminary injunction, set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure
(including but not limited to CCP §§ 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529) and rule 3.1150 of the California Rules of Court. These provisions constitute rules of practice for temporary stays in mandate proceedings brought under CCP § 1085 in the absence of temporary stay provisions specific to such mandate proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

2. When following the statutory and regulatory procedures for obtaining a TRO and/or an
OSC, comply with the ex parte procedures outlined above in "Applying for a Temporary Stay in Administrative Mandate Proceedings" and in rule 3.1201 et seq. of the
California Rules of Court.

3. If no TRO or OSC is sought, notice a motion for a preliminary injunction following the
procedures set forth below in "Bringing Motions Before the Hearing on the Merits"

Note that a temporary stay in proceedings on a petition for a writ of prohibition may be obtained by following the procedures set forth below under "Setting a Hearing on the Merits of a
Petition, (2) Securing issuance of alternative writ." An alternative writ of prohibition, unlike an alternative writ of mandate, stays specified action by the respondent until further order of the court. (See CCP §§ 1087, 1104.)

Bringing Motions before
The Hearing on the
Merits of a Writ Petition:

Motions on the pleadings and other pretrial matters brought in civil actions -- including
motions for change of venue, demurrers, motions to strike, motions to dismiss, discovery
motions, and motions for summary judgment -- may generally be brought in writ
proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 5 of 11

Motions addressing the merits of the petition in whole or in part should be calendared for a hearing at the at same time as the hearing on the merits. Motions directed at resolving
issues preliminary to and distinct from the issues related to the merits of the petition, such
as untimeliness of the petition under an applicable statute of limitations, should be
calendared before the hearing on the merits of a writ petition. The court, in the exercise
of its discretion to control the order of litigation before it, may advance the hearing on a motion to a date before the hearing on the merits or may postpone a motion to the hearing on the merits when. such advancement or postponement will promote the efficient conduct and disposition of the proceeding.

Because a writ petition is usually disposed of by a hearing on the merits which is limited to oral to argument on written briefs and documentary evidence, the usefulness of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in economically disposing of an unmeritorious case or claim is substantially reduced in writ proceedings. Thus, before bringing a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication, counsel should carefully evaluate whether the purpose of the motion can be achieved more directly and completely through a hearing on the merits of the petition.

Step Action

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve a date and time available on the department's calendar for a hearing on the motion. Prior to reserving a date, contact
the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Some
assigned writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

2. Notice the motion in accordance with the civil law and motion procedures in
CCP § 1005 and in compliance with the California Rules of Court, including rules 3.1110 through 3.1113, 3.1115, 3.1116, 3.1300, and 3.1320 through 3.1324.
Comply with the page limits for memoranda set forth in rule 3.1113.

If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the notice of motion must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

Setting a Hearing
on the Merits of a
Writ Petition:

If a hearing on the merits of a writ petition has not been set in conjunction with an ex parte
hearing on an application for a temporary stay, it may be set either by (1) noticing a hearing on the petition or (2) securing issuance of an alternative writ. Note: The court prefers, as more efficient and economical for both itself and the parties,
the procedure of noticing a hearing on the petition.
The date set for a hearing on the merits of a writ petition, whether by notice or alternative writ, should allow the parties to file briefs in accordance with the following schedule established
in Local Rule 2.26(D):

Opening brief: Due 45 days before the hearing
Opposition brief: Due 25 days before the hearing
Reply brief: Due 15 days before the hearing

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 6 of 11

Note that Local Rule 2.26(D) limits the length of opening and opposition briefs to 30 pages and reply briefs to 20 pages instead of the page limits in rule 3.1113 of the California Rules of Court.

The date of the hearing on the merits may be expedited and the briefing schedule shortened upon an application setting forth circumstances warranting an expedited hearing. The application for an expedited hearing may be made orally at a hearing for a
temporary stay or alternative writ or on an ex parte basis in accordance with rule 3.1201 through 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court.

(1) Noticing a hearing on a writ petition

Step Action

1. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for a hearing on the writ petition. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Writ petitions are normally heard on Fridays.

2. Prepare and file a notice of hearing on the writ petition specifying the reserved hearing
date and time. If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the
notice of hearing must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

3. File the notice of hearing either at the civil front counter in Room 102 or by mail addressed to the Civil Division - Room 102, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.

4. Serve a copy of the notice of hearing on respondent(s) and real party(ies) no later than
the time allowed for filing and serving the opening brief. If not previously served, the
writ petition, the Notice of Assignment, and this Guide should also be served no later than the time for filing and serving the opening brief.

(2) Securing issuance of an alternative writ
The alternative writ is an order to show cause that calendars a writ petition for a hearing on the merits. With the exception of an alternative writ of prohibition issued pursuant to
CCP 1104, the alternative writ does not, in and of itself, accomplish a stay or afford any a
affirmative relief.

Note that, with the alternative writ method, two writs may be issued in the proceeding. %
is First, the alternative writ is issued to set a hearing on the merits of the petition. Second, a
peremptory writ may issue after the hearing on the merits.
Step Action

1. Prepare an ex parte application for an alternative writ. Specify "Ex Parte" in the title
of the application.

As provided in rules 3.1201 and 3.1202 of the California Rules of Court and this guide, an ex parte application for an alternative writ includes the following supporting documents and papers:
Endorsed copy of the petition.
Points and authorities and any other supporting documents.
Proposed order directing issuance of alternative writ. Proposed alternative writ with blank spaces for the date and time of a hearing on the petition. (Include a signature block for the clerk, not the judge.) Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3.1204.

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised' 1.1.2014 Page 7 of 11

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for an ex parte hearing on the application for an alternative writ and to determine whether the department requires the papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing.

Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays. Also note that, absent showing of good cause or waiver by the respondent(s) and real party(ies), some departments will not issue an alternative writ unless the writ petition and application for the alternative writ have been served on respondent(s) and real party(ies) at least five days before the ex parte hearing. (See CCP § 1088, requiring service of copy of petition in conjunction with application for alternative writ; CCP § 1107, providing a five-day period for respondent(s) and real party(ies) to respond to a writ petition after receiving service of the petition.)

3. Notify the respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the date and time of the ex parte hearing on the alternative writ pursuant to rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include
the details of this notiflcation in the declaration regarding notice pursuant to rule 3.1204.

Note: The court prefers at least 48 hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, will
accept less notice.

If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in
Step 1 to be filed before the hearing, file and serve on all parties the documents and
papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing.

If the court grants the application for an alternative writ, the court signs and files the proposed order directing issuance of the alternative writ that sets the petition for a hearing on the merits. The clerk then issues the proposed alternative writ with the date and time
of the hearing and provides It to the petitioner after the petitioner has paid the issuance fee in Room 102. The writ must be served upon respondent(s) and real party(ies) in the
a same manner as a summons in a civil action unless the court expressly orders otherwise. (See CCP §§ 1073, 1096.) Once served, the writ must be filed with a proof of service.

Applying for a
Continuance:

After a hearing has been set on motion or on the merits of a petition, it may be
continued only upon approval of the court. If the continuance requires a change in the briefing schedule, such change must also be approved..

Step Action

Present a telephone request for a continuance of the hearing to the clerk in the assigned writ department, including the reason(s) for the continuance and any necessary changes in the briefing schedule. Present the request as far in advance of the scheduled hearing
date as possible.

Upon the court's approval, the clerk will provide available dates on the court's calendar IO which the hearing may be continued.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
INFORMATION PACKAGE
Recognizing that many civil disputes can be resolved without the time and expense of traditional civil litigation, the Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento (Sacramento County Superior Court), strongly encourages parties in civil cases to explore and pursue the use of Alternative Dispute Resolution.
What is Alternative Dispute Resolution?
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is the general term applied to a wide variety of dispute resolution processes which are alternatives to lawsuits. Types of ADR processes include:

Arbitration • Private judging Mini-trials
Mediation • Neutral evaluation
Settlement Conferences Negotiation and hybrids of these
processes

All ADR processes offer a partial or complete alternative to traditional court litigation for resolving disputes. At the present
time, the Sacramento County Superior Court offers Mediation and Arbitration.

What are the advantages of using ADR?
ADR can have a number of advantages over traditional court litigation.

* ADR can save time. Even in a complex case, a dispute can be resolved through ADR in a matter of months or
weeks, while a lawsuit can take years.
ADR can save money. By producing earlier settlements, ADR can save parties and courts money that might otherwise be spent on litigation costs (attorneys fees and court expenses.)

* ADR provides more participation. Parties have more opportunity with ADR to express their own interests and
concerns, while litigation focuses exclusively on the parties' legal rights and responsibilities.

* ADR provides more control and flexibility. Parties can choose the ADR process most appropriate for their
particular situation and that will best serve their particular needs.

* ADR can reduce stress and provide greater satisfaction. ADR encourages cooperation and communication, while
discouraging the adversarial atmosphere found in litigation. Surveys of disputants who have gone through ADR have found that satisfaction with ADR is generally high, especially among those with extensive ADR experience.

Arbitration and Mediation

Although there are many different types of ADR processes, the types most commonly used to resolve disputes in California state courts are Arbitration and Mediation. The Sacramento County Superior Court currently offers pre- screened panelists with experience and training in each of the following areas.
Arbitration. An Arbitrator hears evidence presented by the parties, makes legal rulings, determines facts and makes an Arbitration award. Arbitration awards may be entered as judgments in accordance with the agreement of the parties or, where there is no agreement, in accordance with California statutes. Arbitration can be binding if the parties so agree in writing. If there is no such agreement, either party can reject the Arbitration award and request a trial.

Mediation. Mediation is a voluntary, informal, confidential process in which the Mediator, a neutral third party, facilitates settlement negotiations. The Mediator improves communication by and among the parties, helps parties clarify facts, identify legal issues, explore options and arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute.
Litigants are encouraged to use an ADR process as early in the case as circumstances permit. All appropriate cases will be reviewed for referral to ADR at the Case Management Conference(CMC).

ADR Procedures for the Sacramento County Superior Court
Upon filing complaint or cross-complaint, the plaintiff/cross-complainant must acquire this information package from the Court's Website, http://www.saccourt.ca.gov, or the Superior Court Clerk. Plaintiff is required to include the ADR Information Package when he or she serves the Complaint on the Defendant.

The court's ADR Panel List is available on-line at http://www.saccourt.ca.gov or may be obtained at the Civil Filing Counter at the Gordon D. Schaber Sacramento County Courthouse, 720 Ninth Street, Room 101, Sacramento, CA 95814.

Mediation.
All parties to the dispute may voluntarily agree to submit the case to a neutral Mediator, either through a court- appointment or thröugh a private arrangement. The parties may choose either of the following Mediation choices:
Private Mediation. Parties to a civil action agree to mediate their dispute with a Mediator of their choice without court assistance. The cost of Mediation must be borne by the parties equally unless the parties agree otherwise. Parties will be charged an amount as set by the Mediator (refer to the ADR Panel List for current rates).

Court Mediation. Upon stipulation of the parties, a Mediator and alternate Mediator will be selected from the court-approved list of neutrals (ADR Panel List). The court will confirm the selected Mediator and notice parties by mail.

The Mediator is then is responsible for contacting the parties to confirm a date, time, and place for Mediation. Mediators on the court's approved ADR Panel List have agreed to provide up to three (3) hours of pro-bono Mediation. In the event the Mediation extends beyond 3 hours and parties determine it
would be beneficial to continue the Mediation process; the parties will independently be responsible for compensating the Mediator in an amount as set by the Mediator.
