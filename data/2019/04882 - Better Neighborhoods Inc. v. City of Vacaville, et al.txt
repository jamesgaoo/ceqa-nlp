VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P Plaintiff and Petitioner, Better Neighborhoods, Inc., a California corporation (*Petitioner")

2 alleges against the City of Vacaville (*Vacaville"), and the City Council of the City of Vacaville (the

3 "City Council"), Vacaville and the City Council being collectively referred to as "Respondents" or

4 the "City", as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the decisions by the City in connection with the approvals for a 6

7 project called "Case Dei Vista Apartments" which entails the construction of a 245-unit apartment

8 complex on a vacant 14.41-acre site located at the southwest corner of Allison Drive and Travis Way

9 in the city of Vacaville, Solano County (the "Project").

10 2. Petitioner challenges the City's actions in adopting Resolution No. 2019-,
11 approving the Project and adopting the Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) under the California

12 Environmental Quality Act and the CEQA Guidelines (all of the foregoing, the "Project
13 Approvals").

14 3. Petitioner alleges that the City's actions in giving the Project Approvals violate
15 provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code Section 21000,

16 et seq. ("CEQA").

17 PARTIES

18 4. Petitioner is a California corporation established to help people present their
19 objections and help them shape local developments in pending municipal planning decisions, SO that
20 such community members will be heard equally to that of the city staff and the developer. Petitioner
21 also encourages smart growth and real planning that is consistent with the needs of the residents of

22 the community, to protect the natural environment, to support affordable housing, and to balance the
23 needs for growth while preserving the elements of livability in our cities.

24 5. This action involves public rights and Petitioner's objective in bringing this action is
25 that of an interested citizen seeking to procure enforcement of Respondent's public duties and
26 compliance with applicable state and local laws.

27 6. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in
28 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner will be substantially and adversely affected by

2 impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals described in this petition, and Petitioner is

3 aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of the City as alleged in this petition. Petitioner is

4 suing on its own behalf and on the behalf of others who will be affected in the City of Vacaville and

5 surrounding areas, as well as on behalf of the citizens of the City of Vacaville.

6 7. Respondent, The City of Vacaville, is a charter city, duly organized under the laws of

7 the State of California. The City of Vacaville and/or the Planning Commission of the City of

8 Vacaville is the lead agency under CEQA for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Project.

9 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondent, City
10 Council of the City of Vacaville, is the elected governing body of Vacaville and is the body
11 responsible for promulgating municipal ordinances, resolutions and policies.

12 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the Real Parties in
13 Interest, Guardian Commercial Real Estate, L.P and Rich Alexander (the "Developer") are the
14 owners of (or have the right to purchase) the real property that is the subject of the Project. The
15 Developer is named as a real party pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section
16 21167.6.5, subdivision (a).

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 10. This Court has jurisdiction to consider the CEQA claims under Public Resources

19 Code section 21168.5. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate pursuant to Code of

20 Civil Procedure section 1094.5.

21 11. The Respondent, City of Vacaville, is located in Solano County. Venue is proper in
22 the County of Solano pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 394, subdivision (a).

23 12. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the granting of this writ of mandate,
24 as well as the requested injunctive relief. Petitioner has appeared at the public hearings held in
25 connection with granting the Approvals, and Petitioner has objected to the approval of the Project
26 prior to the City's adoption of the Approvals.

27 13. The City and City Council made various land use and CEQA approvals, including the
28 Project Approvals.

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

14. Petitioner and other interested parties and individuals made oral and written

2 comments on the Project Approvals and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

15. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondent, the

4 City, by objecting to the approval of the Project, as required by the provisions of Public Resources

Code Section 21177.

6 16. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this
petition, including without limitation complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code
Section 21167.5 by mailing (and sending by email) on May 17, 2019 a notice to the City that this

9 action would be filed. A copy of the Intent to Sue letter is attached to this Petition as Exhibit "A."

10 17. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as

11 required by law.

12 18. Petitioner hereby notifies Respondent, the City, to prepare the complete record of

13 Respondents' proceedings relating to this action, subject to all rights and procedures for Petitioner to

14 elect to prepare, itself, the administrative record in this matter after Petitioner receives and reviews

15 Respondents' Preliminary Notification and cost estimate. A copy of the Petitioner's notice of

16 election to prepare the record is filed concurrently with this Petition.

17 19. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ

18 of mandate and thereby orders the City to set aside the Approvals of the Project. In the absence of

19 such remedy, (a) the Project Approvals will remain in effect, in violation of State environmental

20 laws and planning laws; (b) the Project, lacking adequate environmental review, will be in violation

21 of CEQA; and (c) Petitioners and members of the public in the community in which the Project

22 would be developed will suffer irreparable harm.

23 20. There is a significant probability that Petitioners will prevail on the merits in this

24 matter. The Court should issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent
25 injunction ordering Respondents to suspend all activities implementing the Project (including

26 without limitation processing or granting any permits for development of the Project) until the Court,
27 by way of return writ, adjudicates that the City has fully complied with all requirements of the

28 California Environmental Quality Act.

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F FACTS

2 21. The project, "Case Dei Vista Apartments," entails the construction of a 245-unit

3 apartment complex on a vacant 14.41-acre a site located at the southwest corner of Allison Drive and

4 Travis Way in the city of Vacaville, Solano County (the "Project"). The apartment complex would

5 include seven, 3-story buildings 35 feet in height with thirty-five (35) units in each - 28 studio units,

6 98 one-bedroom units, 105 two-bedroom units, and 14 three-bedroom units.

7 22. On April 16, 2019, the Planning Commission of the City held a public hearing to

8 consider the Project. During this hearing, the Planning Commission heard from concerned members

9 of the public with regard to environmental issues and other policy matters relating to the Project,
10 including Petitioner, and together they raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
11 23. The Planning Commission adopted the Project Approvals at the April 16, 2019
12 hearing.

13 24. On April 26, 2019, Petitioner filed an appeal to the City Council, appealing the
14 Planning Commission's approval of the Project.

15 25. The City Council hearing for Petitioner's appeal was scheduled for May 14, 2019 at 6
16 PM.

17 26. On May 13, 2019, a City staff report was made available to Petitioner in which staff

18 recommended that the City Council reject the appeal and approve the Project.
19 27. In response to the staff report, and prior to the City Council hearing on May 14, 2019,

20 Petitioner delivered a letter to the City Council via the City Clerk and to staff, which provided
21 substantial evidence of significant environmental impacts under CEQA that the Project would cause,
22 and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

23 28. On May 14, 2019, the City Council denied Petitioner's appeal, and approved the

24 Project Approvals.

25 29. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing this action;
26 including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 by mailing
27 notice to the City that this action would be filed. (See, Exhibit A).

28

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 30. Petitioner will also serve copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General as

2 required by law.

3 31. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that the City's decisions are in

4 conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those requirements properly executed and

5 the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner and members of the public will be adversely

6 affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions and approvals, and Petitioner and such

7 members of the public are aggrieved by the acts, decisions, and omissions of the City as alleged in
8 this petition and complaint. Petitioner brings this action on its behalf, and on behalf of others who

9 will be affected in the City of Vacaville, as well as citizens of the City of Vacaville.
10 32 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary course of
11 law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner and the public generally will suffer
12 irreparable harm if this court does not issue a writ to compel the City to comply with CEQA and to
13 vacate and set aside the above-described approvals related to the Project.
14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; MND Does Not Comply with CEQA)
16 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs
17 through 32 inclusive in this Petition.

18 34. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare a Mitigated Negative Declaration
19 that complies with the requirements of CEQA. The lead agency must provide for public review and
20 comment on the project and related environmental documentation. A Mitigated Negative
21 Declaration must provide sufficient environmental analysis so that decision makers can intelligently
22 consider environmental impacts that a proposed project may create.

23 35. The City's actions in approving the Project constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion,
24 because the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and the City failed to support its
25 decision to grant the approvals with substantial evidence. Among other failings by the City, the
26 City:

27 a) Should have prepared, circulated for review and comment and adopted an updated
28 MND or environmental impact report that analyzed and mitigated all of the significant
5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environmental impacts raised by Petitioner and other members of the public during the public

2 hearings;

b) Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the significant environmental impacts that

4 will result from the development of the Project, including those mentioned above. In addition, the
City did not study any cumulative impacts, and Petitioner alleges that if an environmental impact

6 report is required, there will also be several cumulatively considerable impacts by the Project on all

7 of the above identified environmental impacts.

C) Improperly deferred the analysis of impacts and the definition of and implementation

9 of mitigation measures;

10 d) Failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and failed to adequately mitigate
11 environmental impacts from the development of the Project; and

12 e Failed to adopt legally adequate findings as required by law with regard to the

13 approvals.

14 36. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned analysis in

15 response to comments received on a mitigated negative declaration, to address (in detail)

16 recommendations and objections raised by comments submitted to the lead agency, and to explain
17 why specific comments and objections, especially those of experts, were not accepted by the lead
18 agency. The City failed to respond adequately to comments made by Petitioner and other members

19 of the public. Moreover, the City Council in denying the appeal failed entirely to consider the
20 substantial evidence of significant impacts presented by Petitioner and other concerned members of

21 the community.

22 37. All of the letters and testimony of Petitioner and other members of the community

23 constitute a fair argument that there is a reasonable probability that the Project will create several

24 significant environmental impacts that should be studied and, if possible, mitigated.

25 38. As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner and the public have been

26 harmed, because, prior to the City's approval of the Project, Petitioner and other members of the

27 public were not fully informed about the significant environmental impacts that could occur from the
28 development of the Project.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

39. Petitioner and members of the public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested

2 in this Petition is not granted by this Court, and the Project is constructed in the absence of an
environmental impact report for the Project that complies with the applicable provisions of CEQA

4 and other applicable laws.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines; Inadequate Findings)

7 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of Paragraphs

8 through 39 inclusive in this Petition.

41. CEQA requires that the findings made by a lead agency in connection with the
10 approval of a project must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA

11 further requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports
12 the conclusions it has made.

13 42. The City violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law,
14 because the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not

15 limited to the following:

16 (a) The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or

17 that the adopted MND would avoid or lessen the Project's effects on the environment;

18 (b) The determination that the Project is not in conflict with the City's general

19 plan; and

20 (c) The proposed mitigation measures would reduce all identified significant

21 impacts to a level that is less than significant.

22 43. As a result of the defects described above, the City prejudicially abused its discretion
23 by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. Therefore, the City also
24 prejudicially abused its discretion by granting approvals for the Project based upon defective and

25 inadequate findings. Accordingly, the City's approval of the Project must be set aside.

26 ///

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

2 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment against the Respondents, and each

3 of them, as follows:

4 1. For a peremptory writ of mandamus directing Respondents, the City and the City

5 Council, to vacate and set aside the approval of the Project, the actions adopting MND, and all

6 related approvals.

7 2. a That this court issue a writ of mandate suspending the authority of Respondents, the

8 City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions and other

9 subdivisions, to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project (including without
10 limitation to any of the Real Party in Interest) until after the City requires Developer to prepare a full
11 environmental impact report to fully analyze all significant environmental impacts from the Project,
12 consistent with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and all other applicable laws, and
13 until a full set of legally adequate findings are made by the City as required by law.
14 3. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction
15 enjoining Respondents, the City and the City Council, their officers, employees, agents, boards,
16 commissions and other subdivisions, as well as the Real Party in Interest, from undertaking any
17 activities, demolition, grading or construction pursuant to the City's approvals as described herein,
18 prior to the City's full compliance with CEQA, the City's municipal code, and other applicable laws.
19 4. For attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5.

20 5. For costs of suit; and

21 6. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
