VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

By this Petition and Complaint ("Petition"), Petitioner and Plaintiff alleges:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Petitioner and plaintiff CYNTHIA MARCOPULOS ("Petitioner") in bringing this

4 action challenges the approval by Respondent CITY OF DALY CITY ("Daly City") of

5 Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 in violation of the California Environmental Quality

6 Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California
Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq., and in violation of the Daly City Municipal

8 Code.

9 2. Daly City prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed as required by law

10 and by granting approvals not supported by substantial evidence, and these violations of law

11 precluded informed public participation and informed decision making.

12 3. Daly City's violations of CEQA and the Daly City Municipal Code, and approval of

13 Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 based thereon, will harm Petitioner and the public, as

14 the public has not been informed of (1) environmental impacts as required by CEQA, (2) the site

15 selection process, (3) all of the applicants' existing telecommunications facilities within city limits,

16 and (4) landscape plans showing vegetation proposed for removal.

17 PARTIES

18 4. Petitioner CYNTHIA MARCOPULOS is a private citizen and resident of San Mateo

19 County. CYNTHIA MARCOPULOS is concerned about Daly City's failure to comply with its own

20 Wireless Communication Facilities ordinance and failure to perform any environmental review in

21 connection with approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865.

22 5. CYNTHIA MARCOPULOS participated in the administrative proceedings by inter

23 alia submitting written and oral comments on the legal inadequacies of Daly City's approval of

15 STATEMENT OF FACTS

16 15. On May 10, 2019, the Daly City Planning Division gave notice that it had granted

17 staff-level approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-10-18-13728 which would allow replacement

18 of a 40-foot flagpole containing a stealth wireless facility with six new antennas, nine new remote

19 radio head units, and six new junction cylinders at a location 30 feet west of the original location. The
20 May 10 notice purported to approve the renewal of Administrative Use Permit AUP09-26.

21 Administrative Use Permit AUP09-26 was approved in 2010 for two panel antennaes.

22 16. Crown Castle's January 2, 2019 SiteSafe Site Compliance Report states that the nine
23 proposed new antennae panel are not part of the existing flagpole. The January 2, 2019 Sitesafe

24 "Antennae Inventory" shows 9 proposed new antennae at the following wattage: 772 watts, 2780

25 watts, 1600 watts, 772 watts, 2780 watts, 1600 watts, 772 watts, 2780 watts, and 1600 watts

26 respectively. This increased capacity is the very purpose of the proposed permit.
27 17. On May 16, 2019, Cynthia Marcopulos requested to inspect the Daly City Planning
28 Department file for Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

A. 1

18. Review of the file for Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 revealed that

2 Daly City had granted approval, made findings and imposed conditions for Administrative Use

3 Permit AUP-10-18-137381, not Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865.

4 19. The Daly City Planning Division's staff-level approval of Administrative Use Permit

5 AUP-10-18-13728 was subject to a ten-day appeal period.

6 20. On May 20, 2019, Cynthia Marcopulos appealed the Daly City Planning Division's

7 staff-level approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-T0-18-13728 to the Daly City City Council.

8 21. Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 will not be on the same site as the

9 structure granted approval by Administrative Use Permit AUP09-26 in 2010. While on the same

10 property, the site for the new structure will be approximately 30 feet away from the original structure

11 and closer to nearby residences.

12 22. Cynthia Marcopulos submitted written comments to Daly City regarding

13 Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 on May 20, 2019, September 5, 2019 and September 9,

14 2019, and submitted oral comments at the Daly City City Council hearing.

15 23. The Daly City staff report, prepared for the September 9, 2019 Daly City City Council

16 hearing, admits that the applicants for Administrative Use Permit AUP-10-18-13728 have not

17 submitted the information required by Daly City Municipal Code 17.39.030 in support of the
18 proposed telecommunication facility. The information not submitted includes (1) a letter explaining

19 the site selection process including information about other sites that were considered and reasons for

20 their rejection, and demonstrating that facilities have been designed to attain the minimum height

21 required from a technological standpoint for the proposed site; (2) a map identifying all of the

22 applicants' existing telecommunications facilities within city limits, including the illustration of the

23 estimated coverage area (search area) for all existing and proposed antenna sites for the applicant
24 and/or service provider; and (3) a landscape plan showlintg existing vegetation, vegetation proposed

25 for removal, and proposed plantings by type, size and location.:

26 24. Daly City Director of Economic and Community Development Tatum Mothershead

27 did not waive, in writing, the submittal requirements of Daly City Municipal Code 17.39.030 for

28 Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

25. On September 9, 2019, the Daly City City Council conducted a hearing of Cynthia

2 Marcopulos' appeal of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865. Daly City purported to

3 approve Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 at that hearing; however Resolution 19-133

4 approving the project was not finalized by Daly City and released to the public until September 17,

5 2019.

6 26. On September 23, 2019, Daly City filed a Notice of Exemption for its approval of
7 Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865.

8 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

9 27. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

10 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law, inter

11 alia, submitting written and oral comments on Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 and its
12 environmental review during the administrative process.

13 28. Petitioner timely raised each and every significant substantive and procedural issue

14 known to her in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177 during the review process for

15 this Project. Petitioner requested that Respondent not approve Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-

16 19-13865 until Respondent fully complied with CEQA and Daly City Municipal Code 17.39.030.
17 Any further exhaustion would be futile.

18 29. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

19 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Daly City prior to filing
20 this petition and complaint. A copy of the prior written notice provided to Respondent, with proof of

21 service thereof, is attached hereto as Exhibit "1".

22 30. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

23 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mäiling 'a copy of the Petition and Complaint to
24 the state Attorney General. A copy of the notice to the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit

25 6273

26 31. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by filing a
27 Request for Preparation of the Administrative Record at the time of filing this Petition and

28 Complaint. The request notified Respondent that Petitioner would elect to prepare the record or that

141:
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1:8

the parties would agree to an alternative method of preparation.

2 32. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

3 sections 1085 (traditional mandate), and 1094.5 (administrative mandate); Public Resource Code

4 section 21168.5 (California Environmental Quality Act); and Article VI, section 10, of the California

5 Constitution.

6 33. Venue is proper in San Mateo County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 395
because Daly City has its office within San Mateo County, the site for Administrative Use Permit

8 AUP-01-19-13865 is located in San Mateo County and because the actions complained of herein

9 occurred within this County.

10 34. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

11 unless this Court enjoins and mandates that Respondent-comply with their duties and set aside the

12 approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865. In the absence of such remedies,

13 Respondent's approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 will remain in effect in

14 violation of CEQA and the Daly City Municipal.Code.

15 35. If Respondent and its agents are not enjoined from implementing Administrative Use

16 Permit AUP-01-19-13865, and from undertaking acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioner will suffer

17 irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the site of Administrative Use

18 Permit AUP-01-19-13865 would be altered without any environmental review, and without any

19 explanation of the site selection process, applicants' existing telecommunications facilities within

20 Daly City city limits, or the landscape plans showing vegetation proposed for removal.

21 36. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the

22 public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and citizens of San

23 Mateo County, the San Francisco Bay Area and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled

24 to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

25 37. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations.

26 38. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Püblic Resources Code section 21168.5 and

27 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 which require that an agency's approval of a
28 Project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Respondent has prejudicially

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

*

1 abused their discretion because Respondent has failed to proceed according to the law, and its

2 approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 is not supported by substantial evidence.

3 STATEMENT OF LAW

4 CEQA

5 39. CEQA is an integral part of every public agency's decision making process, including

6 the issuance of permits Pub. Res. Code § 21006. CEQA was enacted to protect the environment by

7 the establishment of administrative procedures to ensure that long-term protection of the environment

8 shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.
9 40. In order to inform the government and the public about a proposed activity's potential
10 environmental impacts, the normal procedure under CEQA is to prepare an environmental review

11 document. However, when an agency determines  that a project is categorically exempt, no
12 environmental review is conducted.

13 41. Courts have repeatedly held that categorical exemptions are to be narrowly construed

14 in order to "afford the fullest possible environmental protettion.' Don't Cell Our Parks v. City of San
15 Diego (2018) 21 Cal. App. 5th 338; Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water
16 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697. %: M. •

17 42. An EIR serves not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to an

18 apprehensive pubic that it is being protected. CEQA Guideline § 15003, subd. (b).

19 43. A CEQA Class 2 categorical exemption, pursuant to 14 C.C.R. 15302 consists of

20 replacement or reconstruction of existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be

21 located on the same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose and
22 capacity as the structure replaced.

23 Daly City Municipal Code ghttic

24 44. Daly City Municipal Code Section: 47.39 requires that an applicant for an
25 administrative use permit submit, inter alia, the following:

26 • A letter explaining the site selection process including information about other sites
27 that were considered and reasons for their rejection, and demonstrating that facilities have been
28 designed to attain the minimum height required from a technological standpoint for the proposed site;

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

A letter to the director stating that the system, including the antennas and associated

2 base transceiver stations, conforms to the radio-frequency radiation emission standards adopted by

3 the FCC;

4 • The maintenance program for the facility;

5 Noise/acoustical information for the base transceiver stations and associated

6 equipment such as air conditioning units;

7 A map identifying all of the applicants' existing telecommunications facilities within

8 Daly City city limits, including an illustration of the estimated coverage area (search area) for all

9 existing and proposed antenna sites for the applicant and/or service provider;

10 A landscape plan showing existing vegetation, vegetation proposed for removal, and

11 proposed plantings by type, size and location. hey l:

12 45. Daly City Code 17.39.050 provides: 1:

13 Location preference for wireless communications facilities should be given to publicly

14 owned structures, co-location sites, and industrial or commercial sites. New wireless

15 communications facilities should avoid sites located within or near residential areas unless the

16 application includes information sufficient to demonstrate: the location and type of preferred

17 sites which exist within the proposed or technically feasible coverage area; that good faith

18 efforts and measures were taken by the carrier to secure the preferred location sites; specific

19 reasons why such efforts and measures were unsuccessful; and why the location of the

20 proposed facility site is essential to meet the service deniands of the applicant.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF CEQA (Pub. Res. Code, $ 21000 et seg.)

22 46. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set

23 forth.

24 47. The project is inconsistent with CEQA Categorical Exemption 15302.

25 48. Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 involves an increase in structure

26 capacity as it includes installation of six new antennas, nine new remote radio head units, and six new
27 junction cylinders. This does not constitute negligible or no expansion of capacity.
28 49. With the addition of six new antennas, nine new remote radio head units, and six new

5 property, the site for the new structure will be approximately 30 feet away from the original structure

6 and closer to nearby residences.

7 51. By approving Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 without performing any

8 environmental review and finding the Permit consistent with CEQA Categorical Exemption 15302,
9 Daly City failed to proceed as required by law, its approval and findings were not supported by
10 substantial evidence, and therefore Daly City prejudicially abused its discretion.

12 52. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set
13 forth.

14 53. Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 is not in compliance with Daly City

6 61. By approving Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 without requiring the

7 applicants to comply with Daly City Municipal Codé 17.39.030, Daly City failed to proceed as

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Action (Pub. Resources Code
§ 21167.5)

This letter provides written notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that Cynthia Marcopulos will filé suit on or before October 22, 2019 challenging the City of Daly City's approval of Administrative Use Permit AUP-01-19-13865 ("Permit"). The grounds for this lawsuit include, inter alia, (1) that Daly City has violated CEQA by avoiding environmental review and processing the Permit pursuant to CEQA Categorical Exemption 15302, and (2) that the Permit violates Daly City Municipal Code section 17.39 submission requirements.
Cynthia Marcopulos is willing to discuss terms to settle this dispute that could resolve this matter. Cynthia Marcopulos presents the following settlement demand, in the form of principles that would have to be embodied in a formal written settlement agreement:

1. Daly City rescinds its approval of the Permit and its finding that the Permit is consistent with CEQA Categorical Exemption 15302 and its finding that the Permit complies with Daly City Municipal Code section 17.39.
2. Daly City and the Project Applicants amend the Permit to keep the new wireless facility in the same location as the existing flagpole facility. 3. Daly City and the Project Applicahts amend the Permit to reduce the number of antennas, radio head units and junction cylinders.
This letter and Cynthia Marcopulos' prior participation in Daly City's administrative process satisfy Cynthia Marcopulos' obligations under California

Civil Code of Procedure section 1021.5, as interpreted by the California Supreme Court in Graham v. DaimlerChrysler (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577.
