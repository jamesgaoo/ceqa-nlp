Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 Introduction

1. Protect Our Plaza, an unincorporated association, brings this mandamus
action in the public interest to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

6 (CEQA) regarding the expansion of the Cheese Factory operations on the historic
Sonoma Plaza National Historic District, also designated as a National Historic

8 |Landmark, without environmental review.

20 Protect Our Plaza challenges the discretionary decision made by the Sonoma

21

22 City Council to vest a 15-year old use permit and overturn the Planning Commission's

23 careful deliberation and determination that the old permit had long been abandoned

24 and had expired, pursuant to Chapter 19.56.040 of the Sonoma Municipal Code, and

25 that a new project application would be necessary.

26

27 The City Council also erred in reinterpreting the 2004 use permit to allow multi-

28 tenant restaurant uses to be built instead of the development of a retail shopping center

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 as proposed by the 2004 permit. The testimony of Planning Commissioners and City

2 Council Members confirm that the interpretation of the permit to allow restaurant uses
3

4 has the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or

5 a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, thus constituting

6 a project under CEQA that requires environmental review be conducted. Related

7 environmental impacts of this change of use include direct, indirect, and cumulative

8 impacts to, inter alia: parking and traffic on the congested National Historic Plaza
9

10 Landmark and surrounding streets, pedestrian safety, impacts to historic resources,

11 and greenhouse gases.

12 Resurrecting an old permit to allow new uses in a sensitive setting presented

13 unusual circumstances that perplexed both the Planning Commission and City Council
14

15 members. Mayor Amy Harrington stated that a much more straightforward approach

16 to resurrecting the 2004 use permit, was to present a new application to planning so

17 that the City could be apprised of what is being proposed; trying to "shoehorn" multi-

18 tenant food businesses into a 15 year-old permit for use identified as retail does not

19

20 work. The Mayor stated she would love to see an Oxbow type development in this

21 location but that cannot be achieved through the resurrection of the 2004 permit.

22 Planning Commission members stated similarly - any multi-tenant restaurant use

23 cannot be said to be encompassed via the 2004 permit, whether it had vested or not.

24

25 Council Member Rachel Hundley concluded that you can't have a 10-year lapse

26 without doing anything and have a valid permit.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 The City Council's findings and later actions are also inconsistent and unlawful.

2 The City Council resolution adopting the project claimed the City's actions relative to

3

4 the 2004 Use Permit were ministerial and did not constitute a project under CEQA.

5 After the City Council's final hearing on the matter, the City adopted a Notice of

6 Exemption for a categorical exemption under CEQA Guideline 15301, never considered

7 in the extensive testimony before the Planning Commission and City Council. Since

8 categorical exemptions are only applicable to discretionary projects subject to CEQA,

10 the City's action adopting the categorical exemption nullifies their prior claims that

11 their action was ministerial and not project under CEQA.

12 While there is no requirement under CEQA for an agency to provide notice or

13 hold a hearing before adopting categorical exemption, the undeniable result is that
14

15 the City has not provided any rationale or bases for the adoption of the claimed

16 categorical exemption - the City did not state how the project fits within the scope of

17 the exemption or consider whether exceptions apply. Furthermore, since there was no

18 opportunity to be heard, Protect Our Plaza was relieved from its exhaustion
19

20 requirement. Providing notice and a hearing would have allowed citizens to put the

21 City on notice of the legal deficiencies of its actions.

22 The project does not qualify for a categorical exemption for several reasons. The

23 project exceeds the scope of the claimed exemption for an Existing Facility exemption
24

25 under CEQA Guidelines section 15031 because the area in which the project is located

26 is environmentally sensitive and the project poses greater than "negligible or no

27 expansion" of use, as defined by the exemption. Furthermore, exceptions to the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

exemption apply, under CEQA Guidelines sections 15300.2 (a) location within a

2 sensitive resource, (b) cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same type in the
same place are significant over time (c) significant environmental effects due to 4

5 unusual circumstances, inter alia, site-specific and cumulative impacts relating to traffic,

6 parking, cultural and historic resources, and pedestrian safety, among other impacts
7 supported by evidence in the administrative record; and (f) direct and indirect impacts
8 to historic resources.
9

10 Since the project is outside the scope of the claimed exemption, the fair argument

11 standard applies to the issue of whether an EIR must be prepared. As a matter of law

12 "an EIR is required 'whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial
13

14 evidence that [a] project may have significant environmental impact.' [citation]."

15 (Friends of the San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo Community College District (2016) 1 Cal.

22 905; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, at 309.)

23 Protect Our Plaza, thus respectfully asks for this Court's peremptory writ to set
24 aside the Council's decision and order the
25 City to prepare an EIR for the Cheese

26 Factory expansion.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Jurisdiction

2 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and
3 CCP section 1094.5. The parties and site are located in the
4 County of Sonoma.

5 Parties

6 3. Petitioner, Protect Our Plaza, is an unincorporated association formed in

7 the public interest in 2018. Protect Our Plaza's purpose is to protect the historic nature
8 and character of the Sonoma Plaza. Members of Protect Our Plaza include community 9

10 residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the Plaza's eminently

11 important historical resources. Protect Our Plaza brings this petition on behalf of all

12 others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and brought before this
13 Court as petitioners. Protect Our Plaza objected to the
14 project and the City's actions

15 regarding vesting and exhausted administrative remedies. Since the City of Sonoma

16 adopted a categorical exemption after the last hearing on the project and did not

17 conduct a hearing on the exemption or provide any notice of its intention to adopt a
18 categorical exemption, Protect Our Plaza had no legal duty to exhaust remedies on this
19
issue.
20

21 4. Respondents, City of Sonoma and the City Council of Sonoma

22 (collectively, the "City") is the governmental body that approved the action that would

23 make way for the Cheese Factory expansion and adopted the categorical exemption
24 under CEQA.

7 names and capacities are currently unknown to Protect Our Plaza. If and when their

8 true names and capacities are known, Protect Our Plaza will amend this petition to
9

10 assert them. If any individual is deemed not an indispensable party, Protect Our Plaza

11 will consider dismissing them from the litigation.

12 7. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

13 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

14

15 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

16 General Allegations

17 8. The Cheese Factory is located at 2 West Spain Street and is a designated

18 historic resource eligible for listing on the California Register of Historic Places; the

19 Cheese Factory is located on the Sonoma Plaza National Historic District which is also
20

21 designated a as a National Historic Landmark. The Plaza includes these iconic National

22 Landmarks: Bear Flag Monument, Blue Wing Inn, Mission San Francisco Solano de

23 Sonoma, Presidio of Sonoma (Sonoma Barracks), and the Swiss Hotel. The National

24 Historic Landmarks program is the highest level of designation for historic and
25

26 cultural resources. It is reserved for buildings, sites, structures, objects, and districts

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 that demonstrate exceptional value, quality, and significance in illustrating the

2 heritage of the United States.

3 9. In 2004, the Planning Commission approved a use permit with conditions
4

5 of approval to convert the use of the Cheese Factory building to retail use and

6 subdivide the building into nine tenant spaces for a multi-tenant retail center. The May

7 2004 City staff report confirms the intent of the permit was to "devote the entire

8 building to retail use ...' Based on staff's calculations the operation would result in a
9

10 deficit of 9 parking spaces.

11 10. In 2014-2015 and 2018, the Viviani Trust applied for and received

12 discretionary use permits to expand the operations of the Cheese Factory that were not

13 based upon the 2004 use permit. The 2014/ 2015 project application was never acted
14

15 upon and expired. The 2018 project application entailed the adoption of a mitigated

16 negative declaration and was appealed to the Council due to unaddressed impacts to

17 historic resources, among other things, but the appeal was not calendared to be heard

18 for over a year.
19
11.
20 In November of 2018, during the pendency of the appeal of the 2018

21 project, the City brought the 2004 permit to the Trust's attention. Shortly, thereafter,

22 the Trust advanced a new theory claiming that the Trust had vested rights to proceed

23 with another project at the same location under the 2004 permit. The Trust asked the

24 Planning Commission to make a determination as to whether the 2004 permit had
25

26 expired or was still valid.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

12. The Planning Commission considered the matter at the February 21, 2019
and 25, 2019 public hearings. Planning Commissioners objected to the unusual nature

3 of resurrecting a 15 year-old permit while another project was also pending on appeal
4
with the City at the same location. Commissioners also objected to the failure of the

6 Trust to divulge that it had already been working with a developer a well known for

7 advancing Oxbow type multi-tenant restaurant developments, after having repeatedly

B asked what type of restaurant uses the Trust had planned, and had been told by the
9

10 Trust and its representatives that there were no current plans.

11 13. In February 2019, the Planning Commission adopted Resolution #3-2019,

12 applying Chapter 19.56 of the Sonoma Municipal Code, relative to the abandonment

13 and expiration of a use permit, and determined that the 2004 use permit had expired
14

15 before a building permit related to the creation of multiple tenant spaces to establish a

16 commercial shopping center had issued, and making six findings: (1) the applicant did

17 not submit timely building permit applications to establish multiple tenant spaces

18 before the use expired in May of 2005; (2) the permits were not related to the work
19 authorized by the use permit to create spaces for multiple tenants as a commercial
20

21 retail shopping center; (3) the applicant has not applied for or received any permits or

22 approvals for improvements as shown on the conceptual plans in 2004; (4) the

23 applicant has not established more than an original use, the Cheese Factory retail and
24 deli use; (5) the applicant has not created the main structural elements of a retail
25

26 shopping center with links to the Plaza and streets to the common parking areas; and

27 (6) the building permits have only demonstrated improvements and expansion to the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

existing space and have not created capacity with respect to the occupancy of

2 individual tenant spaces.

3 14. In March 2019, the Viviani Trust appealed the Planning Commission's
4

5 findings to the City Council, claiming that the permit had not expired.

6 15. In June 2019, the Trust withdrew the 2018 project application.

7 16. In June and August, 2019, the Council held public hearing hearings to

8 consider the Trust's appeal. In August 2019, counsel for Protect Our Plaza submitted
9

10 an extensive letter requesting the Council uphold the Planning Commission's

11 determination regarding the abandonment and expiration of the 2004 permit and

12 informing the Council that their counsel had used the wrong criteria to assess the

13 validity of the old permit; evidence of a single tenant's improvements did not provide
14 evidence of the intention to build out a multi-tenant retail use, which was a central
15

16 premise of the 2004 permit. And even if the permit was considered valid, the project

17 would vest as allowing the expansion of retail uses, consistent with the stated

18 intention of the 2004 permit. Protect Our Plaza also laid out the reasons why the City's
19

20 proposed action was a discretionary decision subject to CEQA, not a ministerial action

21 as proposed by the Council, and urged the Council to study the environmental effects

22 of expanded restaurant uses, not contemplated by the 2004 permit. Considering the

23 sensitive setting of the project that includes the National Historic Plaza Landmark and
24 the Sonoma Barracks, and due to conceded impacts relative to parking and traffic on
25

26 the chronically congested Plaza, as well as pedestrian safety and greenhouse gases

27 impacts, environmental review was required to be conducted.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 Mayor Harrington and Council Member Hundley, like the Planning

2 Commissioners before them, stated that the use authorized by the 2004 permit was for

3 the expansion of retail use, not restaurant use, and pressed the Trust for specifics
4

5 about what kinds of restaurant uses would be proposed. They reminded the Trust that

6 the 2004 permit resulted in a deficit of parking places on a now greatly congested

7 Plaza and the new intensified uses would result in greater impacts. Mayor Harrington

8 and Council Member Hundley urged the Trust to relinquish their efforts to resurrect
9

10 the 2004 permit and put forward a clear project application that could be fairly

11 reviewed. Further, no seats inside the Cheese Factory building had ever been

12 approved, therefore, to adopt certain number of seats, as the Council proposed,

13 would exceed the scope of the 2004 permit and constitute a discretionary decision to
14

15 approve an expanded use. When asked by the Council what the Trust thought the

16 revival of the permit would entitle them to do, counsel for the Trust proclaimed that it

17 was their understanding that they would be allowed to develop "food, deli,

18 restaurant, you name it" under the revived permit.

19

20 Protect Our Plaza pointed out that the City's findings claiming that its

21 decision was not a project under CEQA, and even if it were considered to be a project,

22 "no impacts have been identified that have not already been analyzed" - was

23 nonsensical since no environmental review had ever been conducted for the expansion of the

24

25 Cheese Factory under the 2004 permit. In 2004, the permit was supposedly deemed

26 exempt from environmental eview even though no Notice of Exemption was ever

27 filed and no document named a categorical exemption accompanied any of the staff

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

reports or the final resolution. Circumstances have clearly changed in the 15-year time

2 frame; traffic, parking, circulation, and pedestrian problems have all intensified in the

3 interim period.
4

5 Protect our Plaza explained that pursuant to CEQA, all phases of a project

6 must be considered as the "whole" action; redefining the 2004 permit outside of its
original parameters is the first step in allowing multiple projects to proceed and

3 therefore it must be accompanied by environmental review; and a fair argument of
9

10 impacts has been established requiring preparation of an EIR.

11 17. The Council approved the project via resolution on August 19, 2019,

12 reversing the Planning Commission's decision; finding that the 2004 Use Permit had

13 vested; that the decision was a ministerial action not subject to CEQA; and setting
14

15 parameters on the nature of the project, including the number of seats allowed for

16 restaurant uses.

17 18. Thereafter, on August 26, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Exemption

18 (NOE) claiming that the City's action was ministerial and not a project under CEQA
19

20 while also filing a categorical exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15301

21 applicable to discretionary projects subject to CEQA. The City did not provide notice or

22 an opportunity to be heard regarding their intention to adopt a categorical exemption,

23 therefore citizens had no duty to exhaust administrative remedies related to the

24 categorical exemption.
25
19.
26 The categorical exemption was unlawfully adopted for the following

27 reasons: the project exceeds the scope of the exemption because the area in which the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

project is located is environmentally sensitive and the project poses greater than
"negligible or no expansion" of use, as defined by the exemption. And exceptions to

3

4 the exemption apply, under CEQA Guidelines sections 15300.2 (a) location within a

5 sensitive resource; (b) cumulative impacts of successive projects of the same type in the

6 same place are significant over time; (c) significant environmental effects due to

7 unusual circumstances, inter alia, site-specific and cumulative impacts relating to traffic,

8 parking, cultural and historic resources, pedestrian safety, and greenhouse gases,
9

10 among other impacts supported by evidence in the administrative record; and (f) direct

11 and indirect impacts to historic resources.

12 20. This action is timely filed within the statutory 35 days from the date of the

13 filing of the NOE.
14
21.
15 Protect Our Plaza has served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney

16 General.

17 22. Protect Our Plaza has no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief

18 prayed for in this Petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and
19

20 irreversible environmental impacts to the Sonoma environment and residents. The City

21 has the ability to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

22 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

23 23. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
24 24.
25 The City abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

26 |law in approving the Cheese Factory expansion project. According to proof following

27 certification of the administrative record of proceedings:

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 13

a. The City unlawfully adopted a project as ministerial when the record

2 shows that the City's actions were discretionary and subject to CEQA;
b. The City unlawfully claimed their actions did not constitute a project
under CEQA where the record shows the City's action relative to the 2004

6 Use Permit was discretionary and has a potential for resulting in either a
direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
indirect physical change in the environment, which constitutes a project
9
under CEQA;
10

11 c. The City failed to consider the 'whole' action and unlawfully engaged in

12 'piecemealing' environmental review when it allowed development to go

13 forward under the 2004 Use Permit, which failed to consider the
14

15 environmental impacts of the foreseeable expansion of the Cheese Factory;

16 d. The City unlawfully approved a project under CEQA categorical

17 exemption section 15301, for Existing Facilities, when the project exceeds

18 the scope of the exemption because the area in which the project is located
19 is environmentally sensitive and the project poses greater than "negligible
20

21 or no expansion" of use, as defined by the exemption.

22 e. The City unlawfully approved a project outside the scope of the claimed

23 exemption and failed to conduct environmental review when the record
24 contains substantial evidence of a fair argument of potentially significant
25

26 impacts such that an EIR is required to be prepared due to, inter alia: site-

27 specific and cumulative impacts relating to traffic, parking, cultural and

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 14

1 historic resources, and greenhouse gasses, among other impacts supported
by evidence in the administrative record;
f. The City unlawfully approved a project under a categorical exemption
when exceptions to the exemption apply, under CEQA Guidelines sections
15300.2 (a) location within a sensitive resource, (b) cumulative impacts of
successive projects of the same type in the same place are significant over

8 time (c) significant environmental effects due to unusual circumstances,
9

10 inter alia, site-specific and cumulative impacts relating to traffic, parking,

11 cultural and historic resources, among other impacts supported by

12 evidence in the administrative record; and (f) direct and indirect impacts to

13 historic resources;
14

15 gโข The City's findings and determinations are not supported by substantial

16 evidence and the City failed to make findings that the project fit within the

17 scope of the claimed categorical exemption and no exceptions apply.

18 WHEREFORE, Protect Our Plaza prays:
19 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City to set
20

21 aside and void their approval relating to the 2004 Use Permit for the

22 Cheese Factory and to refrain from further consideration of the project

23 until it fully complies with CEQA by preparing an EIR that fully considers

24 the project's direct, indirect, and cumulatively significant impacts and
25

26 proposes mitigation measures and alternatives to the project that

27 substantially lessen those impacts;

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 15

1 2. That the Court enjoin the City and real parties in interest and their
employees and agents from all construction and pre-construction activities
relating to the implementation of the 2004 Use Permit while this petition is
pending;

3. For Protect Our Plaza's costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5; and

8 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
