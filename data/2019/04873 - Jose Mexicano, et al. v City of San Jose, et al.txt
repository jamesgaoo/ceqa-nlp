27 mandate directed to Respondents and Defendants City of San Jose, City Council of the City of San

28 Jose, and Rosalynn Hughey, Planning Director of the City of San Jose (collectively "Respondents" or

-

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 "City") and Real Party in Interest Asset Gas SC, Inc. ("Real Party" or "Applicant"), and by this

2 verified petition and complaint, allege as follows:

3 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

4 approving the AC by Marriott Hotel- West San Jose Project ("Project") without first preparing an

5 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") in accordance with the requirements of the California

6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code coR 21000 et seq., and the CEQA

7 Guidelines, title 14, California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.

2. The Project includes the demolition of an existing gas station and the construction of
9 an approximately 78,850 square feet hotel including 168 guest rooms, a restaurant and four floors of

10 underground parking for 100 vehicles.

11 3. Petitioners submitted evidence from experts presenting a fair argument that the

12 proposed Project may have significant environmental effects on air quality and greenhouse gas

13 ("GHG") emissions and that the City of San Jose's Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration

14 ("IS/MND") is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents are in violation of CEQA by

15 substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite

16 that the Project may have significant environmental effects.

17 4. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in adopting the IS/MND and failing

18 to prepare an EIR. Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by relying upon

19 an IS/MND that is not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the approval of the Project

20 should be set aside and Respondents should be required to prepare an EIR and fully comply with

21 CEQA prior to considering whether to approve the Project.

22 PARTIES

23 5. Petitioner JOSÉ MEXICANO is a resident of San Jose. Mr. Mexicano frequently

24 visits the neighborhood adjacent to the Project site. Mr. Mexicano is interested in ensuring that the

25 City and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure that all environmental impacts are mitigated

26 to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Mexicano made oral comments to the City Council objecting to

27 the Project's compliance with CEQA.

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 6. Petitioner ALEJANDRO MARTINEZ is a resident of San Jose. Mr. Martinez

2 frequently visits the area adjacent to the Project site. Mr. Martinez is interested in ensuring that the

3 City and Real Party fully comply with CEQA to ensure that all environmental impacts are mitigated

4 to the maximum extent feasible. Mr. Martinez made oral comments to the City Council objecting to

5 the Project's compliance with CEQA.

6 7. Petitioner LABORERS INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA,

7 LOCAL UNION 270 ("Local 270") is a labor organization that has approximately 4,300 members

8 residing in the County of Santa Clara. Local 270 has more than 3,400 members who live in the City

9 of San Jose. Local 270's purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe

10 workplace environments; working to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its

11 members' quality of life when off the job; advocating to assure its members access to safe, healthful,

12 productive, and aesthetically and culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting

13 environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects on behalf of its members, including

14 providing comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects;

15 advocating for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve balance between

16 employment, the human population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide

17 sharing of life's amenities by its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to

18 preserve important historic, cultural, and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain,

19 wherever possible, an environment that supports diversity and variety of individual choice;

20 advocating on behalf of its members for programs, policies, and development projects that promote

21 not only good jobs but also a healthy natural environment and working environment, including

22 advocating for changes to proposed projects and policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and

23 water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce

24 global warming impacts, and assure compliance with applicable land use ordinances; and working to

25 attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation, risk to health or

26 safety, or other undesirable or unintended consequences.

27 8. Local 270 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'

28 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

3

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance

2 and prosecution of this action will confer substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

3 from the environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown

4 due to the lack of a full environmental analysis. Local 270 and its members submitted comments to

5 the City's Planning Director and the City Council objecting to and commenting on the Project and its

6 unsupported and inadequate environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

7 9. Respondent CITY OF SAN JOSE is the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of

8 Public Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental

9 review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

10 10. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE is the governing body of

11 the City and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the IS/MND and the

12 Project. On January 8, 2019, the City Council approved the Project, including the MND and the Site

13 Development Permit.

14 11. Respondent and Defendant ROSALYNN HUGHEY is the Planning Director of the

15 Planning, Building and Code Enforcement Department of the City of San Jose. The Planning Director

16 is the initial decision-making body for most Development Permits and various minor and
17 administrative types of permits in the City. On November 28, 2018, Sylvia Do, Acting Deputy

18 Director, on behalf of Respondent Hughey, held a hearing to consider the IS/MND and the Site

19 Development Permit, and adopted both on that date.

20 12. Real Party in Interest ASSET GAS SC, INC., is a corporation organized under the

21 laws of the State of Wyoming and doing business as a registered foreign corporation in California.

22 Asset Gas SC, Inc., is the applicant for the Project.

23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

24 13. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section

25 1085) and Public Resources Code sections 21168 (alternatively section 21168.5) and 21168.9, this

26 Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to approve the

27 Project without proper CEQA review. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant

28 to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et

4

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 seq.

2 14. is Venue is proper in this Court because this action challenges acts done by a public

3 agency, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in the County of Santa

4 Clara. Venue also is proper in this Court because the City is located in the County of Santa Clara.

5 15. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

6 21167.5 by serving on January 22, 2019 a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this

7 action against Respondents. A copy of the written notice is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

8 16. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

9 21167.6 by filing a notice of their election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings

10 relating to this action. A copy of the notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
11 17. Petitioners will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
12 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney General.

13 18. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

14 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

15 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

16 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to prepare an EIR or

17 other legally adequate CEQA document for the Project and enjoins the City from approving the

18 Project pending completion of legally adequate CEQA review. In the absence of such remedies,

19 Respondents' decision will remain in violation of state law.

20 LEGAL BACKGROUND

21 20. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

22 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

23 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1)). Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce

24 environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all

25 feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3)).

26 21. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

27 proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Resources Code, §

28 21100.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of

5

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

I Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124

2 Cal.App.4th 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the

3 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological

4 points of no return." (Bakersfield Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a

5 "document of accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency

6 has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights
Improvements Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR

8 process "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors,
9 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.)

10 22. An EIR is required if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before

11 the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Resources

12 Code, § 21080(d); see also Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.) This evidentiary standard is

13 generally referred to as the "fair argument" standard.

14 23. "Significant environmental effect" is defined very broadly as "a substantial or

15 potentially substantial adverse change in the environment.3 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068; see also

16 CEQA Guidelines, § 15382.) An effect on the environment need not be "momentous" to meet the

17 CEQA test for significance; it is enough that the impacts are "not trivial." (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

18 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83.)

19 24. Under the "fair argument" standard, an EIR is required if any substantial evidence in

20 the record indicates that a project may have an adverse environmental effect-even if contrary
21 •  evidence exists to support the agency's decision. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1); Pocket

22 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 931; Stanislaus Audubon Society v. County of Stanislaus (1995) 33

23 Cal.App.4th 144, 150-15; Quail Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. v. City of Encinitas (1994) 29

24 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602.) The "fair argument" standard creates a "low threshold" favoring
25 environmental review through an EIR rather than through issuance of negative declarations or notices

26 of exemption from CEQA. (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.) "[I]t is a question of law,

27 not fact, whether fair argument exists, and the courts owe no deference to the lead agency's

28

6

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 determination. Review is de novo, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental

2 review." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 928.)

3 25. "[U]nder CEQA, the lead agency bears a burden to investigate potential environmental

4 impacts. 'If the local agency has failed to study an area of possible environmental impact, a fair

5 argument may be based on the limited facts in the record. Deficiencies in the record may actually

6 enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider range of inferences.""*

7 (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 311. County Sanitation Dist. No. 2

8 V. County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544.)

9 26. In limited circumstances, an agency may avoid preparing an EIR by issuing a negative

10 declaration but only if there is not even a "fair argument" that the project will have a significant
11 environmental effect. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15371 ["CEQA Guidelines"]; Pub. Resources Code, §§

12 21100, 21064.) Since "[t]he adoption of a negative declaration has terminal effect on the

13 environmental review process," by allowing the agency "to dispense with the duty [to prepare an

14 EIR]," negative declarations are allowed only in cases where "the proposed project will not affect the
15 environment at all." (Citizens of Lake Murray v. San Diego (1989) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440.) A

16 mitigated negative declaration is proper only if the project revisions would avoid or mitigate the
17 potentially significant effects identified in the initial study "to a point where clearly no significant

18 effect on the environment would occur, and….there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole

19 record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the

20 environment." (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21064.5 and 21080(c)(2); Mejia v. City of Los Angeles

21 (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322, 331.) In that context, "may" means a reasonable possibility of a

22 significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21082.2(a), 21100, 21151(a); Pocket

23 Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927; League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic Resources v.

24 City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 904-905.)

25 27. As a matter of law, "substantial evidence includes . . . expert opinion." (Pub.

26 Resources Code, § 21080(e)(1); CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(5).) CEQA Guidelines demand that

27 where experts have presented conflicting evidence on the extent of the environmental effects of a

28 project, the agency must consider the environmental effects to be significant and prepare an EIR.

l (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f)(5); Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e)(1); Pocket Protectors,124 Cal.App.4th

2 at 935.)

3 28. A negative declaration must accurately describe the proposed project and its
environmental setting. (Christward Ministry v. Superior Court (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 180; CEQA

5 Guidelines §15071(a).) The initial study must "provide documentation of the factual basis for the

6 finding in a Negative Declaration that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment."
(CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c)(5).)
STATEMENT OF FACTS

29. The Project is proposed to be located on a 0.42-gross-acre site, in the CG Commercial

10 General Zoning District located at the southeast corner of Stevens Creek Boulevard and Stern

11 Avenue in San Jose.

12 30. The Project proposes to demolish an existing gas station and construct an
13 approximately 78,850 square feet hotel including 168 guest rooms, a restaurant and four floors of
14 underground parking for 100 vehicles.

15 31. Experts who have examined the Project have found that there may be significant

16 environmental effects.

17 The IS/MND's Insufficient Indoor Air Quality Analysis

18 32. Certified Industrial Hygienist, Francis "Bud" Offermann, PE, CIH, conducted a

19 review of the Project, the IS/MND and relevant appendices regarding the Project's indoor air

20 emissions. Mr. Offermann is one of the world's leading experts on indoor air quality and has

21 published extensively on the topic. He concluded that it is likely that the Project will expose future

22 workers employed at the hotel to significant impacts related to indoor air quality, and in particular, as

23 a result of the Project's emissions of the cancer-causing chemical formaldehyde.

24 33. Mr. Offermann explained that many composite wood products typically used in hotel

25 construction contain formaldehyde-based glues that off-gas formaldehyde over a very long time

26 period. Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen. Mr. Offermann stated that there is a fair

27 argument that full-time workers at the Project will be exposed to a cancer risk from formaldehyde of
28 approximately 18.4 per million. This is almost double the Bay Area Air Quality Management District

8

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 ("BAAQMD") CEQA significance threshold for airborne cancer risk of 10 per million. This alone

2 establishes a fair argument that the project may have a significant adverse environmental impact and

3 an EIR is required.

4 34. Whether or not the Project complies with the 2016 CalGreen Building Code does not

5 matter to this analysis because Mr. Offermann assumed such compliance in his calculations. Further,

6 a merely stating a project will comply with another agency's regulations is not sufficient to satisfy

7 CEQA's disclosure and analysis requirements.

8 35. To the extent there is uncertainty as to what formaldehyde emitting materials will be
9 used, the City did not have substantial evidence to reject Mr. Offermann's analysis. The City bears
10 the burden to investigate the Project's potential health risks from formaldehyde emissions. By

11 refusing to study this area of possible environmental impact, "a fair argument may be based on the

12 limited facts in the record" and that deficiency in the City's record "enlarge[s] the scope of fair

13 argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider range of inferences."" County Sanitation Dist.
14 No. 2, 127 Cal.App.4th at 1597, quoting Sundstrom, 202 Cal.App.3d at 311.

15 36. Mr. Offermann also noted that the high cancer risk that may be posed by the Project's

16 indoor air emissions likely will be exacerbated by the additional cancer risk that exists from vehicle

17 emissions from the adjacent Stevens Creek Boulevard and other nearby roadways. The cumulative

18 impact has not been, and must be, properly considered.

19 37. Mr. Offermann suggested several feasible mitigation measures, such as requiring the

20 use of no-added-formaldehyde composite wood products, which are readily available, and air

21 ventilation systems. None of these or other mitigation measures were considered.

22 The IS/MND's Other Insufficient Air Quality Analysis

23 38. Beyond the indoor air issues discussed above, the environmental consulting firm

24 Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE") commented that the City underestimated air
25 pollution from the Project. The reasons for this conclusion include that (a) the air modeling was basedl

26 on a 77,900 square feet building rather than the 78,850 square feet building described in the IS/MND;

27 (b) truck haul trips for the demolition of the existing gas station and service station were not properly

28 taken into account; and (c) the IS/MND does not properly analyze the air quality effects that could

9

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

l result when a 168-room hotel with only 100 parking spaces needs to find alternative parking such as

2 off-site parking locations.

3 39. SWAPE also concluded that the City's health risk assessment ("HRA") with respect to

4 the effects of air emissions "should not be relied upon to determine the significance of the cancer risk

5 posed to nearby sensitive receptors as a result of Project implementation." The reasons for the

6 inadequacy of the HRA include that (a) the construction health risk modeling does not address a

7 requisite class of sensitive receptors-the third trimester receptor, which the BAAQMD requires be

8 evaluated; and (b) there is no analysis of the Project's operation post-construction even though

9 SWAPE calculated risks well in excess of BAAQMD's threshold. Because of the failures in the

10 construction HRA, there is no substantial evidence supporting the MND's assertion of no significant

11 health impacts and a fair argument exists that health risks from the Project's construction may be

12 significant. Based on SWAPE's substantial screening evidence, a fair argument is present that the

13 Project's operation may have significant health risk impacts on nearby residents.

14 40. Further, the City must properly evaluate the cumulative impacts of the Project on

15 nearby sensitive receptors. The Project's cumulative adverse health risk impact along with the

16 existing impacts from at least the traffic on Steven's Creek Boulevard has not been properly

17 analyzed.

18 The IS/MND's Unsubstantiated Greenhouse Gas Evaluation

19 41. The Project is projected to emit approximately 1,528 metric tons of carbon dioxide

20 equivalent ("CO2e") per year - well above the BAAQMD threshold of 1,100 metric tons of CO2e per
21 year.

22 42. Despite exceeding the BAAQMD threshold of 1,100 metric tons of CO2e per year, the

23 IS/MND claims that because the Project is consistent with the mandatory requirements of the City's

24 GHG Reduction Strategy ("GHGRS"), it will not have any significant impacts from its GHG

25 emissions. IS/MND, pp. 64-69. But "[i]f there is substantial evidence that the effects of a particular

26 project may be cumulatively considerable notwithstanding the project's compliance with the

27 specified requirements in the plan for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, an EIR must be

28 prepared for the project." 14 Cal. Admin Code § 15183.5(b)(2). Further, "[a]n environmental

10

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 document that relies on a greenhouse gas reduction plan for a cumulative impacts analysis must

2 identify those requirements specified in the plan that apply to the project, and, if those requirements

3 are not otherwise binding and enforceable, incorporate those requirements as mitigation measures

4 applicable to the project." 14 Cal. Admin Code § 15183.5(b)(2).

43. The IS/MND does not meet these requirements, including because (a) the evidence

that the Project is projected to exceed BAAQMD's numeric GHG threshold is substantial evidence
that the Project may be cumulatively considerable despite its alleged compliance with the City's

1 8 GHGRS; (b) although the IS/MND points to the GHGRS's requirement that the City "[r]educe
9 vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita by 10%," the proposed Project will increase the existing

10 VMTs resulting from the gas station at the site; (c) although the IS/MND points to the presence of

11 four Santa Clara Valley Authority bus stops within a quarter mile of the Project, there is no evidence

12 that hotel guests actually use public transit buses provided in support of the IS/MND analysis; (d)

13 even if the hotel were to provide shuttles to nearby attractions, there is no evidence that the additional

14 VMT required to get people to and from the hotel will be reduced; (e) although the GHGRS

15 highlights the importance of car share programs, the IS/MND leaves the possible car share program

16 entirely undeveloped; (f), although the IS/MND relies on the requirement for the Project to comply

17 with the City's Green Building Ordinance and lists several green building features to be applied by

18 the Project, there is no indication whether or how these measures will comply with the Green

19 Building Ordinance; and (g) to the extent the City wants to rely on use of public transit, shuttles, car

20 share programs and green building requirements, the City must provide evidence of the plans and

21 their effects.

22 44. Further, the City does not require feasible mitigation measures for GHGs, such as

23 installation of solar panels.

24 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

25 45. In August 2018, the City circulated the initial IS/MND for the Project for public

26 review, and in October 2018, the City circulated the revised IS/MND for the Project for public

27 review.

46. On behalf of Respondent Hughey, Acting Deputy Director Sylvia Do held a Director's

2 Hearing on the Project on November 28, 2018. In conjunction with that hearing, on October 24, 2018,

3 Local 270 submitted written comments on the IS/MND and the Project, including expert comments

4 prepared by environmental consulting firm SWAPE. On October 30, 2018, Local 270 submitted

5 supplemental written comments, including expert comments from Mr. Offermann. Local 270 also

6 provided oral comments at the November 28, 2018 Director's Hearing. On behalf of Respondent
Hughey, Acting Deputy Director Do adopted the IS/MND and the Site Development Permit on

8 November 28, 2018.

9 47. On November 30, 2018, Local 270 appealed Respondent Hughey's decision to the

10 City Council. Local 270 submitted additional written comments to the City Council on January 4,

11 2019, including additional comments from SWAPE. The City Council heard the appeal on January 8.

12 2019. On that date, despite the existence of substantial evidence creating a fair argument that the

13 Project may result in significant adverse environmental impacts, the City Council approved the

14 Project and adopted Resolution No. 78908, denying the appeal and upholding the Planning Director's

15 approval of the Revised Mitigated Negative Declaration and the Site Development Permit.

16 48. On January 10, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Determination with the Santa Clara

17 County Clerk's office. The Notice of Determination identified "Asset Gas SC Inc." as the applicant

18 for the Project. Cal. Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a) requires that a petitioner or plaintiff a

19 "shall name, as a real party in interest, the person or persons identified by the public agency in its

20 notice.... Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6.5.

21 49. This action is being filed within 30 days of the posting of the City's Notice of

22 Determination with the Santa County Clerk's office, in accordance with Public Resources Code

23 section 21167(b).

24 50. Petitioners exhausted administrative remedies by submitting comments and expert

25 analysis to Respondents demonstrating that a there is a fair argument that the Project may have adverse
26 environmental impacts and requesting preparation of an EIR to analyze these impacts and to propose

27 feasible mitigation measures. Despite being presented with this substantial evidence, Respondents
28 failed to prepare an EIR.

12

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 51. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

2 within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 or, alternatively, § 1086, in that

3 Respondents' approval of the Project is not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an

4 adequate remedy. Accordingly, Petitioners seek this Court's review of Respondents' approval of the

5 Project to rectify the violations of CEQA.

6 52. Petitioners are informed and believe that the Real Party in Interest is threatening to

7 proceed with implementation of the Project in the near future. Implementation of the Project will

8 irreparably harm the environment in that the Real Party will commence with environmentally

9 damaging activities without Respondents having prepared an EIR for the Project resulting in adverse

10 environmental effects. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions

11 should issue restraining Respondents and Real Party from proceeding with the Project without first

12 preparing and certifying an EIR analyzing impacts and imposing all feasible mitigation measures.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Prepare EIR Despite Fair Argument of Potential Significant Impacts and IS/MND Not Supported by Substantial Evidence)
15
53. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in
16
full.
17
54.
18 Respondents failed to comply with CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project
despite substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more

19

20 significant environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following:

21 a. There is a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on indoor air

22 quality due to the use of composite wood products that off-gas carcinogenic

23 formaldehyde. Substantial evidence demonstrates that future workers at the hotel

24 may be exposed to significant adverse indoor air quality impacts.

25 b. There is a fair argument that the cumulative cancer risk posed by formaldehyde

26 used in the Project together with additional nearby cancer risks may be significant.
Substantial evidence demonstrates that future workers at the hotel may be exposed
27 to a significant cumulative cancer risk.
28

-

2 C. There is fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts on air

w pollution because the City underestimated air pollution from the Project.

7 n Substantial evidence demonstrates that the Project may cause significant adverse
air quality effects.

6 d. The City's conclusion that the Project's construction and operation will not have a
significant health risk impact on adjacent residents and children is not supported

8 by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that a the health risks from the
Project's construction and operation may be significant.

9 e. The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a cumulative health risk

11 impact is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that the
Project will result in cumulative health risks.

12 f.

13 The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant impact on GHG

14 emissions is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair argument exists that a

15 the Project may have significant GHG emission impacts.

16 g. The City's conclusion that the Project will not have a significant cumulative
impact on GHG emissions is not supported by substantial evidence and a fair a

17

18 argument exists that the Project may have a significant cumulative impact on GHG

emissions.

19 55. Because a fair argument exists that the Project may have one or more significant
20 environmental impacts, the City must prepare an EIR for the Project to analyze all environmental
21 impacts and to propose all

22 56. feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts.

23 Alternatively, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by adopting an

24 IS/MND the environmental impact analysis for which is not supported by substantial evidence.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Party in Interest)

26 57. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again in

27 full.

28 58. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,
Respondents and Real Party in Interest will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance 14

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint

1 with CEQA. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to take the required

2 steps to protect the environment. Declaratory relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure §

3 1060, injunctive relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq. and a writ of

4 mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and 1094.5 et seq. and under

5 Public Resources Code § 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

6 PRAYER

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray that the Court:

1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the approval of
the AC by Marriott Hotel-West San Jose Project, including but not limited to Resolution 78908, the

10 accompanying mitigated negative declaration and the site development permit unless and until
11 Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a legally adequate CEQA document prior to
12 any subsequent approval action;
13 2. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents and Real Party in Interest to
14 suspend all activity in furtherance of the AC by Marriott Hotel-West San Jose Project unless and
15

16 until Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions into compliance with CEQA;

3.
17 Issue a preliminary and permanent injunction staying the effect of Respondents'

18 approval of the AC by Marriott Hotel-West San Jose Project;

19 4. Issue a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approval of the AC by Marriott

20 Hotel-West San Jose Project to be null and void and contrary to law;

21 5. Award costs of suit;

22 6. Award attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any other

23 applicable provisions of law; and

24 7. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
