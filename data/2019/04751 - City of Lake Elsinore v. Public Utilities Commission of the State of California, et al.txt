INTRODUCTION

This petition presents an issue of environmental justice that is relevant

throughout California. But before this issue can be addressed, a threshold

question must be answered: what kind of petition is applicable here- -a petition

for writ of mandate or a petition for writ of review?

On the one hand, a legacy statute (1972) from the early days of the

California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") provides that actions against

the Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") proceed only by writ of mandate to

this Court. On the other hand, in 1996 the Legislature amended the Public

Utilities Code to specify that appeals of PUC decisions granting or denying

applications proceed by writ of review to either the courts of appeal or this

Court. Petitioner believes that the latter enacted statute controls over the

former one and that jurisdiction for this petition should lie as a discretionary

writ of review to the Fourth District Court of Appeal. However, with the

leading CEQA treatise concluding otherwise, out of an abundance of caution

Petitioner has filed this petition with this Court. Needless to say, resolution of

the obvious conflict between the two statutes by this Court is sorely needed,

and as discussed in the City's memorandum below, there are good reasons for

this Court to conclude that the 1996 statute supplants the earlier one.

Once the Court resolves this threshold issue, either this Court will, or

the Fourth District Court of Appeal may, adjudicate this petition's key issue

10

of environmental justice: that respondent PUC engages in an institutionalized

pattern and practice of violating CEQA when addressing the visual impacts of

overhead powerlines in developing communities. While this petition concerns

the PUC's approval of a project adding eleven miles of overhead powerlines

in the City of Lake Elsinore (population 66,000), it also represents an

opportunity to rein in the PUC's overt indifference to CEQA and correct a

trajectory that for nearly two generations has deviated from the Legislature's

finding that "[i]t is necessary to provide a high-quality environment that at all

times is healthful and pleasing to the senses and intellect of man" and from

state policy to "[t]ake all action necessary to provide the people of this state

with [] enjoyment of aesthetic [] qualities." (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000,

subd. (b), 21001, subd. (b).)

The PUC utilizes two methods to dismiss the visual impacts of projects,

both of which violate CEQA. First, the PUC evaluates visual impacts using

so-called objective measures that are either outdated or simply inapposite.

Here, the measure used was published over 30 years ago by the Federal

Highway Administration and titled Visual Impact Assessment for Highway

Projects. These federal guidance and assessment standards were promulgated

to assess visual impacts related to major highway construction and not those

impacting a community's unique cityscape. First published in 1988, the

standards were retired in 2015, yet the PUC adamantly defended its use of the

11

obsolete standards to assess the visual impacts of overhead powerlines along

the City of Lake Elsinore's streets, some only two-lanes wide.

The PUC'S second mechanism, also highly refined, is to aggressively

limit discussion concerning project impacts, mitigation, and alternatives.
Despite the fact that the PUC held three days of evidentiary hearings in the

proceedings below, its order expressly precluded all evidence "regarding the

identification of significant environmental impacts, mitigation measures and

alternatives, and the environmentally superior alternative." (6PE21:3605.)

Indeed, so aggressive is the PUC in beating back even a suggestion of

visual impact from overhead powerline projects, it refused to correct simulated

views that minimized view impacts by depicting single circuit power lines

(three overhead lines) in the environmental impact report when in fact double

circuit transmission lines (six overhead lines) were planned for that particular

segment on City streets.

The PUC'S indifference to community aesthetic values (and project

impacts in general) and the accompanying quashing of community input has

been fostered within the confusion created by the conflict between Public

Resources Code section 21168.6 and Public Utilities Code section 1756.

References to "PE" are to Petitioner's Appendix of Exhibits in
Support of Petition (*Petition Exhibits"), filed concurrently. Each reference to "PE" is preceded by the applicable volume number and followed by the
relevant tab number separated by a colon from the appropriate page reference.

12

Within this confusion, the PUC's crabbed CEQA process has festered

unchecked, and judicial review of this critical issue of statewide concern is

long overdue.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF REVIEW

The City of Lake Elsinore ("City") petitions for a writ of review of
Decision (D.) 18-08-026 (the "Final Decision"), issued by respondent

California Public Utilities Commission ("PUC" or "Commission") on August

31, 2018, as modified on December 17, 2018 following application for

rehearing, by D. 18-12-031 (the "Rehearing Decision"). (1PE1:6; 1PE2:114.)

By this petition, City alleges:

A. Beneficial Interest of Petitioner; Capacities
of Respondent and Real Parties in Interest

Petitioner City is, and at all times was, a California municipal corporation

founded in 1883 and incorporated as a general law city effective April 23,

1888. The City encompasses approximately 43 square miles in southwestern

Riverside County and lies within Division Two of the Fourth District Court of

Appeal.

1. The Final Decision approved the Valley-Ivyglen 115 kV

Sub-transmission Line Project ("Valley-Ivyglen Project"), a major portion of

which will be constructed and operate in the City such that many of the

project's impacts will occur in the City.

13

2. The City was a party to the proceedings before respondent PUC

that resulted in the Final Decision approving the Valley-Ivyglen Project.

3. Respondent PUC is the administrative agency responsible for

regulating private, for-profit utility providers in the State of California. (Cal.

Const., art. XII, § 6; Pub. Util. Code, § 701.)2

4. Real party in interest Southern California Edison Company

("SCE") is an investor-owned public utility operating an interconnected and

integrated electric utility system that generates, transmits and distributes

electric energy in portions of Central and Southern California.

B. Jurisdiction, Venue and Timeliness of Petition

5. This petition for writ of mandate/writ of review ("Petition") is

the only available way for the City to obtain appellate review of the PUC'S

decision in the Valley-Ivyglen proceeding. Subdivision (a) of Public Utilities

Code section 1756 authorizes any party aggrieved by a PUC decision to

petition for a writ of review.

6. Subdivision (a) of Public Utilities Code section 1759 provides:

"No court of this state, except the Supreme Court and the court of appeal, ...

shall have jurisdiction to review, reverse, correct, or annul any order or

decision of the commission or to suspend or delay the execution or operation

All further statutory references in this petition are to the Public
Utilities Code, unless otherwise indicated.

14

thereof..." Therefore, either this Court or Division Two of the Fourth District

Court of Appeal has original jurisdiction of this matter under subdivision (a)

of Public Utilities Code section 1759, which specifies the only judicial

recourse for challenging a PUC decision is by writ of review. However,

because this Petition alleges violations of the California Environmental Quality

Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100 et seq.; "CEQA") by the PUC and the

leading CEQA treatise opines that the only judicial recourse for challenging

a PUC CEQA decision is by petition for writ of mandate to this Court, out of

an abundance of caution the City has filed this Petition with this Court. (See

2 Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under Cal. Environmental Quality Act,

(Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2018) Public Utility and Energy Commission Decisions,

cop 23.153, pp. 23-172 ["Although [Public Utilities Code section 1756 and

Public Resources Code section 21168.5] conflict, the CEQA provision should

control because it is the more specific of the two."].)

7. The Commission issued its Final Decision approving the Valley-

Ivyglen Project on August 31, 2018, 2018. (1PE1:61.) The City filed a timely

application for rehearing on October 1, 2018, within 30 days of the decision's

issuance as required by subdivision (b) of Public Utilities Code section 1731.

(7PE48:4437.) On December 17, 2018, the Commission issued Rehearing

Decision, D.18-12-031, slightly modifying the Final Decision and denying

rehearing of that decision as modified. (1PE2:114.) This petition is filed

15

January 16, 2019 - within 30 days of the denial - and is, therefore, timely

under Public Utilities Code section 1756(a).

C. Authenticity of Exhibits

8. All exhibits in support of this Petition, filed under separate cover

captioned "Appendix of Exhibits in Support of Petition for Writ of Review"

("Petition Exhibits" or "PE"), are true and correct copies of original documents

filed with the PUC in the Valley-Ivyglen Project proceeding, except: (i) exhibit

6PE13:3024 which is a true and correct copy of transcripts of the prehearing

conference held on June 5, 2017; exhibit 6PE14:3064, 6PE15:3249 and

6PE16:3364 which are true and correct copies of transcripts of the evidentiary

hearings held on October 17, 18, and 19, 2017, respectively, and; exhibit

6PE17:3433 which is a true and correct copy of the transcript of the oral

arguments held by the Commission on May 2, 2018. The Petition Exhibits are

incorporated by reference. They are paginated consecutively from pages

through 4467, and references to the Petition Exhibits (or PE) in this petition

are to the consecutive pagination.

D. Proceedings Before the PUC

9. The Valley-Ivyglen Project approval process has been the

subject of multiple Commission proceedings extending over several years.

10. By Application (A.) 07-01-031, filed January 16, 2007, SCE

sought a permit to construct the "Valley Ivy-Glen 115kV Subtransmission Line

16

Project" to relieve loads on existing 115 kV transmission lines and provide a
second source of power to the Ivyglen Substation, all located in Riverside

County.

11. By D. 10-08-009 issued on August 17, 2010, the PUC granted

SCE's application to construct the Valley-Ivyglen Project. (6PE18:3503.)

12. SCE requested modification to the previously-approved permit

to construct the Valley-Ivyglen Project by way of a petition for modification

filed with the PUC on April 2, 2013 and, thereafter, by way of an amended

petition filed on a May 23, 2014. (6PE19:3523.)

13. By its amended petition for modification, SCE sought to modify
the Valley-Ivyglen Project project design by (among other things) realigning
portions of the subtransmission line route and undergrounding a portion of the

line and to modify the construction method and techniques by, among other

things, using shooflies, blasting, and helicopters. (1PE1:15; 6PE19:3532.)

14. The Valley-Ivyglen Project, however, implicated another

pending SCE application before the PUC. By Application (A.) 09-09-022,

filed September 30, 2009, SCE sought a certificate of public convenience and

necessity ("CPNC") to construct the Alberhill System Project (Alberhill

Project") to purportedly relieve projected electrical demand and provide a

second source of electricity. (1PE1:14.)

17

15. Because components of the Valley-Ivyglen Project are required

for construction of the Alberhill Project, the Commission's Energy Division

consolidated the environmental review of the projects. On May 6, 2015, the

Energy Division announced the Notice of Preparation of an Environmental

Impact Report ("EIR") for the projects. (1PE1;16.) The draft EIR issued for

comment in April 2016, and the final EIR issued in April 2017. (1PE1:16.)

16. On April 28, 2016, the assigned Administrative Law Judge

("ALJ"), Hallie Yachnin, issued a ruling giving "notice of anticipated issues
that will be included in the scope of the proceeding, and directs parties who
intend to offer evidence on issues addressed in the Environmental Impact

Report (EIR) to do SO by public comment on the draft EIR that issued on April

12, 2016." (6PE20:3596.)

17. The ALJ went on to advise the public that its one and only

opportunity to address deficiencies in the draft EIR would be during the draft

EIR's public review period:

"The final EIR will include and address all such comments, and

will be admitted into the evidentiary record of this proceeding.

Accordingly, as will be further explained at the prehearing

conference, I do not anticipate taking further evidence regarding

the identification of significant environmental impacts,

mitigation measures and alternatives, and the environmentally

18

superior alternative (i.e., issues no. 1, 2 and 3), beyond the final

EIR. Therefore, any person who wishes to present evidence on

the environmental impacts of the proposed project and

alternatives, recommended mitigation, and the environmentally

superior alternative must do so through public comment on the

draft EIR." (Italic in original.)

(6PE20:3600.)

18. The City timely submitted comments to the draft EIR on July 13,

2016, asserting the draft EIR's analysis of project impacts was deficient in

addressing and mitigating aesthetic impacts, hazards to sensitive receptors,

dangers posed by the proposed transmissions line near Skylark Airport, socio-

economic impacts, disproportionate impact to the City's low-income residents,

and failing to propose feasible mitigation measure to address those impacts in

the draft EIR's alternative analysis. (5PE9:1745-1757.)

19. The City's comments pointed to a critical defect in the draft

EIR's visual impact analysis: that it was based on a discredited and

subsequently replaced study first published in 1988 by the Federal Highway

Administration:

"Why has the DEIR so profoundly missed the mark on aesthetic

impacts? Because it utilizes an utterly outdated aesthetic

standard-now 28 years old-that even the notoriously glacial

19

Federal Highway Administration has abandoned. The Federal

Highway Administration's 2015 replacement Guidelines for the

Visual Impact Assessment of Highway Projects acknowledge

that the 1988 guidelines as simply antiquated: 'The new

guidelines recommend engaging the public to a higher degree

than earlier VIA methods, to achieve a better understanding of

how people define visual quality and how they interpret changes

to it.' (p. 1-3). By failing to engage the public and instead
relying on outdated (and, candidly, inapplicable guidelines for

the Proposed Project), the DEIR consistently understates the

visual impact of the Proposed Projects."

(5PE9:1748.)

20. In responding to the City's 13-page comment letter, the final EIR

initially had this to say in response to the City's visual impact comments:

"248-2: In cases where a visual impact was

identified, mitigation was included to

reduce the impact, which included either

undergrounding or other measures. See

Section 4.1, Aesthetics. In addition, the

CPUC considered undergrounding

20

alternatives. See Chapter 5.0, Comparison

of Alternatives.

248-3: See response to comment 248-2.

248-4: See response to comment 248-2.

248-5: See response to comment 248-2.

248-6: See response to comment 248-2.

248-7: See response to comment 248-2.

248-8: See response to comment 248-2."

(4PE8:1576-1577.)

21. Eighteen months later, a belated but more substantive response

to the City was finally given in the Final Errata to the EIR issued by the Energy
Division on February 23, 2018. (6PE11:3015-3016.)

22. A prehearing conference was held on June 5, 2017.

(6PE13:3024.)

23. Following the June 5, 2017 prehearing conference, on June 21,

2017, the commissioner assigned to the Valley-Ivyglen Project and the

Alberhill Project, Commissioner Guzman Aceves, issued her "Assigned

Commissioner's Scoping Memo and Ruling" for the proceedings (the

"Scoping Memo"). (6PE21:3601; see also §1701.1, subd. (b).) The Scoping

Memo set deadlines for the parties to serve direct and rebuttal testimony, and

set the evidentiary hearing for October 17 through 19, 2017. (6PE21:3607.)

21

24. The Scoping Memo also identified nine "issues to be

determined." Issues 1, 2 and 3 directly addressed environmental compliance:

"1. What are the significant adverse environmental impacts of

the proposed projects? This issue encompasses consideration of
whether the project designs comports with Commission rules

and regulations and other applicable standards governing safe

and reliable operations.

2. Are there potentially feasible mitigation measures or project

alternatives that will avoid or lessen the significant adverse

environmental impacts? This issue encompasses consideration

of how to design the proposed projects in a manner that ensures

their safe and reliable operation.

3. As between the proposed projects and the project

alternatives, which is environmentally superior?"

(6PE21:3603.)

25. The Scoping Memo made clear that the Commission would not,

however, entertain evidence of the EIR's deficiency at the evidentiary hearing:

"The EIR addresses 1 issues 1 through 3. CEQA requires the

opportunity for the public to comment on the draft EIR, and

requires the final EIR to consider and address each and every

comment that is received, pursuant to the process and

22

procedures of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines (Title 14 C.C.R.

Chapter 3.) Given this process under CEQA, the Administrative
Law Judge's (ALJ's) April 28, 2016 ruling gave notice that no
evidence would be taken regarding the identification of

significant environmental impacts, mitigation measures and

alternatives, and the environmentally superior alternative (i.e.,

1 issues 1 through 3) beyond the final EIR, and that any person

who wished to present information regarding those issues should
do so through public comment on the draft EIR. We will not

take further evidence on these issues."

(6PE21:3605.)

26. The evidentiary hearing was held on October 17, 18, and 19,

2017. (6PE14:3064; 6PE15:3249; 6PE16:3364.) All attempts to introduce

direct testimony concerning the feasible project alternatives that would lessen

environmental impacts were rebuffed by the ALJ and stricken. (6PE14:3066-

3068; 6PE22:3609; 6PE23:3620; 6PE24:3629; 6PE25:3631;6PE26:3647.) In

keeping with the Scoping Memo, no evidence regarding project environ-

mental impacts, feasible mitigation measures, or alternatives was permitted at

the evidentiary hearing. (6PE14:3066-3068.)

27. On April 4, 2018, the assigned ALJ, who presided over the

evidentiary hearing, issued a Proposed Decision ("PD") approving the Valley-

23

Ivglen Project application for a permit modification and denying SCE's
application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the

Alberhill Project. (7PE44:4215.)

28. The PD accepted the final EIR's conclusion that the proposed

projects-that is, the Valley-Ivyglen Project and the Alberhill Project--would

have no significant adverse visual impacts within the City. (7PE44:4232-

4233.) In rejecting the City's core complaint concerning the PUC's use of the

Federal Highway Administration's ("FHWA") 1988 Visual Impact Assessment
for Highway Projects publication because of its bias toward "drivers" and its

accompanying focus on major highway corridors, the PD states:
"To the contrary, the EIR's selection and application of the 1988

guidelines is fully supported by substantial evidence. [FN] As

it explains:

The FHWA has recently revised its guidelines for visual impact

assessment to allow different levels of documentation and be

more readily understood and practical in its application (FHWA

2015). However, the new FHWA guidelines now focus more on

transportation projects and no longer emphasize several key
concepts from the earlier guidelines that are applicable to
various types of projects, such as transmission lines, substations,

and similar industrial-type development projects, in rural,

24

suburban, and urban landscapes. Although the new FHWA

guidelines incorporate many elements from those issued in

1988, the earlier guidelines remain most applicable for assessing

aesthetic impacts of proposed projects situated within diverse

landscape types and on private lands. (EIR, at 4.1-16-4.1-17.)"

(7PE44:4232-4233.)

29. On May 2, 2018, four of the Commissioners along with ALJ

Yachnin heard oral arguments from the parties. (6PE17:3433.)

30. On June 29, 2018, Commissioner Guzman Aceves, the assigned

commissioner, issued an Alternative Proposed Decision ("APD"), also

approving the Valley-Ivglen application for a permit modification and denying

SCE's application for a CPCN for the Alberhill project, but with a proviso that

the denial was "without prejudice" and that SCE could submit a new

application with specific additional information primarily concerning electrical

demand. (7PE46:4352-4353.)

31. The full Commission issued a Final Decision on August 31,

2018, substantially adopting the APD, but with a eleventh hour change that the

Alberhill application would not be "denied" but rather that the proceeding on

Alberhill would be held "open" so that SCE could compile and submit the

requested additional information for future consideration by the Commission.

(1PE1:1, 53.)

25

32. Both the APD and the Final Decision recited the PD's

determination, as set forth above, on the projects' aesthetic impacts in the City.

(7PE46:4336-4337; 1PE1:27-28.)

33. Two parties, the City and Forest Residents Opposing New

Transmissions Lines ("Frontlines"), applied for a rehearing of the
Commission's Decision 18-08-026 ("Final Decision"), raising claims of error

regarding compliance with CEQA. (7PE48:4437; 7PE47:4420.) The PUC

denied rehearing but also modified its Final Decision to "to clarify the issue

of environmental review with respect to the Commission's future consideration

of the Alberhill Project." (1PE2: 116.)

34. Both the City and Frontlines argued that the Commission

violated CEQA by certifying the final EIR in the Final Decision even though

the Commission had not approved (but rather held "open") SCE's application
for the Alberhill Project. (7PE48:4441-4444; 7PE47:4422-4423.) In light of

the Commission's clarification in the Rehearing Decision on this issue, the

City does not seek further review from this Court on the issue of segregating

final EIR certification from the potential future approval of the Alberhill

Project.

35. The Commission rejected the City's argument that the final

EIR's analysis improperly relied on the FHW A's Visual Impact Assessmentfor

Highway Projects, publication. Despite the fact that the FHWA had

26

abandoned its use of these guidelines and had issued new guidelines in 2015,

the Commission concluded that the City's "assertion of error lacks merit"

noting that the Commission was free to choose whatever assessment

methodology it felt like:

66 as the lead agency, the Commission is responsible for

determining an assessment methodology that is appropriate for

the projects being reviewed." (1PE2:120.)

36. The Commission also rejected the holding in Berkeley Keep Jets

Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of Port Comms. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344

("Berkeley Jets") rejecting the use of outdated studies in assessing

environmental impacts. (1PE2:121-122.) There, the court held that "[b]y

using scientifically outdated information derived from the 1991 profile, we

conclude the EIR was not a reasoned and good faith effort to inform

decisionmakers and the public about the increase in TAC emissions that will

occur as a consequence of the Airport expansion." (Berkeley Jets, supra, at p.

1367.)

37. Despite this clear authority, the Commission reasoned that the

holding in Berkeley Jets was limited by its facts and only applicable to air

quailty guidelines:

"However, Berkeley Jets is not applicable to the case at hand.

Berkeley Jets did not concern aesthetics; it concerned

27

quantitative air quality standards regarding toxic air

contaminants that were under the jurisdiction of the California

Air Resources Board ('CARB')."

(1PE2:122.)

38. The Commission also rejected the City's argument that the final

EIR's alternative analysis has created a "strawman" alternative of under-

grounding the entire project which was clearly not feasible and then used that

alternative to torpedo more moderate and focused undergrounding alternatives.

(1PE2:122-123.)

39. CEQA requires the adoption of all feasible alternatives and

mitigation measures that substantially reduce the environmental impacts of
projects. The fact that an alternative may be more expensive or less profitable

is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible. (Citizens

of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors of Santa Barbara County (1988) 197

Cal.App.3d 1167, 1181.)

40. CEQA also requires an EIR to include a reasonable range of

alternatives to the project or to the location of the project which reduce the

environmental impacts of the project: "the discussion of alternatives shall

focus on alternatives to the project or its location which are capable of

avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even

if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project

28

objectives, or would be more costly." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.
Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400.)

41. The Final EIR never presented any undergrounding through the
City, other than Alternative M to the Valley-Ivyglen Project which calls for
undergrounding the entire Valley-Ivyglen Project. (2PE4:821-825.)

42. However, the Final EIR quickly rejected this "all underground"

alternative as no better than the proposed project:
"[u]ndergrounding the entire alignment would neither create nor

avoid a land use conflict that would result in significant

environmental impacts. Impacts would be the same under this

alternative as for the proposed project."

(2PE4:824.)

43. This basis for rejection for the "all underground" alternative, a

completely contrived alternative that was utterly infeasible, then served as the
basis for rejecting the City's good faith comments that limited undergrounding

alternatives should be considered:

"In addition, note that the CPUC considered undergrounding

alternatives. See undergrounding alternatives. See Chapter 5.0,
Comparison of Alternatives, for an analysis of undergrounding

alternatives."

(6PE11:3016.)

29

44. The Commission ultimately found that the "City's assertion of
legal error has no merit," asserting that an "EIR does not need to consider
every conceivable alternative, but must consider a 'reasonable range' of
alternatives to foster informed decision-making and public participation."

(2PE2:122.)

E. Basis for Relief

45. Public Utilities Code section 1757(a) governs the reviewing

court's examination of cases properly before it on petition for writ of review

from a Commission decision involving "ratesetting." The Valley-Ivyglen

proceeding was a ratesetting case. (6PE21:3608; see also §1701.1(a) &

(c)(3).)

46. Under Public Utilities Code section 1757(a), this court reviews

a PUC decision involving ratesetting to determine whether, "on the basis of the

entire record which shall be certified by the commission":

(1) "[t]he commission has not proceeded in the manner required

by law";

(2) "[t]he decision of the commission is not supported by the

findings";

(3) "[t]he findings in the decision of the commission are not
supported by substantial evidence...";

30

(4) "[t]he. .decision of the commission was procured by fraud

or was an abuse of discretion"; or

(5) "[t]he..decision of the commission violates any right of the

petitioner under the Constitution of the United States or the

California Constitution."

47. The City requests the issuance of a writ of mandate or writ of

review on the following grounds:

48. The PUC failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

abused its discretion when it evaluated visual impacts in the Valley-Ivyglen

Project EIR using measures that are wholly outdated or inapposite to urbanized

communities.

49. The PUC failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

violated its own rules, and abused its discretion when it precluded discussion

concerning project impacts, mitigation, and alternatives from evidentiary

hearings in the Valley-Ivyglen Project proceedings at the PUC.

50. The PUC failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

abused its discretion, when it failed and refused to correct obvious and

admitted errors in the Valley-Ivyglen Project EIR.

51. The PUC failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

abused its discretion, when it included extreme and infeasible alternatives in

31

the EIR's alternative analysis and use such alternatives as justification for

refusing to consider other feasible alternatives.

PRAYER

WHEREFORE, City prays that this Court:

1. Issue a writ of mandate or writ of review to inquire into and

determine the lawfulness of the PUC's Valley-Ivyglen Project decision, D. 18-

08-026, as modified by D. 18-12-031;

2. Direct respondent PUC to certify its record in the subject

proceeding to this Court;

3. After review, set aside and annul the PUC's VIF project

decision;

4. Award City its costs of suit pursuant to rule 8.493 of the

California Rules of Court; and

5. Grant such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

I. THE COURT SHOULD REVIEW THE PUC'S DECISION

The CEQA process at the PUC is broken, propped up by platitude after

platitude lobbed at communities seeking some semblance of the engaged

public process at the heart of CEQA. By ingenious institutional shortcutting,
the PUC has gutted CEQA by applying it as a veneer to projects with the
superficial appearance of compliance on the outside but hollow underneath.

The City is entitled to the Court's review on the merits to correct the

Commission's failure to comply with CEQA. Because the Public Utilities

Code specifies that a petition for writ of review is the sole means of obtaining

review of a PUC decision, a timely petition that appears to be meritorious must

be granted; such a petition should not be summarily denied "on policy grounds

unrelated to [its] procedural or substantive merits." (Consumer Lobby

Monopolies v. PUC (1979) 25 Cal.3d 891, 901, fn. 3.)

The Petition here is both meritorious and raises significant issues of the

PUC's compliance with CEQA which have broad public importance to

communities throughout California.

34

II. THE COURT SHOULD RESOLVE THE CONFLICT
BETWEEN PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SECTION 1756
AND PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 21168.6
CONCERNING THE PURPORTED SOLE
JURISDICTION OF THIS COURT IN PUC RELATED
CEQA MATTERS

In adopting CEQA in 1972, the California Legislature vested sole

judicial redress of a CEQA action with this Court by way of mandamus relief:

"In any action or proceeding under Sections 21168 or 21168.5

against the Public Utilities Commission the writ of mandate

shall lie only from the Supreme Court to such commission."

(Pub. Resources Code § 21168.6.) At the time, this statute posed no apparent

or even implicit jurisdictional conflict to the different writ of review process

for Supreme Court review of the PUC's decision found in then-existing Public

Utilities Code section 1756. (See Desert Environment Conservation Ass'n. v.

Public Utilities Comm'n. (1973) 8 Cal.3d 739 [Court applied Public Resources

Code section 21168.6 and ruled on petitioners' mandamus CEQA action].)

The conflict arose in 1996 with the enactment of Senate Bill No. 1322

(1995-1996 Reg. Sess.), extending judicial review of PUC decisions to the

courts of appeal. (Stats. 1996, ch. 855, § 5.) Subdivision (a) of Public Utilities

Code section 1756 ("Section 1756") now provides in pertinent part:

"Within 30 days after the commission issues its decision

denying the application for a rehearing, or, if the application was

granted, then within 30 days after the commission issues its

35

decision on rehearing, or at least 120 days after the application

is granted if no decision on rehearing has been issued, any

aggrieved party may petition for a writ of review in the court of
appeal or the Supreme Court for the purpose of having the

lawfulness of the original order or decision or of the order or

decision on rehearing inquired into and determined."

Thus the confusion was created. If an aggrieved party followed all of the

particularities of Section 1756 and brought a petition for writ of review to

challenge a PUC decision, that party was nonetheless compelled out of an

abundance of caution, to file a petition for writ of mandate with the California

Supreme Court if the challenged PUC action in any way touched upon CEQA.

To date, the California Supreme Court has not resolved this confusion,

and to the extent that courts of appeal have touched on it they have only
compounded the confusion. For example, in v. City of Vernon v. Public Utilities

Comm 'n. (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 672, 677, the Second District Court of Appeal

had no problem accepting and deciding an action alleging the PUC's violation

of CEQA ["Vernon filed a petition for review in this court pursuant to Public

Utilities Code section 1756"].) Conversely, in City of Huntington Beach v.

Public Utility Commission (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 566, 582, the court noted

its prior dismissal of a party's petition alleging violation of CEQA by the PUC

["On June 15, 2011, this court ruled that the petition violated Public Resources

36

Code section 21168.6 to the extent it raised CEQA issues"], and in Center for

Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th

452, 468, the court remarked in passing that "we are not discussing specified

environmental challenges filed against the Public Utilities Commission, which

are filed in our Supreme Court. (§ 21168.6.)."

The CEQA treatises are equally unhelpful. In the only one Petitioner's

counsel found that even addresses the conflict, the commentators opine that the

conflict must be resolved in favor of sole jurisdiction by this Court in all

CEQA challenges to PUC decisions:

"Challenges to California Public Utilities Commission (PUC)

decisions generally are initiated by filing an application for a

writ of review directly with the court of appeal or California

Supreme Court. Pub Util C § 1756. However, when a CEQA

proceeding is brought under Pub Res C §21168 or §21168.5, the

writ of mandate to the PUC must be filed with the supreme

court. Pub Res C §21168.6. Although these provisions conflict,

the CEQA provision should control because it is the more

specific of the two. See Committee for a Progressive Gilroy v
State Water Resources Control Bd. (1987) 192 CA3d 847, 859

(specific CEQA statute of limitations governs CEQA claim

against water board); Walters V County of Plumas (1976) 61

37

CA3d460, 469 (specific CEQA limitations period applies rather

than more general validating action limitation period)."

(2 Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under Cal. Environmental Quality Act,

[Cont.Ed.Bar 2d ed. 2018] Public Utility and Energy Commission Decisions,

s0p 23.153, pp. 23-172-3.) Kostka and Zischke conclude by declaring that "a

CEQA challenge to a PUC decision should be filed directly to the supreme

court." (Ibid.)

The practical result of this is the judicial equivalent of a hot mess, with

many parties aggrieved by the PUC having to file not one but two petitions

within 30 days of the PUC's decision - with the non-CEQA issues going to a

court of appeal and the CEQA issues going to this Court. (See, e.g., City of

San Diego v. Public Utility Commission, Supreme Court Case No. S151176.)

However, Kostka and Zischke's analysis fails to acknowledge that Section

1756 is also highly specific when compared, for instance, with the validation

statute, Code of Civil Procedure sections 860 et seq., at issue in Walters v.

County of Plumas, supra. Moreover, while acknowledging the court's

conclusion in Committee for a Progressive Gilroy, supra, that a CEQA statute

of limitations trumped a Water Code statue of limitations, Kostka and Zischke

overlook the fact that the court in that case was also persuaded that the CEQA

claims simply could not fit within the writ of review process set out in the

Porter-Cologne Act:

38

"Under the Water Code, 'the court shall exercise its independent

judgment on the evidence.' (Wat. Code. § 13330, subd. (b).) In
contrast, under CEQA "The court shall not exercise its
independent judgment on the evidence but shall only determine

whether the act or decision is supported by substantial evidence

in the light of the whole record.' (Pub. Resources Code,
§ 21168.) It would be anomalous to apply the Water Code
limitation period and yet simultaneously use the different scope

of review under CEQA."

(Committee for a Progressive Gilroy v. State Water Resources Control Bd.,
supra, 192 Cal.App.3d at p. 859.) In contrast, Public Utilities Code 1757 is
fully consistent with the review standards in CEQA.'

(a) No new or additional evidence shall be introduced upon review by the court. In a complaint or enforcement proceeding, or in a ratemaking or licensing decision of specific application that is addressed to particular parties, the review by the court shall not extend further than to determine, on the basis of the entire record which shall be certified by the commission, whether any
of the following occurred: (1) The commission acted without, or in excess of, its powers or jurisdiction. (2) The commission has not proceeded in the manner required by law. (3) The decision of the commission is not supported by the findings. (4) The findings in the decision of the commission are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. (5) The order or decision of the commission was procured by fraud or was an
abuse of discretion.
(6) The order or decision of the commission violates any right of the petitioner under the Constitution of the United States or the California Constitution.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the court to hold trial de novo, to take evidence other than as specified by the California Rules of

39

Finally, Kostka and Zischke fail to acknowledge that an aggrieved
party, when seeking a writ of review under Section 1756, is seeking something

different than a writ of mandate as called out under Public Resources section

21168.6. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc. § § 1067-1077 with Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 &

1094.5.) Writs of review and writs of mandate are not the same, and Kostka

and Zischke's opinion ignores a key principle of statutory interpretation: that

court must assume that the Legislature, in enacting Section 1756 in 1996, did

so with Public Resources section 21168.6 in mind and yet chose not to scalpel

CEQA actions from its ambit. (Estate of Simpson (1954) 43 Cal.2d 594, 600.)

The City respectfully submits that an aggrieved party, having fully

followed the prerequisites to seek a writ of review as required by Section 1756,

should be permitted to seek such review from the Court of Appeal for any

issue, whether it be CEQA or anything else. This Petition certainly does not

compel the Court to clear up the confusion, but it does pose that opportunity.

III. THE COMMISSION FAILED TO PROCEED IN THE
MANNER REQUIRED BY LAW WHEN IT APPROVED
THE EIR FOR THE VALLEY-IVYGLEN PROJECT

A. The Standard of Review Under CEQA

The Court's review extends "to whether there was a prejudicial abuse

of discretion." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.) "Abuse of discretion is

established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if

Court, or to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.

40

the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence." (Ibid.)

"[Q]uestions of interpretation or application of the requirements of CEQA are

matters of law." (City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of Calif. State University
(2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 355-356.) For example, in determining whether an
agency has proceeded as required by CEQA in deciding whether and when to
engage in environmental review, the Court has explained that:

Drawing this line raises predominantly a legal question, which

we answer independently from the agency whose decision is

under review. . .. [WJe determine de novo whether the agency

has employed the correct procedures, "scrupulously enforc[ing]

all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements" [citation].

(Save Tara v. City of Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 131 (alterations in
original), citing Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City

of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Ca1.4th 412, 435.)

In contrast, "[t]he substantial evidence standard is applied to

conclusions, findings and determinations. It also applies to challenges to the

scope of an EIR's analysis of a topic, the methodology used for studying an
impact and the reliability or accuracy of the data upon which the EIR relied

because these types of challenges involve factual questions." (Bakersfield
Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184,

1198.)

41

"In sum, although the agency's factual determinations are subject to

deferential review, questions of interpretation or application of the

requirements of CEQA are matters of law. [Citations.] While we may not

substitute our judgment for that of the decision makers, we must ensure strict
compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute." (Save Our

Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Bd. Of Supervisors (2001) 87

Cal.App.4th 99, 118.)

B. CEQA Must Be Interpreted Broadly and Strictly Enforced.

"CEQA was enacted to advance four related purposes: to (1) inform the

government and public about a proposed activity's potential significant

environmental impacts; (2) identify ways to reduce, or avoid, environmental

damage; (3) prevent environmental damage by requiring project changes via

alternatives or mitigation measures when feasible; and (4) disclose to the

public the rationale for governmental approval of a project that may

significantly impact the environment." (Tomlinson v. County of Alameda

(2012) 54 Cal.4th 281, 285-286 ("Tomlinson").)

To advance these four purposes, CEQA's dictates must be "strictly

enforced."(Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors of Santa Barbara

County (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1176.) "Only by requiring [the lead

agency] to fully comply with the letter of the law can a subversion of the

important public purposes of CEQA be avoided." (Id.) In turn, there is no

42

such thing as a "harmless error" under CEQA; any violation is "necessarily

prejudicial." (Resource Def. Fund v. Local Agency Formation Comm. of Santa

Cruz County (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-898.)

C. The Final EIR's Analysis of the Valley-Ivyglen Project's
Aesthetic Impacts Fails to Adequately Account for the
Degrading of Views to Residents and Patrons of
Commercial Developments in the City of Lake Elsinore

In Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. v. City of Encinitas
(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, the court confirmed that a substantial,
demonstrable negative aesthetic effect has a significant effect on the

environment:

"We further conclude it is inherent in the meaning of the word

*aesthetic' that any substantial, negative effect of a project on

view and other features of beauty could constitute a 'significant'

environmental impact under CEQA."

(Quail Botanical Gardens Foundation, Inc. V. City of Encinitas, supra, 29

Cal.App.4th at 1604.)

1. The Final EIR's Emphasis on Freeway Views Ignores
the Valley-Ivyglen Project's True Visual Impacts

CEQA implements state policy that government agencies "[t]ake all

action necessary to provide the people of this state with [] enjoyment of

aesthetic [] qualities, and freedom from excessive noise.." (Public Res. Code

§ 21001(b), emphasis added.) State policy also "[r]equire[s] government

43

agencies at all levels to consider qualitative factors" in CEQA documents and
not just quantitative factors. (Public Res. Code § 21001(g).) The Final EIR's
aesthetics analysis is fundamentally flawed and violates this policy in exactly

the same way that the noise analysis was flawed and violated it in Berkeley

Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of Port Comms. (2001) 91

Cal.App.4th 1344 ("Berkeley Jets").

In Berkeley Jets, the EIR used a single methodology to assess the
project's potential noise impacts: a quantitative methodology that exclude any

qualitative analysis of noise impacts on residents "in normally quiet residential
neighborhoods," such as disturbance of their sleep and "peaceful enjoyment
of our homes, gardens, and parks." (Id., at pp. 1372-1375.) When area

residents and the Cities of San Leandro and Alameda protested this, the EIR

preparers were "steadfast and consistent" in rebuffing those protests, insisting

that the EIR need not address or mitigate noise impacts that occurred outside

of the noise "corridor" addressed by the EIR's quantitative noise analysis. (Id.,

at pp. 1372-1383) Citing the foregoing CEQA policies, the Berkeley Jets court
rejected the EIR's single quantitative analysis, finding it deficient for failing
to qualitatively analyze noise impacts to residents outside the noise corridor

the EIR studied. (Id.)

Repeating the mistakes the Berkeley Jets EIR made in addressing noise

impacts, the Final EIR incorrectly assumed that the only significant visual

44

impacts created by the Valley-Ivyglen Project are those associated with how

the transmission lines will be viewed from the Interstate 15 and State Route 74

highway corridors and thus relied on the Federal Highway Administration's

1988 Visual Impact Assessment for Highway Projects while using no other

criteria for measuring the Project's aesthetic impacts. In doing so, the Final
EIR ignored the fact that over eleven miles of proposed transmission lines will
be within the City's municipal boundaries, while virtually none of the
transmission lines within the City will be within the Interstate 15 and State
Route 74 highway corridors. Consequently, the Valley-Ivyglen Project is
simply ill-suited for analysis using criteria developed for the federal interstate
highway system--and outdated criteria to boot.
Further, this emphasis on views from highway corridors as opposed to

the degradation of City residents' and retail patrons' views where the lines will
actually be located can be seen by the photographs included (and excluded) in

the Final EIR:

"Most views focus on the foreground with hills and

mountains in the middleground and background.

Context photos 9 through 17, and 24-28 (Figures

4.1-2c-e) depict the variety of views within the landscape

unit. Lake Elsinore is visible in the middleground from

a variety of vantage points, as shown in context photo 24

45

(Figure 4.1-2d). The City of Lake Elsinore has identified

six vantage points in its General Plan, as described below

in Section 4.1.1.4, 'Scenic Vistas' (City of Lake Elsinore

2011). Context photo 24 (Figure 4.1-2d) shows the view

from Vantage Point 1, located at I-15 just west of

Railroad Canyon Road, where motorists can see Lake

Elsinore." (2PE4:293.)

Context photos 9-17 and 24-28 contain a total of 14 photographs from

different points in the City, but only one of them includes a small portion of

a residential area. (2PE4:297, 299, Figures 4.1-2c and 4.1-2e.) None of the

photographs depict any significant retail development. Yet, current and future
development throughout the City will be substantially impacted aesthetically

by the Valley-Ivyglen Project.

Additionally, the Final EIR ignores "viewer sensitivity" by people

viewing the transmission lines in retail centers and only makes a passing

reference to "homeowners":

"Viewer sensitivity is high for views seen by people who

are driving for pleasure; people engaging in recreational

activities, such as hiking, biking, or camping; and

homeowners. Viewer sensitivity tends to be lower for

views seen by people driving to and from work, as part

46

of their work, or engaged in personal business activities

(USFS 1995; FHWA 1988) [] Views from recreation

trails and areas, scenic highways, scenic overlooks, and

residential areas are generally assessed as having high

viewer sensitivity." (2PE4:293.)

The Final EIR addresses what it calls "viewer groups" that it identifies

as those "that would have views of the proposed projects." (2PE4:302.) The

viewer groups are identified and their sensitivity to the views of the Projects
are then listed in Table 4.1-1. (2PE4:302-303.) However, the only viewer
groups identified are "motorists," "motorist and other travelers" and
"recreationists." (2PE4:302-303, Table 4.1-1.) No mention is made of the
tens of thousands of City residents visually impacted by the Valley-Ivyglen
Project in their community or visual impacts to current and future commercial

developments.

The Final EIR addresses "significance criteria" at page 4.1-43.

(2PE4:334.) While scenic vistas are considered, missing again from the

analysis are impacts to residences and retail centers.

Also missing from the Final EIR's aesthetics analysis are viewpoints

outside highway corridors and from streets within the City in which there are

no existing overhead transmission lines and streets that have overhead lines on

only one side of the street. The proposed Projects' plan to install lines where

47

none currently exist at all and to add a second set of poles and lines in areas

where only one set exists across the street will substantially degrade the

existing visual character and quality of those City streets. The EIR's aesthetics

analysis also fails to account for City streets that have existing modest

transmission lines capable of future undergrounding at a reasonable cost that

will now be burdened with a set of dual transmission lines foreclosing a

financially viable potential for any future undergrounding.

In the instances in which the Final EIR does disclose visual impacts,

that disclosure demonstrates indifference to local impacts within the City in the

same way the EIR in Berkeley Jets was indifferent to noise impacts outside the

noise corridor it analyzed. The Final EIR's analysis of Key Viewpoint

("KV") 8 is emblematic of this approach. (2PE4:326, Figure 4.1-4i.) The City

carefully conditioned the retail and commercial centers bordered by Third

Street and Pasadena Avenue to underground utilities, as demonstrated by the

retail center shown in KV 8 at the corner of Central and Pasadena. (2PE4:326,

Figure 4.1-4i.) Those commercial and retail businesses have thrived in this

modern business center which meets the aesthetic expectations of both its

owners, their patrons, and the community. The Valley-Ivyglen Project lays

waste to those expectations as both it and the Alberhill Project propose running

transmission lines on double circuit poles down Third Street the entire length

of Pasadena Avenue (ASP 3/VIG 4). (1PE3:199, Figure 2.5b.)

48

Despite the City's efforts to successfully implement development of

aesthetically pleasing neighborhoods and retail centers in which utilities are

routinely undergrounded as exemplified on Pasadena Avenue, the Final EIR's

response in effect says: "we don't think anyone will notice these transmission

lines." (2PE4:326, Figure 4.1-4i.) Using the outdated and inapplicable federal

guidelines for interstate freeways and scenic highways, the Final EIR

concludes that visual impacts in the City's prime business park are somehow

"moderately low because it is experienced mostly by people working or
traveling in the area for work or personal business." (2PE4:313.)

This bias against impacts experienced by both local businesses and the

local community is further exemplified in "moderately low" visual sensitivity
attributable to the installation of taller power lines on Auto Center Drive (Key

Viewpoint 13) "because it is experienced on a regular basis by a moderate

ber of viewers consisting primarily of local residents, workers, commuters,

and people engaged in shopping and business activities who are focused on the

activities they are engaged in, rather than the surrounding views."4 (2PE4:31,

Figure 4.1-4n; 2PE4:315, Table 4.1-2.) If the Final EIR dismisses the

4 Apparently sensing its indifference to viewer impacts was a bit too
obvious, the Final EIR changed the phrase in the Draft EIR from "who would
not have a high concern for visual changes" to "who are focused on the
activities they are engaged in, rather than the surrounding views." As the City
understands this change, viewers have gone from not caring about the view in
the Draft EIR to being too busy to care about the view in the Final EIR.

49

sensibilities of residents, workers, commuters and persons engaged in

commerce within the City, whose sensibilities are left to consider when

assessing visual impacts?

In sum, the Final EIR's aesthetic analysis is premised on a position that

any aesthetic appeal to undergrounding utilities in neighborhoods and

commercial centers is simply illusory. Those users, according to the Final

EIR, will simply not notice above-ground poles and transmission lines because

they are preoccupied with other tasks. (2PE4:315, Table 4.1-2.) This point of

view stands in stark contrast to the development expectations of virtually every

city in California, which routinely mandate the undergrounding of utilities in

new subdivisions and commercial centers. Such undergrounding is performed

routinely because undergrounding of utilities is consistent with the

community's aesthetic sense and expectations for new development.

2. The "Yardstick" Used to Measure Visual
Impacts Is Outdated and Has Been Rejected
by the Federal Agency that Created It

Why did the Final EIR miss the mark on the Projects' aesthetic

impacts? Because it utilized an outdated 1988 aesthetic standard - now over

30 years old - that even its author, the Federal Highway Administration, has

abandoned.' (2PE4:292, referencing the Visual Impact Assessment of Highway

5 Final EIR, at p. 4.1-1, referencing the Visual Impact Assessment of
Highway Projects, Federal Highway Administration, Publication No. FHWA-
HA-88-054. See City's Motion to Request Judicial Notice, Exhibit 2.

50

Projects, Federal Highway Administration, Publication No. FHWA-HA-88-

054; see also 7PE35:3906 [City's Motion to Request Judicial Notice] and

7PE36:4003 [Exhibit 2 to motion].) The Federal Highway Administration's

2015 replacement Guidelines for the Visual Impact Assessment of Highway

Projects acknowledge that the 1988 guidelines as antiquated: "The new

guidelines recommend engaging the public to a higher degree than earlier VIA

methods, to achieve a better understanding of how people define visual quality

and how they interpret changes to it." (7PE36:4016, Guidelines for the Visual

Impact Assessment of Highway Projects, January 2015, Federal Highway

Administration, Publication No. FHWA-HEP-15-029, 7PE36:4008 [Exhibit 3

to City's Motion to Request Judicial Notice].)

The City expressly informed the Commission of the Federal Highway

Administration's abandonment of the 1988 visual assessment guidelines used

in the Draft EIR and further informed the Commission of the updated 2015

guideline in the City's comment letter to the Draft EIR. (5PE9:1748.) The

initial Response to Comments to the City's comment letter failed to address the

rationale for using the outdated 1988 study but belatedly did so over a year a

later in an errata to the Final EIR. (6PE11:3015.) By failing to engage the

public and instead relying on outdated and inapplicable guidelines for the

51

Valley-Ivyglen Project, the Final EIR consistently understates the projects'

visual impacts.6

The use of the 1988 assessment guideline here is remarkably similar to

the facts in Berkeley Jets, where the EIR relied on a 1991 study evaluating

toxic air contaminates ("TAC"). However, during the comment period, the
lead agency was alerted by a commentor that the 1991 study had been updated

in 1994. Despite being placed on notice of an updated standard, the final EIR

failed to acknowledge the updated standards. The court found this a clear error

under CEQA:

"the use in the final EIR of data extrapolated from

CARB's 1991 speciation profile # 508 for measuring

aircraft emission of TAC's did not meet the standard of

'a good faith effort at full disclosure' required by CEQA.

(Guidelines, § 15151.) 'Where comments from

responsible experts or sister agencies disclose new or

conflicting data or opinions that cause concern that the

agency may not have fully evaluated the project and its

alternatives, these comments may not simply be ignored.

There must be good faith, reasoned analysis in

Appendix M, part M3 Local, beginning on page 9.)

52

response.' (Cleary v. County of Stanislaus (1981) 118

Cal. App. 3d 348, 357 [173 Cal. Rptr. 390], original

italics.) By using scientifically outdated information

derived from the 1991 profile, we conclude the EIR was

not a reasoned and good faith effort to inform

decisionmakers and the public about the increase in TAC

emissions that will occur as a consequence of the Airport

expansion."

(Berkeley Jets, supra, at p. 1367.)

In turn, the Final EIR's use of outdated standards ripples through its

analysis of visual impacts. The lack of adequate analysis of the impact of

above-ground transmission lines from the Valley-Ivyglen Project in residential

and retail locations is especially noteworthy in two areas within the City.

The first area is part of the Valley-Ivyglen (or "VIG") Project and is in
the area designated VIG 3 and VIG 4 at and near where these segments meet

at a right angle. KV 8 is 8 located along VIG 4 just north of where VIG 3 and 4
meet. KV 8 depicts the intersection of Pasadena Street and Central Avenue,

a retail area. The Figure 4.1-4i photograph of this intersection and

accompanying visual simulation show the significant aesthetic impact the

poles and transmission lines will have in this area where currently there are no

lines. In spite of the obvious significant impact on aesthetics, the Final EIR

53

concludes that visual sensitivity in this area is "[m]oderately low because it is

experience [sic] mostly by people working or traveling in the area for work or

personal business; the area is not a main thoroughfare used to access

residential or recreational areas." (2PE4:313.) Importantly, this analysis

ignores the obvious impact to the retail area itself and how the poles

transmission lines would be viewed by patrons of the businesses at this

location. There is no discussion of the possibility of undergrounding.

The second area contains transmission lines for both the Valley-Ivyglen

Project and the other project discussed in the Fianl EIR, the Alberhill System

Project (or "ASP") at VIG and ASP 2, beginning in the north at KV 6 and

KV 7 and extending south to the point where each of these segments end, just

east of the Fogarty Substation. Final EIR Figures 4.1-4g and 4.1-4h show

photographs and visual simulations where one set of transmission lines in each

Figure is to be replaced by two, much taller and visually more invasive

transmission lines. (2PE4:324-325.) While the Final EIR concedes that visual

sensitivity is "moderately high" at KV 6 and KV 7, there is no analysis of

undergrounding in this area. (2PE4:313.) In addition, no analysis of visual

impacts south 6 of KV 6 and KV 7 is provided in this segment, even though the

City's General Plan contemplates residential development south of KV 6 and 6

KV 7. (7PE36:4021,4023, City of Lake Elsinore General Plan, adopted

December 13, 2011, 1.0 Alberhill District and 3.0 Business District.)

54

3. The Final EIR's Aesthetic Analysis Is Based on
Single Circuit Lines/Pole Configurations Even
though Much of the Valley-Ivyglen Project within
the City Will Be Configured on Double Circuit Poles

The Final EIR's visual impact analysis is premised on its review of the

simulated views. (2PE4:318-333, Figures 4.1-4a through 4.1-4p .) The City

has had much to say about both the paucity of views analyzed within key

viewpoints within the City and the 1988 Federal Highway Administration

"yardstick" used for measuring those visual impacts. But there is another

problem: the simulated views are wrong.
Key Viewpoints (KV).6 and KV 7 show simulated single circuit poles

marching two-by-two down Lake Street in Lake Elsinore. (2PE4:324, 325,

Figures 4.1-4g and 4.1-4h.) KV 8 shows a simulated single circuit lines and

poles running along Pasadena A venue in Lake Elsinore which is currently fully

undergrounded. (2PE4:326, Figure 4.1-4i .)

The Final EIR, however, correctly acknowledges that the combined

Valley-Ivyglen Project, when coupled with the Alberhill Project, will hang a
second circuit on the powerline poles. (1PE3:203.)

Is there a material difference between a visual impacts of single circuit

poles versus double circuit poles? As a point of beginning, there certainly is

a difference. The Final EIR shows depictions of several single circuit poles

and only one double circuit pole on Figure 2-4. (1PE3:193.)

55

Here is the depiction from the Final EIR (1PE3:193, Figure 2-4) of a

single circuit pole (see pole on far left) that appears to have been used for
purposes of the visual simulations for KV 6, 7 and 8:

Here is the depiction of the only double circuit 115 kV pole depicted in the

Final EIR. (1PE3:193, Figure 2-4.)

NOTTO SCALE Minimura

56

The double circuit poles necessarily include three additional

transmission lines along with the additional pole arms.' The City submited

that the additional lines and pole arms are sufficiently impactful (that is, the

cumulative impact) that it alone could swing the visual impact analysis from

"less than significant" to "significant."

But the PUC was characteristically unmoved.

"To the contrary, as clarified in the errata to the EIR, the visual

simulation for Key Viewpoint 13 (Figure 4.1-4n) provides an

example of the incremental impact associated with adding an

additional circuit to the proposed Valley-Ivyglen structures. The

EIR's conclusion that these changes would be incremental and

would not raise the level of significance beyond that disclosed

under AES-3 (VIG) is reasonable."

(1PE1:28.)

Notably, this Court recently rejected an EIR for similarly failing to

accurately inform the public of a project's potential biological impacts, finding

such failure constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion. (See Banning Ranch

Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.) Such is also the

7 The City acknowledges that the depictions are not "apples to apples" in that the light weight steel single circuit poles shown in the first depiction are
made of different material than the tubular steel pole contained in the second
depiction. We could not locate a depiction of a sample 115 kV double circuit light weight steel pole in the Final EIR.

57

case here, with the PUC deceiving the public by not providing them with the

correct basic powerline configuration in the view simulation that forms the

very basis for the EIR's visual impact assessment and then nonchalantly

dismissing the additional impacts as "incremental."

D. The Final EIR Fails to Adequately Address
Alternatives to the Valley-Ivyglen Project,
Especially with Regards to Undergrounding

CEQA requires the adoption of all feasible alternatives and mitigation

measures that substantially reduce the environmental impacts of projects.

(Public Res. Code § 21002; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a).) The fact that an

alternative may be more expensive or less profitable is not sufficient to show

that the alternative is financially infeasible. (Center for Biological Diversity

v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 883.)

CEQA also requires an EIR to include a reasonable range of

alternatives to the project or to the location of the project which reduce the

environmental impacts of the project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a);

Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553.)

Further, "the discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project

or its location which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any

significant effects of the project, even if these alternatives would impede to

some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly."

(CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b).)

58

The proposed Projects include the undergrounding of transmission lines

outside the City. Indeed, VIG Alternatives B-1, B-2, C, and M all involve

undergrounding. (1PE3:278, 280, sections 3.3.2, 3.3.3, 3.3.4, and 3.3.5

thereto.)

Originally, "the Alternatives Screening Report considered 14

alternatives for the proposed Valley-Ivyglen Project and retained 9 of those

alternatives for consideration in the EIR. The Alternatives Screening Report

considered 33 alternatives for the Alberhill Project and retained five of those

alternatives for consideration in the EIR." (1PE3:273.) Of the nine VIG

project alternatives, three more were eliminated as identified on Page 3-4 of

the Final EIR, leaving only Alternatives B1, B2, C, M, and the no project

alternative for consideration in the Final EIR. (1PE3:275-276.) Of the five

ASP project alternatives, three more were eliminated as identified on page 3-5

of the Final EIR, leaving only Alternatives B, DD, and the no project
alternative for consideration in the Final EIR. (Ibid.)

Alternatives B1, B2, and C to the Valley-Ivyglen Project all involved

undergrounding in areas outside the City of Lake Elsinore. (1PE3:155.)

Though it analyzes undergrounding alternatives in certain areas, the Final EIR

never presents any undergrounding through Lake Elsinore, other than

Alternative M to the Valley-Ivyglen Project which calls for undergrounding

the entire VIG project. (1PE3:280.)

59

Clearly, then, undergrounding is technically feasible. And

undergrounding the 115 kV lines, at least through portions of Lake Elsinore,
would reduce impacts to aesthetics, socioeconomic issues, and urban decay to

less than significant.

The Final EIR's analysis of Land Use and Planning for Alternative M

states that "[u]ndergrounding the entire alignment would neither create nor

avoid a land use conflict that would result in significant environmental

impacts. Impacts would be the same under this alternative as for the proposed

project." (2PE4:824.) This conclusion is clearly false.

The undergrounding of the proposed Projects would avoid many of the

land use conflicts of the proposed Projects. Only by manipulating the aesthetic

impact analysis by using the Federal Highway Administration's outdated 1988

visual impact assessment guidelines was the Final EIR able to reach the

preposterous conclusion that undergrounding was an environmental "wash"

when compared to the proposed Projects.

In summary, the Final EIR fails to comply with CEQA's directive to

"describe a reasonable range of alternatives to the project, or to the location of
the project." (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a).)

60

E. The PUC's Blanket Exclusion of Evidence
of Significant Environmental Impacts,
Mitigation Measures, and Alternatives at the
Evidentiary Hearings Is an Abuse of Discretion

In order for a party to exhaust its administrative remedies, Public

Resources section 21177(a) requires that the alleged grounds for

noncompliance with CEQA must have been presented to the agency either

during the public comment period provided by CEQA or before the close of

the public hearing on the project.

Courts of appeal have generally interpreted Public Resources section

21177(a) to allow project opponents to present evidence and objections at any

time before the close of the public hearing on the project. (See Tracy First v.
City of Tracy (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 912 ("Tracy First") [objections

submitted during public hearing on EIR certification and project approval];
Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124
Cal.App.4th 1184, 1199 ("Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control") [objections

submitted at public hearing on project approval held after EIR was certified];

Galante Vineyards v. Monterey Peninsula Water Mgmt. Dist. ("Galante

Vineyards") (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 1109, 1120 [objections submitted at public

hearing before EIR's certification].)

The PUC, however, a operates with a decidedly different set of ad hoc

rules. On April 28, 2016, ALJ Hallie Yachnin advised the public that its one

61

and only opportunity to address deficiencies in the draft EIR would be only

during the draft EIR's public review period:

"The final EIR will include and address all such comments, and

will be admitted into the evidentiary record of this proceeding.

Accordingly, as will be further explained at the prehearing

conference, I do not anticipate taking further evidence regarding

the identification of significant environmental impacts,

mitigation measures and alternatives, and the environmentally

superior alternative (i.e., issues no. 1, 2 and 3), beyond the final

EIR. Therefore, any person who wishes to present evidence on

the environmental impacts of the proposed project and
alternatives, recommended mitigation, and the environmentally
superior alternative must do so through public comment on the

draft EIR."

(6PE20:3600; italics in original.)

Commissioner Guzman Aceves hammered home that the Commission

would not, under any circumstances, entertain evidence of the EIR's deficiency

at the evidentiary hearing:

"The EIR addresses issues through 3. CEQA requires the

opportunity for the public to comment on the draft EIR, and

requires the final EIR to consider and address each and every

62

comment that is received, pursuant to the process and

procedures of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. (Title 14

C.C.R. Chapter 3.) Given this process under CEQA, the

Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ's) April 28, 2016 ruling gave

notice that no evidence would be taken regarding the

identification of significant environmental impacts, mitigation

measures and alternatives, and the environmentally superior

alternative 1 (i.e., issues 1 through 3) beyond the final EIR, and

that any person who wished to present information regarding

those issues should do so through public comment on the draft

EIR. We will not take further evidence on these issues."

(6PE21:3605.)

Despite this admonition, both the City and The Utility Reform Network

("TURN") submitted direct (written) testimony that indirectly implicated the

EIR's alternative analysis. But ALJ Yacknin would have none of it and struck

the submitted testimony. (6PE14:3066-3068.) The evidentiary hearing was

held on October 17, 18, and 19, 2017. (6PE14:3064; 6PE15:3249;

6PE16:3364.) In keeping with the Scoping Memo, no evidence regarding
project environmental impacts, feasible mitigation measurers, or alternatives

was permitted at the evidentiary hearing. (6PE14:3066-3068.)

63

The City submits that this blanket prohibition violates the four core

principals of CEQA enunciated by this Court in Tomlinson,$ is inconsistent

with the lower court rulings in Tracy First, Bakersfield Citizens for Local
Control, and Galante Vineyards discussed above, and violates the PUC's own

rules.

Petitioner recognizes the holding in Mount Shasta Bioregional Ecology

Ctr. v. County of Siskiyou (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 184 that an agency may

reject evidence submitted before its hearing if its rules require evidence to be
provided before the hearing. There, the county had adopted by resolution

specific rules. One rule required that all documentary evidence be submitted

at least five days before the applicable hearing. The CEQA petitioner had
submitted a 16-page letter with 101 pages of supporting literature as its only
evidence of an air quality emissions issues the day before the public hearing
at the county. The court held that the county was within its rights to exclude

the letter from board of supervisors' consideration of the project. (Id., at

pp. 201-202 ["The Board excluded the letter from the evidence before it for

consideration. Absent error in this regard, the letter is not properly part of the
record before us on review of the Board's decision."].)

8 See this Court's identification in Tomlinson, infra at III.B., p. 42, of
CEQA's four related purposes.

64

Except for its ad hoc process of systematically excluding evidence of

significant environmental impacts, mitigation measures and alternatives at

evidentiary hearings exemplified in the proceeding below, the PUC has no
such similar "rule" and has not gone through the critical rulemaking process

necessary to impose such a rule. With respect to compliance with CEQA, the

PUC's Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 2.4 regarding CEQA

compliance states that:

"Applications for authority to undertake any projects that are
subject to the California Environmental Quality Act of 1970,

Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq. (CEQA) and the

guidelines for implementation of CEQA, California Code of

Regulations, Title 14, Sections 15000 et seq., shall be consistent

with these codes and this rule."

(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 20, § 2.4, subd. (a).)

The commitment to comply with CEQA found in section 2.4 of the
PUC's Rules and Procedures is not accompanied with any sort of authorized

blanket exclusion of evidence of significant environmental impacts, mitigation

measures and alternatives, and the environmentally superior alternative.

Notably, the PUC's rules regarding the issuance of scoping memos

neither contemplates nor authorizes the blanket exclusion of evidence:

65

"7.3. (Rule 7.3) Scoping Memos. The assigned Commissioner

shall issue the scoping memo for the proceeding, which shall

determine the schedule (with projected submission date) and

issues to be addressed. In an adjudicatory or ratesetting

proceeding in which there is evidentiary hearing, the scoping

memo shall also designate the presiding officer. In a proceeding

initiated by application or order instituting rulemaking, the

scoping memo shall also determine the category and need for

hearing."

(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 20, § 7.3.)

Indeed, the only blanket exclusion imposed on PUC evidentiary

hearings is the exclusion of any "discussion, admission, concession or offer to

settle, whether oral or written, made during any negotiation on a settlement...."

(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 20, § 12.6.)

At the bottom of this is a process in which CEQA is to seen but not

heard. The record here with its thousands of pages of CEQA documents is the

veneer of compliance. Those commentors - and here there were hundreds -

are nicely packed away at the close of the draft EIR comment period with a

process designed to ensure they are not substantively heard from again.

(5PE9:1705-2242; 6PE10:2244-3014.)

66

CONCLUSION

The Legislature has mandated in CEQA that "all agencies of the state

government which regulate activities ... [that] affect the quality of the

environment, shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given

to preventing environmental damage." (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, subd.

(g).) Because the Public Utilities Commission failed to comply with CEQA

prior to issuing its Final Decision, the City respectfully asks this Court to grant

its petition for writ of mandate/petition for writ of review as prayed.
