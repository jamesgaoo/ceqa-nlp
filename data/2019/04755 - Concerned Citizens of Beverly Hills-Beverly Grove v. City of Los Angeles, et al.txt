VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1. Petitioner, CONCERNED CITIZENS OF BEVERLY HILLS/BEVERLY GROVE

2 ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
3 Declarative and Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION 4

5 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
6 "Respondent") of the certification of a Negative Declaration and exemption determination for a
7 proposed ordinance regulating "home-sharing" activity in the City of Los Angeles (the "Project"

8 or "Ordinance"). As noted below, implementation of the Project will have substantial adverse
9 impacts on the environment.
10 2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the,

§ 11 actions, resolutions, ordinances, and findings related to the Project, as well as the Negative Channel Law Group, d11 LIZ06 12 Declaration and exemption determination considered by Respondent. The Project was approved
8 eyns "pAE eJJysIIM 00Z8 13 by the City of Los Angeles on or about December 11, 2018. Petitioner requests that the Court
SII!H AUeAS 14 vacate the Project because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
15 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA")
16 and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
17 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
18 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside the Ordinance
19 and the certification of the Negative Declaration and exemption determination because
20 Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.
PARTIES 21

22 4. Petitioner, Concerned Citizens of Beverly Hills/Beverly Grove, is an
23 unincorporated association dedicated to the protection of both the community and the
24 environment in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. Petitioner and its respective members have :
25 direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating
26 to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
27

2 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to

2 assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' environmental

3 interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.

4 5. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is charter city incorporated under the laws of
5 the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality
6 Act ("CEQA").

7 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein

9 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named 8 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.

10 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
11 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings § d11 'dnoJg MET |euueuO -LZ06 12 alleged in this Petition.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 13 8 eyns "pAa eJJysi!M 00Z: 14 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code SIl!H Auereg 15 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
16 8. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the
17 Code of Civil Procedure.

18 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
19 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County.
PROJECT 20

21 10. The Project is a proposed ordinance that would legalize so-called "home sharing"
22 in the City of Los Angeles. Among other things, the Home Sharing Ordinance ("Ordinance" or
23  "Project") would amend various provisions of the Municipal Code and Administrative Code to
24 authorize short-term rentals of less than 30 days and impose regulations to permit the sharing
25 one's primary residence.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1. PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

3 Declaration on June 14, 2016. The City received numerous written comments during the public 11. The City prepared an Initial Study for the Project and published a draft Negative

4 comment period including from Petitioner.

12. Notwithstanding the fact that the City had conducted an Initial Study for the
6 Project, the City nonetheless determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to the 5

7

8 13. The Project was considered by various commission and committees over the "common sense exemption."

9 course of three years, including the City Planning Commission, Planning and Land Use
10 Management Committee and Housing Committee. The Ordinance was modified various times as

11 a result of these hearings. Ultimately, the Ordinance was approved by the City Council on or § d17 Group, MET |ouueyO L LZ06 14. On or about December 14, 2018 the City filed both a Notice of Determination 12 about December 11, 2018.

8 eyns "pAg ENJySIM 00Z8 SIl!H Beverly 14 ("NOD") and Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the Project with the County Recorder. 13

15 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

16 15. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

18 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 17 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

19 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
20 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
21 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
23| otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with 22 of projects,

24 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
25 16. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
26 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
27

4 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1. provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
2  project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,
3 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse effect on the
5 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially

6 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to

7 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures

8 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
9avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make
10 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those
11 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable. § d11 'dnoJo Me lauueyo 12 17. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an EIR is built into L1Z06
8 Buns "paa eJjysi!m ooZ: 13 CEQA. This presumption is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under
'SIl!H Auenag 14 which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports
a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
16 environment. The fair argument standard applies both to agency decisions and to judicial review 15

17 of those decisions. Agencies apply the fair argument standard as a substantive standard in

19 the fair argument standard as a standard of judicial review for agency decisions to adopt a 18 deciding whether an EIR or a negative declaration is required. Courts apply

Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause 20 negative declaration.
21

a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency must prepare an EIR. An EIR may be 18.

23 dispensed with only if the lead agency finds no substantial evidence in the initial study or 22

24 elsewhere in the record that the project may significantly affect the environment. Without such
25 evidence, the agency must adopt a negative declaration. "Significant effect upon the
26 environment" is defined as "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the

5 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

environment." A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
2  "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. If any aspect of the project
3 may result in a significant impact on the environment, an EIR must be prepared even if the
overall effect of the project is beneficial. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of

5 an EIR. If substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant
environmental effect, the lead agency must prepare an EIR even if other substantial evidence
7 before it indicates the project will have no significant effect.
8 19. An argument that a project may have a significant environmental effect must be

9 based on relevant evidence sufficient to support that conclusion. An EIR is not required if there
10 is no substantial evidence in the record showing the project may cause significant adverse
11 impacts. § • d11 'dnoJo Mel |auueyo 12 20. The fair argument standard is very different from the standard normally followed 41706 13 8 S NS "PAE HUJJUSIIM 0OZ8 by public agencies in their decision making. Ordinarily, public agencies weigh the evidence in
'SW!H 1uasag 14 the record and reach a decision based on a preponderance of the evidence.
15 fair argument standard, by contrast, prevents the lead agency from weighing competing evidence
16 to determine who has a better argument concerning the likelihood or extent of a potential
17 environmental impact.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 18

19 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Negative Declaration Does Not Suffice; EIR Required)
20 21. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
21 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
22 22. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
23 the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and
24 comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide
25 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider
26 environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
27

6 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

23. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to conduct an EIR for the Project.
2 Respondent erroneously concluded that a Negative Declaration was the appropriate
3 environmental clearance document. Substantial evidence in the record supports
a fair argument that project may have a significant effect on the environment. Among other
things, Respondent failed to recognize the potentially significant environmental effects of the
Project on many environmental factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
/ Population/Housing, Land Use/Planning , and Public Services.

8 24. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
by certifying an environmental clearance document that does not comply with CEQA and by
10 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the
11 Negative Declaration and approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION LLZ06 Channsl laws oroupu ie 300 Suns pAla aulusi!m ooZg 12

13 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption) 8
SII!H ALEAES 14 25. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
15 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
16 26. The City improperly concluded that the project qualified for an exemption under
17 CEQA. Specifically, the City determined that the Project qualified for the "common sense"
18 exemption. This was in error because this exemption is only reserved for situations where it can
19 be seen with certainty that there is a no possibility that a project may not have a significant effect
20 on the environment. The correspondence received from the public regarding the impacts of short
21 term rentals does not support the use of the common sense exemption.
22 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEOA PROCEEDING
23 27. On January 14, 2019, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel,
24 served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
25 against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter
26 providing such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this

reference. This letter satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

2 28. On January 14, 2019, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California

4 correct copy of this Petition. A copy of such notice (without the copy of this Petition attached to 3 Attorney General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and

5 such notice) is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this reference.

6 Such notice satisfies Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and
7 California Code of Civil Procedure, section 388.
PREPARATION OF THE RECORD 8

9 29. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to
10 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner is
11 filing a notice of its election to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is § d71 'dnoJg MET (uueyd - 1706 12 attached as Exhibit C.
