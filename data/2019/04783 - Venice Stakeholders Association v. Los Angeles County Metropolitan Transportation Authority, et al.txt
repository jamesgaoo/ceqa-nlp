VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

In support of its Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate (the
2 "Petition"), petitioner Venice Stakeholders Association, a California corporation
3 (*Petitioner") alleges as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6

7 1. In this action, Petitioner respectfully petitions for a peremptory writ of
8 mandate and other appropriate orders to invalidate the action on February 28, 2019, by the
9 Board of Directors of the respondent Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
10 Authority (*MTA Board") adopting a motion to instruct the Chief Executive Officer of
11 MTA to enter into a no-fee lease agreement with the City for the former bus maintenance
12 yard owned by MTA at 100 E. Sunset Avenue in the Venice neighborhood of the City (the
13 "Project Site"), pursuant to which the City would then construct and operate a homeless
14 shelter (the "City Project"). The motion approved by the MTA Board (the "Motion") is
15 itself a "project" under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code sec.
16 21000-21177) ("CEQA"). The Petition is made on the ground that the MTA, by approving
17 the lease, violated CEQA.
18

19 2. The City Project consists of a 154-bed shelter for homeless persons
20 and associated facilities, to be operated by the City, or an outside service provider retained
21 by the City, on the Project Site. Such facilities include, among other things, a large semi-
22 permanent "tent" building which will act as a dormitory for 100 persons, a large outdoor
23 dining area, a large outdoor kennel for residents' pets, and numerous additional buildings
24 to house additional persons and offices for staff, service providers and other personnel.
25

26 3. The Project Site is surrounded by residential neighborhoods on all
27 four sides, and some residences are as little as 30 feet from the tent-like structures and
28
-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR
PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

V outdoor facilities that form the core of the Project. These residences are particularly
2 susceptible to the noise, traffic, parking and other impacts that would arise from the

3 construction and operation of the Project. In addition, residential neighbors reasonably

4 anticipate that the operation of a large homeless shelter will act as a magnet for homeless
5 individuals and encampments, with resulting adverse impacts on persons and the
6 environment, including noise, litter, discharge of sewage, and public safety.

7

8 4. Despite the many potential impacts of the City Project, the MTA
9 Board did not perform any review under CEQA before approving the Motion. Instead, at
10 the last moment an amendment was made to the Motion which purportedly adopted the
11 CEQA determinations made by the City during its own approval process for the City
12 Project, even though those determinations were never disclosed to the public in advance or
13 considered by the MTA Board.
14

15 5. The MTA Board's February 28, 2019, action approving the Motion
16 was final and not further appealable.
17

18 6. As pled more particularly below, Petitioner hereby petitions this Court
19 for (1) a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5 of the
20 California Public Resources Code and sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the California Code of
21 Civil Procedure requiring that the MTA Board set aside the Motion; (2) a permanent
22 injunction against the MTA, the MTA Board and the City from allowing or undertaking
23 any activities concerning the Motion, the Project Site or the City Project until the MTA
24 Board has complied with CEQA; and (3) while this litigation is pending, a preliminary
25 injunction prohibiting the MTA, the MTA Board and the City from allowing or
26 undertaking any activities concerning the Motion, the Project Site or the City Project.
