INTRODUCTION

2 1. On or about June 27, 2019, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife
3 ("CDFW") approved and entered into a Dispute Resolution Agreement ("DRA" or

4 "Agreement") concerning the proposed Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19
5 project ("Village 14 Project") in unincorporated San Diego County. The Agreement commits

6 CDFW to transfer public lands in the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve to the private Village 14
7 Project developer for development, and to take other actions to facilitate an agreed alternative to
8 the Village 14 Project ("DRA Project") - all without any public review and without conducting
9 any analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). CDFW's decision to
10 give up protections for a wide swath of pristine San Diego backcountry and to support the DRA
11 Project without any public input or environmental review violates CEQA.
12 2. The Village 14 Project has been under consideration by the County for over two
13 years. GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P., the site owner, and Jackson Pendo Development Company,
14 its agent and manager (collectively, "Jackson Pendo"), are seeking to construct 1,119 single-
15 family houses on nearly 1,300 acres. The project includes development of sensitive habitat
16 known as PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. The Village 14 Project would locate 340 houses on these 200
17 acres.

18 3. Throughout the County's administrative review of the Village 14 Project, CDFW
19 submitted comments objecting to development on PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. In the 1990s, CDFW
20 and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") approved a Multiple Species Conservation
21 Program ("MSCP") for San Diego County, which establishes habitat preserves and other
22 mitigation necessary to allow the County to authorize limited development that results in the
23 incidental take of endangered and other protected species. Under the MSCP and the associated
24 County Subarea Plan, PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 were designated as preserve or "no take
25 authorized" lands. CDFW informed the County that the County was prohibited from authorizing
26 development of PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 pursuant to the MSCP and its implementing plans and
27 agreements. Nevertheless, the County approved the Village 14 project. Petitioners have
28 separately filed suit challenging that approval.
3
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 4. Notwithstanding its concerns, CDFW proceeded to work with Jackson Pendo
2 behind closed doors. CDFW ultimately agreed to take action to support a completely
3 reconfigured project-the DRA Project- -by which Jackson Pendo will withdraw development
4 plans for PV-1 and a portion of PV-3 and certain other portions of the Village 14 project in

5 exchange for CDFW allowing the development of PV-2 and a portion of PV-3, and transferring

6 currently protected public lands within the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve to Jackson Pendo
7 for development. In other words, CDFW agreed to give a private developer protected lands

8 within a state ecological reserve, and to allow development on lands currently protected by the

9 MSCP -all in exchange for the developer's agreement not to develop lands that are already
10 protected by the MSCP.

11 5. Before entering into this startling agreement, CDFW took no steps to comply with
12 CEQA. CDFW prepared no analysis of environmental impacts for the public or decisionmakers,
13 made none of the required CEQA findings, and took no other procedural steps necessary to
14 comply with the statute. The Agreement states that "CDFW will rely on the County-certified
15 Project EIR for its consideration of any action regarding or pursuant to th[e] Agreement." But in
16 approving the Agreement, CDFW committed itself to the sale of the Ecological Reserve
17 property and to support the DRA Project, regardless of the outcome of any future environmental
18 review. This commitment to implementing the DRA Project before undertaking CEQA
19 compliance is unlawful.
20 6. For these reasons, CDFW's approval of the Agreement constituted an abuse of
21 discretion and must be overturned.

22 PARTIES
23 Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a is a tax-exempt non-profit California
24 corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable land use and
25 transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships across Southern
26 California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, including the MSCP, now threatened
27 by climate change and the approval of the DRA Project. EHL is extremely active in the San
28 Diego region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological diversity in the area and
4
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 served on the County advisory committee for the 2011 General Plan Update. EHL submitted
2 written comments to CDFW objecting to and commenting on the Agreement.

3 7. Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity (the "Center") is a non-profit
4 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
5 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 70,000 members

6 worldwide, including residents of San Diego County within communities in the vicinity of the
7 DRA Project. The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife,
8 open space, air and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated San
9 Diego County where the DRA Project is proposed. Members of the Center objected to the
10 approval the Agreement and will be directly and adversely affected by the Agreement.
11 8. Petitioner California Native Plant Society ("CNPS") is a California non-profit
12 501(c)(3) corporation. CNPS was founded in 1965 and currently has about 10,000 members in
13 35 chapters throughout California and Baja California. Its members include professional
14 botanists, landscape architects, nursery owners, professional conservation workers, agency
15 personnel, and laypersons. The members of CNPS are dedicated to the preservation of
16 California's rich native botanical heritage, the conservation of native plants and their natural
17 habitats (such as woodlands, chaparral, and wetlands), progress on issues that affect native
18 plants and people (such as wildfire and climate change), and advancement of the understanding,
19 appreciation, and horticultural use of native plants. CNPS works closely with decisionmakers,
20 scientists, and local planners to advocate for well-informed and environmentally friendly
21 policies, regulations, and land uses. Members of CNPS orally objected to approval of the
22 Agreement.

23 9. Petitioner Preserve Wild Santee ("PWS") is a volunteer community environmental
24 organization that has worked to protect and enhance the quality of life and preserve natural
25 resources in the City of Santee and adjoining areas since 1994. Preserve Wild Santee's members
26 offer input into local land use decisions in an effort to produce better development projects with
27 fewer environmental and fire safety impacts. Members of PWS have environmental,
28

5
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 educational, recreational, scientific, and aesthetic interests in the Project area and its plants and
2 wildlife.

3 10. Petitioner California Chaparral Institute ("CCI") is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit

4 education, research, and advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of native shrubland

5 habitats throughout the West and supporting the creative spirit as inspired by nature. Members

6 of CCI have environmental, educational, recreational, scientific, and aesthetic interests in the
7 Project area and its plants and wildlife.

8 11. The interests that EHL, the Center, CNPS, PWS and CCI (together, "Petitioners")
9 seek to further in this action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners
10 and their members have a direct and beneficial interest in the CDFW's compliance with laws
11 bearing on approval of the Agreement. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by
12 the Agreement, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and implementation of which
13 would cause substantial harm to the natural environment, public health, and the quality of life in
14 the surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
15 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
16 harms alleged herein.

17 12. Respondent CDFW is, and at all times herein mentioned was, an administrative
18 and regulatory agency of the State of California with a mission of managing California's diverse
19 fish, wildlife, and plant resources, and the habitats upon which they depend, for their ecological
20 values and for their use and enjoyment by the public. CDFW has a mandatory duty to comply
21 with CEQA.

22 13. Respondent Charlton H. Bonham is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the
23 appointed Director of Respondent CDFW. Mr. Bonham is the signatory, on behalf of CDFW, of
24 the Agreement. As the Director, Mr. Bonham is charged with responsibilities under CEQA for
25 conducting a proper review of the Agreement's environmental impacts and granting the various
26 approvals necessary for the Agreement. Mr. Bonham is sued in his official capacity.
27 14. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents Does
28. through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe,
6
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

and on that basis allege, the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the actions

2 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
3 determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert
4 such identities and capacities.

5 15. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in

6 Interest County of San Diego is and at all times herein was a political subdivision of the State of

7 California. The County of San Diego has a significant interest in the Agreement and will incur

8 significant obligations through its participation therein.

9 16. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
10 Interest GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P., is a Delaware limited partnership registered to do business
11 in California and owner of the Village 14 Project site. GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P. has a
12 significant interest in the Agreement and will incur significant obligations through its
13 participation therein.
14 17. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
15 Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company is a California corporation, the a authorized agent
16 and manager of GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P., and signatory of the Agreement. Jackson Pendo
17 Development Company, on behalf of GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P., has a significant interest in the
18 Agreement and will incur significant obligations through its participation therein.
19 18. Petitioners are unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in Interest Does 11
20 through 20 and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and
21 believe, and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named real parties in interest are directly
22 and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and
23 capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, Petitioners will amend this
24 Petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 19. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,
27 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County
28

7
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside CDFW's decision to

2 enter into the Agreement.

20. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

4 in and for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 393(b). The
effects of the actions taken by Respondents will be felt in San Diego County, and therefore the
causes of action plead below arose in San Diego County.
21. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central Division of the Superior Court
for the State of California for the County of San Diego. On information and belief, the DRA
Project is located in zip codes 91914 (South Division) and 91935 (East Division). However, as
10 this petition pleads a California Environmental Quality Act claim, venue is proper in the Central
11 Division pursuant to Local Rule 1.2.2(E).

12 22. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action
13 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
14 required by law. Petitioners and their members submitted numerous objections to approval of
15 the Agreement, CDFW's failure to evaluate the DRA Project's impacts as required by CEQA,
16 and the DRA Project's inconsistency with the existing MSCP and implementing plans and
17 agreements.

18 23. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to entering into the
19 Agreement. Respondents have a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but not
20 limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
21 24. On July 26, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section
22 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file a
23 Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval of the Agreement.
24 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.
25 25. On October 8, 2019, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources Code section
26 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the
27 State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and

28 correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

26. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to

2 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will
3 file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

4 27. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
5  law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
their decision to enter the Agreement. In the absence of this remedy, Respondents' decision will
remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably
8 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and their
9 members for that harm.

10 28. This petition is timely filed.

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS

12 Proctor Valley and the Proposed Project Site
13 29. The DRA Project would be located in the remote Proctor Valley area of San Diego
14 County, northwest of the City of Chula Vista and near the small, unincorporated town of Jamul.
15 Apart from the dirt and gravel Proctor Valley Road, a designated scenic highway, the site is
16 entirely undeveloped. Travelers along Proctor Valley road are treated to the undeveloped, gentle
17 hillsides of Proctor Valley, San Miguel and the Jamul Mountains, and the dense trees and shrubs
18 of Upper Otay Reservoir.

19 30. Proctor Valley is located at the crossroads of a wealth of biological resources. The
20 site abuts the 5,600-acre Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, owned by CDFW, to the west,
21 north, and east. The Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve provides raptor foraging habitat, host
22 plants and nectar resources for the Quino checkerspot butterfly, habitat occupied by the
23 California gnatcatcher and San Diego fairy shrimp, burrowing owl locations, and important
24 habitat for numerous other special and protected species, including the mountain lion.
25 31. CDFW acquired the portion of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve at issue in
26 the DRA with state and federal funding to "provide permanent protection of important
27 biological, scenic, cultural and historic resources." Before this acquisition, the Wildlife
28 Conservation Board staff explained that this land was "the highest priority for acquisition by the
9
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

- State and federal government as part of the joint Natural Community Conservation Planning
2 program. Proctor Valley also provides the last remaining connection between the San Diego
3 National Wildlife Refuge and other protected open space in southern San Diego County.

4 32.

5 The Wildlife Refuge is otherwise surrounded by development. As such, Proctor

6 Valley and the DRA Project site provide a vital wildlife movement corridor for species traveling
between the protected habitat of San Miguel Mountain within the Wildlife Refuge to the
7 northwest and the Jamul Mountains to the southeast. CDFW has recognized the importance of
8 water sources in Proctor Valley for wildlife migration between these two areas.
'33. The DRA Project site itself supports numerous sensitive natural vegetation
10 communities including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian and vernal pools. For instance, the
11 site contains special-status plants, including the federally threatened/state endangered Otay
12 tarplant, the federally threatened spreading navarretia, and other California Rare Plant Rank list
13 species. The site also contains special-status wildlife species, including the federally endangered
14 San Diego fairy shrimp and Quino checkerspot butterfly, the federally threatened California
15 gnatcatcher, the state fully protected Golden Eagle and white-tailed kite, and the federal
16 candidate western spadefoot toad. The site is not only replete with sensitive flora and fauna; it
17 provides some of the County's last best habitat for many of these species.
18 34.

19 For instance, Proctor Valley contains key habitat for the federally endangered

20 Quino checkerspot butterfly, a small orange-and-black butterfly that was once one of the most
common butterflies in Southern California but is now on the verge of extinction. Proctor Valley
21 connects vital habitat areas for the Quino checkerspot butterfly-San Miguel Mountain and
22 Otay Mountain--and contains significant habitat, including host plants and nectar sources. After
23 the wet winters of 2017 and 2018, limited surveys revealed over 50 Quino checkerspot butterfly
24 on and near the site.

25 35. In addition, recent observations and USGS tracking data show that federally-listed
26 Golden Eagles frequently travels through Proctor Valley and forages in the DRA Project site.
27 Recent scientific literature indicates that Golden Eagles are particularly sensitive to
28 development; for instances, houses, roads, and infrastructure can cause Golden Eagles to vacate
10
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

nearby areas. Development in Proctor Valley would result in the loss of important eagle
2 foraging habitat and the San Miguel Mountain/Rancho San Diego eagle territory, shrinking
3 available habitat in San Diego County significantly.

4 36. The western spadefoot toad, a state species of special concern, is also present in
5 Proctor Valley. This brown and green amphibian requires shallow, temporary pools or streams
6 during breeding season, many of which are present on or near the DRA Project site.
7 II. The Multiple Species Conservation Program

8 37. In response to ongoing threats to federal and state listed endangered species and
9 continued development pressures, CDFW and USFWS prepared the MSCP for San Diego
10 County. The MSCP is a joint federal Habitat Conservation Plan and state Natural Community
11 Conservation Plan. The MSCP established mechanisms to ensure the survival and recovery of
12 certain federally and state listed species while providing the County with limited "take"
13 authorization pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. section 1531 et seq.,
14 and the California Endangered Species Act, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq. Notably,
15 the MSCP does not cover some sensitive species found on the DRA Project site, including the
16 Quino checkerspot butterfly and the western spadefoot toad.
17 38. To implement the MSCP in the vicinity of the DRA Project, CDFW worked with
18 the County, the City of Chula Vista, and the USFWS to prepare a MSCP Subarea Plan. The
19 DRA Project is located within the "South County Segment" of the Subarea Plan.
20 39. CDFW approved the County's take permit pursuant to the Natural Community
21 Conservation Program Act (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.) on March 17, 1998. CDFW
22 also entered into an "Implementing Agreement" with the County to establish the entities' roles
23 and responsibilities for carrying out the MSCP and Subarea Plan.
24 40. The MSCP and the Subarea Plan includes an open space preserve system that
25 differs from the one originally approved by the County as part of the County's General Plan
26 (specifically, in the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan). Among other things, the MSCP expanded
27 the preserve system to include approximately 200 acres of central Proctor Valley (known as PV-
28 1, PV-2, and PV-3) in exchange for allowing for increased development in other areas. PV-1,
11
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

PV-2, and PV-3 are designated in the Subarea Plan as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch
2 Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will be Issued, " and are identified in the MSCP Subregional
3 Plan and its EIR as "100 percent conserved," meaning such lands fall within the designated
4 "Hardline Preserve" area. In exchange designating these and other lands as Preserve, the MSCP

5 allowed expanded development footprints, increased residential density and/or reduced Preserve
6 in Otay Ranch Villages 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11, areas in which the City of Chula Vista
7 subsequently permitted development.

8 41. The EIR prepared for the MSCP also establishes preservation of PV-1, PV-2 and

9 PV-3 as mitigation for the impacts of the development authorized by the MSCP.
10 III. History of the Village 14 and DRA Projects.
11 42. Jackson Pendo has been interested in acquiring the Rancho Jamul Ecological
12 Reserve for development for a number of years. Before submitting its Village 14 proposal to the
13 County, Jackson Pendo contacted CDFW regarding a proposed land exchange, which would
14 involve Jackson Pendo's acquisition and development of lands within the Rancho Jamul
15 Ecological Reserve. By letter dated July 22, 2016, CDFW informed Jackson Pendo that it "must
16 decline [the] proposal," citing its determination that the proposed land exchange would not
17 result in a net conservation benefit.

18 43. Lacking access to Rancho Jamul, Jackson Pendo submitted an application for the
19 Village 14 Project in November 2016. Village 14 is proposed as a sprawling residential
20 community located on a 1,284-acre site, with 1,119 single-family homes and "ranchettes,"
21 10,000 square feet of commercial space, and associated development. The proposed Village 14
22 Project did not include development on Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve.
23 44. Between December 15, 2016 and January 23, 2017, the County circulated a notice
24 of preparation ("NOP") for a Draft Environmental Impact Report for Village 14. CDFW
25 commented on the NOP, noting that the development footprint included PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3,
26 which were designated in the MSCP Subarea Plan as "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take
27 Permits' Will Be Issued." CDFW a also commented that a proposed alternative involving
28 development on Rancho Jamul would not be feasible.
12
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

45. On March 1, 2018, the County released the draft environmental impact report

2 ("DEIR") for the Village 14 Project. Despite CDFW's comments on the NOP, the document
defined the project as the development of Village 14, 16 and 19 (including PV-1, PV-2, and PV-

4 3) with up to 1,119 single-family residential units.
46. On Aril 16, 2018, EHL submitted extensive comments on the DEIR. For instance:

a. EHL commented that the proposed development of least 340 new homes in
PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 conflicted with the MSCP and associated Subarea Plan.
b. EHL noted that approval of Village 14 in this configuration would require
9 modification of mitigation measures established for the MSCP, specifically related to protection
10 of PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3.

11 C. EHL commented on the many ways the DEIR failed to adequately analyze,
12 mitigate, and avoid direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including
13 the western spadefoot toad, the Quino checkerspot butterfly, the Golden Eagle, and other
14 sensitive flora and fauna.

15 d. EHL noted that any land exchange alternative, involving development of
16 the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, was infeasible given CDFW's stated unwillingness to
17 transfer the property.
18 47. Numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals also commented on the
19 DEIR. For instance, CDFW submitted extensive comments on the Village 14 Project's conflict
20 with the MSCP and Subarea Plan, as well as its likely adverse impacts on many special status
21 plants and animals.
22 48. In September 2018, the County released the Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Village 14
23 Project. Despite the significant and fundamental flaws identified in the DEIR, the FEIR
24 contained only limited revisions. The Village 14 Project's key components remained unchanged.
25 49. On October 19, 2018, the County Planning Commission considered the Village 14
26 Project, ultimately voting 5-1 to recommend approval.
27 50. On November 26, 2018, Mr. Bonham wrote to the County regarding a proposal to
28 "condition" approval of the Village 14 project on future amendments to the MSCP to remove
13
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

- the PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 Preserve and "No Take" designations. Mr. Bonham stated that the
2 MSCP and Subarea Plan do not authorize the County to conditionally approve development of
3 the Village 14 Project and PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 through a non-MSCP process. Instead, Mr.
4 Bonham stated that to develop PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3, the County and project developer would
5 have to pursue an amendment to the MSCP before the County considered the Village 14 Project.

6 51. On December 21, 2018, EHL sent a letter to CDFW regarding development of
7 PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. EHL explained that amendments to such designated preserve areas, as
8 suggested by CDFW, would require a major amendment to the MSCP.
52. On March 19, 2019, Mr. Bonham sent a letter to the County offering to meet
10 directly with members of the Board "to try to find a path forward." Mr. Bonham stated that "the
11 most appropriate and preferred approach to address development on PV-1, PV-2 and PV-3
12 [would be] through a major amendment process" to the MSCP. Mr. Bonham also reiterated his
13 concern that the County's proposed approach of merely conditioning approval of the Village 14
14 Project on a future amendment to the MSCP was unlawful.
15 53. On March 20, 2019, EHL sent a letter to CDFW mirroring some of these concerns.
16 Specifically, EHL raised legal and practical issues associated with the County's proposal to
17 condition approval of the Village 14 Project on a future MSCP amendment.
18 54. In mid-May 2019, the County set the Village 14 Project for hearing before the
19 Board of Supervisors on June 26, 2019.

20 55. On June 19, 2019, EHL submitted further comments outlining the continued flaws
21 in the County's FEIR and the Village 14 Project's ongoing inconsistencies with state law and
22 relevant plans.

23 56. On or around June 19, 2019, the County for the first time made public that, in
24 addition to considering the Village 14 Project analyzed in the EIR, the County would also be
25 considering approval of the DRA. According to the staff report, all parties intended that the
26 Agreement would "memorialize the parties' discussions regarding the process for extending take
27 authorizations and addressing issues related to the MSCP."

28 57. On information and belief, none of these discussions occurred in a public forum.
14
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 58. The DRA obligates the CFDW to facilitate approval of a completely reconfigured
2 project, which had never been disclosed to the public or analyzed under CEQA. The Agreement,
3 while woefully sparse on details, would allow development of PV-2 and portions of PV-3, while
4 also allowing Jackson Pendo to acquire and develop portions of the Rancho Jamul Ecological
5 Reserve. The Agreement obligates CFDW to place deeds to the reserve property into escrow,

6 and to close on the transfer to Jackson Pendo, subject only to future approval by WCB. The
7 Agreement further requires CFDW to take actions to support and implement the DRA Project

8 and prohibits CFDW from taking any actions that would interfere with the timely

9 implementation of the DRA Project.

10 59. EHL and CBD objected to the Agreement in letters to CDFW on June 25, 2019.

11 Specifically, EHL and CDB commented that:

12 a. The Agreement obligated CDFW to take certain steps with respect to the
13 DRA Project, including applying for a land conservation evaluation with the Wildlife
14 Conservation Board to transfer lands within the Rancho Jamul Ecological Preserve to Jackson
15 Pendo and approving a revised tentative map. As the Agreement effectively surrenders CDFW's
16 future discretion to reject the DRA Project, approval of the Agreement is 1 project pursuant to
17 CEQA and requires CDFW compliance with its mandates.
18 b. The DRA Project would lead to greater environmental harm than the
19 original Village 14 Project. As CDFW commented in 2016, transfer and development of the
20 Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve lands would result in degradation of lands that were actively
21 achieving the conservation goals for which they were acquired.
22 60. CNPS objected to the Agreement at the June 26, 2019 Board of Supervisors
23 meeting to consider the Village 14 Project and the Agreement.
24 61. On June 26, 2019, the County voted 3-2 to approve both the Village 14 Project
25 and the Agreement.
26 62. On June 27, 2019, Director Charlton H. Bonham executed the Agreement on
27 behalf of CDFW. On information and belief, CDFW prepared no CEQA documents related to
28 approval of the Agreement.
15
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

63. On information and belief, CFDW did not prepare or file a notice of exemption,
2 notice of determination, or other notice related to CEQA compliance.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violations of CEQA - Against All Respondents
N (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq; State CEQA Guidelines; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

6 64. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
7 in their entirety.

8 65. On June 27, 2019, Mr. Bonham executed the DRA on behalf of CDFW. Entering

9 into the Agreement is a project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. See
10 CEQA Guidelines § 15378. Specifically, the Agreement obligates CDFW to transfer the Rancho
11 Jamul Ecological Reserve lands to Jackson Pendo subject only to future actions outside of its
12 control, and further requires CDFW to take actions to support and implement the DRA Project,
13 and to refrain from taking actions that would interfere with the timely implementation of that
14 project.
15 66. CDFW has therefore committed to actions that have the potential to cause direct
16 and indirect physical changes in the environment, specifically those related to the development
17 of the DRA Project. The DRA Project includes development of the Rancho Jamul Ecological
18 Reserve, a biologically rich area set aside for permanent preservation. In addition, the DRA
19 Project authorizes development of PV-2 and a portion of PV-3, despite their preservation
20 designations in the MSCP, Subarea Plan, and EIR. By approving the DRA, the CDFW took final
21 action to approve a sale of the a Rancho Jamul lands and took the first step toward committing
22| itself to amendment to the MSCP to conform to the MRA Project.
23 67. On information and belief, CDFW took no steps to comply with CEQA prior to
24 entering into the Agreement. It did not prepare or make available to the public any
25 environmental document, make any necessary findings or statements of overriding
26 consideration, or otherwise comply with CEQA's specific, procedural obligations.
27 68. While the DRA states that CDFW anticipates relying on the FEIR certified by the
28 County for the Village 14 Project in the future, CDFW did not rely on the FEIR to approve the
16
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

Agreement. On information and belief. CDFW did not certify that it reviewed and considered

2 the information in the FEIR, did not adopt related CEQA findings or a statement of overriding
3 considerations, or file a notice of determination or other notice for its approval of the
Agreement. In addition, the FEIR for the Village 14 Project did not analyze the environmental
5 impacts of the DRA Project.

6 69. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
7 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by entering into the DRA without
8 complying with the requirements of CEQA. Respondents' approval of the Agreement must be
9 set aside.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
12 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing CDFW and Mr. Bonham to
13 vacate and set aside their approval of the Agreement;
14 2. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing CDFW and Mr. Bonham to
15 comply with the requirements of CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public
16 Resources Code section 21168.9;

17 3. a For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
18 injunctions restraining CDFW, Mr. Bonham, and Real Parties in Interest and their agents,
19 servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with CDFW and/or Mr. Bonham on
20 their behalf, from taking any action to implement the Agreement, pending full compliance with
21 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

22 4. For costs of the suit;

23 5. An order awarding Petitioner its attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure
24 section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and
25 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
