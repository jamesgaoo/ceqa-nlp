Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

Petitioner alleges:

2 Introduction

3

1. Preservation Sacramento brings this mandamus action in the public 4

interest. This Court's peremptory writ is sought following the city's action to strip the

6 A Street Annex of its a historic status. The Annex is a contributor to the North 16th Street
Historic District, listed in the Sacramento Register of Historic and Cultural Resources.
The city's undisguised reason to delist the Annex was to avoid mandated environmental

10 review of its proposed demolition, as requested by the California Almond Growers

11 Exchange (better known as Blue Diamond) to expand truck parking and unloading. 12

24 The Annex delisting fails to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
25

26 (CEQA). The Central City Specific Plan encourages development on vacant city lots and

27 promotes the adaptive reuse of historic resources. To comply with CEQA, the Plan

28

2 Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 requires that an environmental process analyze impacts and identify feasible

2 alternatives to proposed demolitions of listed buildings.
3
The city's Preservation Director, appointed Preservation Commission, and the
consultant for the original listing of the Annex in 2011 agree that the Annex was, and
remains, appropriately listed in the Sacramento Register, even after duly considering

7 the new historic report prepared by consultants for Blue Diamond positing that the
8

9 Annex was mistakenly listed at the outset.

10 Legal delisting of the Annex could avoid the expense of the environmentally-

11 protective EIR process. But Municipal Code section 17.604.210 that provides the city
12 with discretionary power to list and delist properties to the Sacramento Register 13

14. includes no provisions for delisting a property years after the initial listing. Further,

15 allowing the process followed by the city to defeat environmental protections by the

16 targeted removal of historic status would gut the legislative goals underlying CEQA and
17

18 set a harmful precedent for future city projects.

19 State law cannot be broken for convenience or expediency. As recently held by
20 our state Supreme Court, regardless of a project's perceived merit or an agency's
21 political desire to accommodate plans of a successful business, "CEQA's requirements 22

23 for informing the public and decision makers of adverse impacts, and for imposition of

24 valid, feasible mitigation measures, ... still need to be enforced." (Center for Biological

25 Diversity v. California Department of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 240.)
26

27 Blue Diamond's truck facility project cannot detour around CEQA. Delisting the

28 Annex simply to avoid environmental protection sets a dangerous precedent. The city's

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 discretionary decision to strip the Annex of historic status to allow demolition is not

2 only not allowed by the City Code but is not categorically exempt from CEQA under
3
local or state law (CEQA Guidelines [14 Cal.Code Regs], section 15300.2(f)). Neither is 4

5 the truck facility project. The city has also improperly segmented and piecemealed

6 environmental review of the whole of the Blue Diamond project action as it is part of

7 the company's reasonably-foreseeable Sacramento Campus Plan.
8

9 A peremptory writ should issue to set aside the CEQA categorical exemption and

10 all other city approvals of the Blue Diamond project. Environmental review must first

11 evaluate environmental impacts and the feasibility of mitigating or avoiding demolition
12 of the historic A Street Annex.

3.
21 Petitioner Preservation Sacramento is a California nonprofit corporation

22 originally founded in 1972 as the Sacramento Old City Association. Its members are

23 committed to a Sacramento where all citizens recognize the intrinsic value of historic
24 sites and cherish them as a vital part of everyday life. Preservation Sacramento aspires
25

26 to create a universal preservation ethic in the Sacramento region that prevents losing

27 the past through neglect, ignorance, or monetary expediency. It strives to remind

28 Sacramentans throughout the region of the value of their shared past, the ways in which

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 that past enriches residents' lives, and the irreplaceable legacy it provides their

2 children. Preservation Sacramento is dedicated to protecting Sacramento's historic
3
places and encouraging quality urban design through advocacy, outreach, and activism. 4
Members include community residents and concerned citizens who enjoy and

6 appreciate the environmental and historical resources of Sacramento, including the
North 16th Street Historic District and the A Street Annex. They bring this petition on
8

9 behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and brought

10 before this court as petitioners. Preservation Sacramento objected to the delisting of the

11 A Street Annex and to the related Blue Diamond truck facility project approvals and
12 exhausted administrative remedies.
13

14 4. Respondents City of Sacramento and its City Council (collectively, the city)

15 are the governmental body and lead agency that approved the delisting and all Blue

16 Diamond project approvals based on a categorical exemption from CEQA.
17
5.
18 Real parties in interest Saxon Sigerson, Sigerson Architects, and the

19 California Almond Growers Exchange also known as Blue Diamond are the applicants
20 for the subject project. Saxon Sigerson and Sigerson Architects are named in the filed

21 and posted Notice of Exemption.
22

23 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true

24 names and capacities are currently unknown to petitioners. If and when their true

25 names and capacities are known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.

General Allegations

7 8. The A Street Annex is located at 131 N. 16th Street has been listed in the

8 Sacramento Register of Historic and Cultural Resources since 2011 as a contributing
9 building in the city's North 16th Street Historic District. 10
11
12

14 ?
16

17

18

19
9. Blue Diamond applied to demolish the A Street Annex and for a site permit
20

21 and design review to accommodate a truck facility project including asphalt paving,

22 three parking stalls, ornamental fencing, landscaping, and installation of three loading

23 docks with rolling doors on the Cold Storage building at 121 North 16th Street.
24
10. To accommodate the project, Blue Diamond proposed that the City Council 25

26 adopt an ordinance to delist the A Street Annex from Sacramento Register of Historic

27 and Cultural Resources as a contributing building in the city's North 16th Street

28 Historic District and to resolve that the A Street Annex is not an historic building.

6 Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Blue Diamond secured an historic consultant report concluding that the A Street Annex

2 was erroneously listed in the city historic register in 2011.
3
11. The City's preservation staff reviewed the application. In August 2018 the 4

5 city's Preservation Director issued a determination that the Annex still qualifies as

6 historic and should not be delisted from the Sacramento Register.

7
12. In October 2018, the city's Preservation Commission held a public hearing
8
to
9 consider the delisting. The Commission agreed with the Preservation Director's

10 recommendation to deny the delisting. The Commission's minutes state that

11 "specifically, the Commission concluded that it was inappropriate to delist the building
12 from the Sacramento Register as it continues to meet the criteria for listing." 13

14 12. The City Council held a public hearing on December 11, 2018. The city's

15 Preservation Director provided an opinion that the Blue Diamond historic report

16 supporting delisting contained errors of fact and was not supported by substantial
17

18 evidence. Members of Preservation Sacramento provided evidence supporting the

19 rejection of the delisting and the project and also objected to segmenting the truck
20 facility project from Blue Diamond's proposed and reasonably-foreseeable Sacramento
21 Campus Plan. The City Council rejected the recommendations to deny the delisting of
22

23 the A Street Annex and the requested Blue Diamond truck facility project. The Council

24 approved the removal of the building from the city's historic register and the entire Blue

25 Diamond truck facility project.
26
13. The city approved a categorical exemption from CEQA and filed a Notice of 27

28 Exemption on December 12, 2018. This action is timely filed within 35 days.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

14. Petitioner served a copy of this petition on the Attorney General.

2 15. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief prayed for in
3
this petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and irreversible 4

environmental impacts to the city's environment and its residents. The City Council has

6 the ability to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

9

10 16. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

11 17. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

12 law in approving the delisting of the A Street Annex from the Sacramento Register of
13

14 Historic and Cultural Resources and approving the Blue Diamond truck facility project

15 based on a categorical exemption from CEQA. According to proof following certification

16 of the record of proceedings:

17 a. Categorical exemption from CEQA is disallowed because the A Street Annex is an
18

19 historic resource and its demolition may cause a substantial adverse change and

20 a significant environmental impact. The CEQA Guidelines provide that a

21 categorical exemption "shall not be used for a project which may cause a
22 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource." 23

24 b. The delisting of the A Street Annex is a discretionary action that reduces existing

25 codified protections from demolition and therefore has a potential significant a

26 environmental impact that must be studied in an EIR process.
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 C. The city unlawfully approved a non-exempt project with potentially significant

2 environmental impacts based on a categorical exemption and thus did not have
3 the benefit of environmental review to inform its discretion. Demolition will have
4

5 significant environmental impacts, including, inter alia, impacts relating to

6 historic resources, and CEQA requires preparation of an initial study and an

7 adequate environmental document.
8

9 d. The city unlawfully segmented and piecemealed Blue Diamond's proposed

10 demolition and truck parking and loading project from its pending Campus Plan.

11 e. The city's findings in approving the delisting of the A Street Annex and approving|
12

13 the truck facility project are not supported by substantial evidence.

14 Violation of the Sacramento Municipal Code
15

16 18. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

17 19. The city's delisting of the A Street Annex from the Sacramento Register
18
violated Municipal Code section 17.604.210 that regulates listing and delisting. 19

20 20. The city failed to make a supported finding as to substantial evidence in the

21 record that the A Street Annex warrants delisting in compliance with the plain language

22 of the Municipal Code, both as to qualifications for historic status and procedures
23

24 required for delisting.

WHEREFORE, Preservation Sacramento prays: 2

3 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the city to set

9 aside and void all approvals relating to the Blue Diamond project as described above,
5 including the delisting of the A Street Annex from the Register of Historic and Cultural 6

7 Resources in violation of the Municipal Code and CEQA, and to refrain from further

8 consideration of any project-related approval until it fully complies with the Municipal

9 Code and CEQA by preparing and certifying an adequate EIR and adopting feasible
10

11 alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid environmental impacts.

12 2. That the Court enjoin the city and real parties in interest and their

13 employees and agents from project construction activities while the petition is pending;
14
3. For petitioner's costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil
15
1021.5; and 16 Procedure section
