PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This action challenges the City of Los Angeles' ("City's") failure to comply with
the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and State Planning and Zoning Law in

5 approving The Fig Project.
2. The Fig Project proposes to build a hotel, student housing, and mixed income
7 housing with associated retail uses on a 4.4 acre site (the "Project"), where a portion of the site

8 contains seven contributing resources to the Flower Drive California Register Historic District.

9 The Fig Project would pave over this Historic District and put up a seven-story parking garage

10 to support the new development.

11 3. The remainder of the site is occupied by two large surface parking lots, which
12 provide significant space for development without the destruction of historic resources.

13 4. Moreover, not only are the buildings on the Project site historic, they also contain

14 32 rent stabilized residential units, many with long-term tenants.

15 5. In approving this Project, the City ignored a win/win alternative solution that
16 would preserve the historic resources while still satisfying the applicant's goals - increasing the

17 height of the development on the parking lot portions of the site. This alternative would allow

18 for construction of nearly all the units included in the approved Project and retention of the

19 Historic District.

20 6. The City's wholesale violations of CEQA and the Project's inconsistencies with

21 applicable general plan policies and development regulations necessitate the filing of this action

22 to obtain a writ of mandate directing the City to set aside approval of the Project until it prepares

23 proper environmental review and addresses the land use policy inconsistencies. Accordingly,

24 Petitioners request that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate to prevent the City or Real

25 Party in Interest from taking actions based on the faulty Project approval and to require the

26 preparation of adequate environmental review for the Project.

2 STATEMENT OF FACTS

3 The Flower Drive Historic District.

4 13. The Flower Drive Historic District is composed of 19 multi-family residences that

5 were constructed primarily between 1920 and 1927 on the west side of Flower Drive between

6 West 38th Street and the dead-end of Flower Drive south of West 39th Street.

7 14. The district includes 17 contributing and two non-contributing buildings.

8 Contributing buildings are those which add to the historical integrity or architectural qualities

9 that make the historic district significant. The two non-contributing buildings on the Project site

10 were constructed in the 1930s, also provide rent stabilized housing, and are similar in

11 architecture, massing and scale to the contributing buildings, but were constructed outside the

12 district's period of significance.

13 15. The Flower Drive Historic District is a highly representative and exceptionally
14 intact example of multi-family residential development in the University District east of
15 Exposition Park during the period 1920-1927.

16 16. On September 1, 2005, architectural historian Peter Moruzzi, who meets the

17 Secretary of the Interior's professional qualification standards, prepared the "Historic

18 Assessment Survey Report, Historic Resources Survey Update, Hoover Redevelopment Project

19 Area,' for the Community Redevelopment Agency of the City. This survey identifies the
20 Flower Drive Historic District as an historic resource eligible for listing on the California

21 Register of Historic Places. The Fig project lies within the Hoover Redevelopment Project

22 Area, which was later named the University Park - Exposition Park Project Area, and is subject

23 to the Redevelopment Plan.

24 17. Expert Moruzzi found that the Flower Drive Historic District was "the last intact

25 grouping of multi-family residences erected in the once-larger Zobelein Tract during the
26 Roaring Twenties." Other historic residences in this area have been demolished, piece by piece.

27 18. The Flower Drive Historic District was designated historic for its association with

28 events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- cultural heritage. The district also embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type and period

2 of construction--the response to a growing population in the City a in the 1920s. The residences

3 are constructed in the Mediterranean Revival architectural style a with a strong sense of
4 architectural cohesion and are united by property type, size, form and architectural style. They
5 also retain a high degree of integrity:

18 19.
19 After review by the public and a citizen advisory committee, the Community

20 Redevelopment Agency codified and published expert Moruzzi's report in March 2006.
20.
21 On July 25, 2008, WAHA brought forward the Community Redevelopment
Agency's adopted findings of the historic significance of Flower Drive to the State of California
22 Historic Resources Commission ("SHRC") and nominated the Flower Drive Historic District for
23 listing on the California Register. The SHRC heard the nomination and found the Flower Drive 24 Historic District to be eligible for the California Register.
25 21.
26 One of previous owners of contributing resources within the Flower Drive Historic

27 District requested reconsideration of the eligibility determination by the SHRC, and again on
November 7, 2008 the Flower Drive California Register District was found eligible for the 28 California Register. Architectural Historian Mitzi March Mogul represented WAHA at both

05
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

hearings, successfully arguing for recognition of the district's eligibility for the California

2 Register over the objection of politically-connected individuals.

3 22. The Flower Drive Historic District is not an isolated island, as it is incorrectly
4 portrayed in the EIR for the Project, but instead connects to the very community's history as one

5 of the parcels of the original Zobelein Tract, as it is relational to the Zobelein historic cultural

6 monument (HCM), and the other historic elements which include Exposition Park. As
7 commenter Jim Childs expressed: "When traveling west along 39th Street from the east of the I-

8 110 freeway a viewer emerges from the viaduct at Flower Drive and is confronted with the

9 striking view of the LA Memorial Coliseum dead ahead with its' Peristyle, the Olympic-Torch,

10 the headless statues and the historic formal landscaped entrance of Christmas Tree Lane. To the

11 north and to the south the two flanking block faces of the Flower Drive Historic District." The

12 Flower Drive Historic District is not an island into itself but is deeply rooted in the historic
13 development of the area.

14 23. The Fig Project would demolish more than 1/3 of the California Register-eligible
15 Flower Drive Historic District and all of the contributing resources located south of 39th Street.

16 Expert architectural historian and historic preservation consultant Mitzi March Mogul submitted
17 comments to the City on behalf of WAHA that detail the importance of this historic district and
18 the far-reaching impacts of demolishing most of one of the last remaining districts of its kind.

19 24. Additionally, the Flower Drive Historic District contains a total of 94 rent
20 controlled residential units, 32 of which are located on the Project site and would be demolished

21 by the Project.

22 25. The majority of those living in the Flower Drive Historic District rent controlled

23 units are long-term tenants. In response to the Project's proposal to evict these tenants and

24 demolish the units, Flower Drive resident Maria Partida stated: "I have lived at Flower Drive for

25 37 years. am currently retired. The reasons I do not want to relocate are the following: home

26 is downtown Los Angeles, my clinics are close by, bus and train transportation are all around

27 me, my children grew up here, the area is evolving and the neighborhood is much nicer and
28 safer."

06
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- The Project Site and Project.

2 26.

3 The Fig Project would be located on a site bounded by Flower Drive and the 110

4 Harbor Freeway to the east, Figueroa Street and Exposition Park to the west, 39th Street to the

5 north and Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard to the south. The addresses for the Project site are

6 3900 South Figueroa Street, 3900-3972 South Figueroa Street, 3901-3969 South Flower Drive,
and 450 West 39th Street.

7 27. This site currently contains eight residential fourplexes, seven of which are
8 contributing resources for the Flower Drive Historic District. These historic residential

9

10 contributing resources take up less than one-third of the Project site. The remainder of the site is

11 occupied by two large surface parking lots and a couple of non-contributing buildings.
28.

12 The Flower Drive Historic District was found eligible for listing on the California

13 Register in 2008, seven years before Real Party in Interest purchased the Project site. The City's

14 Department of Planning website clearly indicates that the Project site contains designated

15 historic resources. Real Party in Interest purchased this site subsequent to the California

16 Register designation of the district and with full knowledge that the site contains historic

17 resources. Instead of serving as stewards of these resources, Real Party in Interest plans to
eliminate all historic resources on the site.

18 29.

19 The Fig Project would remove all existing buildings from the site to make way for
the construction of this three-component project, with each component located in a separate
20 seven-story building. The hotel component would include 298 rooms, 15,335 square feet of
21

22 retail and restaurant uses, 13,553 square feet of amenities and 7,203 square feet of meeting

23 spaces. The applicant's original plan for the Project was a 21-story tower design, but, without
explanation, the City's planning department urged the applicant to revise the Project to the
24 seven-story design that was subsequently defined as the proposed Project.
25 30. The student housing component would include 222 student housing units and
26 32,911 square feet of retail and restaurant uses. The mixed-income housing component would
27

28 include 186 dwelling units, 82 of which would be restricted as "affordable" for moderate income
households, 20,364 square feet of office space and 7,000 square feet of retail and restaurants.

Printed on Recycled Paper 07
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. In addition to these three components, the Project includes a seven-story above-

2 ground parking garage, which would be built where the historic Flower Drive buildings now

3 reside.

4 32. The stated objectives of the Project are to: develop an infill mixed-use project with

5 market rate and affordable housing; develop new student housing; develop new short-term and
6 extended-stay lodging opportunities; develop new retail, restaurant, office and hospitality uses;

7 create an environmentally sensitive development; improve the visual character along Figueroa

8 Street by removing a surface parking lot; and reduce vehicle miles traveled.

9 33. The Project site is located within the Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan,

10 which was adopted in March 2000 and updated in 2018. The parcels on the site that fronts

11 Figueroa Street were designated Community Commercial under the March 2000 Community

12 Plan. The parcels fronting Flower Drive were designated multiple residential (R-4). In the

13 updated plan, the Flower Drive portion of the site was designated RD1.5 (residential low

14 medium use) and the remainder of the site was designated Neighborhood Commercial. The City

15 downzoned the Flower Drive portion of the site to preserve existing intact residential
16 communities, such as the Flower Driver Historic District. One of the key goals of the 2018

17 Southeast Community Plan revision process was to protect the existing , intact residential
18 communities from out of scale development.

19 34. The Project site was zoned C2-1L, which is commercial with a height district
20 limit. This zoning allows for commercial, office, residential, retail and hotel uses, but restricts

21 building height to a six stories and a maximum floor area ratio ("FAR") of 1.5:1. A portion of the

22 site was also zoned R4-1L, multiple residential.

23 35. The Fig Project required a number of land use approvals from the City, including:

24 a vesting tentative tract map; a zone and height district change from C2-1L to (T)(Q)C3-2d; site

25 plan review; a zoning administrator's determination; a conditional use permit for a hotel within

26 500 feet of a residential zone; a master conditional use permit to allow for alcohol sales;

27 approval of the demolition of historic buildings under the City's historic preservation ordinance;

28 and approval of an exemption from the City's Rent Stabilization Ordinance ("RSO").

08
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

36. The vesting tentative tract map would create one ground lot for the entire Project
2 site and multiple commercial condominium units, while vacating a portion of the existing right
3 of way along Flower Drive.

4 37. The zone and height district change would allow for an increase in FAR to 3.25:1
and an increase in height from six stories to seven stories.
38. The zoning administrator's determination would waive traditional height
7 requirements for Projects located within 100 to 199 feet of the Open Space zone.
8 39. The area surrounding the Project site is highly urbanized and made up of a mix of

9 commercial retail and residential uses. The area includes Exposition Park, which houses the Los
10 Angeles Coliseum, the California Science Center, the Dr. Theodore T. Alexander Jr. Science

11 Center School, the California African American Museum, the Los Angeles County Natural
12 History Museum, the Exposition Park Rose Garden, the Wallis Annenberg Building and the
13 Expo Center. The area also contains many local, state and federally designated historic
14 buildings and districts.

15 40. The Project site is also located with the Exposition/University Park
16 | Redevelopment Plan area and the North University Park-Exposition Park-west Adams
17 Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District.
18 41. The Exposition/University Park Redevelopment Plan places a high priority on the
19 retention of historic resources and also includes restrictions for residential uses in a
20 commercially designated area. The applicable Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan also
21 emphasizes the preservation of historic resources.

22 The Project Approval Process

23 42. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for The Fig Project was circulated for public
24 comment from July 18, 2016 to August 18, 2016. This initial study and checklist failed to notify
25 the public that the Project would include the demolition of California Register-eligible historic
26 resources. Instead, the project description simply stated, "The Project would demolish eight
27 existing multi-family residential buildings."

28 43. At the time the NOP was circulated, the Project Applicant was identified as

09
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 "Spectrum Group Real Estate." This applicant later changed its name to the entity that

3 ultimately received the Project approval, "Ventus Group", but is comprised of the same parties.
44.

4 On August 10, 2016, a public scoping meeting was held from 6 to 8 p.m. at the

5 Radisson Mid City Hotel, but no opportunity for public comment was provided at the meeting.
45.

6 At the scoping meeting, WAHA members spoke with the applicant and applicant's

7 representative. The representatives informed these WAHA members that the applicant was
aware that the Project would demolish California Register historic resources, but that they were

9 not open to any discussion of possible alternative design mitigations that might retain the
historic properties.

10 46.

11 WAHA members and other historic preservation and affordable housing

12 organizations, as well as individuals, urged the applicants to consider an alternative that

13 preserves the historic affordable housing and informed them that meaningful project alternatives

14 must be considered in the EIR. WAHA's recommendation to consider retaining the historic

15 buildings was confirmed by WAHA and others in writing immediately thereafter.
47.

16 Numerous other persons and organizations, including the Los Angeles

17 Conservancy, urged the city to mandate consideration of a range of potentially feasible

18 preservation alternatives in the draft EIR that would retain the Flower Drive Historic District's
continued eligibility for the California Register. WAHA and others noted that significant
19 I development could still be placed on the Project site in the large parking lot areas, while
20 preserving the historic resources.
21 48.

22 In addition to the Los Angeles Conservancy, the University Park Historic

23 Preservation Overlay Zone Board, the North University Park Community Association

24 ("NUPCA"), the Adams Dockweiler Heritage Organizing Committee ("ADHOC"), Society for a

25 Just Economy ("SAJE"), Esperanza Community Housing, the California Preservation

26 Foundation, residents of Flower Drive, and numerous others urged consideration of alternatives

27 that would retain the historic buildings while allowing for a development that would meet the
objectives of the project.

28 49. SAJE, in particular, noted how the Project's affordable housing failed to meet any

Printed on Recycled Paper 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 of the needs of the current residents who will not qualify for the new "low income" units.

3 Further the new affordable units would be exempt from the RSO.
50.

4 Subsequent to the scoping meeting, ADHOC member Jim Childs provided the

5 applicant and the City with the adopted survey records for the Flower Drive Historic District

6 that identify the contributing historic resources, which were slated for demolition.
51.

7 After the scoping meeting, the applicant engaged the Page & Turnbull

8 architectural firm and architect John Lesak "to help us identify options that might retain some or

9 all of the contributors while carrying out the project program."
52.

10 On October 5, 2016, the Project applicant's representative suggested that

11 community members meet with the applicant and the newly hired Page & Turnbull team to

12 identify "options that might retain some or all of the contributors."
53.

13 A workshop on retention options was held on November 7, 2016 at the offices of

14 Page & Turnbull. Present at the workshop were representatives of WAHA, Los Angeles

15 Conservancy, NUPCA, and ADHOC, as well as Laura Meyers, Jim Childs, Mitzi Mogul, and
other community members.

16 54.

17 The first meeting was productive, and follow up meeting was set for November

18 21, 2016 to continue the alternatives discussion. At this meeting, Page & Turnbull presented

19 renderings and materials detailing alternative configurations that would allow for preservation of
the historic resources. The community and organization members present arrived at a consensus
20 in support of a multiple tower alternative in a configuration and scale to be determined. All of
21

22 the rent stabilized apartment buildings would be preserved. The only unresolved issues were

23 whether certain of the garages for the contributors, which were not contributors themselves,

24 would be retained or demolished. Those that attended the meeting were buoyed by the

25 possibility of resolving the conflict, preserving the 32 rent stabilized apartments, and allowing

26 for the Project goal to be built in a redesigned configuration. The details of design (how many

27 towers, perspective heights, undergrounding parking) were to be determined.
55.

28 No subsequent follow up meeting was held with the applicant, Page & Turnbull,
and the organizations and community members. No further communications with the applicant

Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

and the concerned community members and organizations occurred over the next year.

2 56. The draft EIR was circulated from comment from October 12, 2017 until

3 November 27, 2017. The proposed Project included in the draft EIR was essentially the same

4 project described in the NOP, one that would demolish all historic resources located on the

5 Project site. The EIR acknowledged that the demolition of the Flower Drive Historic District

6 was a significant adverse impact, even after mitigation. The minimal mitigation proposed by the

7 EIR was to relocate three of the contributing resources to a site or sites within five miles of the

8 Project site. No potential available locations were discussed.

9 57. Numerous comments were submitted on the draft EIR, objecting to the wholesale
10 removal of the Flower Drive Historic District contributing resources located on the Project site

11 and urging consideration of alternatives that allowed for both preservation and new construction.

12 58. On November 2, 2017 the Empowerment Congress North Area Neighborhood

13 Development Council ("NANDC'") submitted comments finding that the proposed demolitions

14 could not be supported in the context of the goals of the Community Plan and the Community

15 Redevelopment Area Hoover Project Area goals. Later, the Hoover Project Area became the
16 Exposition/University Park Plan Area. NANDC strongly objected to the demolition of eight

17 multi-family residences within the Flower Drive Historic District and, by Board motion, urged

18 the applicant to consider an alternative that incorporated these buildings into the Project design.

19 59. On November 7, 2017, WAHA sent a request to Page & Turnball for a copy of
20 the materials reviewed at the two Page & Turnbull meetings, but was informed by Page &

21 Turnbull architect John Lesak that they were bound by a client confidentiality agreement and

22 could not provide the requested documents.

23 60. ADHOC submitted comments to the City on November 27, 2017, stating that, "At

24 the conclusion of the second meeting [with the applicant and Page & Turnbull] I understood that

25 a there was a consensus for a proposed new Project Alternative concept, which would retain the

26 elements of the FLOWER DRIVE HISTORIC DISTRICT, the proposed 21-story Hotel, and add

27 a second tower for the residential components."

28 61. The City released a final EIR for the Project on October 11, 2018.

12
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 62.

2 On November 1, 2018, NANDC again reviewed the proposed Project, and the

3 final EIR. NANDC voted to maintain its opposition to the Project as presented and support an

4 alternative that retains the 32 units of rent stabilized existing historic housing.
63.

5 On November 7, 2018, the City scheduled a joint Advisory Agency and Hearing

6 Officer on behalf of the City Planning Commission public hearing on the Project. The Hearing

7 Officer public hearing took place at that time, but the Advisory Agency portion of the hearing,

8 necessary for the tract map approval, was continued until December 5, 2018.
64.

9 Numerous persons, many of whom are long term residents of Flower Drive,

10 testified that Flower Drive is their home and a neighborhood that ought not to be demolished.
65.

11 At the December 5, 2018 rescheduled public hearing on the tract map, over two

12 hours of testimony was taken and fifty residents attended and voiced their objections to the

13 demolition of their homes and this important historic district. WAHA and others advised the

14 City that the findings cannot be made for the tract map as the development is not in

15 conformance with the Redevelopment Plan nor the Southeast Community Plan.
66.

16 On December 12, 2018, the updated Southeast Community Plan was adopted by

17 the City Council. The City initiated the proceedings to update this community plan prior to

18 September 8, 2016, the date on which the City found the application for The Fig Project to be

19 complete. Thus, the updated Community Plan applies to the subsequent approval of this Project.
67. The updated Southeast Community Plan designated the Flower Drive portion of
20 the Project site as RD1.5 (Residential low medium use.) The Flower Drive zoning was changed
21

22 from its previous residential zoning of R4 to lower density RD1.5. In the Southeast

23 Community Plan process, the City attempted to protect the character of residential

24 neighborhoods by downzoning, which is the case on Flower Drive. The revision to the

25 Community Plan was decades in the making, but was entirely ignored in the final EIR and in the
City's approval of the Project.

26 68. The City completed an errata to the final EIR on November 28, 2018 to correct
27 zoning information, but the City found this was not significant new information.
28 69. On December 6, 2018, the City circulated its "The Fig Project - Tract Map

Printed on Recycled Paper 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Approval Letter" 24 hours after a lengthy public hearing. Nothing in the City's decision

2 material reflected the extensive testimony or salient facts brought forth the day before.

3 70. WAHA and SAJE appealed the approval of the Project to the Planning
Commission.

5 71. On January 28, 2019, a second errata to the final EIR was completed, this time to

6 correct discussion in the document regarding aesthetic impacts to historic resources.

7 72. On February 14, 2019, the City Planning Commission ("CPC") heard the appeals

8 of The Fig Project and found that no subsequent EIR or addendum was required, recommended

9 that the City Council adopt the vesting zone change and height district, and approved the zoning
10 administrator's determination and site plan review. The City Planning Commission denied the

11 appeals by WAHA and SAJE.

12 73. CPC Commissioner Mack, who is the single vote on the CPC in a 7-1 approval of

13 the various discretionary actions, objected to the demolition of the historic, rent stabilized
14 housing and questioned the adequacy of the EIR.

15 74. Another Commissioner questioned the signage package in The Fig Project plans

16 and wondered why the signage was not reviewed in the context of the soccer Stadium Sign

17 Ordinance which they had reviewed at the meeting prior.

18 75. WAHA appealed the CEQA determination to City Council in the aspiration that,

19 finally the errors made in the whole of the administrative process, extensively noted by many
20 commenters to the administrative record, could be rectified.

21 76. On May 21, 2019, the Planning and Land Use Committee of City Council

22 ("PLUM") heard the appeals by WAHA and SAJE, reviewed the discretionary actions related to

23 the project, and recommended adoption of the EIR, over the objections of WAHA, the Friends

24 of Flower Drive ("FOFD") and numerous others present. FOFD submitted a visual sampling of

25 Flower Drive and announced formation of a coalition of like-minded people and organizations
26 that object to the City's destruction of the Flower Drive California Register District.

27 77. WAHA urged the City Council to remedy the injustice and displacement of
28 families and the failure to include in the EIR an alternative that would save the rent stabilized

14
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 housing, preserve a significant historic resource, and allow for the new development and the

2 accompanying benefits.

3 78. On June 12, 2019, the City Council heard the entire range of discretionary actions,

4 certified the adequacy of the EIR, denied WAHA's appeal of the Tract Map and the CPC

5 decision, and adopted a statement of overriding considerations.

6 79. WAHA, FOFD, the Los Angeles Conservancy, NANDC, and ADHOC, in person

7 and/or in writing, asked the public officials to take a step back, not to certify the EIR, and

8 recirculate the EIR with the preservation Page & Turnbull "towers" alternative that retains the

9 Flower Drive rent stabilized apartments, while allowing for the development sought by the

10 applicant.

11 80. NANDC representative Jean Frost pleaded at the City Council that the EIR was

12 severely flawed for, among other serious defects, its failure to provide an adequate reasonable

13 range of alternatives, assessment of cumulative impacts, and effective mitigation measures. She

14 also reiterated that there was no basis to adopt a statement of overriding considerations as the

15 Council did not have adequate facts before them to justify such a statement when there remains

16 an unexamined alternative that meets both the project goals and preserves the Flower Drive

17 Historic District.

18 81. The Mayor approved the ordinance for the zone change on June 18, 2019.

19 82. The notice of determination for the Project was filed on June 19, 2019.
20

21 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

23 83. Petitioners WAHA and FOFD objected to the Project in the administrative process

24 by submitting letters during the comment period and providing testimony at public meetings
25 regarding the Project.

26 84. Petitioner WAHA filed all available administrative appeals for the Project.

27 85. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

28 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of

15
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 such remedies, the City's approval of the Project would form the basis for a development project
that would proceed in violation of state law.

3 86.

4 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a

5 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
Exhibit A.

6 87.

7 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

8 providing the City with notice of their intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice
is attached as Exhibit B.

9 88. Petitioners elect to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
10 attached as Exhibit C.

11

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (VIOLATION F CEQA)

14 89. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
15 Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Impacts

16 90.

17 CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

18 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal.
Code Regs. § 15004). §

19 91. CEQA imposes upon the City a clear, present and mandatory duty to certify an
20 EIR only if the EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may

21 occur. The EIR for the Fig Project lacks the necessary analysis.

22 92.

23 Further, CEQA requires adoption of all feasible mitigation measures that will

24 reduce adverse environmental impacts and prohibits the deferral of mitigation measures.
Historic Resources

25 93.

26 The Project would remove seven of the 17 buildings that are contributing

27 resources to the Flower Drive Historic District, severely degrading and likely eliminating the

28 district's eligibility for listing on the California Register of Historic Places.
94. The EIR acknowledges that the Project a would have a significant historic resource

Printed on Recycled Paper 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

and aesthetic impact at a project level due to the elimination of these historic resources.

2 95. However, the EIR analysis of historic resource impacts is inadequate because it

3 fails to disclose the significant cumulative impacts The Fig Project would have. The EIR

4 completely ignores the project that is planned for the site north of the Project site, adjacent to the

5 remaining 10 contributing resources for the Flower Drive District. The 3800 S. Figueroa Mixed

6 Use Development would develop a seven-story transit-oriented, mixed-use development

7 stepping down to the east to transition to the portion of the Flower Drive Historic District on that

8 site. The cumulative impacts of this development and The Fig Project on the Flower Drive

9 Historic District must be analyzed.

10 96. Additionally, the EIR analysis claims that previous demolitions of smaller multi-

11 family residences similar to the Flower Drive Historic District justify the demolition of the last
12 few remaining examples of this type of resource due to its isolation. If anything, the District's
13 isolation from other smaller multi-family residences demonstrates the cumulative impact of
14 modern developments displacement of the historic neighborhood. After the Project's proposed
15 demolitions, it is unlikely the Flower Drive Historic District would retain its historic

16 significance, opening the remaining remnants of the district located north of 39th Street to
17 demolition as well. This cumulative impact must be acknowledged.

18 97. The EIR's proposed mitigation for historic resource impacts is also improperly

19 deferred. The EIR presents two competing mitigation measures: Mitigation Measure C-2 calls
20 for the creation of a salvage and reuse plan, while Mitigation Measure C-3 requires at least three
21 of the contributing resources to be relocated to a site within five miles of the Project site. If
22 resources are to be relocated, their historic elements and materials should not be salvaged, but
23 the EIR fails to address how a balance would be struck between these two competing measures.
24 (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
25 98. Further, there is no indication whether MM C-3 is actually feasible despite
26 CEQA's requirement that mitigation measures be fully enforceable. (CEQA Guidelines §
27 15126.4(a)(4).) There is no discussion whether there are sites available for relocation within the

28 five-mile radius. There is also no discussion of how the relocated historic residential buildings

17
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- might preserve their former uses as rent stabilized housing.

2 99.

3 There is also no discussion of impacts that would be associated with such

4 relocation, which can only be assessed when potential locations have been disclosed. The

5 effects of mitigation measures are required to be disclosed in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines §
15126.4(a)(1)(D).)

6 Land Use

7 100. The EIR's claim that there are no land use impacts due to inconsistencies with

9 existing plans lacks evidentiary support. The Fig Project would run afoul of a fundamental goal

10 of the Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan-to protect and preserve historic resources.

11 (SELA Community Plan Goal 18 and corresponding objectives and policies.) While the DEIR

12 acknowledged the inconsistency, it still made the unsupported claim there would no significant

13 adverse land use impacts. The conflicts between the Project and the Community Plan's

14 fundamental goal of protecting and preserving historic resources are clear, and this significant

15 impact must be acknowledged. (CEQA Guidelines Appendix G, subd. X.b.)
101. The EIR fails to discuss The Fig Project's inconsistencies with the update to the
16 Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan. The updated Community Plan is the relevant plan for
17

18 purposes of making consistency determinations in approving this Project. The updated

19 Community Plan designates the Flower Drive portion of the Project site as RD1.5-1, which
allows far less development than is planned as part of this Project. The inconsistency between
20 / The Fig Project and the updated Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan must be disclosed.

21 102.

22 The EIR also fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the North

23 University Park-Exposition Park-West Adams Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District's

24 regulations based on an unsupported claim that they should not apply to the Project because the

25 Project fronts Figueroa Street. The frontage for the Project site is currently on Flower Drive, not
Figueroa Street. The Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District ordinance states, "except
26 properties fronting on Figueroa Street" and when the ordinance was adopted by the City, this
27 property fronted on Flower Drive. Thus, the development regulations and findings required for
28 the Neighborhood Stabilization Overlay District should be required, but were not.

Printed on Recycled Paper 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 Population and Housing

3 103. The Fig Project would displace the residents in 32 existing rent controlled

4 residential units. While the Project includes an affordable housing component, there is no

5 analysis comparing the affordability of the proposed units with the existing units. Further, the

6 EIR fails to address the significant time lapse between the eviction of the existing tenants from
7 rent controlled units and the availability of the new units, which would be at least 18 months.
8 This residential displacement impact should be evaluated in the EIR.

9

10 The Alternatives Analysis is Inadequate

11 104. CEQA imposes upon the City a clear duty to consider a reasonable range of
12 alternatives that may satisfy most project objectives, including any feasible alternative which
13 could substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of the Project. Despite this duty,
14 the EIR rejects feasible alternatives and fails to consider reasonable and potentially feasible
15 alternatives.

16 105. Under CEQA, "the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating
17 that, notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the
18 proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures."
19 (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) This
20 did not happen here.

21 106. The alternatives analysis is the "core of the EIR." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
22 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal 3d 553, 564.), and all reasonable alternatives must be
23 analyzed under CEQA. Reasonable alternatives raised during administrative review include the
24 Page & Turnbull tower alternative, which would have allowed for the preservation of the rent
25 stabilized historic resources, while still allowing the Project applicant to construct up to 95
26 percent of the units and uses proposed. This alternative would have achieved all project
27 objectives and eliminated the Project's significant and unavoidable historic and aesthetic

28 impacts.

19
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

107. The City can only approve the Project with its significant and unavoidable impacts

2 if "there is no feasible way to lessen avoid the significant effect[s]." (CEQA Guidelines §

3 15043.) When an agency seeks to approve a project despite the significant impacts the project

4 would have on the environment, the agency must adopt a statement of overriding considerations. a

5 (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.) A statement of overriding considerations must include specific

6 findings, supported by substantial evidence, that "[t]here is no feasible way to lessen or avoid

7 the significant effect..." (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15043, 15093(b).) Although a statement of

8 overriding considerations is policy statement, it must still be supported by substantial

9 evidence. A less impactful alternative can only be rejected if it is truly infeasible. The City

10 improperly rejected less impactful alternatives include in the EIR and skews any fact-based

11 review by not including the Page & Turnbull towers alternative.

12 108. The City lacks substantial evidence to reject Alternative 2, the Community Plan

13 Update Compliant/Historic Preservation Alternative. This alternative would retain the integrity
14 of the Flower Drive Historic District. It would also eliminate visual impacts and substantially

15 lessen noise and traffic impacts.

16 109. The City's finding that this less impactful alternative would fail to meet all of the
17 Project objectives is not supported by substantial evidence. Alternative 2 meets the underlying 2

18 purpose of the Project and is not required to meet all of the project objectives to the same extent

19 as the Project.

20 110. The City also improperly rejects Alternative 3, the Reduced Density/Partial

21 Historic Preservation Alternative. This alternative includes only a few fewer units than the

22 proposed Project, and the analysis fails to take into account the existing affordable housing units

23 that would remain with the preservation of Flower Drive units.

24 111. Additionally, the EIR states that Alternative 3 would lessen the historic resource
25 impacts, but the City's findings inconsistently find that it would not. The City's findings also
26 appear to reject this alternative based on a claim of financial infeasibility, but the City has

27 provided no evidence to support this claim. Whether a project is economically infeasible "is not

28 measured by the increased cost or lost profit, but upon whether the effect of the proposed

20
Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 mitigation is such that the project is rendered impractical." (Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of
2 Woodside (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 587, 600.)
3

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

6

7 112. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
8 113. The Government Code imposes upon the City a clear, present and mandatory duty
9 to ensure consistency of project approvals with the General Plan.
10 114. Government Code section 66473.5 provides that no tentative subdivision map
11 shall be approved unless it is consistent with the general plan.
12 115. Zoning ordinances must also be consistent with the general plan. (Gov. Code c0
13 65860.)

14 116. The Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan is a component of the City's General
15 Plan.

16 117. The City was required, but failed, to ensure the Project was consistent with the
17 Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan's policies, including, but not limited to the policies
18 requiring preservation of historic resources.

19 118. Pursuant to Government Code section 66474.2(b), the City was required, but
20 failed, to apply the updated Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan to the Project because the
21 City initiated proceedings to update the Community Plan before accepting the application for
22 The Fig Project as completed. The updated Community Plan downzoned the Flower Drive
23 portion of the Project site to ensure residential neighborhood compatibility, but the City failed to
24 consider this updated land use designation when approving the Project.
25 119. The Project approval also violates State Planning and Zoning Law because the
26 Project is inconsistent with the University Park-Exposition Park-West Adams Neighborhood
27 Stabilization Overlay District's regulations and the Exposition/University Park Redevelopment
28 Plan.

Re: Challenge under California Environmental Quality Act to the City of Los
Angeles' approval of The Fig Project

Honorable Attorney General:

Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge
the City of Los Angeles' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) in approving The Fig Project. The Fig Project would allow for the demolition of
a California Register-eligible historic district, the Flower Drive Historic District, which
currently provides 32 rent-controlled apartment units. This Petition objects to the
environmental impact report (EIR) due to the failure to adequately analyze and mitigate
historic resource, land use and population and housing impacts. The EIR and the
statement of overriding considerations for the Project are also legally improper because
they improperly reject feasible alternatives that would allow for some or all of the historic
resources to be preserved, while still providing for nearly all of the new construction
desired by the Project applicant.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources Code. Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
