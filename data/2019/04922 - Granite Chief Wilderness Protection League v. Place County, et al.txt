1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Granite Chief Wilderness Protection League (*Petitioner") challenges

3 Respondent County of Placer's ("Respondent" or "County") approval on July 23, 2019 of the

4 Squaw Valley / Alpine Meadows Base-to-Base Gondola (*Project"), including a General Plan

5 amendment, rezoning, conditional use permit and certification of an Environmental Impact

6 Statement/Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").

7 2. The Project proposes a gondola, dozens of towers and two large mid-stations that will

8 permanently alter what is now a pristine Sierra Nevada environment bordering the Granite Chief

9 Wilderness Area, bisecting the existing wilderness trail used for decades by hikers and

10 recreational visitors with a large industrial development. The Project represents the first step in

11 transforming this pristine area into one that is developed with roads, housing and considerable

12 human made infrastructure. In so doing, the Project will have significant impacts under the

13 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq., to visitors,

14 wildlife and the physical environment, which impacts have neither been adequately identified or

15 mitigated in the EIR certified by the County.

16 3. Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval of the Project as contrary to CEQA in that the

17 EIR lacks adequate information about this Project's significant impacts on the wilderness

18 characteristics of the area, as well as aesthetic and recreational resources. The Project will lead to

19 considerable development within critical habitat designated for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged

20 frog, with attendant adverse impacts on the ability of this federally listed species to survive in the

21 affected watershed. The EIR does not adequately consider these and other impacts, nor does it

22 accurately assess the cumulative impacts of the Project in combination with a massive private

23 development being simultaneously proposed in the Project area, all directly adjacent to the

24 wilderness area and overlapping the wilderness trail used by thousands of hikers each year. The

25 Project will have significant impacts to human visitors, wildlife and the physical environment,

26 which impacts have neither been adequately identified or mitigated in the EIR.

27 4. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing Respondent to set aside its approval of the

28 Project until such time as it has complied with CEQA's requirements.

Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

H. PARTIES

2 5, Petitioner Granite Chief Wilderness Protection League is a mutual association of individuals

3 concerned over the development proposed by the Project adjacent to the Granite Chief Wilderness

4 Area, a pristine wilderness set aside by Congressional action in 1983. Petitioner and its members
have formerly participated in the administrative review for this Project by submitting timely scoping

6 comments as well as comments on the Draft and Final EIRs, and by providing testimony at public
meetings during the planning process for the Project.

8 6. Respondent Placer County is and was at all times relevant to this action the governmental
entity responsible for reviewing and approving the Project challenged in this action. Respondent

10 Placer County is the lead agency for the CEQA review conducted for the Project and the agency

11 which certified the final EIR.

12 7. Real Party in Interest United States Forest Service is a governmental agency within the United

13 States Department of Agriculture. The Forest Service is responsible for managing lands within the

14 Tahoe National Forest, including the Granite Chief Wilderness Area, which is affected by this Project.

15 The Forest Service is the lead agency under the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), 42

16 U.S.C., § 4231 et seq., as it is responsible for issuing an amended special use permit (SUP) issued for

17 the Project in relation to the operation and maintenance of the Alpine Meadows ski area.

18 8. Real Party in Interest Squaw Valley Ski Holdings LLC, is a Delaware Corporation and is the

19 stated Project Applicant/Owner on the Notice of Determination for the Project issued by the County.

20 See Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6.5.

21 9. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of DOES 1 through

22 100, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sue said real parties in interest by such fictitious names

23 and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandate when they have been ascertained.

24 III. JURISDICTION AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

25 10. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure 81084

26 et seq. and California Public § Resources Code $ 21168 and/or 21168.5.
27 11. Venue is proper as Respondent and the Project are located in Placer County.

28 12. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has

2
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioner and

2 members of the public provided written and oral comments to Respondent during the administrative

3 process related to each of the claims raised in this Petition. See Pub. Res. Code § 21177..

13. On August 21, 2019, Petitioner faxed a Notice of Commencement of Action letter pursuant

5 to Public Resources Code § 21167.5 to Respondent informing it of Petitioner's intent to file a legal

6 action challenging Respondent's approval of the Project. (See Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)

14. On August 22, 2019, Petitioner's attorney served a copy of Petitioner's Verified Petition on

8 the Attorney General to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private attorney

9 general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)

10 15. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy in the course of law unless this Court grants the

11 requested writ of mandate.

12 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13 16. The Project concerns the construction and operation of a gondola, which is proposed to

14 connect the Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows ski areas located in the Tahoe National Forest on the

15 edge of the Granite Chief Wilderness. The gondola will traverse from the base of the Squaw Valley

16 ski area near the Red Dog lift to a 'mid-station' located on the Olympic Ridge bordering Squaw

17 Valley and Alpine Meadows, just west of the top terminal of the existing KT-22 Express lift.

18 17. From there the gondola will continue south down the ridge line, crossing into a sensitive

19 watershed directly below Five Lakes, a popular hiking destination in the Granite Chief Wilderness

20 Area, and directly across the Five Lakes trail, the most actively used wilderness destination trail in

21 the Tahoe area. At the base of the watershed, the Project proposes a second mid-station, located on

22 private property ("Caldwell property"), which is designed specifically to serve a future proposed

23 development in the area, the "White Wolf' development, consisting of 38 single-family residential

24 units, a clubhouse/lodge, chairlift, and seasonal recreational facilities including tennis courts and

25 equestrian facilities. Construction of this mid-station would require approximately 25,000 cubic yards

26 of excavation, of which approximately 5,000 cubic yards would remain onsite. Power for this mid-

27 station would be provided from the Caldwell property. Access would require construction of a

28 segment of new permanent road on the Caldwell property. The Caldwell mid-station is close to the

3
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 site of the proposed White Wolf property development, and the Project envisions that when the

2 Caldwell property development is implemented, property owners and their guests would be permitted

3 exclusive access to enter and exit at this mid-station.

4 18. From the Caldwell property mid-station, the gondola will head due south towards the base of

5 the Alpine Meadows ski area, where it will connect with the ski lifts available at Alpine Meadows.

6 Fill required for the grading proposed at the Alpine Meadows base area would be generated from the
Caldwell property mid-station site.

8 19. The Project would be configured as an eight-passenger gondola and would have a design

9 capacity of approximately 1,400 persons per hour in each direction. In total, the lift would be roughly

10 11,700 feet in length of which approximately 2,300 feet would be sited on Forest Service lands,

11 including the Alpine Meadows base terminal. A total of 33 towers would be installed along the

12 gondola alignment, with 28 towers on private land and five on Forest Service lands. Tower heights

13 would average approximately 30 feet, with two to four towers over 50 feet in height. Helicopters

14 would be used to set most towers. Blasting may be required for the tower foundations. Disturbance

15. for each tower would vary from a total disturbance of 600 square feet to 300 square feet of

16 disturbance. Towers located on granite outcroppings could require drilling/blasting and would likely

17 be secured directly to the rock, or anchored to concrete poured directly on the rock.

18 20. The Project is located adjacent to the Granite Chief Wilderness Area, which was designated

19 as a wilderness area by Congress in 1983. The line of the gondola follows down the ridge across the

20 main trail to Five Lakes, the most visited destination in the wilderness area, through a narrow, granite

21 lined drainage which is the main migration/dispersal route for the federally listed Sierra Nevada

22 yellow legged frog. The Project will replace the undeveloped ridge line with a host of thirty foot

23 towers, leading to a large mid-station that is designed to enable residents of the future White Wolf

24 development to have private access to skiing opportunities at both the Squaw Valley and Alpine

25 Meadows areas. The Project will require a new construction road through the designated wilderness

26 area. The proposed location of this road corresponds directly with a future permanent road designed

27 for the higher elevation residences in the White Wolf development, which are located directly below

28 the wilderness area ridge line, in direct view of visitors to the wilderness area.

4
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 21. The Project will cause significant adverse impacts on the recreational experience of visitors

2 using the Five Lakes trail, as well as to the physical environment that will be converted into towers,

3 roads and large concrete development platforms. At the Squaw mid-station, the Project may lead to

4 access to the Five Lakes area for gondola riders, which would convert the existing wilderness area

5 into a gondola destination, similar to how the Squaw Valley tram delivers visitors to Squaw's high

6 camp area on the other side of the ridge. The gondola and its associated roads, towers, mid-stations

7 and development will significantly alter the pristine nature of the existing area, including critical

8 habitat designated for the Sierra Nevada yellow legged frog.

9 22. The U.S. Forest Service has acted as a lead agency for the Project review, based on its federal

10 authority to consider approval of an amended special use permit ("SUP") issued for the Project

11 pursuant to NEPA. In April 2019, the Forest Service issued a draft Record of Decision ("ROD") for

12 the Project, which was then subject to an Objection process under 36 CFR 218, Subparts A and B.

13 On August 15, 2019, the Forest Service's Deputy Regional Forester sent a letter to 'Objectors and a

14 Interested Persons' setting forth changes to the Project necessary prior to the Forest Service's final

15 determination of whether to approve the SUP.

16 23. The County as lead agency under CEQA approved the Project on July 23, 2019, at the same

17 time certifying the EIR. The County filed its Notice of Determination the same day. Entitlements

18 for the Project include a General Plan amendment, rezoning, conditional use permit and certification

19 of the EIR.

20 24. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this petition by raising each

21 and every issue known to it regarding the impacts of the Project on wilderness, aesthetics, visitor

22 recreational experience, wildlife and the physical environment, in compliance with Public Resources

23 Code § 21177, during the public comment period for the Project's EIR evaluation.

24 V. LEGAL BACKGROUND

25 25. CEQA is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term protection to the

26 environment. Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 105,112.

27 Courts must interpret CEQA to afford the fullest protection to the environment, see Friends of

28 Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259-260, to fulfill CEQA's policy that all

5
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

public agencies "shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to preventing

2 environmental damage." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn v. Regents of University of California

3 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390; Pub. Res. Code § 21000(g.)

4 26. The "primary means" by which the legislative goals of CEQA are achieved is the preparation

5 of an EIR. Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392; Pub. Res. Code §§21080(d), 21100, 21151; 14

6 Cal. Code Reg. §15080. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
purpose is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have

8 reached ecological points of no return." Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392. An EIR is intended

9 to serve as "an environmental full disclosure statement." Rural Land Owners Assn. v. City Council

10 of Lodi (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 1013, 1020.

11 27. CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and the public about the potential, significant

12 environmental effects of a project. CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1). An EIR must include a

13 description of the physical conditions in the vicinity of the project at the time environmental analysis

14 commences. CEQA Guidelines § 15125. This environmental setting will normally constitute the

15 baseline physical conditions by which the lead agency determines whether an impact is significant.

16 Id. See also Planning & Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal. App.

17 4th 892, 915-916; Environmental Planning & Information Council v. County of El Dorado (1982)

18 131 Cal. App. 3d 350, 357.

19 28. Aside from evaluating a proposed project's environmental impacts, an EIR must identify

20 mitigation measures and alternatives to the project which may reduce or avoid the project's significant

21 adverse impacts, thus accomplishing CEQA's basic statutory goals. See Laurel Heights, supra, 47

22 Cal.3d at 400-403; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564; Pub.

23 Res. Code §§ 21002.1, 21100. This analysis of feasible mitigation measures and a reasonable range

24 of alternatives is crucial to CEQA's substantive mandate that significant environmental damage be

25 substantially lessened or avoided where feasible. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081, 21100; CEQA

26 Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392,

27 404-405. CEQA requires government agencies to disclose to the public the reasons why they have

28 approved a particular project if it will result in significant adverse environmental effects. CEQA

6
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Casel

1 Guidelines 15002(a)(4). "The EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed

2 self-government." Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392.

3 29. When the EIR determines that significant adverse effects remain, even after the

4 implementation of all feasible mitigation measures, the agency must balance the benefits of the

5 project against its environmental harm to determine if the project should proceed. Pub. Res. Code

6 §21002; § 21081(d); 14 Cal. Code Reg. § 15093. This "statement of overriding considerations," as

7 the last step in the analysis, provides critical information to the public to fulfill the law's public

8 disclosure requirement - that the EIR function as "a document of accountability" and "informed self

g government." Sierra Club v. Board of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal 4th 1215, 1229 (the agency "retains the

10 power to approve a plan that has significant adverse effects upon the environment, so long as it

11 justifies its action in light of "specific economic, social, or other conditions.")

12 VI. CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA)
13
30. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
14
31. CEQA requires that an EIR contain adequate information for the public and decision makers
15 to determine whether a project may have significant impacts on the environment and whether there
16
are feasible mitigation measures or alternatives that could avoid those impacts. See Laurel Heights,
17 supra, 47 Cal.3d at 392; Pub. Res. Code § 21002. In this case, the EIR fails to meet these standards.
18
32. The EIR does not adequately identify the significant impacts of the Project on the wilderness
19 character of the area as well as the wilderness experience of visitors to the Granite Chief Wilderness,
20

21 including those using the Five Lakes trail to access the wilderness. The Wilderness Act, 16 USC §

22 1131 et seq., requires designated Wilderness areas to "be administered for the use and enjoyment of
the American people in such manner as will leave them unimpaired for future use and enjoyment as
23
wilderness, and so as to provide for the protection of these areas, the preservation of their wilderness
24
character." However, the EIR does not acknowledge that the impacts of the Project on wilderness
25
and the wilderness experience will be significant due to the physical changes to the environment and
26
setting that will occur as a result of installing and operating a large gondola project along the ridge
27 directly crossing the Five Lakes Trail and then down through the middle of the drainage along the
28
eastern border of the wilderness area. The EIR treats impacts to wilderness as not cognizable under

7
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case N

1 CEQA even though visual, noise, biological and other environmental impacts - as well as social

2 effects caused by these physical impacts-are 'effects' that must be analyzed under CEQA. National

3 Parks & Conservation Assn. v. County of Riverside (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1359. The EIR fails

4 to assess the Project's impacts on the wilderness experience of visitors, both by introducing man-

5 made infrastructure into the wilderness viewshed as well as allowing for significant increased use of

6 the Five Lakes area due to the location of the gondola mid-stations.

7 33. The EIR fails to identify or adequately analyze the significant cumulative impacts of the

8 Project on critical dispersal habitat for the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog, a federally listed species

9 which has been detected within the watershed. The EIR errs in assuming that only occupied habitat

10 need be protected, while failing to disclose that this population of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog

11 is extremely rare and genetically unique within its species cohort, and thus in danger of extirpation

12 due to its low numbers in the area. The Project proposes to eliminate aquatic and adjacent upland

13 habitat utilized by this species through vegetation removal/clearing, grading, rock blasting, drill

14 locations for tower and tower installation, mid-stations construction, access route use, trench work

15 for underground utilities at the base terminals, and/or other utilities. Such habitat removed and/or

16 damaged by the Project comprises the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog's prime dispersal route,

17 which impact is neither addressed or mitigated in the EIR. The EIR improperly relies on deferred

18 mitigation to compensate for these impacts, including consultation with wildlife agencies and set

19 aside of preserved habitat elsewhere. However, these off-site measures do not avoid the projected

20 impacts to the species' habitat within the Project area, which include critical dispersal routes along

21 streams that will be adversely modified by the Project's facilities and construction. The deferred

22 measures contain no analysis or ascertainable performance standards and the subsequent consultation

23 that has occurred has not addressed the preservation of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog's

24 dispersal habitat. Such deferral of unformulated mitigation measures is contrary to CEQA. See e.g.,

25 Communities v. Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 92-96; Save Panoche Valley v. San Benito

26 County (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 503, 525; POET, LLC v. Cal. Air Resources Board (2013) 217

League, Inc. V. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 794.

2 34. The EIR unlawfully segments its analysis, and/or fails to identify or adequately analyze the

3 significant cumulative impacts, of the Project in combination with the White Wolf development
planned for the same area. The EIR wrongly asserts that the White Wolf development is independent

5 from the implementation of the Project even though the Project alignment includes a 'mid-station'

6 and road through the existing wilderness that corresponds directly with the planned future
development. The Project has been planned specifically so that property owners and guests of the

8 development would be permitted exclusive private access to enter and exit at this mid-station. The

9 EIR further provides no information as to the need for a southern mid-station coordinated with the

10 future White Wolf development, except to facilitate such development by offering residents private

11 access to the gondola. The EIR's cumulative impact analysis of the effects of the Project in

12 combination with the planned private development is also inadequate. The development will include

13 "38 single-family residential units (parcels .5 to 1.5 acres in size), a clubhouse/lodge, a chairlift, and

14 seasonal recreational facilities including tennis courts and equestrian facilities." The development

15 will be extensive, transforming a pristine and undeveloped watershed bordering the Granite Chief

16 Wilderness and Five Lakes trail into a developed subdivision, with residences, paved roads and

17 substantial alteration of the physical environment. The EIR acknowledges that the cumulative impacts

18 of the Gondola Project and the White Wolf development will bring significant changes to the existing

19 landscape due to the degree of contrast that would result from the presence of these homes compared

20 to the existing condition and irreversible loss of the natural-appearing landscape of the project area,

21 as well as the considerable alteration of habitat planned for the watershed drainage relied on by the

22 Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog as a critical dispersal route. However, notwithstanding these major

23 cumulative changes, the EIR still finds that cumulative impacts to wilderness experience, recreation,

24 aesthetic resources and wildlife will be insignificant. These findings lack adequate information to

25 meet CEQA's standards and are not supported by substantial evidence. The EIR's failure to identify

26 and address these cumulative impacts violates CEQA. See e.g., Communities for a Better

27 Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 117; Los Angeles Unified

28 School Dist. v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58 Cal. App 4th 1019, 1026; 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15355.

9
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 35. The EIR fails to identify or adequately analyze the Project's significant visual impacts. The

2 impacts of the Project on visual quality for visitors to the wilderness area will be adverse and
3 significant as the development will transform a pristine and undeveloped valley surrounded by granite

4 cliffs into a central transportation corridor for the ski area involving towers and platforms carrying

5 an estimated 1,4000 persons traveling each way per day. The EIR also does not assess or identify the

6 significant visual impacts that will occur due to the cumulative effects of the Project in combination

7 with the White Wolf development, which will transform the pristine watershed separating the Granite

8 Chief Wilderness and the Five Lakes trail into a housing development with roads, towers and

9 exclusive residences built on the edge of the wilderness area. Where the EIR does determine that

10 visual impacts will be significant under CEQA, it fails to adequately consider alternative routes or

11 other project alternatives that would avoid such impacts, nor does the County make a finding

12 supported by substantial evidence that such an alternatives are infeasible. The EIR does not present

13 information showing that it is infeasible to operate the Alpine Meadows and Squaw Valley ski areas

14 without a Gondola connection splintering the wilderness viewshed of the Granite Chief Wilderness

15 and Five Lakes trail. The Project is not 'necessary' but instead is development that is desired and thus

16 the proposed substantially adverse change in the wilderness viewshed will not be justified by any

17 balancing of social and economic considerations. See Pub. Res. Code § 21002; Laurel Heights, supra,

18 47 Cal.3d at 400-403; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.

19 36. The EIR fails to adopt enforceable mitigation that would restrict the ability of the gondola

20 Project to operate in the summer and thus used as a mechanized means to access the Granite Chief

21 Wilderness by summer visitors. This failure will allow undue damage to the wilderness area, which

22 is contrary to the Tahoe Forest Plan's wilderness objectives to limit change to resources that, if

23 overused, would degrade the wilderness experience. This failure is particularly problematic with

24 respect to the Squaw mid-station, which would be constructed near or on top of the ridge just above

25 the Five Lakes trail as the trail enters the wilderness area. Further the EIR's mitigation of signage is

26 inadequate as it does not constitute a requirement that such access is not allowed, nor does is the EIR

27 provide any actual mitigation prohibiting the use of the mid-stations to access the wilderness area.

28 The EIR also does not propose as enforceable mitigation that the gondola Project cannot be operated

10
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 during the non-winter season. In the absence of enforceable mitigation, the EIR does not address the

2 foreseeable likelihood of increased wilderness usage and visitor impacts due to the expansion of the

3 Project for summer use, consistent with existing plans to develop Squaw Valley and Alpine Meadows

4 into a 12 month a year destination for developed recreation. The EIR's failure to prescribe and the

5 County's failure to adopt enforceable mitigation measures on these issues is contrary to CEQA. See

6 Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(b); 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.4(a)(2); Federation of Hillside and Canyon

7 Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261; Lincoln Place Tenants Assn.

8 V. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal. App. 4th 1491, 1508-09.

9 37. The EIR fails to adequately describe the project and the environmental setting. Under CEQA,

10 the EIR must contain a full description of the environmental setting and project. See 14 Cal. Code

11 Reg. § 15125; San Joaquin Raptor v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th 713, 722-723;

12 County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App.3d 185, 192-193. The EIR fails to

13 provide adequate descriptions in a number of respects: 1) failure to provide descriptions of the

14 construction specifics including the locations of towers and construction roads proposed to build the

15 Project infrastructure; 2) failure to provide a description of an access road, which will cross and run

16 through the wilderness area immediately to the east of Five Lakes, without detail on the specific

17 location of the road vis vis sensitive wetland or cliff features on the land, including the main section

18 proposed within the designated wilderness; 3) failure to provide a full explanation of the relationship

19 between the White Wolf development and the Project, including a description for how components

20 of the Project will integrate into the development such as through mid-stations designed to ensure

21 access to residents proposed to be living in the Project area in the future: 4) failure to provide

22 information on the population status of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog in this area, a population

23 that has been identified by the regulatory agencies as critically imperiled due to its isolated genetic

24 status and low abundance; and 5) failure to describe the existing setting by not disclosing the

25 existence of a long term lease agreement between the private property owner Caldwell and Squaw

26 Valley Resorts dating back to 2015, which would demonstrate the extent to which the Gondola and

27 White Wolf projects are in fact coordinated and require each other's approval for each Project to

28 proceed forward.

11
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

1 38. The EIR fails to consider a non-gondola project alternative that would avoid the significant

2 visual, wilderness, recreational and biological impacts of the Project, as required by CEQA, including

3 an alternative that would improve the existing shuttle system. Instead, the EIR only considers Project
alternatives that include the construction of a gondola adjacent to and through the viewshed of the

5 Granite Chief Wilderness Area. The EIR wrongly does not evaluate a shuttle improvement alternative

6 based on an overly narrow project purpose, contrary to CEQA. See North Coast Rivers Alliance v.

7 Kawamura (2016) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668-69. Further, under CEQA, an agency may not approve

8 a proposed project if a feasible alternative exists that would meet a project's objectives and would

9 diminish or avoid its significant environmental impacts. Pub. Res. Code § 21002; Kings County Farm

10 Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 731. An alternative need not meet every

11 Project objective or be the least costly in order to be feasible. See CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

12 The EIR fails to meet these standards as there is no analysis or substantial evidence showing that a

13 non-gondola alternative is infeasible in meeting reasonable objectives for operating a ski area.

14 VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

16 1. For a writ of mandate ordering Respondent to set aside its approval of the Project until

17 it has complied with CEQA; and to file a return with the Court showing compliance with the writ;

18 2. For injunctive relief enjoining any construction or operation of the Project until such

19 time as Respondent has complied with CEQA and filed a satisfactory return with the Court showing

20 compliance with the writ of mandate;

21 3. For reasonable attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5;

22 4. For costs of suit; and

23 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.
