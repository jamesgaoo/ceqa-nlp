22 INTRODUCTION

23 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to assure that the Regents of the University of
24 California (the "University") complies with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
25 Resources Code section 21000 et seq., before deciding whether to develop a massive student housing
26 project at the University of California at Santa Cruz ("UCSC"), including development on the pristine
27 land iconic East Meadow. Petitioner and plaintiff Habitat and Watershed Caretakers seeks full
28 environmental disclosure, appropriately timed and placed campus development, adherence to the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 1 -

1 University's core commitment to public service, and protection of irreplaceable, world-class vistas,
2 vulnerable endangered species and scarce and overtapped water supplies. Petitioner challenges the
3 University's unlawful action in approving the Student Housing West Project ("SHW" or "Project"),
4 certifying the Project's Environmental Impact Project ("EIR"), adopting the Mitigation Monitoring and
5 Reporting Program ("MMRP"), CEQA Findings, and Statement of Overriding Considerations thereto,
6 approving Amendment No. 2 to UCSC 2 2005 Long Range Development Plan ("2005 LRDP") and the
7 Project's design, and issuing the March 29, 2019 Notice of Determination ("NOD") (collectively,
8 I"Approvals") for the Project. These Approvals authorized construction of a poorly sited and needlessly
9 impactful housing project at two sites on the UCSC campus that will degrade important views and the
10 beauty of the deeply venerated and the long-protected East Meadow, in violation of CEQA.
11 2. The impacts of the SHW Project demonstrably exceed the University's disclosure,
12 evaluation and mitigation of them. The Project will severely degrade visual resources, commit the City of
13 Santa Cruz Water Department ("SCWD") to provide water it does not have, and undermine UCSC's
14 /public service goals in favor of private development interests. Although the Project literally paves the
15 way for future expansion onto and degradation of the pristine East Meadow, that growth-inducing impact
16 is ignored. The Project's addition of 3,000 beds also prematurely commits the University to a rapid-
17 growth, high-density scenario which would increase the student population by over 50 percent from the
18 roughly 18,000 students accommodated today to 28,000 students by 2040 - before the public and the
19 decisionmakers have reviewed, let alone approved, this future expansion.
20 3. The entirety of this Project will be planned, constructed and operated "via a public-private
21 partnership (P3) delivery method" ("PPP"), which poses profound conflicts with the public's control over
22 the scale, pace and nature of campus development. September 2018 Revised Draft Environmental Impact
23 Report ("RDEIR") 3.0-1; February 2019 Final Environmental Impact Report (*FEIR") 2.0-2. The
24 University is a public education and research institution that is "driven by values of public service." The

ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2-

1 UCSC campus likewise prides itself on its "uncommon commitment to .. public service."2 Yet, this
2 /Project will interpose private, profit-driven management biases into the decisionmaking process for future
3 campus development. Under the PPP model, the private developer - Alabama-based Capstone Partners
4 will finance, design and build the buildings, set rent and fees, and make a profit, on all new development.

5 This privatization of campus development undermines the University's public service-driven policies by
6 injecting private, profit-driven priorities and prejudices into the planning process.

7 4. The University admits that these private, profit-driven goals conflict with the University's
8 public objectives. It states that "the use of a PPP is most effective for projects that .. [a]re situated off-

9 campus on land not owned by [the University]" because projects on University owned land often
10 *constrain contracting options available to private sector developers" and limit their ability to make a
11 profit.® This discordant competition between divergent public and private decision-making paradigms
12 raises the question whose goals will prevail in the planning process - the University's public-service
13 objectives, or the developer's private profit-driven bottomline. The FEIR fails to reveal, let alone
14 analyze, the PPP model's conflicts with the interests of students, faculty and staff and the public that
15 ultimately pays for it all.

16 5. The Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on natural resources, including
17 the visual resources in the East Meadow. The extraordinary and iconic beauty of the East Meadow will
18 be permanently degraded. RDEIR 4.1-55 to 4.1-63; FEIR 4.0-8 to 4.0-11. The Project will overwhelm
19 SCWD's inadequate and overcommitted water supply. The University admits that "there would be a
20 substantial gap between supply and demand during multiple dry years." RDEIR 4.13-21; FEIR 3.0-210.
21 Habitat important to imperiled species, including burrowing owls and California red-legged frogs, would
22 be harmed.

23 6. Despite these profound and pervasive adverse impacts, the University failed to perform

1 essential environmental reviews of them, thwarting informed public and agency review and comment.
2 Most notably, it failed to fully consider the impacts of the PPP model on the interests of students, faculty,
3 staff and the taxpayer, and to comply with CEQA's mandate that the unresolved water supply shortfall

4 must be addressed before - rather than after - approval of this massive growth.

5 7. The University also failed to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project and
6 the large-scale growth it would unleash. In an attempt to justify opening the East Meadow to current and
7 future development, the University downplayed the costs and impacts of the Project as compared to those
8 of the alternatives. Its apples-to-oranges cost analysis ignored both the short- and the long-term costs
9 associated with creating new development on the East Meadow. The University's attempt to downplay
10 both the cost and impact of constructing housing on the East Meadow violates CEQA.
11 8. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate setting aside, a declaration invalidating, and an
12 injunction forbidding implementation of, the SHW Project, FEIR, and associated Mitigation Monitoring
13 and Reporting Program, CEQA Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Amendment No. 2 to
14 the 2005 LRDP, Project design approval, and the related NOD, pending the University's full compliance
15 with CEQA.

16 PARTIES

17 9. Petitioner HABITAT AND WATERSHED CARETAKERS ("HAWC") is a public
18 interest citizens organization whose members reside within the County of Santa Cruz and use and enjoy
19 environmental resources that would be adversely impacted by the University's approval and
20 implementation of the SHW Project and its FEIR. HAWC and its members actively participated in the
21 administrative proceedings that preceded the University's adoption of the Approvals. Their
22 environmental, aesthetic, recreational, scenic, scientific, historic, cultural and community interests will,
23 unless the relief requested herein is granted, be adversely affected by the University's failure to comply
24 with CEQA in approving the SHW Project,. The University's approval of the Project and its FEIR will
25 harm HAWC and its members because the Project will degrade important aesthetic resources, over-
26 commit SCWD's limited water resources to unnecessary growth, undermine UCSC's public-interest
27 values, and cause significant adverse environmental impacts to the public's use and enjoyment of UCSC
28 lands, waters, wildlife and scenery.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 10. HAWC and its members availed themselves of all available administrative remedies to

2 laddress the University's violation of CEQA by commenting and objecting at every opportunity. HAWC
3 gave prior notice of this proceeding to the University and the California Attorney General in accordance
4 with applicable law, as documented in petitioner's Proof of Service of petitioner's Notice of Intent to File
5 CEQA Action filed concurrently herewith.

6 11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within the
7 meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086, in that the University's approval of the Project and its
8 FEIR is not otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy.

9 12. Respondent REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA owns and manages
10 the Santa Cruz Campus of the University of California. The Regents has "full powers of organization and
11 governance" over the University of California, including the UCSC campus, under article IX, section 9,
12 of the California Constitution. On March 14, 2019, the Regents, through its governing Board, approved
13 the Project, certified its FEIR, adopted the MMRP, CEQA Findings, and Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations, approved Amendment No. 2 to the 2005 LRDP, and approved the Project design. The
15 /Regents then posted its NOD for the Project with the California Office of Planning and Research on
16 March 29, 2019.

17 13. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
18 |petitioner who therefore sues said respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil
19 Procedure section 474. Petitioner will seek leave of Court to amend this petition and complaint when the
20 Itrue names and capacities of said DOE respondents have been ascertained.

21 14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES
22 XXI-L, and therefore sues said real parties by such fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes,
23 and based on such information and belief alleges, that the fictitiously named real parties in interest are
24 either responsible in some way for the above-described threatened injury to petitioner, or otherwise have
25 a direct economic interest in the approval of the SHW Project and certification of the FEIR alleged above
a 26 in a manner adverse to petitioner's interests. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties
27 in interest have been determined, petitioner will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this Verified
28 Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 15. This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
1085, et seq., Public Resources Code section 21168.5, and article XI, section 10 of the California

4 Constitution.

16. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 (actions
6 lagainst public officers), and 395 (actions generally) because the University of California Santa Cruz is
7 located within this County.

8 17. This petition is timely filed within 30 days of the City's filing of its Notice of
9 Determination announcing its approval of the Project and certification of its FEIR with the California
10 Office of Planning and Research on March 29, 2019, in accordance with California Public Resources

11 Code section 21167.

12 FACTS

13 18. The SHW Project proposes to add approximately 3,000 student beds to two sites - the
14 Heller site and the Hagar site on the UCSC campus by 2023, via the PPP model.
15 19. The Heller site is located near the west entrance to campus and comprises five buildings,
16 up to seven stories tall, with apartments that would provide approximately 2,712 undergraduate student
17 beds. FEIR 2.0-2. Laundry, mail, and custodial facilities, as well as other support spaces, would also be
18 constructed at the Heller site. Id.

19 20. The Hagar site would permanently convert 17 acres of pristine meadow in the southeast
20 portion of the campus - widely known as the East Meadow- to family student housing. FEIR 2.0-2, 2.0-
21 3. The Hagar site would develop 140 new student beds in 35 two-story townhouses, a 3,500 square foot
22 community building, and a 1,375 quare foot maintenance building, among other infrastructure. FEIR 2.0-

23 3. The Hagar site is currently designated as Campus Resource Land under the 2005 LRDP and is
24 therefore forbidden to development. FEIR 2.0-3; 2005 LRDP 68. Under the 2005 LRDP, "these lands
25 would be maintained in their natural state to serve as long-term reserve lands for future use." 2005 LRDP
26 68. Because the Project proposes to develop these important resource lands, the University proposes to
27 amend the 2005 LRDP. FEIR 2.0-3.

28 21. The PPP model directly contradicts UCSC's stated public service values. The University

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6 -

1 of California is a public education and research institution that prides itself on its commitment to public
2 service. Yet, this Project will interpose private, profit-driven motivations and corporate management

3 biases into the decisionmaking process of this otherwise public service-driven educational institution.
4 Under the PPP model, the private developer - Capstone Partners will provide the capital, design and
|build the buildings, set rent and fees, and make a profit, on all of the new development. Indeed, it was
6 this developer - not the University - who proposed to develop housing on the East Meadow site because
7 its cost of development would be less. FEIR 2.0-15.

8 22. The FEIR's Project objectives state that the Project is needed to "[s]upport the
9 development of sufficient and affordable, on-campus student housing under the UC President's Housing
10 Initiative." FEIR 2.0-4; RDEIR 3.0-7. The President's Housing Initiative is a statewide program that
11 favors and promotes privatization of the University's development planning process. Under this
12 initiative, "the Office of the President led an effort to identify housing developers .. . that would be
13 eligible to respond to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for campus-specific student housing projects.34

14 23. The 2005 LRDP "provides a comprehensive framework for the physical development of
15 the UC Santa Cruz campus." FEIR 2.0-16. All development on campus is therefore subject to guidance
16 by the goals set forth in the LRDP, including the overarching goal of "maintaining the campus's strong
17 traditions of environmental stewardship and sustainability." 2005 LRDP 1. The 2005 LRDP presents a
18 framework that "accommodate[s] an on-campus three-quarter-average enrollment of 19,500 full time
19 equivalent (FTE) students by 2020-21.3 FEIR 2.0-16.

20 24. In 2008, UCSC, the City of Santa Cruz and other parties reached a Comprehensive

21 Settlement Agreement ("CSA"), as a result of a lawsuit, that required UCSC to house "67 percent of new
22 student enrollment above a baseline of 15,000 three-quarter average FTE." RDEIR 1.0-4. The University
23 claims that the Project is necessary to meet the goal of housing 67 percent of the 2005 LRDP's 19,500
24 |FTE enrollment goal. FEIR 2.0-4. However, the SHW Project is not necessary to achieve this goal, and
25 directly contradicts the 2005 LRDP's goals for balancing campus development with environmental
26 |protection.

25. It appears that the unstated purpose behind the SHW Project is to preemptively open the
2 door to future growth on campus beyond the current 19,500 FTE student projection. FEIR 3.0-198.
3 UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal has stated his intent to expand the campus by approximately

4 10,000 FTE students, to €28,000 students by 2040" "from the roughly 18,000 students [UCSC]
5 accommodate[s] today." Chancellor George Blumenthal, 2020 Long Range Development Plan update,
6 January 12, 2018. The University has a long-term strategy of continuing to expand the campus until there
7 is no readily developable open space left. Yet, it intends to review the impacts of each expansion only
8 incrementally, in violation of CEQA.

9 26. UCSC issued its Notice of Preparation (NOP") of its Draft Environmental Impact Report
10 ("DEIR") for the Project on August 31, 2017, and a issued a revised NOP on October 31, 2017. UCSC
11 issued its DEIR on March 27, 2018. The public comment period for the DEIR closed on June 27, 2018.
12 UCSC issued its RDEIR on September 17, 2018, and the public review period closed on November 1,
13 2018. Its FEIR was published in February 2019.

14 27. On March 14, 2019, the Regents, through its governing Board, purported to approve the
15 Project. The Regents then filed its NOD for the Project, finding that the FEIR and related approvals
16 complied with CEQA, with the California Office of Planning and Research on March 29, 2019.
17 28. Petitioner and its members participated in the administrative proceedings leading up to the
18 Regents' approval of the Project and certification of its FEIR either by participating in hearings thereon,
19 or by submitting letters commenting on the DEIR, RDEIR and FEIR. Petitioner attempted, to no avail, to
20 persuade the University that its environmental review did not comply with CEQA's requirements. The
21 University's approval of the Project and certification of its FEIR are not subject to further administrative
22 review. Accordingly, petitioner seeks this Court's review of the Approvals to rectify the violations of
23 CEQA summarized above and detailed below.

3 NOD for the Project, constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the University failed to proceed in

4 the manner required by law, and the Approvals are not supported by substantial evidence, in the following
5 respects, among others.

6 The Project Description Is Inadequate
7 31. The FEIR's Project description is inadequate. An adequate project description is an
8 lessential starting point for analysis of a project's environmental impacts, and all environmental impact
9 reports must provide one. 14 California Code of Regulations ["CEQA Guidelines"] § 15124. As
10 directed by the CEQA Guidelines, the project description "shall contain the following information:"
11 (a) The precise location and boundaries of the proposed project … shown on a detailed map.
12 (b) A statement of objectives sought by the proposed project[, which] will help the Lead Agency develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate in the BIR .. .. The statement of objectives
13 should include the underlying purpose of the project. (c) A general description of the project's technical, economic, and environmental characteristics
14 Id.

15 32. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative
16 and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles ("County of Inyo") (1977) 71
17 |Cal.App.3d 185, 193. By contrast,

18 [a] curtailed or distorted project description may stultify the objectives of the reporting
19 process. Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal's benefits against its environmental cost, consider
20 mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e. the "no project" alternative) and weigh other alternatives in the balance.
21 Id. at 192-193.

22 33. Here, the FEIR's Project objectives state that the Project is needed to "[s]upport the
23 development of sufficient and affordable, on-campus student housing under the UC President's Housing
24 Initiative." FEIR 2.0-4; RDEIR 3.0-7. The President's Housing Initiative is a statewide program that
25 favors and promotes privatization of the University's development planning process. Under this
26 initiative, "the Office of the President led an effort to identify housing developers . . . that would be
27

28

ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9-

eligible to respond to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for campus-specific student housing projects."5

2 34. But the FEIR fails to explain the three unexamined central premises of this initiative that
3 Ipreordain its direction and impacts: (1) that statewide campus growth be imposed on all campuses at the
4 same rapid pace regardless of each campus' environmental carrying capacity (i.e., one size fits all), (2)
5 that private profit-driven decisionmaking ultimately determines the size, density, pace and quality of all
6 on-campus housing development, and (3) that on-campus housing is the only means of achieving
7 convenient access to" campus and "reduc[ing] the growth in vehicle trips to the campus." FEIR 2.0-4;
8 RDEIR 3.0-7. But improved public transportation would achieve both of the latter goals. The FEIR
9 claims that these premises "are not contained in the Housing Initiative" and makes the conclusory
10 assertion that the Project is necessary for the 19,500 students allowable under the 2005 LRDP. FEIR 3.0-
11 201 to 3.0-202. But neither of those claims addresses, let alone analyzes the basis for, these threshold
12 premises. Whether these premises are contained in the Housing Initiative or not, the premise underlying
13 the Housing Initiative is that this growth presumed. The University should have first questioned whether
14 that premise is accurate before undertaking the Project. The failure to address the presumed need for
15 growth led to an inadequate environmental review document as discussed below.
16 35. The FEIR fails to address why UCSC should bear the same - or an even higher - burden
17 of statewide University student growth as the other campuses - regardless of the severe local
18 environmental impacts that this "one size fits all" imperative unleashes. Indeed, as the FEIR admits, only
19 726 new beds are needed to accomplish the goals set forth in the 2008 CSA. RDEIR 3.0-8. Yet UCSC is
20 |building nearly 3,000 beds - more than four times what is required under the CSA and more than one
21 fifth of all of the beds required statewide by the Housing Initiative. The FEIR fails to ask - let alone
22 answer the threshold question why additional growth that follows a University-wide "one size fits all"
23 Japproach should be the guiding principle. As discussed below, UCSC faces water supply shortfalls,
24 massive defacement of a world-renowned iconic landscape, and significant biological impacts, from
25 placement of the SHW Project on the East Meadow.

26 36. Furthermore, the FEIR fails to explain why the decision to impose massive growth on

1 UCSC should be unduly influenced by private interests bent on building as big a project as possible rather
2 than moderated by the University's public goals. The FEIR fails to analyze whether privatization of the
3 University undermines these important goals and therefore should not dictate housing policy.

4 37. Nor does the FEIR address, contrary to its underlying premise, whether on-campus
5 housing is the only means "to facilitate convenient access to classrooms and other learning environments;
6 student services; campus amenities such as retail, restaurants and fitness facilities; and reduce the growth
7 in vehicle trips to the campus." FEIR 2.0-4; RDEIR 3.0-7. The FEIR ignores the fact - raised by
8 petitioner and others that these objectives could be encouraged and accomplished through increased
9 shuttle access, better online and electronic access, incentives and infrastructure for carpooling, and greater
10 Ipedestrian and bicycle access coupled with greater restrictions on campus vehicular use and parking. The
11 fact that UCSC already implements some of these measures does not eliminate the need for the FEIR to
12 consider expansion of these programs as an alternative to the proposed Project. FEIR 3.0-202 to 3.0-203.

13 38. Yet, the FEIR objectives describe the Project as a forgone conclusion because they a
14 Ipresume that this privatization and housing growth must occur at UCSC. And as further discussed below,
15 even if housing growth on the UCSC campus is justified, the FEIR fails to address why it cannot be
16 accommodated largely - if not wholly - within the current building footprint.

17 The FEIR Fails to Consider a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

18 39. CEQA mandates that an EIR must provide the public with a full assessment of alternatives
19 to the proposed project. Pub. Resources Code § 21001(g). CEQA confirms "it is the policy of the state
20 |that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives . . . available
21 which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects . . . ." Pub.
22 Resources Code § 21002. The Legislature directed that an "[EIR] shall include a detailed statement
23 setting forth .. . [a]lternatives to the proposed project," and declared that one of "[t]he purpose[s] of an
24 [EIR] is to identify alternatives to the project." Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002.1(a) (second quote),
25 21061, 21100(b)(4) (first quote).

26 40. CEQA requires an EIR to describe a reasonable range of alternatives that could feasibly
27 attain most of the basic objectives of the project while avoiding or substantially lessening any of its
28 significant effects. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a) and (f). "An EIR's discussion of alternatives must

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF . 11 -

1 contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making." Laurel Heights Improvement Association
2 v. Regents of the University of California ("Laurel Heights") (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 404. An alternative
3 may "not be eliminated from consideration solely because it would impede to some extent the attainment
4 of the project's objectives." Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz ("HAWC"') (2013)
213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b). "The EIR is required to make an in-depth
6 discussion of those alternatives [that have been] identified as at least potentially feasible." HAWC, 213
7 |Cal.App.4th at 1303 (emphasis and quotation omitted).

8 41. Despite revision of the University's alternatives analysis from the DEIR to the RDEIR and
9 FEIR, the FEIR still fails to identify and evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed
10 Project. RDEIR 5.0-1. The alternatives that were examined by the FEIR were not reasonably calculated
11 to significantly reduce the Project's adverse impacts. The FEIR analyzes seven alternatives - a No
12 Project Alternative, and six alternatives that all develop the Heller Site. RDEIR 5.0-16 to 5.0-83. The
13 IFEIR fails to consider alternatives that achieve most of the Project's objectives without developing the
14 Heller Site.

15 42. Moreover, none of these alternatives considered shifting some of the proposed student
16 growth to other UC campuses that have adequate carrying capacities - including sufficient water supplies

17 and thus fewer environmental impacts. Instead, the Project assumes that UCSC must be expanded, and
18 keep expanding, to accommodate more and more students on a campus that cannot support that growth.
19 Only one campus - Merced - has been added to the UC system in more than 50 years, while the
20 population of California has more than doubled during this period. Yet UCSC -the campus with the
21 greatest resource constraints including a severe water supply shortfall - is unreasonably expected to bear
22 a disproportionate share of this statewide growth. There is nothing inherently infeasible about an
23 lalternative that limits growth on the UCSC campus - due to these indisputable resource constraints -
24 while accommodating that growth at other UC campuses, new or existing. As noted, an alternative may
25 not be eliminated from consideration solely because it would impede to some extent the attainment of
26 Ithe project's objectives." HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1304. The FEIR's cursory dismissal of this
27 alternative in insufficient under CEQA. FEIR 3.0-23. Its conclusory paragraph claiming that the Project
28 "is needed to meet demand for student housing" assumes the Santa Cruz campus must accommodate

ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 12 -

rapid student growth that ultimately will vastly exceed the 19,500 students approved under the 2005
2 LRDP - a premise CEQA forbids. FEIR 3.0-23. CEQA requires consideration of a reasonable range of
3 alternatives that would avoid this dramatic and disruptive spike in UCSC's housing burden by fairly
4  redistributing that burden to other UC campuses that can better absorb it.

5 43. Consideration of a less impactful alternative that would redistribute this proposed growth
6 to other UC campuses is especially important given the Santa Cruz campus' lack of an adequate water
7 (supply. According to the City's Urban Water Management Plan (*UWMP"), "the City has had to declare
8 la water shortage in five of the . seven years" between 2009 and 2015.5 The City admits in its current
9 Water Supply Impact Assessment ("WSA") that the SCWD "is facing several obstacles in meeting its
10 present and future water supply needs." RDEIR 7.1-12. Indeed, the City's WSA discloses that "'annual
11 shortages of 16 to 21 percent are predicted" during a single dry year, and shortages over 50 percent will
12 occur after three dry years." RDEIR 7.1-32 to 7.1-33 (Table 7.1-10). The FEIR fails to address the
13 threshold question whether this resource-busting growth in enrollment - 50 percent in 20 years - is even
14 |possible - let alone appropriate - in view of the lack of an adequate water supply to support even the

15 existing development served by the City of Santa Cruz Water Department. The FEIR should, but fails to
16 consider alternatives that reduce the scale, pace and impacts of development in recognition of the severe
17 resource constraints at this campus.

18 44. The FEIR fails to consider other potentially feasible alternatives that would achieve the
19 Project's basic objectives at a lower environmental cost. For example, it cursorily dismisses an
20 lalternative that would repurpose buildings - including structures not currently used for housing - already
21 on campus to meet the University's housing goals. FEIR 3.0-22; see also RDEIR 5.0-15. "A potentially
22 feasible alternative that might avoid a significant impact must be discussed and analyzed in an EIR so as
23 Ito provide information to the decision makers about the alternative's potential for reducing environmental
24 |impacts." HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1304 (emphasis in original); Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 404.
25 Increasing the density of occupancy of existing housing is known to be feasible, since the University "has
26 already implemented a number of projects to increase the density of occupancy of existing housing,"

P RDEIR 5.0-15. The option of repurposing buildings not currently used for housing is never considered at
2 all, despite petitioner's repeated requests that it be assessed. Instead, the University summarily dismissed
3 this alternative by claiming - without factual support - that "[m]ore beds cannot be added to the existing
4 colleges on the campus without new construction." RDEIR 2.0-5. Dismissing an alternative that would
5 |repurpose buildings not currently used for housing without analysis violates CEQA. CEQA Guidelines
6 15126.6; HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1304.

7 45. The FEIR also fails to analyze any alternative that maintains the current footprint and
8 simply adds floors to - or redesigns or repurposes existing floors within - existing structures. RDEIR
9 (5.0-11 to 5.0-83. All of the action alternatives contemplate construction of entirely new buildings, but
10 many of the Project's impacts could be avoided by expanding or better utilizing the existing infrastructure
11 within the same footprint. The FEIR's failure to consider this alternative - despite petitioner's repeated
12 requests that it do SO - violates CEQA's demand for a reasonable range of alternatives. CEQA
13 Guidelines § 15126.6; HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1304.

14 46. Furthermore, the FEIR fails to consider the alternative of developing the land owned by
15 the University in the nearby City of Marina. The University already plans to use these lands to expand its
16 facilities. Of the University's 1,100 acres in Marina, 500 acres are planned, and 127 acres are already
17 approved, for development. Despite the availability of these developable lands, the University failed to
18 consider an alternative that would utilize them for student housing, ignoring petitioner's repeated requests
19 Ithat it do so. Under CEQA, the University had duty to evaluate the feasibility of developing these lands
20 instead of destroying the pristine East Meadow. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6; HAWC, 213 Cal.App. 4th

21 at 1304.

22 47. The University further violated CEQA because its analysis of the potential to utilize the
23 North Remote Site to house students is misleading. Because that site would require new dining and other
24 facilities due to its location, the cost of developing those facilities was included in the per-bed cost for
25 that alternative. UCSC, Student Housing West, Supplementary Campus Report: EIR Alternatives, An In-
26 Depth Review of Scope, Schedule, Budget, & Influencing Factors Affecting Achievement of Project
27 |Objectives, March 23, 2019, 18-19, 30-31. However, even though new dining facilities are likewise
28 required for the Heller site, the dining expansion at the Heller site was instead excluded as "a separate

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14 -

project with its own separate source of funding." RDEIR 2.0-4. Comparing the cost of the North Remote
2 Site - with the cost of dining facilities included - to the cost of the Heller site - from which the cost of
dining facilities was excluded - is a distorted apples-to-oranges comparison. The FEIR should have
4 compared these alternatives fairly by either including the cost of dining facilities - or not -for both sites.

5 48. Finally, the University's dismissal of feasible alternatives because they would add to the
6 cost of the Project, violates CEQA. The RDEIR acknowledges that an EIR "shall focus on alternatives to
7 the project or its location that are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of
8 the project, even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project
9 objectives, or would be more costly." RDEIR 5.0-1 (quoting Guidelines § 15126.6(b), emphasis added).
10 Therefore, the University's rejection of the Heller Site and North Campus Development Alternative
11 (RDEIR 5.0-12), the Heller Site and Off-Campus Housing Development Alternative (RDEIR 5.0-14),
12 Alternative 2: Reduced Project Alternative (RDEIR 5.0-31), Alternative 3: Heller Site Development Only
13 Alternative (RDEIR 5.0-37), Alternative 4: Heller Site and North Remote Site Development Alternative
14 (RDEIR 5.0-49), Alternative 5: Heller Site and East Campus Infill Development Alternative (RDEIR 5.0-
15 61), Alternative 6: Heller, East Campus Infill, and Delaware Site Development Alternative (RDEIR 5.0-
16 73), and Alternative 7: Heller, East Campus Infill, and North Remote Site Development Alternative
17 (RDEIR 5.0-83), largely because they would result in a higher per bed cost than the proposed Project
18 violates CEQA. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

19 49. It appears that the University's rejection of alternatives that would spare the East Meadow
20 from development stems from the fact - undisclosed in its FEIR - that some or all of them would not be
21 profitable for a third-party developer. The July 19 and 21, 2016 Meeting Minutes of the Regents'
22 Committee of Grounds and Buildings reveal that UCSC has limited debt capacity and would therefore be
23 unable to finance these alternatives without private investment - an investment that requires the surrender
24 of public design and public control - the so-called PPP model.' Those Minutes disclose that "[u]ntil
25 recently, [UCSC's] limited debt capacity constrained its ability to develop significant new housing."

27 The Regents of the University of California, Committee on Grounds and Buildings, July 19 and

28 21, 2016 Meeting Minutes (attached as Exhibit 1 to petitioner's March 11, 2019 letter to the
Regents).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15 -

1 Petitioner's March 11, 2019 letter to the Regents ("March 11 letter") at Exhibit 1, pp. 4-5; see also
2 Exhibit 1, p. 6 ("the reason the campus had not developed more housing was because of the limitations of
3 its debt capacity").

4 50. According to these Minutes, Regent Perez acknowledged that the PPP model poses
5 conflicts with public control, because "considerations of debt capacity would drive too many decisions"
6 unless tempered by other considerations. March 11 letter at Exhibit 1, p. 7. Notwithstanding these
7 serious shortcomings - never revealed, let alone analyzed, in the FEIR - the PPP model was proposed to
8 provide the University with the private funds to support this new development. Id. at Exhibit 1, p. 5.
9 Contrary to CEQA, the public has been kept in the dark about the real rationale underlying the proposed
10 PPP model, and its many drawbacks.

11 51. The consequences of hiding this machination from the public are never examined, but
12 appear to be profound. For example, it seems that the private financing mechanism of the PPP model has
13 led to the rejection of some environmentally superior alternatives in favor of both faster growth and
14 larger-scale development. As the Committee on Grounds and Buildings noted, "[t]he campus has
15 developed plans for a number of projects to increase on-campus housing to meet the demand of
16 enrollment growth." March 11 letter at Exhibit 1, p. 3. But the rapid housing growth proposed in those
17 /projects is unnecessary to meet the objectives of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement ("CSA"), as
18 the requirements of the CSA [have been] met primarily by increasing density." Id. at Exhibit 1, p. 4.
19 Rather than striving to achieve the goals of the CSA - as UCSC claims this Project is intended to do
20 UCSC is, instead, responding to the financial interests and demands of the private developer in promoting
21 faster and larger development.

22 52. A larger-scale project providing many more beds than is required by the CSA also
23 conveniently allows UCSC to place its thumb on the scales by jumping the gun on the 2020 Long Range
24 Development Plan ("LRDP"). In order to provide the lenders with the added security of increasing
25 student demand for beds by continually expanding enrollment beyond 19,500 students, UCSC has
26 prematurely committed the public - and the Regents - to needlessly rapid development driven by
27 enrollment growth far beyond the 19,500 students now authorized. UCSC had 18,704 FTE enrollments
28 in 2017-2018, and has been increasing its FTE enrollment by approximately 700 students per year - a rate

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16 -

1 of growth faster than the other campuses.8

2 53. This needless rapid growth is also detailed in the Update on Housing Strategy that was
3 presented to the Regents in support of Chancellor Blumenthal's presentation on July 19, 2016.9 That
4 /presentation shows continually increasing enrollment through 2024-25 as if it is foregone conclusion.
5 March 11 letter at Exhibit 5, p. 4. Furthermore, this Update assumes, without evaluation, that additional
6 housing for this rapidly and continually increasing enrollment will be developed under the PPP model.
7 Id. at Exhibit 5, p. 4. And the presentation admits that the PPP model will be used to "[a]ddress[] future
8 demand and enrollment growth." Id. at Exhibit 5, p. 7. But again, despite these clear admissions that
9 private-interests will dictate housing growth, the FEIR fails to consider the implications for UCSC's
10 public service goals.

11 54. The artificial - indeed, manufactured - pressure to needlessly expedite growth sacrifices
12 informed review by, and full accountability to, the public. For example, UCSC repeatedly relied on the
13 claimed need for speed to justify the rejection of less-impactful, smaller-scale alternatives. This cart-
14 before-the-horse approach has generated increased enrollment faster than adequate housing could be
15 supplied. March 11 letter at Exhibit 1, p. 5 ("housing must be developed quickly at [UCSC]"), 6
16 (encouraging the University to "engage architects and builders capable of constructing high-quality
17 housing quickly"), 7 ("the desire to move as quickly as possible was clear").

18 55. But UCSC's lack of transparency is not consistent with CEQA. And, it certainly should
19 not be used to mask subordination of the public interest to the financial demands of a private developer.
20 Instead, UCSC should be mindful of the University's public service goals. The PPP Model's pursuit of

1 Iprivate gain has resulted in the rejection of environmentally superior alternatives. The Regents should
2 answer to the public, not to private investors.

3 56. As shown, the FEIR violates CEQA because it fails to consider an adequate range of
4 alternatives, and those alternatives that are considered are not fully and fairly analyzed. The Project
5 approvals must therefore be set aside.

6 The FEIR's Discussion of Impacts Is Inadequate

7 57. CEQA mandates that the FEIR adequately analyze a project's effects to foster informed
8 decisionmaking and allow the public to understand those impacts. Pub. Resources Code § 21002.1;
9 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15126, 15126.2. Where possible, the lead agency must employ feasible
10 mitigation measures that could minimize the project's significant adverse impacts. Pub. Resources Code
11 § 21002; Guidelines §§ 15121, 15126.4. As shown below, the FEIR fails to adequately address the
12 Project's impacts. Its failure to provide information in "an analytically complete and coherent
13 Jexplanation" violates CEQA's informational purpose and prevents the public and decisionmakers from
14 fully considering those impacts. Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho

17 Guidelines §§ 15121, 15144.

18 Aesthetics

19 58. The FEIR downplays the impact of the SHW development on the pristine East Meadow
20 |(the Hagar site). While the FEIR admits that impacts are significant and unavoidable, the information
21 /presented is misleading and fails to provide the public and decisionmakers with an accurate
22 understanding of the magnitude and severity of the Project's impacts. For example, the FEIR understates
23 the impact at the Hagar site by claiming that the slope configuration, two-story construction, and use of
24 site-appropriate colors for the buildings would "minimize the obtrusion of the development in the view
25 from this location and the rest of the East Meadow would still be visible." RDEIR 4.1-24 to 4.1-25. But
26 the facts show otherwise. As Figures 4.1-15 through 4.1-20 reveal, the gently sloping and iconically
27 attractive East Meadow is highly visible from many vantage points, and the Project will substantially and
28 permanently mar that view. RDEIR 4.1-55 to 4.1-63; FEIR 4.0-8 to 4.0-11. For these reasons among

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF . 18 -

- lothers, the UCSC Design Advisory Board unanimously voted to oppose developing the meadow.

2 59. Similarly, the FEIR trivializes the impacts from the Heller site development, claiming that
3 the views of the bay would only be partially obstructed and "the stepping of the building heights, the
4 selection of appropriate colors and materials . . . and new landscaping .. would soften the appearance of
5 the new development." RDEIR 4.1-21 to 4.1-22; FEIR 3.0-204. But these claims are demonstrably
6 untrue. The five-to-seven storey buildings proposed for development on the Heller site would obstruct
7 Ithe views and significantly impair the extraordinary natural beauty of the area. RDEIR 4.1-39 to 4.1-42
8 (Figures 4.1-2 to 4.1-5). They would also violate the 2005 LRDP Planning Principles and Guidelines
9 I("LRDP Guidelines"). The LRDP Guidelines require that the University

10 "[i]ntegrate the natural and built environment: New development will respond to the

11 aesthetic qualities of UCSC's unique natural environment through siting, development patterns and architecture that are sensitive to the natural setting. In forested areas,

12 buildings generally should not protrude above the surrounding tree canopy; in visually sensitive areas, interruption of prime viewsheds and viewpoints will be minimized."
13 2005 LRDP 49. The proposed development at the Heller site, by contrast, severely "interrupts" and
14 degrades this visually sensitive area. FEIR 3.0-204 (admitting that "the proposed buildings would
15 obstruct views of the bay" and that the Project "would substantially change the existing view"). The
16 |Heller development deviates dramatically from - rather than adhering - to - the LRDP Guidelines, as
17 shown in the visual simulations. RDEIR 4.1-39 to 4.1-42 (Figures 4.1-2 to 4.1-5).

18 60. The FEIR's attempt to mask the Project's visual impacts is pervasive. It claims that the
19 Project "has been designed to address these recommendations" through clustering of buildings, increased
20 building height to reduce footprint, and use of certain materials and colors, and that the buildings would
21 be "below or close to the tree canopy of the adjoining forest." RDEIR 4.1-30; FEIR 3.0-204 to 3.0-205.
22 But the visual simulations that the FEIR claims demonstrate compliance with these recommendations
23 show the exact opposite: buildings that well exceed the tree canopy and stick out like sore thumbs
24 against the surrounding forested landscape. RDEIR 4.1-40 (Figure 4.1-3), 4.1-42 (Figure 4.1-5); FEIR
25 3.0-205 (admitting that the buildings appear "above the tree line" from certain view points).

26 61. By downplaying these aesthetic impacts, the FEIR misleads the public and
27 decisionmakers, and fails to provide an accurate assessment of the Project's impacts. This violates
28 CEQA. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15144; Berkeley Keep Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1355-1356. Without

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19 -

an accurate assessment of these impacts, it is impossible for the public and decisionmakers to make an
2 informed evaluation of the need for alternatives and mitigation measures to avoid or reduce them.

3 Biological Resources

4 62. The FEIR's analysis of biological impacts is likewise insufficient. It fails to provide the
5 hard data and analysis that the public and decisionmakers need to understand and evaluate the Project's
6 impacts to wildlife and vegetation and thereby make an informed decision, as CEQA requires. As shown
7 below, the University must perform additional studies to identify and evaluate the Project's impacts to
8 biological resources, as the few surveys that were performed are incomplete.

9 63. For example, only three biological surveys were completed for each of the sites. RDEIR
10 4.3-5. And all were performed without regard to the standard protocol of conducting species inventories

11 in every season to assure that all affected species are in fact identified and evaluated. The May 2, 2017,
12 June 24, 2017, and August 17, 2018 surveys at the Heller site were performed only in the spring and
13 summer, and thus were insufficient to determine the environmental setting in the fall and winter. RDEIR
14 4.3-5. Likewise, the October 5, 2017, December 7, 2017, and July 31, 2018 surveys of the Hagar site
15 were performed only in the fall, winter, and summer and thus were insufficient to determine the
16 environmental setting during the spring. RDEIR 4.3-5.

17 64. Without an understanding of all of the species that utilize the Project site - and especially
18 the East Meadow - the public and decisionmakers cannot accurately determine the Project's impacts on
19 biological resources. These deficiencies must be rectified because they preclude informed
20 decisionmaking. As the courts have explained, "[a] clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to
21 no judicial deference," and does not constitute substantial evidence supporting an agency's finding.
22 Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n.12.

23 65. The FEIR also fails to provide sufficient information on the Project's impacts to the
24 California red-legged frog ("CRLF"). CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15144; Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 448-
25 449 (EIRs must examine seasonally-changing impacts on imperiled species); Berkeley Keep Jets, 91
26 Cal.App.4th at 1355-1356. The University recognizes that "[b]ased on the known occurrences of the
27 species in the project vicinity, and the manner in which the species is known to disperse and move
28 |between drainages and breeding sites, the Heller site and off-site improvements are located in an area that

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20 -

could provide suitable upland and dispersal habitat for CRLF," and that the "area surrounding the Heller
2 site has also been mapped as designed critical habitat." RDEIR 4.3-41. It also admits that "construction
3 activities at the Heller site, including the proposed off-site utilities, could directly impact CRLF." RDEIR
4 4.3-42. The CRLF breeding habitat at the arboretum pond - and the pond's feeder stream that CRLF are
5 (known to inhabit - are both just a short stroll away from the Heller site. Yet the FEIR fails to even
6 consider the potentially severe impacts to CRLF from the enormous increase in the number of students
7 who will live at the Heller site.

8 66. The Heller site currently houses 199 two-bedroom townhouses. RDEIR 3.0-2. The
9 Project will increase the number of beds more than threefold - to 2,932. FEIR 2.0-2; RDEIR 3.0-9.
10 Adding more than 2,000 undergraduate residents to this location has the potential to significantly impact
11 CRLF and their habitat. And unlike the construction impacts that the FEIR admits, these operational
12 impacts are permanent. The FEIR's conclusory statement that "CRLF are more likely to disperse through
13 this meadow during the winter months while it is raining and during the night when adult CRLF are more
14 lactive, a at a time when students are less likely to be present" is of little recourse to the CRLF that will be
15 [impacted by those students who are present. FEIR 3.0-206 (internal citations omitted). The University
16 cannot ignore this significant impact simply because the FEIR claims "it could be worse."

17 67. Similarly, the FEIR's analysis of Project impacts to the western burrowing owl is
18 insufficient. RDEIR 4.3-46 to 4.3-47. Again, the FEIR only considers the construction impacts of the
19 Project, ignoring the ongoing operational impacts created by increasing the resident population in the
20 area. Id. And, even the discussion of construction impacts underestimates the severity of the harm that
21 the Project will cause to this important species. The FEIR fails to account for the potential to
22 |permanently remove potential burrow habitat and prey for the western burrowing owls that overwinter
23 there. Id.

24 68. The FEIR's discussion of golden eagles is likewise insufficient. RDEIR 4.3-46. Despite
25 recent golden eagle sightings on the East Meadow, the FEIR erroneously concludes that the Project's
26 impacts will be less than significant. It relies on "LRDP Mitigation BIO-11, which sets forth measures
27 that the Campus requires all projects to implement during construction to avoid impacts to nesting birds,
28 including preconstruction surveys of all potential nesting habitats at and within 200 feet of the project

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21 -

F work areas, and establishment of appropriately sized buffer zones in the event that active nests are
2 observed." FEIR 4.0-13. But this mitigation only applies to birds that nest on the meadow. Eagles, for
3 example, nest in trees, not meadows. LRDP Mitigation BIO-11 is not sufficient to mitigate the impacts to
4 all special status species known to occur and forage in the area, since the mitigation measure only surveys
5 for nesting species. FEIR 4.0-13.

69. Likewise, the FEIR ignores ongoing operational impacts from the increased resident
7 |population on numerous other species, including special status birds, special status bats and the San
8 Francisco dusky-footed woodrat. RDEIR 4.3-46 to 4.3-48. These impacts must be addressed under
9 CEQA. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15144; Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 448-449 (requiring examination of
10 seasonal impacts on imperiled species); Berkeley Keep Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1355-1356.

11 Hydrology and Water Quality

12 70. The FEIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's stormwater runoff impacts. The Hagar
13 site is "currently an undeveloped hillside" but will be developed with 6.32 acres, or 50 percent, of
14 "impervious surfaces on the site after project construction." RDEIR 4.7-34. By covering half of the
15 |Hagar site - on the East Meadow with impervious surfaces, the Project creates a significant impact
16 from the runoff of rainfall that would otherwise percolate into the soil. Yet the RDEIR claims that this
17 impact is less than significant because all new runoff from the site would be directed "into storm drains
18 located in the proposed roadways" and treated to remove pollutants. RDEIR 4.7-33 to 4.7-34.

19 71. But the fact that stormwater would be captured in sewers does not mean there will be no
20 impacts. If there were no impervious surfaces, much - perhaps most - of the rain falling on the site
21 would percolate through the soil and recharge the underlying aquifer. That groundwater, in turn, feeds
22 downgradient waterbodies such as Kalkar Quarry Spring, West Lake Pond Spring, Messiah Lutheran
23 Spring, Bay Street Spring and their associated streams, and Moore and Wilder creeks to the west. And,
24 those water bodies in turn support the plants, birds, fish and other wildlife that inhabit these springs and
25 creeks and their adjacent riparian areas. Thus, the Project's impervious surfaces would remove water that
26 would otherwise recharge the groundwater that supports these downgradient waterbodies and their
27 vegetation and wildlife. The FEIR's claim that there would be no significant hydrologic impact ignores
28 the Project's substantial seasonal impact on water bodies and the plants and animals that inhabit them, in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22 -

1 violation of CEQA. FEIR 3.0-208; Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 448-449.

2 72. The fact that the "complexity of the underlying karst system" may make runoff impacts
3 /difficult to predict" (RDEIR 4.7-39) does not excuse the University from its duty to analyze and mitigate
4 them. CEQA requires the University to "use its best efforts to find out and disclose all that it can"
5 regarding the Project's potentially significant impacts. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121, 15144; Vineyard, 40
6 Cal.4th at 440 (EIRs must provide an "analytically complete and coherent explanation" of impacts);
7 Berkeley Keep Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1355-1356; Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n.12. This is
8 especially true given the propensity for the underlain karst features to "lead to settlement or collapse
9 |beneath the structures." RDEIR 4.5-13. Without sufficient analysis of how the structures themselves, or
10 a collapse underneath those structures, could affect runoff - or how reduced percolation might weaken
11 those structures, causing their collapse - the FEIR violates CEQA. And, as shown above, the FEIR's
12 claim that creating impervious surfaces only poses a stormwater removal problem ignores the vital role
13 that rain water performs in percolating through soil to replenish aquifers. As explained, those aquifers are
14 needed to supply downgradient springs and streams, and to sustain their vegetation and wildlife and
15 recreational uses.

16 Land Use Planning

17 73. The Project conflicts with existing and future land use plans for the area. CEQA requires
18 examination of "any inconsistencies between the proposed project and applicable [land use] plans."
19 CEQA Guidelines § 15125(d). The Project's proposed development is plainly inconsistent with the 2005
20 LRDP.

21 74. As discussed above, the aesthetic impact of the Project would be significant (RDEIR 4.1-
22 20 to 4.1-34) due to development of the East Meadow and the dramatically increased scale and height of
23 development at the Heller site. While the Project proposes an amendment to the LRDP's land use
24 designation to allow development of the Hagar site, nothing in the FEIR explains the inconsistency of this
25 amendment with other planning policies and principles outlined in the 2005 LRDP, as required by CEQA
26 |Guidelines section 15125(d).

27 75. For example, the 2005 LRDP calls for maintenance of the "unique character of the UC
28 Santa Cruz campus," "preserv[ation of] open space," and integration of "the natural and built

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23 -

Ilenvironment." RDEIR 4.8-9. In particular, it directs that "[n]ew development in the lower East Meadow
2 between Hagar Drive and Coolidge Drive will be minimized to maintain the overall sense of an open
3 meadow landscape." 2005 LRDP 74. The Project conflicts with each one of these land use standards and
4 guidelines. The Project proposes to develop the pristine and ecologically significant East Meadow,
5 opening it up for both immediate development and potential future growth. This directly violates the
6 LRDP's mandate that UCSC "preserve open space," and the "overall sense of an open meadow
7 landscape." RDEIR 4.8-9; 2005 LRDP 74. And the massive, five-to-seven storey buildings proposed for
8 the Heller site neither maintain the "unique character" of the UCSC campus, nor "[i]ntegrate the natural
9 and built environment." Id. Yet the FEIR ignores these conflicts, contrary to CEQA Guidelines section
10 15125(d).

11 76. The FEIR claims that the "proposed project would not conflict with the UC Santa Cruz
12 2005 LRDP once amended." RDEIR 4.8-12. It asserts that the Project is consistent because the new
13 |development would "remain almost completely within the boundary of existing development" or "would
14 be clustered adjacent to existing housing." RDEIR 4.8-12. Not so. These claims ignore the fact that the
15 proposed development would significantly degrade the scenic and environmental resources of the
16 campus. Because the FEIR fails to discuss and fully and fairly analyze these impacts, it violates CEQA.

17 77. Moreover, the FEIR's failure to address the foreseeable impacts of further incremental
18 development at the East Meadow in the future violates CEQA's requirement for examination of
19 cumulative impacts, both direct and indirect. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15130, 15355.

20 Noise

21 78. The FEIR's noise analysis entirely fails to consider the impact of housing thousands more
22 students in previously quiet, undeveloped areas of the campus. RDEIR 4.9-10 to 4.9-22. Although the
23 FEIR acknowledges the public's concern about this inadequacy, it never remedies the DEIR's failure to
24 analyze this significant impact. RDEIR 4.9-1 (this "section is substantially the same as the section in the
25 [DEIR]" despite the public's comments), 4.9-10 to 4.9-22. Instead, the FEIR erroneously assumes that
26 sound from normal conversation "would not be audible to off-site receptors." FEIR 3.0-209. But this is
27 Inot normal conversation. This is instead the potential cacophony generated by thousands of students
28 collectively. Further, the FEIR admits that "research has not been completed to confirm the effect" of the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24 -

anticipated increases in noise levels on nearby wildlife. FEIR 3.0-209. But the thousands of additional
2 students will at times create very substantial noise whose potentially significant impacts on wildlife
3 should be examined. Id.

4 Public Services

5 79. The FEIR admits that the Project "could not be served [by the Santa Cruz Fire Department
6 ("SCFD")] at the existing level of service." RDEIR 4.10-13. The SCFD determined that to serve the
7 new development it would need additional staff, and construction of a new engine bay. Id. Yet the FEIR
8 claims this impact is less than significant and that no mitigation is required. RDEIR 4.10-13 to 4.10-14.
9 The FEIR appears to base this erroneous conclusion on the fact that SCFD expansion was considered in
10 the 2005 LRDP. RDEIR 4.10-13. However, there is no evidence that such an expansion would take
11 place but for the Project, which requires it. Therefore, expansion of the SCFD station must be considered
12 in the FEIR as part of the Project itself. CEQA Guidelines § 15130 (requiring discussion of cumulative
13 impacts). Without such an analysis, the public and decisionmakers are left unaware of the costs and
14 impacts of this consequential expansion, and therefore cannot make an informed evaluation of them, let
15 alone of the mitigations or alternatives to the SHW Project that would be needed to avoid or reduce them.
16 The FEIR's admission that numerous updates to the fire station would be necessary merely confirms the
17 Ineed for - rather than excusing the absence of - the analysis required now in the FEIR. FEIR 3.0-80 to
18 3.0-81. Because the Project cannot safely proceed without the updates, they must be analyzed as part of
19 the Project.

20 Utilities and Service Systems

21 The City's Water Supply Is Insufficient

22 80. UCSC "receives potable water for use on the main campus from the City of Santa Cruz
23 /Water Department" (the "SCWD"). RDEIR 4.13-2. The FEIR admits that the Project "would increase
24 the amount of water used" on the campus and therefore could not be served by existing entitlements
25 "under multiple dry year conditions." RDEIR 4.13-21; FEIR 3.0-210 ("there would be a substantial gap
26 |between supply and demand during multiple dry years and .. . the City will need to secure one or more
27 new water sources"). But the SCWD does not have an adequate water supply to meet even current
28 demands. According to the City's UWMP, "the City has had to declare a water shortage in five of the ...

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25 -

P seven years" between 2009 and 2015.10 Indeed, the FEIR concedes in its WSA that SCWD "is facing
2 several obstacles in meeting its present and future water supply needs." RDEIR 7.1-12. It concludes that
3 «a small shortage (1 to 3 percent) can be expected in future normal water years," "annual shortages of 16

4 to 21 percent are predicted" during: single dry year, and shortages over 50 percent will occur after three
5 dry years. RDEIR 7.1-32 to 7.1-33 (Table 7.1-10) (emphasis added). Indeed, the FEIR admits that
6 SCWD cannot provide "an adequate water supply to meet the City and [UCSC's] water demand under
7 normal and single dry years" without engaging in substantial new and as yet unapproved and unfunded
8 "conservation and curtailment" measures. FEIR 3.0-210.

9 81. While the Project proposes a wastewater treatment plant at the Hagar site, which would
10 generate recycled water for toilet flushing and landscaping (RDEIR 4.13-1), the Project's water demands
11 still would be more than SCWD has the ability to supply. RDEIR 7.1-32 to 7.1-33 (Table 7.1-10). The
12 Project, in conjunction with other reasonably foreseeable developments, "would generate increased
13 demand for water during normal and drought years," creating significant and unavoidable water supply
14 impacts. RDEIR 4.13-26, 7.1-27.

15 82. Despite these significant and unavoidable impacts, and the documented lack of available
16 water from SCWD, the FEIR states that the City will be able to serve the Project. RDEIR 7.1-52 to 7.1-
17 53. But given the precarious nature of the water supply, it would be irresponsible for the City to commit
18 to providing water to the Project when it does not even have adequate water supply for its current
19 commitments. And, it is a violation of CEQA for the FEIR to imply that the City can provide this
20 additional water when the undisputed facts show otherwise. Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 438-447. Likewise,
21 contravenes CEQA to insist that impacts may be ignored because student growth is inevitable and will
22 occur whether or not the Project is approved. FEIR 3.0-210. Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 431-432.

23 Increased Water Demand Will Be Detrimental to Special-Status Fish Species

24 83. The rivers that provide most of the City's water supply support populations of Central
25 California Coast ("CCC") Distinct Population Segment steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a threatened
26 species (62 Fed. Reg. 43937 (August 18, 1997)), and CCC Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) coho

salmon (Onorhynchus kisutch), an endangered species. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160 (June 28, 2005); 64 Fed.Reg.
2 24049 (May 5, 1999); RDEIR 7.1-8. The endangered CCC coho relies on the San Lorenzo River
|watershed for recovery. 64 Fed.Reg. 24049; RDEIR 7.1-32. The prospects for recovery of the CCC
4 steelhead and coho are dependent on suitable habitat being restored and maintained. Certain minimum
5 levels of flow and temperature are required in streams for the proper development, growth and spawning
6 of salmonids.

7 84. Currently, in critically dry years, the City does not have enough water to meet the City's
8 existing needs, including the instream needs for fish. RDEIR 7.1-32; FEIR 3.0-211. During these dry
9 years maintenance of instream flow is critically important for the survival of the salmonids, as juveniles
10 are typically unable to rear in small tributaries and need adequate water flow in the main stem of the San
11 Lorenzo River. As climate change continues to increase ambient temperatures, the need for cool water
12 flows will increase, requiring corresponding reductions in water supplies for human uses, further limiting
13 the City's ability to meet its existing, let alone future, water demands. Both the FEIR and the WSA must
14 address this when calculating the City's ability to meet water demand. Friends of the Eel River v.
15 |Sonoma County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 874-875 (EIR must address cumulative
16 impacts of upstream and downstream diversions of water for human uses on salmonid species in the
17 river); Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 448-449 (EIR must examine impact of seasonal reductions in river flow on
18 both salmon and human water supply).

19 85. Furthermore, the FEIR and the WSA fail to analyze the impacts that would occur if the
20 City were forced to pump groundwater to make up for reduced surface water supplies in the future.
21 Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 438-447.

22 Alternative Water Supplies Are Not Sufficient To Meet Water Demand

23 86. The WSA suggests four alternative sources of water, including In Lieu Transfers (Passive
24 Recharge), Aquifer Storage and Recovery (Active Recharge) ("ASR"), the Regional Recycled Water
25 Facilities Project, and the City Seawater Desalination Project. All of these alternative water sources are
26 speculative, their feasibility is still being evaluated, and each has its own constellation of unstudied

27

28

1 environmental impacts that neither the City nor any other agency has yet evaluated under CEQA."
2 RDEIR 7.1-13 to 7.1-14, 7.1-38 to 7.1-39, 7.1-42, 7.1-45; FEIR 4.0-40.

3 87. The City has concluded that "it cannot confidently determine that these [water] source
4 options are 'likely future water sources,' the impacts of which an EIR must analyze 'to the extent
reasonably possible," under Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 434. "However, because these [water sources] are
6 under consideration by the City and none of these options has been determined to be infeasible at this
7 time, all four water supply augmentation options ... are briefly described." RDEIR 7.1-38.

8 88. While the City approved a pilot project for the in lieu transfers and ASR, the larger-scale
9 feasibility of those projects remains uncertain. RDEIR 7.1-39. And as the WSA admits, "[b]ecause no
10 CEQA review has been undertaken and neither project has been developed to a level that its
11 environmental impacts may be ascertained, this [FEIR] cannot reasonably present the environmental
12 impacts of [those projects], although it is acknowledged that such projects would likely result in
13 environmental impacts." RDEIR 7.1-39 to 7.1-40.

14 89. Similarly, the WSA only discusses the impacts of the Regional Recycled Water Facilities
15 Project "generically" because no CEQA review has been completed. RDEIR 7.1-42. The City is also
16 considering a "future 3.3 million gallons per day (mgd) desalination plant." RDEIR 7.1-45. As the WSA
17 admits, "there is substantial uncertainty regarding approval and timing of the desalination water supply
18 loption," and it will present a whole new realm of environmental consequences to Monterey Bay and the
19 adjacent counties and cities. RDEIR 7.1-45 to 7.1-49. Seawater desalination is not only expensive, it
20 also uses massive amounts of energy, contributes to global warming due to its huge energy consumption,
21 and will likely be detrimental to the area's biological resources both through entrainment of tiny marine
22 organisms and nutrients, and the discharge of highly saline effluent. RDEIR 7.1-47 to 7.1-49.

23 90. Since the possibility of developing each of these four alternative water supply options
24 |remains uncertain, SCWD has no certain source of the additional water which it will need to supply the
25 Project. Without an adequate supply of water to meet all of its demands, neither the Regents nor SCWD
26 can proceed with the Project without îurther, detailed environmental analysis of the feasibility and

28 The City prepared a Draft EIR for the desalination plant but it was never certified. RDEIR 7.1- 45 to 7.1-46.

impacts of doing so.

2 The Proposed Mitigation Measures Are Inadequate Under CEQA

91. CEQA directs that "agencies shall not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible
4 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
5 environmental effects of such projects . . . Pub. Resources Code § 21002; CEQA Guidelines §
6 15126.4. Furthermore, "[f]ormulation of mitigation measures should not be deferred until some future
7 time," unless specific performance standards are specified. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).
8 "[MJitigation measure[s] [that do] no more than require a report be prepared and followed" do not
9 provide adequate information for informed decisionmaking under CEQA. Endangered Habitats League,
10 Inc. V. County of Orange ("Endangered Habitats League") (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 794; CEQA
11 Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B). The FEIR does not comply with these CEQA requirements for mitigation

12 measures.

13 92. Many of the mitigation measures proposed are inadequate because they are too vague,
14 incomplete, ineffective or unenforceable. The FEIR relies on numerous mitigation measures from the
15 2005 LRDP that are vague, such as mitigation measures AES-5A and AES-6C, which call for the Design
16 Review Board to "review project designs for consistency with the valued elements of the visual
17 landscape" and "require the incorporation of measures into the project design to limit" light and glare.
18 IRDEIR 4.1-19 to 4.1-20. These measures are too general to be informative or enforceable, and the fact
19 that they are program level mitigation measures does not change the fact that they are too vague to satisfy
20 |CEQA. FEIR 3.0-212 to 3.0-213; Endangered Habitats League, 131 Cal.App.4th at 794.

21 93. Other proposed mitigation measures are ineffective. For example, SHW Mitigation BIO-
22 1B requires the replacement of lost purple needlegrass grassland at a ratio of 1:1. RDEIR 4.3-34. This
23 measure assumes without record support that the loss of grassland habitat can be effectively remedied by
24 providing equivalent or greater overall . cover as .. . [what] will be lost to development," and that if
25 that effort fails, attempts to restore such habitat "on a new, more suitable site" can be made, and
26 successfully. Id. But as with most habitat for imperiled species, it is unlikely that there is a "more
27 suitable site" than the occupied site which is proposed to be destroyed. That, indeed, is usually why these
28 species are endangered in the first place: their habitat has been degraded elsewhere. While the FEIR's

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 29 -

1 required preservation of purple needlegrass grassland within the campus at a higher 3:1 ratio to the
2 acreage removed is an improvement over the RDEIR's proposal, it still begs the question whether there is
3 any suitable alternative habitat left. FEIR 4.0-16. Despite the fact that the University received numerous

4 comments objecting to this flaw in the DEIR, the FEIR fails to identify any "more suitable site" as
5 |necessary to remedy this inadequacy. FEIR 4.0-16 to 4.0-17; RDEIR 4.3-2, 4.3-34.

6 94. Further, many of the mitigation measures are improperly deferred, contrary to CEQA's
7 (mandate that "[fJormulation of mitigation measures shall not be deferred until some future time."

8 Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B). For example, 2005 LRDP Mitigation CULT-5B calls for a paleontologist
9 "to develop a paleontological monitoring and data recovery plan" if necessary (RDEIR 4.4-25), and 2005
10 LRDP Mitigation measure GEO-1 suggests that geotechnical studies should be developed in the future
11 (RDEIR 4.5-11). Neither of these deferred mitigations includes any specific performance standards and
12 therefore, both are inadequate under CEQA. Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B); Endangered Habitats
13 League, 131 Cal.App.4th at 794.

14 95. The mitigation measures identified above, as well as many others, are effectively toothless
15 lbecause they commit the University to do nothing more than conduct more studies, review further designs
16 and implement vague future strategies. These mitigation measures include no specific, effective and
17 mandatory actions to be taken if the studies demonstrate that a significant environmental impact exists.
18 Without mitigation measures that require actual reductions in Project impacts, and measurable
19 achievement of environmental standards, CEQA's mandates are not met and the Project Approvals
20 should be set aside.

21 Supplements to the 2005 LRDP in a Project Level EIR Are Inappropriate Under CEQA
22 96. The University attempts to evade the limitations on development set forth in the 2005
23 LRDP, and the 2008 CSA that resulted from the litigation challenging that plan, by including
24 /"supplements" to the 2005 LRDP EIR. RDEIR 1.0-3 (the 2005 LRDP "supplemental analysis is also
25 included in this [RDEIR]), 2.0-16 to 2.0-17, 7.0-1 to 7.2-42; FEIR 2.0-1, 2.0-16 to 2.0-17, 4.0-40. The
26 University includes EIR supplements to purportedly enable modifications of both the WSA and the
27 /Population and Housing Impact Assessment. RDEIR 7.1-1 to 7.1-55, 7.2-1 to 7.2-42; FEIR 2.0-1, 2.0-16
28 to 2.0-17, 4.0-40. But a supplement to an EIR is inappropriate here. CEQA Guidelines § 15163.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
IICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 30 -

1 Supplements to EIRs are only allowed where there have been changes to the previous (i.e., the LRDP)
2 |project, changes to the circumstances surrounding the previous project, or new information arises, and
3 when those supplements are thus allowed, they must be separately noticed and approved. Id. Purporting

4 to attach these supplements to a different project's EIR creates confusion, ignores cumulative impacts,
5 land violates CEQA's prescribed procedures.

6 97. The FEIR claims that these supplements are included so that "the University can complete
7 a streamlined review of subsequent projects proposed for development under the 2005 LRDP" under the
8 CEQA Program EIR tiering model. RDEIR 1.0-2; CEQA Guidelines § 15168. But this presents
9 numerous problems. First, the FEIR at issue here is a project-level FEIR for the SHW Project, subject to
10 different standards than a Program EIR. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15161, 15168. Second, the CSA states
11 that "for future projects under the 2005 LRDP, UCSC will not 'tier' from or otherwise rely on the water
12 or housing analysis in the [2005] LRDP EIR invalidated by the Santa Cruz Superior Court to obtain
13 CEQA compliance." CSA 20-21. The inclusion of these supplements here is invalid because it violates
14 both the letter and the spirit of CEQA and the CSA.

15 The SHW Project Findings Adopted by the University Are Inadequate
16 98. The Findings adopted by the University to support its decision fail to acknowledge, much
17 less rectify, the significant methodological, analytical and factual errors and omissions in the FEIR. For
18 example, the Findings rely on mitigation measures that will not be effective to reduce the identified
19 impacts to insignificance. The MMRP fails to remedy these deficiencies. The Findings are not supported
20 by the evidence in the record.

21 99. For these reasons, the University failed to proceed in the manner required by law and
22 abused its discretion by adopting the Project and certifying its FEIR.

23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

25 Project Approvals as Contrary to C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)
26 100. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
27 reference.

28 101. The University proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
ICOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 31 -

1 purporting to approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such Approvals violate C.C.P.
2 sections 1085, et seq. in the following respects, among others:

3 a.

4 law;

5 such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by

b.

6 C. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

7 before the University. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

8 102.

10 The University failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated CEQA
9 as alleged hereinabove.

103. The University's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures
11 required by C.C.P. sections 1085, et seq. exceeded its jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of
12 discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

13

14 PRAYER

15 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays for the following relief:

1.

16

17 For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining the University from taking
any action to carry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;
2.

19 For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the University to set aside and vacate the
18 Approvals for the Project, and certification of the FEIR;

3.

20 4. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful;
For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the University to suspend all activity
21 implementing the Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it
22 has taken all actions necessary to bring approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA;
23 5.

24 6. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

25 "/. 26 NE S55 For costs incurred in this action; and
