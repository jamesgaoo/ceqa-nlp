24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. Through this Complaint and Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate

26 (*Petition"), Petitioner acting in the interest of protecting public safety and the environment,
seeks to compel the setting aside of the approvals of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") 27 for Environmental Assessment No. 43201 ("EA 43201"), a zoning change, a tentative tract map
28

1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 a and a plot plan for a development (described as the Los Olivos Project development, "Project")

2 by Newland Homes LLC, on property owned by The Richard Family Trust, Edward A. Richard,
Trustee. Riverside County ("County"). "EA 43201" as described herein, refers to the County's 3 entire environmental review and approval process and documentation for the Project, including
4 the Initial Study and MND,
5 2. Through this Petition, Petitioner asks the Court to issue a writ of mandate setting
6 aside the County's approval of this Project and accompanying MND. Petitioner asks this Court
7 to order the County to comply with: the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code,
8 $§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

9 §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"); Government Code requirements requiring all local

10 agency approvals to be compliant and consistent with the General Plan ("GP") and thus, any

11 decision of the County affecting land use and development, including issuance of a use permit,

12 must be consistent with the General Plan. See Gov't Code §§ 66473.5 and 66474 and Code of
Civ. § Proc. $ 1094.5.
13 3. On June 4th, 2019, Riverside County ("County") approved the MND for the 14 Project consisting of 48 single family homes on 12.5 acres with 3.9 acres preserved as Open
15 Space. Much of the a property lies within a floodplain and subject to flooding. Petitioner has
16 demonstrated that some of the housing units and the onsite detention basin will be within an area
17 subject to flooding. Petitioner also alleged that the EA/IS and MND failed to adequately assess
18 the direct impacts to riparian and upland habitat, flooding and other human health and safety

19 hazards and cumulative impacts.

20 4. Importantly, the County relied on hydrology studies that showed increases in

21 flooding both on-site and downstream (on the adjacent rural residential property), but formatted

22 the findings such that County-required discussion of water level data was omitted from the
technical report and the IS. Thus, the data in the record contradicts the finding in the IS 23 concerning Floodplains; and the County's approval of the MND, based on the claim of no
24 flooding on- or offsite, is not supported by evidence provided to the public.
25 5. The Project is also inconsistent with and violates provisions of the Riverside
26 County General Plan (GP) governing groundwater recharge, floodplain and riparian area
27 management, the project approvals do not ensure that adequate aquifer water recharge areas are

28 preserved and protected and do not discourage development within watercourses and areas

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 within 100 feet of the outside boundary of the riparian vegetation, the top of the bank, or the 100-

2 year floodplain, because this Project will build within the 100-year floodplain, not 100 feet
outside of it.
3 6. The Project is also inconsistent with and violates the GP Circulation element by
4 exceeding the GP traffic model trip generation level required by the State Highway 79 Policy
5 Area (SH-79 PA) of the Southwest Area Plan (SWAP 9.2). Because the project is inconsistent
6 with the General Plan, which allows for individual developments to exceed the cap only if it can
7 be demonstrated that sufficient reductions have occurred on other projects it violates Riverside
8 County Ordinance 348.4896 § 2.2. In this case, the Applicant would need to show an additional

9 available 9 housing units not completed in other projects, which it has been unable to do.

10 7. Despite the evidence of potential significant impacts, the County has improperly

11 chosen to only prepare an Environmental Assessment/Initial Study/Mitigated Negative

12 Declaration ("MND") for the Project instead of more comprehensive Environmental Impact

13 Report (*EIR"), thereby leaving the County and the public without the scientific data and
analysis necessary for a project with such impacts. In light of these and other procedural and 14 substantive violations of CEQA and of Riverside County's Municipal Code and General Plan
15 Policies, Petitioners request this Court vacate and set aside the County's approval of the Zoning
16 Change and related approvals and the approvals of the MND because Respondents failed to
17 comply with CEQA and applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.
18 II. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

28 B. Jurisdiction and Venue

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 15. Petitioner brings this action as Petition for Writ of Mandate and the Court has

2 jurisdiction over the claims alleged herein pursuant to Calif. Code of Civ. Proc. § 1084 et seq.,
and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080.5(g), 21168, and 21168.5. 3 16. Venue is proper in the Southwest District of Riverside County Courts as the
4 action arose in that venue.
5 C. Standing
6 17. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the County's full compliance with the law
7 regarding the County's approval of the project. Petitioner is a resident of the County of
8 Riverside and in the immediate area of the project whose personal and community interests and

9 the persons associated with her, who live in and around the subject area, will be severely injured

10 in the areas of safety and well-being if the Project as approved by the County is allowed to

11 proceed as planned. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in and

12 aggrieved by the County's approval as alleged below. Petitioner has expressed her concerns and

13 objections to the approval of the MND numerous times in numerous fora and hearings before the
Planning Commission and the Board, as well as directly to county staff, in meetings with staff 14 and project proponents, in emails, and by other methods of communication. She has been joined
15 in this effort by other individuals and public agencies. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to
16 comply with the legal duties that Petitioner alleges were violated before approving the Project.
17 Petitioner has the right to enforce the mandatory duties that CEQA and State Planning and
18 Zoning Laws impose on Respondents. Separately, following Petitioner's April 30, 1992 action
19 against the County of Riverside (Superior Court Case No. 218564), Petitioner is entitled to

20 demand that Respondents honor their commitments to Petitioner (recorded by Board Minute

21 Record on June 7, 1994) for complete environmental review (serial EIR, not MND) for those

22 portions of the Clinton Keith Road (*CKR") Extension-Project that are proposed - and presently
include the County likely bulldozing of, and otherwise impacting, the floodplain within the EA 23 43201 Project site.
24 D. Factual and Procedural Background
25 18. On April 26, 2017, Applicant submitted an application for: a change of zoning
26 from Rural Residential to Planned Residential (CZ 7937), for tentative tract map approval (TR
27 37294) for approval of a plot plan for the construction of 48 single family homes (PP 26249),
28 which is considered as development approval under Chapter 17.216 of the Riverside County

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 Municipal Code. The record does not show any other permit project applications. The County

2 initiated a review process it titled EA 43201, which includes the MND. The project location as

3 stated on the Application is within the Santa Margarita River Watershed, within the French
Valley Airport Influence Area of unincorporated Riverside County, west of State Highway 79 at 4 the southwest corner of the planned extension to Clinton Keith Road and Leon Road. The site is
5 also west of Briggs Road and north of Los Alamos Road. The site is approximately 2.5 miles
6 east of Interstate 215 at Clinton Keith Road.

7 19. The majority of the site is undeveloped except for an existing single-family home
8 and barn and the remnants of some other buildings located near Los Alamos Road. In addition,

9 the south/southwestern 4.7-acre portion of the site contains rows of olive trees.

10 20. The site is surrounded by: existing single-family residential development to the

11 north; multiple rural residences mixed with light industrial uses to the west (including e horse

12 arena); undeveloped land to the east; and bordering Los Alamos Road to the south, across from

13 rural residential properties (including Petitioner's). The portion of the Project's footprint that
lies within the floodplain, also lies within the County's Study Area, identified as "Drainage 15" 14 in the CKR Extension environmental documents (EIR, Supplement to the EIR, and Addendum to
15 the Supplement, plus ongoing design and review subject to CEQA, should the County choose to
16 proceed with additional road construction next to the EA 43201 Project site, using an on-site
17 construction easement).

18 21. On 7/26/17 a set of Conditions of Approval were sent from Planning to applicant.
19 22. On 1/19/18, a Drainage Report was prepared by ProActive Engineering

20 Consultants, Tom Braun principle, Applicant's representative.

21 23. On 2/23/18, a Floodplain Study was prepared by JLC Engineering & Consulting,

22 Joe Castaneda principal, Applicant's consultant. This study was incorporated into ProActive
Drainage Report as Appendix E of Drainage Report. 23 24. On 3/5/18, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and California Department of Fish 24 and Wildlife (the "Wildlife Agencies"), in a joint letter, provided their analysis and review of the
25 project, concluding it is not consistent with the County's Multi Species Habitat Conservation
26 Plan ("MSHCP") and that the Project may have significant impacts to biological resources.
27

28

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

25. On 3/23/18, the JLC Floodplain Study was submitted to the Riverside County
Flood Control and Water Conservation District ("RCFCWCD), and deemed "acceptable for 2
project approval".
3 26. On 5/30/18, a second Drainage Report was prepared by ProActive Engineering
4 Consultants. This report was identical to the 1/19/18 Drainage Report, except for the date of the
5 report and the date of expiration of Mr. Braun's state engineer's license, on the document cover.
6 27. On 2/28/19, an Environmental Assessment (EA 43201) was released for public
7 review, and the public comment period commenced to run until 3/19/19.

8 28. Petitioner made her 1st request for documents that same evening.

9 29. Petitioner received EA 43201 on 3/4/19. She requested technical appendices that

10 evening.

11 30. On 3/5/19, Petitioner received from County the January 2018 Drainage Report

12 prepared by ProActive Engineering.
31. On 3/13/19, Petitioner sent a letter of concern regarding Hydrology to County 13 Project Planner Dionne Harris.
14 32. On 3/14/19, Petitioner sent a letter of concern re the project's inconsistency with
15 the Multi Species Habitat Conservation Plan ("MSHCP") and referencing the March 5, 2018,
16 Wildlife Agencies* letter of objection, and attaching same, to Planner Harris.
17 33. On 3/17/19, Petitioner sent a letter to Planner Harris, focusing on her concerns re
18 the Cumulative Impacts of the project.

19 34. On 3/19/19, the noticed 3/20/19 Planning Commission ("*PC"*) hearing was

20 continued to 4/3/19.

21 35. On 3/20/19, Petitioner met with Juan Perez (Director of the Transportation and

22 Land Management Agency) and Russell Williams (County Development Review Manager)

23 regarding her concerns with the Project. Perez suggested meeting with the applicant and the
County arranged a meeting for the following week.
24 36. On 3/27/19, Petitioner met with Applicant's team and County Staff for ~2 hours
25 to discuss her concerns with hydrology, inconsistency with the General Plan and other concerns,
26 as outlined in her earlier letters.

27 37. On 3/28/19, 6 days before the PC hearing, Applicant entered additional hydrology
28 data, in the form of 3 floodplain analysis maps, and responded to Petitioner's comment letters.

7

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 38. On 3/31/19, Petitioner replied to Applicant's response to her earlier comments.
39.
2 On 4/1/19, Applicant's again responded to Petitioner's 3/31/19 letters.
40. At the 4/3/19 PC hearing, Dionne Harris, Project Planner, presented the new 3 floodplain maps, which assumed the Project would be constructed after the proposed (unfunded)
4 adjacent Clinton Keith Road. The maps were presented by staff as evidence that floodwater
5 levels would not rise as a result of the project, despite the fact that the floodwater levels printed
6 on the exhibit showed increased floodwater levels.

7 41. At the conclusion of the 80 minute hearing, the PC voted 5-0 to recommend to the
8 Board that they approve the project.

q 42. On 5/24/19, the Sandez, Villagomez and Zambrana families jointly sent a letter to

10 the Board regarding their concerns that the Project would increase flooding on the Sandez

11 property, located at 34650 Los Alamos Road, (immediately downstream of the Project site).

12 They noted the fact that at least one person is known to have drowned due to

13 flooding downstream of the project floodway, and newspaper articles showing damage in 2019
to a rural property downstream of a County-Approved development.
14 43. On 5/29/19, Petitioner and her attorneys, along with Justin Roberts and
15 archeologist and resident Rita Gentry sent additional letters of objection to the Project to the
16 Board of Supervisors, including information about flooding, historic resources and other
17 concerns. Petitioner explained to the Board in her letter that Riverside County Flood Control and
18 Water Conservation District ("RCFCWCD") sets out clear requirements by which floodplain

19 analysis must be carried out, results analyzed and impacts presented and discussed - and that

20 County staff have failed to provide the Board with such evidence.

21 44. Petitioner's attorneys commented extensively on the shortcomings of the EA/IS

22 and MND in their letter on the Project, including, but not limited to, comments about impacts to

23 the riparian and wildlife corridors from: a) groundwater depletion; b) changes in runoff; c)
possible changes in erosion and settlement; d) lack of CEQA required impact assessment to the 24 riparian area; and e) lack of consideration of cumulative floodplain and runoff impacts from both
25 the Project and Clinton Keith Road.
26 45. On 6/3/19, Petitioner's hydrologist, Kamman Hydrology and Engineering Inc.
27 submitted a letter reviewing the Project's floodplain analysis and the flooding issues. Although
28

8

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 the letter was shown as having been received on that same date, by the Clerk of the Board, it was

2 not transmitted to the Board or considered by Staff.
46. On 6/4/19 at 9:30 am, a Planning package with responses to comments was given 3 to the Board and provided to Petitioner. This package did not include all of the public comment
4 letters, or intact versions of some of the public comment letters, that were submitted to Planning
5 on May 29 for transmittal to the Board.
6 47. During the Board hearing Petitioner testified that she had retained a hydrologist to
7 evaluate the Project's hydrology, that his review confirmed that there were numerous omissions
8 and errors in the technical documents on which the Initial Study was based, and that the Project

9 would raise floodwater levels on the Sandez property by almost one foot, without the Sandez's

10 permission.

11 48. Later that day, after hearing lasting 26 minutes, the Board approved the Project
a on a 5-0 vote.
12
49. The County filed and posted the approved MND with the Riverside County Clerk 13 the same day.
14 50. On 6/10/19, Planner Harris emailed Petitioner the 5/30/18 Drainage Report. This 15 was the first time Petitioner saw the new report. However, it was identical in every way to the
16 January 2018 report save for the date and the date of Engineer Braun's license expiration.
17 51. This action is timely filed within 30 days as required by Pub. Res. Code §
18 21167.5.

19 E. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

20 52. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivisions (b) and

21 (c), Petitioner and other members of the public objected to the approval of the project orally or in

22 writing during the public comment period or prior to the close of the public hearing on the
Project. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition 23 and, to the extent required, has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the
24 determination by the County is final and no further administrative appeal procedures are
25 provided by state or local law. Alternatively, Petitioner was not provided opportunity to raise the
26 grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition prior to the County's decision to approve the
27 Project. Further, Petitioner does not believe she is required to exhaust her administrative
28

9

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 remedies, because to attempt to do so would be futile and Petitioner does not have adequate
administrative remedies.
2
F. Notice Requirements
3 53. In accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, on
4 June 27, 2019, Petitioner served Respondent the County with a Notice of Intent to Sue in an
5 effort to resolve disputes set forth in this Petition, and to provide notice to the County that if the
6 matter could not be resolved, Petitioner would file this action. The County did not respond to this
7 Notice. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Intent to Sue, and Proof of Service thereof, is
8 attached hereto as Exhibit A.

9 54. The Petitioner has elected to have the County prepare the record of proceedings

10 pending an estimate by the County in the above-captioned proceeding or to pursue an alternative

11 method of record preparation pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2).

12 Notification of the Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as Exhibit B.
55. In accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 388, 13 Petitioner is serving a copy of this pleading on the Attorney General's office, as evidenced by the 14 Proof of Service on the Attorney General's office, attached hereto as Exhibit C.
15 G. No Adequate Remedy
16 56. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
17 law, within the meaning of Code of Civ. Proc. § 1086, because Petitioner and other members of

18 the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damage and by Respondent's
19 violations of CEQA. At all times mentioned herein, the County has been able to deny the

20 approval of the MND and approval and operation of the rezoning, tract map approval and plot

21 plan approval at issue. Despite such ability, and despite Petitioner's demand for denial, the

22 County has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to deny the approval and the MND.

23 The County has prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the MND for the Project.
57. If the County is not ordered to withdraw its approvals, or if its decision is not 24 vacated pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(g), and the Real Party in Interest is not enjoined
25 from engaging in cutting trees, clearing land, grading, excavating and constructing facilities, the
26 land, wildlife habitat, and environmental values will suffer irreparable and permanent damage.
27 58. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civ.
28 Proc. § 1021.5 to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

requested in this Petition will confer significant benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring

2 that the County does not approve the MND without complying with CEQA and State Planning

3 and Zoning Law. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an
award of attorney's fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent this timely enforcement action by
4 Petitioner, the MND might otherwise be deemed lawfully approved, despite the County's failure
5 to comply with CEQA and State Planning and Zoning Law.
6 III. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION - VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA
7 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
8 59. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous

q paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

10 60. CEQA requires agencies, including Riverside County ("County"), to conduct

11 adequate environmental review prior to making any formal decision regarding projects subject to

12 the Act. CEQA requires that an MND identify, evaluate and mitigate the possible significant

13 environmental impacts of the proposed project. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21080.
61. CEQA imposes upon the County a clear, present and mandatory duty to approve 14 an MND only if it fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may
15 occur due to implementation of a project and only if all feasible alternatives and mitigation
16 measures have been incorporated to avoid or reduce these impacts.
17 62. If there is substantial evidence in the record that the project may have significant
18 impacts, the lead agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Report. Pub. Res. Code
19 §21080(d), §21080.3, §21082.1, 21100, 21151; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063-15064(f).

20 63. The MND must also provide substantial evidence that all impacts have been

21 mitigated below the level of significance. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21080, CEQA Guidelines

22 §§ 15063, 15064, 15070-15075.

64.
23 The County prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Mitigated
Negative Declaration for the Project without adequate evidence and justification which might 24 authorize the use of an MND instead of an EIR, as is required by CEQA.
25 65. The County's failures to comply with CEQA include, but are not limited to, the
26 following.
27 A. Recirculation of the EA is Required Due to New Information
28

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 66. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous

2 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
67. If subsequent to the commencement of public review and agency consultation but
3 prior to the final MND approval the lead agency adds "significant new information" to an MND
4 or its supporting documents, it must issue new notice and must re-circulate the MND or portions
5 of it, for additional review and comment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(c) (2), 21092.1; CEQA
6 Guidelines §§ 15070(b), 15071(e), 15073.5. This ensures that the public is not deprived of a
7 meaningful opportunity to comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the

8 project.

9 68. The County prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed according to

10 law, in that it failed to re-circulate the MND after new information was added to the supporting

11 documents for the MND. This new information included, but was not limited to: mapping of the

12 existing floodplain; location of proposed housing lots and Project infrastructure within the
existing floodplain; encroachment into the existing floodway; evidence that the Project will 13 increase flooding on- and off-site; location of existing conservation lands near the project site. 14 B. The EA Failed to Properly Disclose and Describe the Project Description
15 69. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
16 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
17 70. Every EA/IS must contain a description of the project's technical, economic, and
18 environmental characteristics (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15070, 15071); it "is an informational

19 document" that must be "prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision makers

20 with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of

21 environmental consequences." CEQA requires the analysis of potential impacts to be

22 "reasonably thorough" and specific at the project level. Accordingly, a project description must
be sufficiently detailed for environmental impact analysis to determine technical compliance 23 with CEQA. CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063, 15071. The Initial Study must provide sufficient 24 information for decision makers to conclude that an MND will suffice. In this case, the Initial
25 Study is deficient in that the EA does not consider all Project components which could cause
26 direct and indirect impacts, including encroachment into the floodplain, alteration of the
27 floodway, erosion/sedimentation, stream setbacks, or diversion of water that may result in
28 reduced groundwater recharge.

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 C. The County Failed to Adequately Disclose and Describe Existing Conditions
71.
2 Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
3 72. CEQA requires that an environmental review document include a description of 4 the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project in order to assist in the
5 determination as to whether an impact is significant. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063, 15071(b).
6 This description must be sufficiently comprehensive to allow the project's impacts to be
7 considered. Courts have held that generalized references are not sufficient and that the
8 description must be of specific location and extent of riparian habitat on or near the project

9 property. San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.

10 App. 4th 713. CEQA also requires that an agency correctly identify the existing conditions as

11 the baseline for the project against which the project's environmental impacts are measured.

12 Further, CEQA requires that Project documents be "written in a manner that will be meaningful
and useful to decision makers and to the public", and that "non-compliance with the information 13 disclosure provisions of this division which precludes relevant information from being presented 14 to the public agency, or non-compliance with substantive requirements of this division, may
15 constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion." PRC §§ 21003(b), 21005(a).
16 73. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND approval
17 with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its failure to, among
18 other things, approve an MND for which existing conditions and baseline information was

19 incomplete and incorrect and insufficient to evaluate significant environmental effects, as

20 follows:

21 74. No complete floodplain study was provided for public review and consideration

22 by the Board. Entire sections and critical information required by RCFCWCD were omitted in

23 the package presented to the PC and Board - including a map of the existing floodplain on the
Project site, and the key results, justifications, analysis and discussion necessary to determine 24 impacts on-site and south of the Project.
25 75. The IS/MND inaccurately states the size of the watershed that delivers stormwater
26 to the Project from the west: the western watershed is more than 30% larger than that identified
27 by Applicant and accepted by the Board. The County's acceptance of Applicant's watershed
28 was made in the face of a County-Permitted grading/drainage project ignored by Applicant, and

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 a County-maintained drainage culvert under Los Alamos Road, that combine to direct

2 stormwater from several acres to the western boundary of the Project. Furthermore, the Project
will deliver this stormwater, which presently largely percolates into the soil on the project site's 3 olive grove and vacant land, by pipe directly into the creek on the eastern side of the project,
4 thereby increasing streamflow at Los Alamos Road and the residential property south of the
5 Project; this existing condition and project component is simply ignored.
6 76. EA 43201/MND failed to include sufficient information regarding approximately
7 .56 acres (452 linear feet) of ephemeral watercourse and associated riparian habitat in the Project
8 area that is regulated under Section 1602 of the Fish and Game Code and approximately .56 acre

9 of "waters of the U.S." that is under the jurisdiction of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA).

10 Despite identifying this area as containing riparian habitat, EA 43201 contains no specific

11 description of this riparian area (*Riparian Area"), thereby making it impossible to determine

12 Project impacts that may adversely affect the riparian area. This information is also necessary to

13 determine consistency of the Project with the GP Open Space policies as set out supra Section
IV(a). EA 43201, contains no description of the riparian area and instead repeatedly refers to it
14 simply as a "drainage." As such, the MND cannot identify adequate mitigation measures which
15 would allow the County to satisfy CEQA with an MND. (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(c)(2);
16 Guidelines § 15070(b)).
17 D. The County Failed to Adequately Assess Environmental Impacts and
18 Identify Feasible Mitigation Measures

19 77. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous

20 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

21 78. CEQA requires that an MND identify, evaluate and mitigate the possible

22 significant environmental impacts of the proposed project. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21080,
CEQA Guidelines §§ 15063-15064, 15071. The lead agency is required to conduct a "thorough 23 investigation" with respect to significant impacts, and its conclusion must be based on substantial
24 evidence. See Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21082.2; CEQA Guidelines § 15064(a).
25 79. CEQA requires that direct and indirect impacts of the project be considered.
26 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15064(d)(1), 15358(a). CEQA requires that the agency must consider all
27 information in the record in determining whether to prepare an EIR and not just information in
28 the IS. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(c), 21082.2.

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 80. The EA's conclusion of no impacts on hydrological and biological resources

2 relies on County's failure to consider evidence in the record. These failures include, but are not

3 limited to, Project impacts on flooding, groundwater and water supply; riparian and upland

4 habitat; watercourses; wildlife corridors; and water quality, including from erosion and

5 sedimentation; as more fully described in Petitioner's comment letters to the County regarding
6 the Project. Measures to adequately mitigate impacts such as increased flooding and conflicts

7 with the County's Reserve Assembly goals for the MSHCP, were simply ignored despite the
8 obvious alternative or mitigation measure of not building in the floodplain (i.e. complying with

q the GP open space policies and SWAP 9.2-mandated housing density reduction policies). In the

10 absence of adequate mitigation measures, the County cannot satisfy CEQA with a mitigated

11 negative declaration. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(c)(2); CEQA Guidelines §15070(b). Petitioner

12 also alleges that the EA/IS and MND failed to adequately assess the direct and cumulative

13 impacts to riparian and upland habitat, wildlife corridors, flooding and other human health and
14 safety hazards.

15
81. 16 The MND lacks essential data regarding flooding and sediment deposition in the

17 water-course/riparian area and did not evaluate reasonably foreseeable impacts to water quality
and resources due to the Project's enormous grading and filling of the floodplain and reduction 18 of impermeable surfaces. The MND failed to adequately assess 1) storm water's movement
19 across both sides of the property, and any impacts on nearby properties and watercourses, 2) any
20 increase in erosion and runoff from paving of impermeable surfaces, 3) the Project's direct and
21 cumulative impacts to groundwater depletion due to placement of impermeable surfaces, and 4)

22 cumulative impacts to flooding and riparian habitat due to the combination of the Project and the

23 future, planned Clinton Keith Road.

24 82. EA 43201/MND and the record lack essential data necessary to form scientific

25 opinions regarding the full floodplain and extent of flooding and did not evaluate potential direct

26 or indirect threats to life and property, or impacts on water resources due to debris flow and
surface runoff. The County, by failing to hold applicant to the County's own requirements for 27

28

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 floodplain analysis, made both identification of impacts and determination of appropriate and

2 feasible mitigation measures impossible.
83. Instead, the EA/IS/MND claims that unidentified Best Management Practices 3 (BMPs) and a future Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) will mitigate any potential
4 impacts from this Project. Yet the EA provides absolutely no support for that conclusion.
5 Instead, the EA simply asserts that because the Project will avoid the drainage there will be no
6 impacts on the riparian wetland area.

7 E. The MND Fails to Determine Consistency with Local Plans.
8 84. CEQA requires that cities and counties must consider whether the Project would:

9 "conflict with any applicable land use plan, policy, or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction

10 over a project (including, but not limited to the general plan, specific plan, local coastal program,

11 or zoning ordinance) adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an environmental effect."

12 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125(d), California Code of Regulation, Title 14, Chapter 3, Appendix G,

13 §X, Land Use and Planning; California Native Plant Society v. City of Rancho Cordova (2009)
172 Cal.App.4th 603, 635.)
14 85. Riverside County Ordinance No. 348.4896 (effective 1/10/19) Section 2.2.
15 General Plan Consistency states that "No discretionary permit shall be approved pursuant to this
16 ordinance unless it is determined that the permit is consistent with the General Plan."
17 86. The County has not provided any evidence that the Project is Consistent with and
18 does not conflict with Multipurpose Open Space (OS) Provisions of the Riverside County

19 General Plan (GP) governing Groundwater Recharge, Floodplain and Riparian Area

20 Management, and Wetlands (GP, December 8, 2015, Chapter 5, pages OS-12 thru OS-16,

21 Policies OS 4.3, 4.6, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.2). This allegation incorporates by reference the

22 allegations infra, Section IV. Second Cause of Action (Violations of State Planning and Zoning
Law).
23 F. The County Failed to Adequately Assess Cumulative Impacts 24 87. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
25 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
26 88. CEQA requires that an MND analyze of the Project's cumulative impacts. Pub.
27 Res. Code §§ 21080.5(d)(3)(A), 21083(b)(2); see CEQA Guidelines §§ 15065(a)(1),
28 15063(a)(1); Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson (EPIC) (1985) 170

2 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376; Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124
CA 4th 1184.
3 89. Cumulative impacts are the incremental effects from multiple projects that 4 combine to affect the environment. "The cumulative impacts from several projects is the change
5 in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other
6 closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects." CEQA
7 Guidelines § 15355(b). Cumulative impacts are "two or more individual effects which, when
8 considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental

9 impacts ...[they] can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking

10 place over a period of time." CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b); accord EPIC, supra, 170 Cal. App.

11 3d at p. 625. Such incremental effects must be analyzed whether they fall on-site or off-site.

12 E.g., Friends of the Old Trees V. Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (1997) 52 Cal. App.
4th 1383, 1396.
13 90. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, due to failure to accurately and 14 adequately assess the combined impacts of the Project along with the future impacts from the
15 Clinton Keith Road extension project on the existing floodplain occupying the eastern portion of
16 the Project site. These include cumulative impacts on flooding and biological resources,
17 including impacts to riparian and upland habitat.
18 91. The MND failed to provide evidence to the record regarding such future projects
19 meaning the MND has no support for its conclusions regarding cumulative impacts to biological

20 resources and Project impacts exacerbating existing flooding hazards. The MND discloses that

21 the Clinton Keith Road extension Project is anticipated to impact the "drainage feature," that is

22 the stream on the Project site. (MND, EA p. 46). Yet the MND does not address the combined

23 cumulative impacts on flooding and groundwater depletion of other residential development, the
Project and the future Clinton Keith Road. The County has repeatedly relied on the Applicant's 24 contentions that the Project will have no flooding impacts. It has not provided such evidence to
25 the record because it has not provided the supposed drainage plan to the public or placed it in the
26 public record. Thus, the MND has no support for its conclusions, and fails to adequately
27 consider the direct and cumulative impacts of the Project on exacerbating existing flooding
28 hazards.

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

1 92. The County prejudicially abused its discretion, did not support its MND approval

2 with substantial evidence, and failed to proceed according to the law in its failure to provide the

3 necessary analysis and evidence demonstrating that mitigation had reduced the direct and
cumulative Project impacts below the level of significance. Thus, the County has not provided
4 evidence that an EIR is not required.
5 G. The County Improperly Deferred Impact Assessment and Mitigation
6 93. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous
7 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
8 94. CEQA requires that all foreseeable environmental impacts be assessed and that

9 feasible mitigation measures be considered before the agency makes its decision to approve a

10 project. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1. Specifically, where mitigation measures are

11 necessary to reduce impacts below the level of significance, members of the public and other

12 agencies must be given an opportunity to review environmental document before the document

13 and project are approved. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(c)(2). Studies and mitigation measures that
are deferred until after the environmental document is approved violate CEQA's requirements
14 for public and agency review and scrutiny of the environmental impacts. Sundstrom v. County of
15 Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3rd 296.
16 95. MND Mitigation Measures rely on future plans that have not been evaluated as to
17 their feasibility as mitigation for the potential impacts regarding flooding hazards, water quality
18 and biological resources, including exposure to risks to life and property and indirectly to
19 biological and water resources from debris flow and surface runoff, including the lower,

20 neighboring parcel. The MND lacks evidence to conclude that there will be no significant

21 impacts to the stream due to potential groundwater depletion and justifies its conclusion on

22 unidentified and deferred mitigation. Such measures violate CEQA when their efficacy is not

23 apparent and there is no evidence in the records showing that the measures will be effective. The

24 MND fails to provide substantial evidence in the record to support it conclusions that the
unidentified BMPs and SWPPP measures will be effective and enforceable. Petitioner also
25 alleges that the EA/IS and MND failed to adequately assess the cumulative impacts to riparian
26 and upland habitat, flooding and other human health and safety hazards, including but not limited
27 to the combined cumulative impacts from the Project and the proposed Clinton Keith Road.
28

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

96. 1 The County improperly deferred data gathering and mitigation measure

2 identification for flooding and groundwater impacts because it did not provide the public with
this information before Project approval. The County failed to provide the following evidence 3 required for such deferral: 1) circumstances precluding studies and the adoption of mitigation
4 measures prior to approval; 2) "performance standards" for measuring mitigation success; and 3)
5 an objective, detailed management plan with mitigation measures.
6 97. In light of the foregoing violations of CEQA, the County prejudicially abused its
7 discretion.

8 IV. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)

10 98. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

11 above.

99.
12 Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of a city to adopt a
general plan for the physical development of the city. The general plan is often called a 13 "constitution" for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform.
14 100. Accordingly, any decision of the County affecting land use and development,
15 including issuance of a use permit, must be consistent with the general plan. See Gov't Code §§
16 66473.5 and 66474; Neighborhood Action Group V. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d
17 1176, 1182; Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court of Orange County, 2
18 Cal. 5th 141, 153 (2016). The Project is inconsistent with the Riverside County General Plan

19 because the County failed to impose conditions to ensure that the Project is consistent with the

20 General Plan. Gov't Code §§ 66411, 66418-66419.

21 101. Riverside County Ordinance No. 348.4896 (Effective 1/10/19) Section 2.2.

22 General Plan Consistency states that "No discretionary permit shall be approved pursuant to this
ordinance unless it is determined that the permit is consistent with the General Plan." 23 A. Violations of Opens Space Provisions of the County General Plan 24 102. The Project is Inconsistent with and violates the Multipurpose Open Space (OS)
25 Provisions of the Riverside County General Plan (GP) governing Groundwater Recharge,
26 Floodplain and Riparian Area Management, and Wetlands (GP. December 8, 2015, Chapter 5,
27 pages OS-12 thru OS-16, Policies OS 4.3, 4.6, 4.9, 5.1, 5.3 and 6.2).
28

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

103. 1 OS 4.3 requires that the County: "Ensure that adequate aquifer water recharge

2 areas are preserved and protected." The existing 2 acre floodplain on the project site is an aquifer
water recharge area that merits preservation and protection. There is no evidence that the County 3 has addressed or complied with this Policy.
4 104. OS 4.9 requires that the County: "Discourage development within watercourses
5 and areas within 100 feet of the outside boundary of the riparian vegetation, the top of the bank,
6 or the 100-year floodplain, whichever is greater." This Project will build within the 100-year
7 floodplain, not 100 feet outside of it. The County has provided no evidence that it has
8 discouraged such development and has not provided any rationale or evidence why this Project
9 approval is compliant with OS 4.9. Thus, the Project approval violates OS 4.9.

10 105. OS 5.1 requires that the County: "Substantially alter floodways or implement

11 other channelization only as a "last resort." and limit the alteration to: a. that necessary for the

12 protection of public health and safety only after all other options are exhausted; b. essential

13 public service projects where no other feasible construction method or alternative project
location exists; or c. projects where the primary function is improvement of fish and wildlife 14 habitat. "
15 106. The General Plan further requires that: "The floodway is the channel of a river or
16 other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the 100-
17 year flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot"
18 (page OS-14). This Project will increase water surface elevations by more than one foot at

19 multiple points along the watercourse, demonstrating that the project construction footprint

20 encroaches into the floodway and will alter the existing floodway. Because this Project meets

21 none of the requirements that would permit alteration of the existing it floodway, it violates OS
5.1.
22
107.
23 OS 5.3 requires that: "Based on site specific study, all development shall be set
back from the floodway boundary a distance adequate to address the following issues: a. public 24 safety; b. erosion; C. riparian wetland buffer: d. wildlife movement corridor or linkage; e. slopes;
25 f. type of watercourse." The County, though, has failed to identify the boundary of the existing
26 floodway on the Project site. Absent this critical information and given that Applicant proposes
27 to build right up against the wetland/riparian area of the watercourse and to encroach into the
28 existing floodway, the County has violated OS 5.3.

20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

108. OS 6.2 requires the County to preserve buffer zones around wetlands where

2 feasible and biologically appropriate. The preservation of existing buffer zones around the
wetland/riparian area is both feasible and appropriate but has not been provided. Rather, the 3 Project proposes to build immediately adjacent to areas identified in the EA as riparian and
4 wetland, yet the County has not required the applicant to establish any buffer as required by OS
5 6.2, and thus the County has violated OS 6.2.
6 B. Violations of General Plan/ Southwest Area Plan Circulation Policies
7 109. The Project is inconsistent with and violates Policy 9.2 of the State Highway 79
8 Policy Area of the Southwest Area Plan (SWAP) of the Riverside County General Plan. Policy

9 9.2 governs transportation infrastructure capacity and trip generation. SWAP Policy 9.2 requires

10 the County to ensure that Highway 79 Policy Area development projects produce traffic

11 generation at a level that is 9% less than the trips projected from the General Plan traffic model

12 residential land use designations. Projects can only exceed the General Plan traffic model trip
generation level, provided it can be demonstrated that sufficient reductions have occurred on
13 other projects in order to meet Level of Service standards. The County admits that the Project
14 will exceed the limits set out in Policy 9.2.
15 110. The County Planning Commission Staff Report claimed that eleven excess
16 capacity housing units were available in the State Highway 79 Policy Area to offset the Project's
17 increase in trip generation. Subsequently, Staff's "Submission to the Board" revised the number
18 of available units to nine. However, the conclusions that such units are available, and that

19 Policy 9.2 has been complied with, have no support in the record. Instead, the only evidence in

20 the record is Petitioner's submissions to the County showing that the pool of excess capacity

21 housing units is exhausted, and no such excess units are available for this Project. Therefore,

22 County contentions that the Project is consistent with Policy 9.2 are not supported by substantial
evidence and are contradicted by the record. 23 V. CONCLUSION
24 111. By reason of the foregoing, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion, and
25 has have violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Code of Civ. Proc. §81085 and
26 1094.5 and State Planning and Zoning Law, by approving a Mitigated Negative Declaration for
27 EA 43201 and associated Project approvals. Accordingly, approval of the Project and adoption
28 of the MND must be set aside.

Dear Mr. Johnson, Ms. Harper-lhem, Members of the Board of Supervisors, Dionne Harris, Planner.

This is to advise you that this office has been retained to and will file an action against Riverside County on behalf of Cecelia Webster for your approval of the above referenced Riverside County Environmental Assessment 43201 and Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Newland Homes Los Olivos Development approved on June 4, 2019. The action shall be filed on or about July 3, 2019. This notice is sent to you pursuant to Public Resources Code 21167.5.

Riverside County's approval of change of zoning from Rural Residential to Planned Residential (CZ 7934), tentative tract map approval (TR 37294) construction homes (PP 26249), and approval of the MND of 48 single family
might authorize the without adequate evidence and justification which use of an MND instead of an EIR is violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA*); and CEQA Guidelines,
