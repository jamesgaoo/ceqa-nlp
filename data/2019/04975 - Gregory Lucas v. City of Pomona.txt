PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

2 11. On October 9, 2019, at public hearing, the Planning Commission of the City of

3 Pomona considered a recommendation to City Council to approve the Ordinance. The Planning

4 Commission by a vote of two in favor and five opposed (2-5) could not reach a consensus and
5 did not recommend approval of the ordinance

12.

approve Ordinance No. 4273 on a 7-0-0 6 On November 4, 2019, the City Council introduced the Ordinance for first
7 reading, held a duly noticed public hearing, and voted to
8 vote, which included an amendment to add an additional 600-foot buffer from City of Pomona
9 boundaries. On November 18, 2019, the City Council conducted a second reading of the
10 Ordinance and voted to approve the Ordinance. The City also concluded that the Ordinance was
11 exempt from CEQA. The City adopted a Finding of Consistency which asserted that the Project ® d11 'dnoJs Me'l jauueuo +IZ06 eunS "PAE EJJUSIIM €8E8 12 met the requirements for CEQA Guidelines Section 15183 and concluded that no additional
13 § environmental review or documentation was required.
'SIIIH Áueneg 14 13. On or about November 19, 2019, a Notice of Exemption ("NOE*) was filed with
15 the County Recorder for the Project.
16 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

17 14. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
19 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 18

20 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
21 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
22 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
23 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
24 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
25 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
26 15. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
27

4 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to

2 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,

4 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to

5 approving any discretionary project that may have a significant a adverse effect on the

6 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially
7 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to

8 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures
9 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in
10 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make
11
8 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those
Channel Law d11 'dnoJ5 -LZ06 12 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.
13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 8
é 14 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption)
Kuereg 15 16. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
16 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
17 17. The City improperly concluded that the Project qualified for a categorical
18 exemption under Section §15183(a) (Projects Consistent with a Community Plan or Zoning) of
19 CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15183, Subd. (a)).
20 18. The City relied on a Findings of Consistency Report prepared by an outside
21 consultant which observed:
22 Forecasted development under the General Plan would generate temporary
23 construction and long- term operational air pollutant emissions (e.g., vehicle trips
24 and stationary sources), including potential increases in carbon monoxide (CO)
25 concentrations and odors. The 2014 Final EIR concluded that adherence to

26 applicable General Plan goals and policies and SCAQMD regulations would
27

28 5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

reduce potential air pollutant emissions on a site-specific basis to a less than
w n significant level. Furthermore, the 2014 Final EIR determined that future
development associated with the General Plan would not result in traffic
congestion at intersections that would cause an exceedance of CO standards or
create objectionable odors that would affect a substantial number of people.
19. The Findings of Consistency Report concluded:

The purpose of the Cannabis Overlay is to establish locations in the City that

8 permit land uses related to commercial cannabis, which would remain subject to
development standards set forth in the existing base zoning district or base
10 Specific Plan to which the Overlay would be added. Implementation of the
11 Cannabis Overlay would not allow development of greater intensity than is d17 'dnoJs MET |euueyo -1706 12 allowed under the General Plan and, as such, would not result in air pollutant
13 8 09Z OUNS PALS EJJUSI!M E8E8 emissions or CO concentrations beyond those associated with the growth forecast
Beverly Hills, 14 under the General Plan.

15 20. However, at the time the 2014 EIR was prepared, the City did not allow
16 commercial cannabis activities.

17 21. Pomona is one of the few jurisdictions in the area that allows the sale of
18 commercial cannabis. Thus the establishment of a limited number of locales in which
19| commercial cannabis may be purchased will result in traffic and related air quality impacts that
20 were not, and could not have been, analyzed in the 2014 EIR. Increased traffic from residents of
illegal in their 21 many surrounding communities who will come to Pomona because cannabis is
22 communities is a specific impact that was not analyzed in the 2014 EIR. The unique draw of the
23 newly permitted use is not similar to the impacts of the typical development contemplated by the
24 2014 EIR because residents of neighboring areas already have local access to such commercial
25 outlets as Starbucks, a thrift shop or an auto repair shops in their communities, but they do not
26 have cannabis shops.
27

28 6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22. The Discussion of Greenhouse gases in the 2014 EIR and the Finding of

2 Consistency Report fails to consider the localized impacts of project-specific traffic. The fact
that "the General Plan would encourage compact development; promote the establishment and
4 practice of alternative transit, such as walking and biking, as a mode of transportation; increase 3

per capita use of renewable energy resources; and reduce per capita energy consumption, which would be

6 consistent with the goals of SB 375 and would contribute to long term reductions in
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions" and that the "the increase in per capita GHG emissions under
8 the General Plan would be less than significant" does not support the conclusion that there would
9 be no significant project specific or site-specific greenhouse gas-related impacts.
10 23. The Findings of Consistency Report also failed to take into account the fact that
11 there will be significant project-specific and site-specific noise impacts due to the fact that indoor ® d11 'dnoug MET |ouueyO 12 cultivation, in which no natural light is used, will require installation of back-up generators
uses studied in the 2014 EIR. LLZ06
8 eHNS "pALa eJJySIM E888 13 which will produce significantly greater noise than the
14 24. The Findings of Consistency Report failed to consider that notwithstanding the SIl!H Áuereg 15 analyses of electricity and water use impacts of development in the 2014 EIR, cannabis
16 production creates impacts in terms of electricity and water demand and water pollution that is of
17 a completely different scale from other commercial uses allowed in the same areas under the
18 2014 General Plan and analyzed in the 2014 EIR.
19 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING

20 25. On December 23, 2019, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its
21 counsel, served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a
22 proceeding against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy
of the letter providing such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated
