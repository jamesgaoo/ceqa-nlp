VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE! (*Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition
2 for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive Relief ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the determinations by Respondent City of Los Angeles

5 ("City" or "Respondent") that the "Permanent Supporting Housing Ordinance" ("PSHQ") and
the "Interim Motel Conversion Ordinance" ("IMCQ") are statutorily exempt from the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The two land use ordinances (Ordinance No. 185492 and

8 Ordinance No. 185489) were both adopted by the Los Angeles City Council on April 11, 2018 to
provide the City and real estate developers with streamlined approval methods; environmental
10 review exemptions; and other land use concessions (the "Project").
11 2. Petitioner timely challenged the environmental reviews conducted by the City for 2 Channel Law 'dnous d11 -1706 12 the Project in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Petitioner alleged that the Project was not
13
8 euns "paig eujys!!m €ses subjected to adequate environmental review under CEQA. The City had certified a Mitigated
'SIl!H Auenea 14 Negative Declaration ("MND") for the PSHO, a Negative Declaration (*MND") for the IMCO,
15 and an addendum to the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report (*PEIR") prepared for the
16 Regional Transportation Plan (the "Environmental Review Documents.") While that legal action
17 was pending, the City lobbied the legislature in an effort to obtain a retroactive statutorily
18 exemption from CEQA for the two ordinances. That effort was successful, and the legislature
19 passed AB 1197 which was signed by the Governor and became effective on September 26,
20 2019. However, as explained below, AB 1997 as applied to Petitioner is unconstitutional and
21 therefore the City cannot deem the Project exempt from CEQA.
22 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
23 exemption determinations related to the Project. The City filed Notice of Exemptions with the
24 Los Angeles County Recorder on September 27, 2019. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate
25 the Project because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
26 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
27

2 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner
2 required by law.
3 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil

4 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
5 Approvals and the exemption determinations for the Project because Respondent failed to
6 comply with CEQA and applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.
PARTIES 7

8 5. Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE!, formerly known as Venice Vision, is an
organization dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment in Los
10 Angeles and the Venice area. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial a
11 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental 8 Channel Law 'dnoug d17 LLZ06 12 protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
13 8 byns "pala eulys|!M €:eg to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims
SIl!H Beverly 14 raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests
15 are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
16 6. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is charter city incorporated under the laws of
17 the State of California. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.
18 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
19 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
20 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
21 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
22 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
23 alleged in this Petition.

The City described the IMCO as follows: "An ordinance amending Sections

17 the use of existing hotels and motels for Supportive Housing or Transitional Housing for persons

21 PROJECT BACKGROUND. ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The City released the ND for the IMCO on November 30, 2017. The City also
23 released the MND for the PSHO on November 30, 2017. The City received numerous written 22 13.

24 comments on both the ND and MND.

25 14. On December 14, 2017 the City Planning Commission held a hearing regarding
26 the Project. On or about February 13, 2018 the City Council Planning and Land Use

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Management Committee held public hearings to consider the Project. On or about April 11, 2018
2 the full City Council held public hearings to consider the Project. The City Council certified the
3 MND, ND and Addendum and approved the Project.

15. On or about April 11, 2018, the City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD")

5 with the County Recorder. On or about May 11, 2018, Petition filed an action in Los Angeles
6 Superior Court challenging the environmental clearances adopted for the Project. That action is
7 titled Fight Back, Venice! v. City of Los Angeles (Case No. BS173566). Among other things,
8 Petitioner has alleged that the City: (a) Failed to prepare a full EIR when one was required by

9 law, (b) Improperly analyzed the Project as two separate actions when they were legally one
10  project under CEQA, and (c) Illegally precommitted the city to known future projects without
11 adequate analysis of those future projects. Petitioner has further alleged that the City certified 8 d11 'dnoJg MET |BuueYO LLZ06 A0 V I NE HMASIMN GES CO SILH Áueneg 12 Environmental Review Documents which: (1) Were legally inadequate in their description of the
13 Project and their analysis of its environmental impacts, (2) Were improperly piecemealed from
14 each other and environmental review of other projects, (3) Were improperly circulated and not
15 subjected to required public review, (4) Illegally failed to disclose the creation of a new local
16 CEQA exemption, (5) Inadequately addressed the environmental consequences of, possible
17 mitigation measures for, and potential alternatives to the Project, and (6) Did not adequately
18 address issues raised by public comments.
19 16. Assembly Bill 1197 became effective September 26, 2019. The legislation
20 provides for statutory exemption from CEQA for Ordinance Nos. 185492 and 185489. The
21 City filed two Notices of Exemption with the Los Angeles County Recorder asserting usage of
22 the new exemption on September 27, 2019.
23 17. In bringing this challenge to the statutory exemption determination, Petitioner is
24 excused from any defense that may be raised by the City pursuant to Pub. Res. Code $ 21177
25 (exhaustion of administrative remedies). Pub. Res. Code § 21177(e) specifically states the
26 following: "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this
27

2 raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project, or if the public 1 division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to

3 agency failed to give the notice required by law." The Supreme Court has confirmed that public
4 agencies such as the City must provide "notice of the ground for exemption determination"

5 before the exhaustion of administrative-remedies requirements will apply. Tomlinson v. County
6 of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 281, 286. The City did not conduct any public hearings or provide
7 other opportunities for members of the public to raise objections to the usage of the statutory
8

9 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS exemption in question.

10 In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental 18.

d11 'dnoJg Mel (auueys LLZ06 0gL e}NS "PAE EUJJYSI!M E888 12 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 11

8 13 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
SIl!H AUBAeg 14 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
15 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
16 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
17 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
18 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
19 19. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
20 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. Mitigated negative declarations are
21 prepared when a project applicant revises project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
22 by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
23 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
25 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a 24

26 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible

6 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
2 declaration. An agency adopting a mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
3 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative
4 declaration.

5 20. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency

6 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
7 result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an
8 environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the
9 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
10 | provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
11 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to d11 Channel Law Group, LLZ06 SL 0 VPE  IP A ES OO 'SIIH Áuoneg 12 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible
13 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead
14 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration.
15 21. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a
16 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
17 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
18 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
19 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
20 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
21 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
22 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
23 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
24 Iunavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
25 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (The Project is Not Statutorily Exempt from CEQA Because AB 1197 is Unconstitutional)
3 22. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
5 23. Whether or not a statute may be retroactively applied consistent with the
6 constitutional principles of equal protection and due process requires a meaningful analysis by a
7 court of competent jurisdiction. As stated by the California Supreme Court, "Legislative intent,
8 however, is only one prerequisite to retroactive application of a statute. Having identified such
intent, it remains for us to determine whether retroactivity is barred by constitutional
10 constraints. We have long held that the retrospective application of a statute may be
11
8 unconstitutional if it is an ex post facto law, if it deprives a person of a vested right without due MET |3uueYO Group, d77 -1706 12 process of law, or if it impairs the obligation of a contract." In re Marriage of Buol (1985) 39
13
8 BynS "PAa BUJySI!M €8€8 Cal.3d 751, 756.

SIl!H Auereg 14 24. Assembly Bill 1197 is unconstitutional as applied to Petitioner and therefore the
15 City's determination that the Project was statutorily exempt was erroneous.
16 25. Petitioner has acquired a vested right. A statute may not be applied retroactively
17 to impair an individual's vested rights. A right is A vested when it is so perfected that it cannot be
18 taken away by statute. Petitioner has perfected its rights by virtue of it challenge to the Project
19 before the City Council and the subsequent legal challenge to the Project currently pending in
20 Los Angeles County Superior Court. Petitioner has extensively relied on the procedures and
21 processes outlined in CEQA that allow for a challenge to a Project. AB 1197 would completely
22 disrupt and disseminate the actions undertaken by Petitioner to date and would absolve the City
23 of its obligations to adhere to the mitigation measures that it has committed to undertake in
24 conjunction with the Project. In its MND, the City admitted that the PSHO would have
25 potentially significant environmental impacts with regard to the following resource categories:
26 (1) Noise, (2) Tribal Cultural Resources, (3) Cultural Resources and (4) Hazards and Hazardous

S OgL e}INS "PALA EJUSI!M E8E8 13 rationality in the nature of the class. Here, that rationality was lacking. There is no question that
'SIIlH Aueneg 14 the statutory exemption provided for in 1197 was not comprehensive. Indeed, only the City of
15 Los Angeles's PSH and IMCO ordinances were granted an exemption from CEQA. Further, only
16 one case was challenging those ordinances in court and no other person could bring a new
17 challenge due to the passage of the statute of limitations in May 2018. The exemption was
18 designed to moot out specific lawsuit in a specific court brought by a specific entity -
Petitioner. The means employed by the legislature were not rationally related to the asserted
20  legislative objective. Rather, the means were fashioned in an effort to punish Petitioner for 19

21 bringing a politically unpopular and controversial lawsuit.
As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief)
3 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
5 30. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' exemption determination

6 failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA because the statutory exemption provided by
7 AB 1197 was unconstitutional as applied to Petitioner.
8 31. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal
requirements applicable to the Project.
10 32. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
11 33. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer 8 Channel Law Group, LLP L 1Z06 I B}nS 'pALa eUJyS|!M E8€8 12 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
13 34. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether 8
'SIl!H Aueng 14 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other
15 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
16 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
17 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
18 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
19 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is
20 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
21 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1060.

23 35. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
24 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.
25 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that
26 Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Fight Back, Venice!, formally known as Venice Vision, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City erroneously determined that the Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance (No. 185492) and the Interim Motel Conversion Ordinance (No. 185489) was statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to PRC 21080.27(b)(1) and PRC 21080.27(b)(3). The Petition will also challenge that the Addendum to the Southern California Association of Government's 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") is not statutorily exempt from CEQA. The Petition will allege that the statutory exemption is not applicable because AB 1997 is unconstitutional. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the Ordinances and the Addendum on or about April 11, 2018. The City filed Notice of Exemptions with the County Recorder asserting usage of the statutory exemption provided by AB 1197 on September 27, 2019.

Re: Fight Back , Venice! V. City of Los Angeles et al.

Honorable Attorney General Becerra:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by Fight Back, Venice!, formerly known as Venice Vision. The Petition alleges, inter alia, that the City of Los Angeles erroneously determined that Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance (No. 185492) and Motel Conversion Ordinance (No. 185489) was statutorily exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The City of Los Angeles filed Notices of Exemption with the County Recorder asserting usage of the statutory exemption for the Project on September 27, 2019.

Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Jamie T. Hall
