21 I. INTRODUCTION

22 1. Through this Complaint and Verified Petition for Writ of Administrative

23 Mandamus ("Petition"), Petitioner, acting in the public interest and in the interest of Friends

24 of Enchanted Meadow ("FOEM") seeks to set aside a timber harvest plan (THP) submitted to

25 Respondent California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("CAL FIRE") by Real
Party in Interest Mendocino Redwood Company, LLC ("MRC"). 26 2. CAL FIRE designates the subject THP, approved on August 1, 2019, as THP #
27 1-19-00070. It seeks to log trees in forests of the lower Albion River Watershed, a project
28

that will cause irreparable harm to the Albion River's wetlands and forest ecosystem. Unless
restrained by Order of this Court, this THP would allow extensive logging operations and
2 degrade Enchanted Meadow Wetlands Sanctuary located in the eastern reaches of the Albion

3 River estuary in Mendocino County. Approximately 195 acres of forest land 2.9 miles

4 upstream from the town of Albion would be cut, over one mile in length of wetland preserve

5 designated as sanctuary is disregarded by this THP and considered a mere dumping ground

6 conveniently located to absorb silted spoils from proposed adjacent cut.

7 3. Through this Petition, Petitioner asks the Court to set aside CAL FIRE's

8 approval of THP 1-19-00070 MEN, and to require CAL FIRE to properly analyze, disclose,

9 provide alternatives and mitigate the significant adverse environmental impacts associated

10 with CAL FIRE's approval of the THP. Petitioner ask this Court to order CALFIRE to comply

11 with the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA")

12 and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA
Guidelines"), the 1973 Z'Berg Nejedly Forest Practice Act, Pub. Res. Code § 4511 et seq. and
13 its regulations, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, sections 895 et seq. (*FPA"), and
14 Code of Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5.
15 4. This Petition asks whether a state agency, CAL FIRE, must fulfill its duty to
16 oversee and ascertain the facts about this THP's visual and environmental impacts on the
17 Enchanted Meadow Wetlands Sanctuary and adjacent forest ecosystems, or whether CAL
18 FIRE can simply suspend its responsibility and rely uncritically and without legal or factual
19 justification on MRC's unsupported assurances the THP will not harm the forest, river,

20 wetland and dependent wildlife and plants?

21 This Petition asks what is the measure of regard a state agency, CAL FIRE, must show toward

22 its citizens in fulfilling its duty to support public participation while a THP is under their

23 review?

24 5. Petitioner alleges CAL FIRE prejudicially abused it's discretion and failed to

25 proceed according to law by: not making the THP available to all the public on its website

26 named "CAL TREEs". rejecting FOEM's comments, refusing to extend the Public Comment

27 period and not providing reasonable notice to the public. Petitioner alleges CAL FIRE's

28 disfunctional office practices in Santa Rosa, Willits and Fort Bragg hinders public
participation.

2

CALTREES, an online site for public review of THPs denied entry to Petitioner and FOEM

1 Lands Steward, Nita Ishcomer. During the Public Comment period, both individuals raised

2 this issue with Willits and Santa Rosa CAL FIRE offices by telephone message and thereafter

3 by correspondence before the close of public comment deadline.

4 Near the close of the public comment, Ishcomer went to local Fort Bragg CAL FIRE office to

5 submit his written comment requesting an extension of the Public Comment period because he

6 was blocked from viewing the THP online. Fort Bragg CAL FIRE refused to accept his letter,
would not stamp it received and told him his comment had to be sent to Santa Rosa or Willits

8 CAL FIRE. Ishcomer asked if they would fax it for him and they said no, go to the public

9 library and send it from there, we only deal with "mushroom and fire permits".
With possibly one exception, all times Petitioner sought information from CAL FIRE to learn
10 of the THP's end of comment period or sought help to obtain access to CALTREES,
11 Petitioner's queries were met with voicemails, often placed on hold for long periods of time,
12 experienced abrupt disconnections or was misdirected•to Sonoma County forestry.
13 With exception of an Official Response (OR) letter, which was signed by name, related THP
14 correspondence from CAL FIRE was signed by an anonymous collective, "Review Team".
15 Each time Petitioner called CDF to speak to someone on the "Review Team" the
16 receptionist(s) seemed confused not knowing where to direct the call, would leave the phone
17 and search the hallway to see what doors were "opened or closed", when the receptionist

18 returned to the phone Petitioner's calls were always forwarded to a voice mail, never once did

19 a live conversation ensue.

20 The Notice of Intent to Harvest Timber form Note: THE ESTIMATED EARLIEST

21 APPROVAL DATE IS PROBABLY NOT THE ACTUAL APPROVAL DATE. Normally, a

22 much longer period of time is available for public comment and preparation of CAL FIREs

23 responses to public comments. Please check with CAL FIRE, prior to the above listed date to

24 determine the actual date that the public comment period closes.

25 The singular incident when a live, CAL FIRE person was on the phone, Petitioner asked when

26 the public comment ended and was told "I don't know, but it will be after the second review".
Petitioner asked when the second review was and was told "I'm not sure when, maybe in a
27 week or two".
28

3

On the surface while reading CAL FIRE's self promoting rhetoric one has the impression they

M care, they're sympathetic to the public's concerns, not so; CAL FIRE's premiere role in the

2 silvaculture realm is to facilitate the timber industry's cut, not enforce forestry protection.
0' U- Petitioner alleges CAL FIRE intentionally thwarts the public's participation in the THP
process :
-by not making the THP available to all the public,
-by refusing to extend the public comment period in unusual circumstances,
-by charging the public .37 a page to photocopy, almost four times the amount of a copy shop,
-by only providing THPs for public review in person at Santa Rosa and Willits CAL FIRE's
-by sanctioning small one inch column THP public notices in newspaper as reasonable notice,
-by not requiring reasonable, visual public notification posting, from THP applicants in the
10 nearest community to the THP and nearest public road,
11 -by allowing THPs to be padded, overburdened with general, computerized, non specific data
12 -by operating a public information website that discriminates against non cell phone users,
13 -by discriminating against Mendocino coast residents, providing no local viewing of THPs,
14 -by disallowing Fort Bragg CAL FIRE to receive time sensitive THP public comment and
15 by promulgating dis functional office practices, suppressing disclosure of public information.
16 6. CAL FIRE did not support its THP approval with substantial evidence in that the

17 Official Response (OR) for the THP is inadequate in ways which include, but are not limited

18 to its failure to provide, evaluate and respond in non-conclusory fashion to the issues and

19 comments raised by Petitioner's public comment letter. Petitioner was denied access to the

20 THP on line, the OR prejudicially implies since FOEM received a letter dated May 6, 2019,

21 regarding domestic water supply near THP 1-19-00070, there was ample time for Petitioner to

22 respond to the THP and comment, therefore an extension to the public comment period was
not warranted. The Point is when Petitioner had the time to review the THP on CALTREES,
23
website access was blocked to Petitioner. CAL FIRE did not correct the problem before the 24 close of the Public Comment period. CAL FIRE's failure includes, but is not limited to, the 25 failure to include and adequately respond to petitioners' comments regarding negative
26 environmental impacts to FOEM's nature sanctuary.
27 7. In light of these and other procedure and substantive violations of CEQA and the
28 Forest Practice Act, Petitioner requests this Court set aside CAL FIRE's approved THP.

II. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

28

5.

is allowed to proceed as outlined in the THP. Petitioner is within the class of persons
beneficially interested in and aggrieved by CAL FIRE's approval as alleged herein below.

2 Petitioner expressed concerns and objections to the approval of the THP in correspondence to

3 CAL FIRE. Respondent owes a mandatory duty to comply with the legal duties that Petitioner

4 alleges were violated before approving the THP. Petitioner has the right to enforce the

5 mandatory duties that CEQA, the Forest Practice Act, and the Forest Practice Rules impose on

6 Respondents.

D.
7 Factual and Procedural Background
15.
8 The project is 2.9 miles east of the mouth of the Albion River and town. The
nearest contemporary landmark of thirty years is Enchanted Meadow. The northern section of
the THP borders Enchanted Meadow Wetlands Sanctuary located on the South side of the
10 Albion River between Railroad and Duck Pond Gulches.
11 16. The Notice of Intent to Harvest Timber was stamped RECEIVED on May
12 22, 2019 by CAL FIRES Coast Area Office Resource manager.
13 17.
• Notice of Intent to Harvest states cost to purchase the THP is $93.78
14 18. End of public comment period was 7/21/19.
15 19. On 7/19 Ishcomer tried to submit his public comment letter addressing his

16 blocked access to CALTREES THP site and request for an extension of the public comment

17 period to Fort Bragg CAL FIRE and was refused by their office. On Saturday 7/20 Ishcomer

18 mailed his public comment letter to CAL FIRE in Santa Rosa. End of public comment was

19 Sunday 7/21. Ishcomer's letter was received by CAL FIRE Monday 7/22 and deemed too late

20 to be included in the public comment. See attached exhibits one and two.

21 20. Petitioner tried to contact CAL FIRE on several occasions to find out about the

22 end of the public comment period, and later express the difficulty of blocked access to the

23 public access site for THPs, CALTREES. On one voice mail recording at CALFIRE

24 Petitioner asked if the CALFIRE could email it to her. Petitioner was forced to write a public

25 comment without benefit of the THP review, sending an email to CAL FIRE the eve of the end
of the public comment. Petitioner's comment were deemed timely, however the OR was
26 deficient in addressing Petitioners concerns and her request for an extension of the public
27 comment period was denied.
28

6

21. CAL FIRE approved the THP on August 1, 2019 and issued its Official Response
to Comments on the same day.' CAL FIRE's Notice of Conformance was filed on August 1,

2 2019.

3 22. This action is timely filed within 30 days as required by Pub. Res. Code §

4 21167.5.

5 E. Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

6 23. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this

7 Petition and, to the extent required, has exhausted all available administrative remedies in that

8 the determination by CAL FIRE is final and no further administrative appeal procedures are

9 provided by state or local law. Petitioner and concerned FOEM member, Ishcomer, orally and
in writing and in person requested of CAL FIRE to please extend the public comment period
10 through the process provided by CAL FIRE. Alternatively, neither Petitioner nor others were
11 provided opportunity to raise the grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition prior to
12 CALFIRE's decision to approve the THP. Further, Petitioner does not believe it is required to
13 exhaust administrative remedies, because to attempt to do so would be futile and Petitioner is
14 not afforded adequate administrative remedies.
15 F. Notice Requirements
16 24 In accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc. § 388,

17 Petitioner is serving a copy of this pleading on the Attorney General's office.
18 G. No Adequate Remedy

19 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

20 law, within the meaning of Code of Civ. Proc. § 1086 because Petitioner, FOEM and the

21 public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damage, by Respondents'

22 violations of the Forest Practice Act and CEQA. At all times mentioned herein, CALFIRE has

23 been able to deny the approval and operation of the THP at issue. Despite such ability, and

24 despite Petitioner's demand for denial, CALFIRE has failed and continues to fail to perform

25 its duty to deny the approval and operation of the THP. CALFIRE has prejudicially abused its
discretion in approving THP 1-19-00070.
26

27 7
28

26. If CALFIRE is not ordered to withdraw its approval of the THP, or if its decision
P is not stayed pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(g), and the Real Party in Interest is not
2 enjoined from engaging in timber operations on this THP site, the land, wildlife habitat, and
3 environmental values subject to and affected by the THP will suffer irreparable and permanent
4 damage.

5 27. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of

6 Civ. Proc. § 1021.5 to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the

7 relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons by

8 ensuring that CAL FIRE does not approve the THP without complying with CEQA, the Forest

9 Practice Act and the Forest Practice Rules. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement

10 are such as to make an award of attorney's fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent this

11 timely enforcement action by Petitioner, the THP might otherwise be deemed lawfully
approved, despite CAL FIRE's failure to comply with CEQA, the Forest Practice Act and the 12 Forest Practice Rules.
13 III. CAUSES OF ACTION
14 Claim for Relief (CEQA/Notice of Public Review/Availability)
15 * 28. CEQA requires that the lead agency must provide public notice that the draft
16 EIR or THP is available for public comment and review. Pub. Res. Code § 21092; 14 CCR §
17 15087(a). CALFIRE failed to provide this notice and failed to provide notice so that the
18 public had full notice of the review period and the ability to comment. CALFIRE then failed
19 to acknowledge those problems and accept Petitioner's request for an extension of the time to
20 comment.

21 29. CEQA requires that the EIR or THP be posted to parties who have requested

22 notice and provide notice to the general public. Pub. Res. Code § 21092; 14 CCR § 15087(a-

23 d). CALFIRE failed to meet these requirements because its website CALTREES blocked entry

24 to non cell phone users. The THP was unavailable to the public who do not use cell phones

25 due to poor reception on the coast, and to the public not using cell phone due to medical

26 conditions. No reasonable notice was provided to the general public. No notice was posted in

27 the nearest community, the town of Albion. No reasonable notice was posted on the nearest
public road closest to the THP.
28

8

30. CEQA requires that a comment period be 30 to 60 days. Pub. Res. Code §
21091; 14 CCR § 15087, 15105, 15205. CEQA also requires that if there are unusual

2 circumstances the circulation and comment period be longer. 14 CCR § 15087(e).

3 Petitioner was not allowed review of the THP prior to it's approval by CAL FIRE. Petitioner

4 wrote a public comment letter with out the benefit of the THP review and recently has read the

5 THP which noted the THP would be amended to insert botanical data not present when the

6 THP was approved. Petitioner is now aware the THP does not address significant
environmental damage caused by MRC's negligent logging practices on the North side of
Enchanted Meadow Wetlands Sanctuary ("EMWS") in April of 2018. EMWS is
approximately 53 acres in size, MRC's poorly maintained logging road collapsed 600' above
EMWS and spewed an 1100' mud torrent down slope, across the EMWS and into the Albion
10 River. Petitioner has discovered CAL FIRE has abused its discretion under 14 CCR 898.2(c)
11 in that information contained in the THP is incorrect, incomplete and misleading in a material
12 way.
13 There are unusual circumstances because it appears no individuals in either the two
14 communities that surround the Albion River, the towns of Albion or Little River actually saw

15 the THP before it was approved. An entire class of people did not have access to the THP, or

16 know about it, obviously the Public Notice was ineffective. This THP is deficient because it

17 lacks the input of public comment from the communities that surround it.

18 Claim for Relief (CEQA/Forest Practice Act - Response to Comments)

19 31. Petitioner incorporates by reference all the allegations contained in the previous

20 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein below.

21 32. CEQA stipulates that "[t]he evaluation and response to public comments is an

22 essential part of the CEQA process. Failure to comply with the requirement can lead to

23 disapproval of a project." See "Discussion" following CEQA Guidelines $15088. By forcing

24 the approving agency to acknowledge, summarize and respond to the public's concerns, the
requirement "enable[s] the public to determine the environmental and economic values of their
25 elected and appointed officials thus allowing for appropriate action come election day should a
26 majority of the voters disagree." CEQA Guidelines §15003, subd. (e). The Forest Practice Act
27 requires that CALFIRE invite and consider comments on THPs and respond in writing to all
28 issues raised. 14 C.C.R. §§ 1037.3(d), 1037.4, 1037.8.
9

33. To pass legal muster, an agency's responses to comments must specifically
1 explain the reasons for rejecting suggestions received in comments and for proceeding with a

2 project despite its environmental impacts. Such explanations must be supported with specific

3 references to empirical information, scientific authority and/or explanatory information. The

4 responses, moreover, must manifest a good faith, reasoned analysis; conclusory statements

5 unsupported by factual information will not suffice. CEQA Guidelines §15088.
34. CAL FIRE prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed according to law
and did not support its THP approval with substantial evidence in that the Official Response
for the THP is inadequate in ways which include, but are not limited to its failure to provide,

9 evaluate and respond in non-conclusory fashion to the issues and comments raised by

10 Petitioner. This failure includes, but is not limited to, the failure to include and adequately
respond to Petitioner's concerns regarding REAL PARTIES logging operation's immediate
11 proximity to FOEM's nature preserve, concerns of protective buffers outlined in the THP and
12 appropriate mitigation measures to lessen cumulative impacts of sedimentation of wetlands
13 and over logging by industrial timber in the Albion River Watershed. Concerns for all wildlife,
14 endangered species, species of special concern, plants and water quality.
15 35. WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as set forth below.
16 Claim for Relief (CEQA/Forest Practice Act - Re-circulation Required)
17 36. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations contained in the previous

18 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein below.

19 37. If subsequent to the commencement of public review and agency consultation

20 but prior to the final THP approval or EIR certification, the lead agency adds "significant new

21 information" to an EIR, it must issue new notice and must re-circulate the THP or portions of

22 it, for additional review and comment. Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines con

23 15088.5; 14 C.C.R. §1037.3(f). Re-circulation is required in those instances in which the

24 project is changed, substantial new impacts will result from the project, new mitigation

25 measures with impacts are proposed, a substantial increase in the severity of an environmental

26 impact may occur without adequate mitigation, a feasible alternative or mitigation measure
that clearly would lessen the environmental impacts is rejected, or new information is added
27 which shows that the THP was so deficient as to render public comment effectively
28

10.

meaningless. These violations include but not limited to not making the THP available to the
public and rejection of petitioner's comments identifying the THPs significant unmitigated

2 impacts to wetlands animals and forest ecosystems.
38. CALFIRE prejudicially abused its discretion, failed to proceed according to
v law, and did not support the THP approval with substantial evidence in that it failed to extend

5 the public comment period when Petitioner and FOEM member brought the failing of CAL

6 TREEs website to their attention, including no significant protective buffers provided for

7 EMWS, but not limited to: lack of data regarding native plants and wetlands; erroneous

8 conclusions no impacts to wildlife or ecosystem, insufficient surveys regarding bird species;

9 failure to address and provide relevant data regarding massive relocation of sediment damage
to EMWS acerbated by MRC's negligent logging practices in 2018, and failure to address 10 potential mitigation remedies if slopes were to collapse in the THP as they did in elsewhere in 11 Enchanted Meadow Wetlands Sanctuary.
12

13 39. In light of the foregoing violations of CEQA and the Forest Practice Act,
14 CALFIRE prejudicially abused its discretion.
15 40. WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as set forth below.
16 IV. PRAYER FOR JUDGMENT

17 By reason of the foregoing, Respondent CALFIRE has violated the Forest

18 Prietice Act, the California Environmental Quality Act, and Code of Civ. Proc. §§1085 and

19 1094.5 by approving THP 1-19-00070, notwithstanding the fatal defects described herein

20 above.

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

22 1. For a Writ of Mandate ordering CALFIRE to set aside approval of THP based on

23 its violations of CEQA, the Forest Practice Act and regulations set forth therein.
2. 24 For a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Real Parties in Interest,

25 MRC its agents, employees, representatives, and all persons acting in concert with or
participating with Real Parties in Interest, from engaging in any activity including timber 26 harvesting, pursuant to the THP until it complies with California statutes and regulations.
27

28

11

3. Alternatively, for a stay of CALFIRE's decision approving the THP pending

1 judgment pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc. § 1094.5(g).
2 4. For reasonable attorneys' fees under Code of Civ. Proc. $1021.5.

3 5. For costs of suit.

4 6. For such other and further relief as this Court deems proper.

CAL FIRE
RE: CALTREES online enrollment
RE: THP 1-19-00070

7-19-19

We have tried to access THP 1-19-00070 on line to review and provide public comment. Multiple times our enrollment attempts at CALTREES site was denied, claiming the data we entered was invalid; therefore blocking our access to this THP. A lot of time was spent holding on line via the telephone waiting for an answer as to when the public comment period was ending and numerous times no one answered the phone when calling your Willit's forestry office. Do you have an online venue that allows the public to access THIP's simply and autonomously? If so, where is it, if not, why not? Currently we cannot access this THP, because our enrollment is blocked, due to a snag in your enrollment process. Demanding multiple names, addresses and phone numbers to enter your site, seems unnecessary when sensitive information is not being exchanged; is burdensome and discourages the public's participation in your program. Later this same day we tried to address these concerns locally at your Fort Bragg office on two occasions and was told they couldn't accept any letters and referred us to Willits. Please extend the public comment period and contact us so we may have your assistance in accessing thp 00070 online.
Thank you,

Subject: Public Comments (THP 1-19-00070 MEN)
Dear Nita Ishcomer,
We received your recent letter (copy enclosed) at the Cal Fire Region Headquarters via regular mail on July 22, 2019 inquiring about public comment for THP 1-19-00070 MEN. The close of public comment for this plan was on July 21, 2019. There was one email sent to SantaRosaPublicComment@fire.ca.gov on July 21, 2019 at 11:53 PM just making it in under the
deadline. In the future, if the public date closure is not clear through the CalTREES website, you are welcome to call the Forest Practice phone in the header at the top of this letter to ask the Review Team (Mon - Fri 9-4).
Part of your letter mentioned the difficulty with the CalTREES website. As of today, the
functionality of online submittal of public comments / concern letters through that interface is not available. That was probably the main issue for the confusion with the site. The search function on CalTREES is up and running and available to the public, and should be working if you wanted to just view harvest documents. A good reference for future problems with interacting with the website is the CalTREES support line. Feel free to call them (916) 704-7579 (Mon - Fri 9-4) with questions or problems with CalTREES.

Sincerely,

Santa Rosa Review Team
