21 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:
22 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on
23 January 10, 2019, Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
24 Mandate (*Petition") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) challenging
25 the approval by the Respondent, CITY OF BANNING, of the Banning Distribution Center Project,
26 which proposes the construction and operation of a one million square foot industrial building in
27 the City of Banning.
28 1

The Project will operate as high cube/warehouse distribution facility, meaning that diesel
2 trucks traveling from locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bring cargo

3 to the warehouse building for storage and sorting for transport on other trucks to destinations in and
4 outside California. The Petition alleges that the City failed to comply with CEQA in certifying an
Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. Among other deficiencies, the EIR ignores
feasible mitigation for significant air quality impacts - namely measures that would address the
Project's harmful diesel emissions due to intense truck operations and activity.
For the reasons alleged in the Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate (transmitted

9 herewith), the decisions approving the Project and certifying the Project's EIR must be overturned.

-1- VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

Nmo 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent, City of Banning ("City"), on or
about December 11, 2018, of the Banning Distribution Center project, including
L certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report, a General Plan Amendment, a

5 Zone Change, a Design Review, and all related land use approvals (collectively,

6 "the Project").

7 2. The Banning Distribution Center Project concerns the construction of a one-million

8 square foot industrial building on approximately 63 acres of vacant land in the City
9 of Banning. The Project will likely operate as a high cube warehouse logistics
10 center, meaning that diesel trucks primarily traveling from the Ports of Long Beach
11 and Los Angeles will bring cargo to the warehouse building for storage and sorting
12 for transport on other trucks to destinations in and outside California. These

13 operations will occur 24 hours per day, seven days per week. The Project will
14 generate significant, adverse environmental impacts that have not been adequately
15 evaluated and/or mitigated in violation of the California Environmental Quality
16 ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
17 3. The City of Banning's certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report
18 ("EIR") for the Project must be vacated because the record lacks substantial
19 evidence in support of the EIR's conclusions, and because the EIR fails to
20 adequately describe or disclose relevant information. Also, the Project results in
21 significant and unavoidable impacts but mitigation is ineffective to reduce impacts.
22 Additionally, the City improperly rejected feasible mitigation measures and project
23 alternatives that would lessen some of the Project's harmful environmental effects.
24 4. During the administrative review process, the City was notified that there was need
25 for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse environmental
26 effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the City approved the
27 Project and certified the Final EIR.

28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

5. By this verified petition, Petitioner, Sierra Club, alleges the following:
2 PARTIES
6. Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, is a national environmental organization of
approximately 830,000 members. The San Gorgonio Chapter of the Sierra Club has
membership of approximately 7,500 individuals with approximately 4,000 members

6 living in Riverside County. Sierra Club's goals include protecting California's
7 lands, waters, air and wildlife. Local members of the San Gorgonio Chapter of the
8 Sierra Club reside in the general vicinity of the Project site and are concerned with
9 the Project's impacts to the local and regional environment. Sierra Club submitted
10 comments opposing approval of the Project to the City.
11 7. Respondent, CITY OF BANNING, is a political subdivision of the State of
12 California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the authority of
13 regulating and administering local land use and development within its territory in
14 compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances as well as
15 applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The City is the lead agency
16 for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with
17 applicable State and local laws.
18 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest,
19 BANNING INDUSTRIAL, LP, was the applicant for the Project, has an ownership
20 interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals at the
21 subject of this lawsuit.

22 9. DOES 1 through 100 are individuals or entities that may have an ownership interest
23 in the property, were project applicants, or claim an interest in the approvals at the
24 subject of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the
25 Real Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES through
26 100 inclusive.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 The Project

3 10. The Banning Distribution Center Project is described as a proposal for the
4 construction and operation of a one-million square foot industrial warehouse

5 logistics building on 63.4 vacant acres north and east of the Banning Airport and
6 south of Interstate 10 in the City of Banning.

7 11. The Project site is currently vacant, undeveloped, and vegetated with desert scrub
8 habitat. Several ephemeral drainages cross the site and the surrounding area.
9 12. The Project building includes a total of 209 dock doors and the facility includes 321
N: truck trailer parking spaces and 174 automobile parking spaces.
13. The Project also includes off-site improvements, including the construction of the
intersection of Lincoln and John Street, an emergency access road, and major
13 extensions of water and sewer lines (9,350 and 5,968 linear feet, respectively) to
14 serve the Project site as well a as a lift station. The Project site is not currently served
15 by water and sewer infrastructure.
16 14. The Project includes the certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report and
17 the following land use approvals:
18 a) General Plan Amendment to change the land use designations and zoning
19 for two parcels from Public Facilities-Airport (PF-A) to Airport
20 Industrial (AI) (GPA 17-2501);
21 b) Zone Change (ZC 17-3501);
22 c) Design Review; and
23 d) Plot Plan.
24 CEQA Review and Project Approval

25 15. The City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the Project pursuant to
26 CEQA on January 22, 2018.
27 16. The Project's Draft EIR pursuant to CEQA was circulated for public comment on
28

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

June 26, 2018.
17. The Project's Final EIR was prepared in or about November 2018.
m07 10 0 18. The Final EIR finds that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable
impacts in terms of air quality impacts (long term and cumulative) and greenhouse
gases (GHGs).
19. On November 7, 2018, the City of Banning's Planning Commission voted to
7 approve the Project at a public hearing.

8 20. On December 11, 2018 the City of Banning City Council voted to approve the
9 Project at a public hearing, including, but not limited to, certification of the Final

10 EIR, and adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and a
11 Statement of Overriding Considerations.
12 21. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury
13 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will
14 be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was
15 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City in its certification of the EIR
16 to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and the City's approval
17 of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
18 contrary to the requirements of State law.

19 22. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
20 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
21 under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and

22 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by
23 protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition.
24 Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these public policies and
25 prevent such harm.
26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 23. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedurc

28

-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Section 1094.5.

2 24. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
3 Sections 393 and 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in
4 Riverside County.

5 25. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
6 with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in notifying Respondent
7 of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by complying with
8 the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in notifying Respondent of
9 Petitioner's election to prepare the record of Respondent proceedings in connection
10 with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").
11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
12 26. During the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented in writing
13 to the City that the Project would result in potentially significant impacts to/from
14 including, but not limited to: air quality, energy, greenhouse gases, traffic, growth
15 inducement, and others. Petitioner commented that the EIR was legally inadequate;
16 that further mitigation was required; and that project alternatives were feasible.
17 27. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted its administrative
18 remedies within the meaning of Cal. Public Resources Code § 21177.
19

20 CAUSE OF ACTION
21 (Writ of Mandate)
22 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

23 28. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs through 27 above as
24 though set forth in full herein.
25 29. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §
26 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
27

28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to
2 CEQA's provisions.

3 30. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA. To

4 effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA provides that
5 an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant environmental impacts of a

6 proposed project including both direct and indirect impacts as well as cumulative
7 impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2 (a), 15130)

8 31. CEQA, furthermore, establishes a substantive mandate on the part of the lead agency
9 to mitigate the significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources
10 Code § 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency may
11 not approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts unless
12 the agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been required of the
13 project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental impacts, or
14 (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible based on substantial evidence.
15 (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)
16 (b), 15092 (b).) Moreover, all mitigation measures must be certain and enforceable.
17 (Public Resources Code § 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)(2).)
18 The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are required by or
19 incorporated into the project to ensure that the measures are actually carried out.
20 (Public Resources Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).)
21 32. During the administrative process, Petitioner and others commented that the EIR
22 failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate impacts to/from including, but not limited
23 to, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, land use, noise, traffic, growth-
24 inducement, and cumulative impacts.
25 a) By way of example, the EIR concludes that long-term NOx emissions are
26 255.12 lbs per day (summer) and 263.06 lbs per day (winter). These
27 emission levels far exceed the applicable 55 lbs per day threshold. The
28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project, however, fails to adopt mitigation measures to reduce significant
NOx emissions that are primarily related to mobile sources. Petitioner, on
the other hand, proposed a number of feasible mitigation measures that were

a not adopted, and not found to be infeasible based on substantial evidence in
the record. These include that the Project incorporate the phase-in of

8 electric, hybrid electric, hydrogen electric, or battery operated (i.e., non

9 diesel) trucks; or that the Project periodically reevaluate the feasibility of

5655 cleaner trucks. The City failed to make findings supported by substantial
evidence that the proposed measures are infeasible.
b) By way of further example, the Project will impact six jurisdictional
drainage features. However, the EIR's conclusion of less-than-significant

14 relies on future determinations and approvals by resource agencies. This is

15 improper under CEQA. For instance, the EIR notes that "notifications to the

16 USACE, RWQCB and CDFW will be required prior to any ground

17 disturbance." It is unclear what is meant by "notification." This represents
deferred analysis and mitigation under CEQA.

18

19 c By way of further example, the City adopted only one measure related to

20 significant GHG impacts - i.e., the requirement that the Project install high

21 efficiency lighting. However, this is already a requirement of California's

22 Title 24. Petitioner commented that the Project must adopt all feasible

23 mitigation including the use of solar power energy to reduce GHG impacts.

24 The City failed to make findings, based on substantial evidence, that the use
of solar power was infeasible.

25

26 d) Also for instance, it is estimated that annually the Project will consume

27 1,554,697 million gallons of fuel and have a demand for 1.63 million

28 kwh/year of energy. The Project (a warehouse logistics center) is a fuel-
intensive use; thus, there is not substantial evidence to conclude that the

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project achieves the goal of "decreasing reliance on fossil fuels" consistent
with State CEQA Guidelines Appendix F. The Project takes no affirmative
steps beyond compliance with California's Title 24 in terms of increasing
reliance on renewable energy. For instance, there is no requirement that the
Project utilize solar energy. Focusing on purported sustainability features
6 and compliance with Title 24 is not adequate. (See, Ukiah Citizens for

7 Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 256, 262- 265.)

8 33. CEQA provides that a lead agency must evaluate a "reasonable range" of
9 alternatives to the proposed project, or the location of the project, which would
10 attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially
11 lessen any of the project's significant environmental effects. (State CEQA
12 Guidelines, § 15126.6 (a).) The lead agency also has a duty to adopt a project
13 alternative if it is feasible. (Public Resources Code § 21002) A lead agency may not
14 reject an alternative unless the agency makes findings supported by substantial
15 evidence showing that the alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources Code, §§
16 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 (a)(3), 15092.)
17 34. Petitioner commented that the EIR does not examine a "reasonable range" of project
18 alternatives where it evaluates only one alternative apart from the mandatory "no
19 project" alternative. Neither alternative is capable of meeting "basic" Project
20 Objectives. Three of the five Project Objectives involve the development of a
21 warehouse building. The "no project" alternative (Alternative 1) assumes no
22 development on the site, while the Existing General Plan Land Use Designation
23 alternative (Alternative 2) would not involve the development of a warehouse
24 building. Thus the EIR must evaluate a range of alternatives which are capable of
25 meeting basic Project Objectives, for instance, a reduced size warehouse building.
26 Further, "Alternative 2" has not been shown to be infeasible based on substantial

27 evidence. The fact that the alternative would develop smaller buildings consistent
28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

with existing land use designations does not render the alternative financially or
otherwise infeasible. There is no evidence in the record to support such a claim. m v U 35. For these reasons, the City's actions in certifying the EIR constitute an abuse of
discretion within the meaning of CEQA and the Project approvals must be set aside.
(Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)

6 PRAYER FOR RELIEE
7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner Sierra Club prays the following relief on all causes of action:
8 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent; City of
9 Banning, to set aside its decision certifying the EIR for the Project.
10 b) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
11 Banning, to set aside all Project approvals.
12 C) For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent
13 injunctive relief, in the event that Real Party in Interest, or its agents or
14 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site while this
15 lawsuit is pending.
16 d) For such other relief as may be just and proper.
17 e) For the costs of this suit, including attorney's fees, pursuant to Code of Civil
