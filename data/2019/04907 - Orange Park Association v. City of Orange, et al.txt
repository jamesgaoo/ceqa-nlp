VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the decision of the City of Orange and the City Council of
3 the City of Orange (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") to approve the Trails at Santiago
4 Creek project and related approvals, including a general plan amendment, zone change, specific
5 plan and development agreement. The approvals are referred to collectively as the "Project."
6 The action also challenges the City's certification of a final Environment Impact Report ("EIR")

7 for the Project. The Project approvals purport to allow the development of a 128-unit
8 subdivision in or adjacent to Orange Park Acres, an area of the City long known for its unique
9 rural character. The 109-acre Project site ("Site") is one of the largest remaining undeveloped
10 private sites in the City of Orange.
11 2. The City's approval of the Project is subject to the California Environmental
12 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines,
13 California Code of Regulations, title 14, § 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines"). The EIR for the Project
14 concludes that the Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on air quality and
15 transportation and traffic, as well as numerous other potentially significant environmental
16 impacts. But the EIR's analysis is flawed and incomplete. The EIR, for example, does not
17 include a legally adequate project description. The Project Site has been used for decades for
18 mining, gravel operations, materials recycling, fuel storage and other hazardous activities. The
19 EIR, however, fails to include consistent and accurate information about the extent of clean up
20 and remediation required to build homes on this polluted site. In addition, the City and Project
21 proponents have repeatedly touted the preservation of open space and restoration of the Santiago
22 Creek Corridor as central Project "benefits." Yet the EIR postpones critical elements of the open
23 space planning such as what entity will manage the open space and trails and how much
24 funding will be required and available to some later date.
25 3. The EIR also fails to provide the public with a full a accounting of the Project's
26 environmental impacts. Among its many egregious shortcomings, the EIR: fails to fully identify
27 or mitigate public safety impacts from hazardous materials on site; downplays the Project's
28 water quality, stormwater and flooding impacts; fails to include critical surveys for sensitive and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

endangered species; fails to ensure that sensitive species are protected and loss of habitat

2 resulting from the development is fully mitigated; and fails to include a proper noise analysis or
3 feasible noise reduction measures.

4 4 The EIR also entirely fails to comply with CEQA's mandate to present a

5 reasonable range of Project alternatives, particularly alternatives with fewer environmental
6 impacts, for consideration by the public and decision-makers. Instead, the analysis in the EIR is
7 incomplete and designed to reach the preordained conclusion that the proposed Project is the
8 only feasible alternative.
5. Numerous agencies, organizations, and individuals submitted comments to the
10 City on the draft and final EIRs, urging the City to provide a more thorough environmental
11 analysis of the Project's impacts and to require more mitigation for those impacts.
12 Unfortunately, the City failed to respond meaningfully to these comments or to fix the flaws in
13 the EIR's analysis.

14 6. As set forth below, the City violated CEQA by certifying a final EIR for the
15 Project that fails: (a) to provide an accurate or complete description of the Project; (b) to
16 adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant individual and/or cumulative impacts
17 on the environment; and (c) to adequately analyze alternatives to the Project. The City also
18 violated CEQA by failing to support its findings with substantial evidence, including findings
19 about the Project's impacts and overriding benefits, and the feasibility of mitigation measures
20 and alternatives.

21 7. For all of these reasons, the City's approval of the Project and certification of the
22 EIR must be overturned.

23 PARTIES

24 8. Petitioner Orange Park Association ("OPA") is an incorporated association of
25 citizens formed to protect the rural character of the land within the area known as Orange Park
26 Acres. Since its founding in 1960, OPA has worked to influence land use issues that affect the
27 area in and around the Project site. OPA's members reside throughout Orange County and the

28 City of Orange, including in areas near the Project site. OPA's members enjoy the scenic and
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

natural resources of the Project site and travel along the adjacent roads. The interests that OPA
2 seeks to further in this action are within the purposes and goals of the organization. OPA and its
3 members have a direct and beneficial interest in the City's compliance with the requirements of
4 CEQA in approving development of the Site. These interests will be directly and adversely
5 affected by the Project, whose approval violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition
6 and whose development would cause substantial and irreversible harm to the public and the

7 natural environment in the City of Orange. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will

8 confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and

9 other harms alleged herein and by ensuring that the City abides by the procedures required by
10 law in approving this Project. OPA submitted extensive comments to the City objecting to the
11 EIR's analysis and its members appeared at multiple public hearings where they opposed the
12 City's approval of the Project.
13 9. Respondent City of Orange is a municipal corporation in the State of California
14 responsible for carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The City is the "lead agency" for
15 this Project for purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility
16 for complying with CEQA. The City has a duty to comply with CEQA, state law, and its own
17 ordinances and the City of Orange General Plan (*General Plan").
18 10. Respondent City Council of the City of Orange is the duly elected legislative body
19 for the City of Orange. As the decisionmaking body, the City Council is charged with
20 implementing the City's land use planning, conducting a proper review of the Project's
21 environmental impacts under CEQA, and granting the various approvals necessary for the
22 Project to go forward.
23 11. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individuals,
24 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondents DOE 1 through DOE 20, inclusive, and
25 therefore sues such Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and
26 on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named Respondents are also responsible for the actions
27 described in this Petition. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names and
28 capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the Respondents is the agent and/or

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 employee of each other Respondent, and each performed acts on which this action is based

2 within the course and scope of such Respondent's agency and/or employment.

3 12. Real Party in Interest Milan REI X, LLC ("Milan") is a registered a California
4 Limited Liability Corporation. Milan owns the Project site and is the Project proponent, a party

5 to the Development Agreement, and an applicant for and recipient of the Project approvals.

6 13. Real Party in Interest Chris Nichelson is, on information and belief, the President
of Milan. He is listed on the Notice of Determination in the space designated for "Project
8 Applicant" and is therefore listed in conformance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5
9 a as a real party in interest.
10 14. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individuals,
11 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 21 through DOE 40, inclusive,
12 and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
13 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Petitioner
14 is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named Real Parties in
15 Interest may have an interest in this litigation. Each of the Real Parties in Interest is the agent
16 and/or employee of each other Real Party in Interest, and each performed acts on which this
17 action is based within the course and scope of such Real Party in Interest's agency and/or
18 employment.
19 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

20 15. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
21 in their entirety.

22 16. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
23 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168,
24 21168.5, and 21168.9.

25 17. Venue for this action properly lies in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil
26 Procedure Section 394 because the cause of action alleged in this Petition arose in Orange
27 County. Respondents' office and the Project Site are located in the City of Orange in Orange
28 County.
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 18. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
2 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and

3 required by law. Petitioner submitted numerous objections to approval of the Project and the

4 City's inadequate analysis and mitigation of the Project's impacts in comments on the draft,
5 recirculated draft, and final environmental impact reports prepared for the Project and at public
6 hearings for the Project.

7 19. The City has taken final agency action with respect to certifying the EIR and
8 approving the Project. The City has a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but
9 not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
10 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this
11 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside the Project approvals
12 and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approvals and
13 certification will remain in effect in violation of State law.

14 20. On November 20, 2019, Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section
15 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to the City a letter stating that Petitioner planned to file a
16 lawsuit challenging the City's approval of the Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true
17 and correct copy of this letter.
18 21. On November 21, 2019, Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section
19 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the
20 State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and
21 correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
22 22. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to
23 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner will
24 file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.
25 23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
26 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside its adoption
27 of the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approvals
28 will remain in effect in violation of State law, and the environment, Petitioner, its members, the
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

general community, and the natural environment Petitioner seeks to protect will be irreparably
2 harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner and its

3 members for that harm.

4 STATEMENT OF FACTS

5 24. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding facts in their
6 entirety.

25. The Project is located on a 109.2-acre site (*Project Site" or "Site") owned by
8 Milan. The Site is commonly referred to as the Sully Miller site and is located at 6145 E.
9 Santiago Canyon Road in the City of Orange.
10 26. The Site has been used for decades for mining activities and sand and gravel
11 operations. The Site is bisected by Santiago Creek in an east-west direction. Adjacent to East
12 Santiago Canyon Road is an area that supports or previously supported a concrete
13 crushing/stockpiling operation, various buildings, rock crushing facilities, several fuel storage
14 tanks, and hot-mix asphalt plants.
15 27. On or about October 11, 2016, the City and Milan entered into a Pre-Development
16 Agreement (PDA) for the Site. Under the PDA, Milan agreed to submit various land use
17 approval applications for the Site and the City agreed to process these applications
18 expeditiously.
19 28. The City issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the Project on March 3, 2017,
20 proposing a 150-unit development for the Site.
21 29. The City issued a Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Project in February
22 2018. The City received approximately 130 comment letters during the public review period,
23 including comments from OPA, dated April 5, 2018, which objected that the Project was so
24 lacking in basic design and planning features that it was impossible to evaluate meaningfully.
25 30. On or about November 14, 2018, the City prepared a Recirculated Draft EIR
26 ("RDEIR"). The City received hundreds of letters during the public comment period for the
27 RDEIR, including comments from the State Department of Toxic Substances Control, the
28 California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the City of Villa Park, and the Orange County
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Waste and Recycling. The agencies raised serious concerns about the Project, including
2 concerns about potential ground water contamination on the Site, the lack of adequate
3 information concerning drainage, grading and groundwater monitoring, the lack of a long-term
4 maintenance plan for proposed open space areas, and the Project's misplaced reliance on
5 mitigation banks for impacts to biological resources.

6 31. On December 28, 2018, OPA submitted extensive comments outlining the
7 RDEIR's substantive deficiencies, including its flawed project description and its failure to
8 analyze and mitigate the Project's adverse impacts related to a range of issues such as hydrology

9 and water quality, storm drainage and flooding, hazardous materials, wildlife, wetland and
10 riparian habitat, tree removal, traffic, roadway safety, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas
11 ("GHG") emissions, and noise. OPA also pointed out that the RDEIR failed to present a feasible
12 range of alternatives to the Project that would reduce Project impacts and be more in keeping
13 with the neighborhood's rural character and long-standing community plans.

14 32. In July 2019, the City issued a Final Environmental Impact Report (*FEIR"). As
15 OPA pointed out in its September 20, 2019 comments on the FEIR, this document largely failed
16 to address the RDEIR's substantive defects. Instead, the FEIR simply reiterated the RDEIR's
17 erroneous conclusions about Project impacts. OPA urged the City to deny the Project because of
18 its incompatibility with the rural character of Orange Park Acres and with community plans that
19 have long envisioned the sensitive Santiago Creek corridor and surrounding area as public open
20 space.

21 33. On July 15, 2019 and on August 5, 2019, the Planning Commission conducted
22 public hearings for the proposed Project. The Planning Commission adopted Resolution No. PC
23 07-19, Resolution No. PC 08-19, Resolution No. PC 09-19, and Resolution No. PC 10-19,
24 recommending approval of the Project to the City Council. Members of OPA and numerous
25 other residents of the City of Orange appeared at the Planning Commission hearings and voiced
26 their objections to the Project.
•27 34. On September 24, 2019, the City held a public hearing on the proposed Project,
28 which was continued on October 22, 2019. Members of OPA and numerous other residents of
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the City of Orange appeared at the City Council hearings and voiced their objections to the
2 Project.

3 35. On October 22, 2019, the City approved City Council Resolutions Nos. 11187 and
4 11188, and introduced City Ordinances Nos. 07-19 and 08-19 for the Trails at Santiago Creek
5 project.

6 36. On November 12, 2019, the City approved City Ordinances Nos. 07-19 and 08-19
7 for the Trails at Santiago Creek Project.

8 37. The "Project," as defined in this Petition, includes the zone change, development
9 agreement, general plan amendment, specific plan and all other related approvals for the Trails
10 at Santiago Creek project, including but not limited to the following:
11 a. Approval of City Ordinance No. 07-19, approving Zone Change No. 1286-
12 18 and adopting the Trails at Santiago Creek Specific Plan;
13 b. Approval of City Ordinance No. 08-19, approving Development Agreement
14 No. 0005-18 between the City and Milan for the Project Site;
15 C. Approval of City Council Resolution No. 11187 certifying the adequacy of
16 the EIR and adopting Findings of Fact, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a
17 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and imposing other Project conditions; and
18 d. Approval of City Council Resolution No. 11188 approving General Plan
19 | Amendment No. 2018-0001.

20 38. The Project as approved would allow development of the Project Site with a 128-
21 unit subdivision. The Project includes three different single-family detached lot programs
22 ranging in size from 8,000 square feet to 9,000 square feet (82 Lots); 9,200 square feet to 10,000
23 square feet (17 Lots); and 10,000 square feet and greater (29 Lots). The remaining 68.5 acres
24 would be open space, comprised of hillsides, grasslands, and the Santiago Creek riparian
25 corridor ("Corridor"). The City and Milan have promoted the Project's open space and multi-use
26 trail systems as key Project amenities. However, the City approved the Project without
27 commitments as to how this open space will be managed or funded. As noted in the September
28 24, 2019 staff report: "No commitment has been made by [Orange County] Parks for long-term
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

stewardship of the open space grasslands and trails as part of this Project." Nor has any other
2 entity committed to providing this critical open space management.

3 39. The City filed a notice of determination on October 24, 2019.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of CEQA

6 Public Resources Code § 21000 § et seq.; State CEQA Guidelines

7 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
8 entirety.
9 41. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause
10 significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the
11 statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially
12 significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
13 that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on
14 the proposed project.
15 42. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures
16 that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the
17 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars
18 the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available that would avoid or
19 reduce its significant environmental impacts. If there is an environmentally superior alternative,
20 the lead agency must either select that alternative instead of the project or make formal findings,
21 supported by substantial evidence, that the alternative is infeasible.
22 43. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would have
23 significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
24 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.
25 44. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must
26 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and
27 CEQA further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
28 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

45. The City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA by
2 certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the
3 CEQA Guidelines in numerous respects, including, but not limited to, the following:

4 a. The EIR failed to provide a project description that described the Project
5 and the existing environment in a stable, consistent, complete, and accurate manner.

6 i. The EIR provides inadequate and conflicting information relating to
the nature and extent of site preparation and remediation that would be required to construct the
8 proposed Project on a former mining site and next to a former landfill. The EIR fails to make

9 clear the status of existing uses on the Site. It also fails to disclose the full extent of onsite
10 hazardous contamination and the extent of potential contamination from the adjacent landfill. As
11 a result, it is unclear what actions must occur to ensure the site is safe for human occupation and
12 impossible to evaluate the potential human health impacts from disturbing or occupying the site.
13 In addition, the EIR fails to identify, or provides conflicting information regarding, critical data
14 supporting any remediation, such as the relevant import/export volumes for soil and mine waste.
15 ii. The EIR also fails to include necessary information about other key
16 Project components. It does not fully and accurately describe plan for restoration of the
17 Santiago Creek Corridor and omits essential details of such a plan, like the ultimate alignment,
18 width, depth, bottom configuration, and creek edge treatment of the creek and associated
19 riparian and wetland habitat. The EIR also fails to include a viable plan for the long-term
20 management and maintenance of the Corridor and other open spaces and trails. It is unclear, for
21 instance, whether the proposed public spaces will be managed by Orange County Parks, a
22 homeowners association, or some other entity, and how future management will be funded.

23 iii. The EIR also omits critical information on the design, phasing,
24 timing, and financing of Project infrastructure.

25 b. The EIR fails to fully assess the potential risk from wildfires or to ensure
26 public safety by requiring adequate evacuation plans.

27 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts from hazardous
28 substances, and potential environmental and public health impacts, resulting from the Site's
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

historic mining operations and its proximity to a closed landfill. The Project has the potential to
2 result in significant exposure to pollutants such as trichloroethylene-impacted soil vapor,

3 methane, and TPH-contaminated soils. The EIR, however, postpones assessment of these risks,
4 allowing the Project to go forward with no assurance that these and other hazardous substances
5 will be fully investigated and remediated. The EIR also assumes that compliance with applicable
6 State toxics standards will protect the public without actually disclosing the potential exposure
7 risks and the level of remediation that would be required to reduce the risks to acceptable levels.
8 d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's water
9 quality, stormwater and flooding impacts. The Project contains 100-year flood hazard areas and
10 involves extensive grading that will increase runoff. The EIR fails to provide detailed and
11 concrete assurances that downstream properties will be protected from potential flooding and
12 that adequate storm drainage will be developed. The EIR also fails to clearly describe and
13 mitigate potential impacts on the Santiago Creek Watershed and on the water quality of
14 downstream waterways from the construction and operation of the Project. In addition, the EIR
15 fails to include sufficient detail to allow the public to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation
16 proposed to reduce water pollution and flooding and fails to ensure that this mitigation will be
17 effectively implemented.

18 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's project-
19 specific and cumulative impacts to biological resources. The EIR recognizes that numerous
20 endangered or sensitive wildlife species may occur on the Site, but failed to include appropriate
21 surveys to determine their presence or absence. These species include the arroyo toad, arboreal
22 salamander, coast range newt, coast patch-nosed snake, red-diamond rattlesnake, coast horned
23 lizard, Coronado skink, orange-throated whiptail, western mastiff bat, San Diego black-tailed
24 jackrabbit, coastal (western) whiptail, sharp-shinned hawk, rough-legged hawk, red-shouldered
25 hawk, northern harrier, Southern California rufous-crowned sparrow, prairie falcon, American
26 peregrine falcon, loggerhead shrike, long-eared owl, pallid bat, northwestern San Diego pocket
27 mouse, San Diego desert woodrat, and gray fox. The EIR also fails to analyze the severity and
28 extent of the Project's impacts on numerous sensitive species such as the Yellow-breasted chat,
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a California Species of Special Concern, and the willow flycatcher, a State listed Endangered

2 Species. For these and other species, the EIR does not identify the precise amount of habitat lost
3 or adequate mitigation for lost habitat. Similarly, the EIR offers only vague assurances, rather
4 than credible evidence, that the Project's direct and cumulative impacts on sensitive species-
5 such as the Yellow-breasted chat, the willow flycatcher, the southern tarplant, and the least
6 Bell's vireo, a Federal Endangered and State Endangered species- will not be significant. The
7 EIR takes the same superficial approach with regard to the Site's plant communities and
8 resources. For example, it fails to provide legally enforceable or adequate mitigation for impacts
9 to the Site's southern cottonwood riparian forest and its valuable wetlands, streambeds and
10 riparian habitats and ignores the importance of using native plants for restoration. The EIR also
11 fails to properly evaluate the over 200 trees that are slated for destruction as required by the
12 City's Tree Preservation Ordinance.
13 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's construction-
14 related noise impacts, including impacts at the Salem-Lutheran Church and School. While the
15 EIR acknowledges that increased noise levels could result in annoyance and sleep disturbance, it
16 does not include a significance determination, as CEQA requires, and relies on vague and
17| unenforceable mitigation to reduce noise impacts.
18 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's
19 transportation related impacts. The EIR contains numerous discrepancies and inconsistencies
20 relating to the amount of earthwork required to implement the proposed Project. In addition, the
21 EIR underestimates both the number of truck trips required to prepare the site for development
22 and the Project's overall trip generation. It also understates the impacts of haul trucks in
23 analyzing roadway safety, traffic congestion, and air quality.

24 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's energy-
25 related impacts. While the EIR claims that the Project would not involve wasteful or
26 unnecessary use of energy, it contains few if any features that would reduce its consumption of
27 electricity, natural gas, gasoline or diesel fuel, such as incorporation of LEED (Leadership in
28 Energy & Environmental Design) standards.
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

i. Although the Project will generate over 1,900 metric tons of Greenhouse
2 Gas ("GHG") emissions annually, the EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's
3 consistency with local and State plans, policies and regulations adopted for the purpose of
4 reducing GHG emissions.

5 j. The EIR fails to adequately address the Project's inconsistency with
6 policies in the Orange General Plan, the Orange Park Acres Plan ("OPA Plan"), and the East
7 Orange Plan to protect the rural character of the neighborhood. The Project as proposed is
8 anything but rural: it would construct 82 of the Project's 128 houses on 8,000 square-foot lots
9 (about 5.5 houses per acre). The remaining 46 dwelling units (17 houses on 9,200 square-foot
10 lots and 29 houses on 10,000 square-foot lots) also cannot be characterized as rural development
11 under the Orange General Plan, which defines rural or semi-rural land use designations as
12 having 0-2.0 dwelling units per acre. The EIR fails to fully analyze the Project's inconsistency
13 with existing General Plan policies that seek to ensure that new development is in character with
14 the surrounding community, protect the public from hazardous materials, and reduce traffic
15 congestion and other impacts from new development. The Project is also inconsistent with the
16 designations of portions of the Site as "Santiago Green Belt Plan" in the OPA Plan and
17| "Regional Park" in the East Orange Plan.

18 k. The EIR fails to consider an appropriate range of Project alternatives and
19 presents misleading information about the alternatives it does address. For example, the EIR's
20 assumption that 77 units could be developed under Alternative 1 is unsupportable and artificially
21 inflated. For the "no project" alternatives, the EIR never defines what the existing "sand and
22 gravel operations" (which it also refers to as "resource extraction activities") entail. Thus, it is
23 simply impossible to determine what the "no-project" alternatives involve or how their
24 environmental impacts would compare to the Project. The EIR also fails to accurately represent
25 the "Collaborative Group" alternative or assess it against the Project's stated objectives; the EIR
26 instead invents new objectives that it suggests (with no basis) could not be incorporated into this
27 alternative. While the EIR identifies the Collaborate Group alternative as the environmentally
28 superior alternative (other than no-project alternatives), it dismisses it as infeasible without
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 adequate evidence. The remaining alternative- -the 122-Unit alternativeresults in impacts that
2 are nearly identical to the Project's. The EIR thus fails to identify a range of feasible alternatives

3 that actually reduce project impacts. It also fails to include any alternatives that would be
4 consistent with the long-standing designations of the Site as "Santiago Green Belt Plan" in the
5 OPA Plan and "Regional Park" in the East Orange Plan.

6 1. The EIR fails to provide meaningful responses to numerous comments
7 submitted on the DEIR and RDEIR, including comments on proposed mitigation measures,
8 inadequate wildlife surveys, and alternatives.

9 m. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's cumulative
10 impacts. The EIR ignores potential cumulative impacts on sensitive wildlife and habitat.
11 Moreover, the list of "related" cumulative projects in the EIR fails to include all relevant
12 projects, such as a proposed project by Chandler Sand and Gravel, LLC on a nearby 14.8-acre
13 site that includes a fill operation of massive proportions. In ignoring such projects in its
14 cumulative impacts analysis, the EIR understates the Project's potential cumulative impacts
15 related to traffic, noise, wildlife, sensitive habitat, stormwater drainage, flooding, and other
16 resources.

17 n. The City failed to recirculate the FEIR or RDEIR for public review despite
18 receiving significant new information at the public hearings for the Project and in comment
19 letters. This information revealed that the Project would have new or more severe significant
20 environmental impacts than previously identified, that alternatives existed to lessen these
21 impacts, and that the EIR was fundamentally inadequate.
22 0. In approving the Project, the City adopted findings and a statement of
23 overriding considerations that are inadequate as a matter of law in that they are not supported by
24 substantial evidence in the record. The findings do not provide the reasoning, or analytic route,
25 from facts to conclusions, as required by law. In light of the deficiencies in the EIR set forth
26 above, many of the determination that impacts will not be significant lack substantial evidence.
27 In addition, given the vague and unspecified nature of many of the proposed mitigation
28 measures, there is no substantial evidence that these measures will reduce impacts to less-than-
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 significant levels. The findings of overriding consideration are also inadequate because there is
2 no substantial basis for the assertions that the Project will ensure meaningful public benefits,
3 such as ensuring well-managed public open space, complying with applicable goals and policies
4 in the General Plan, OPA Plan and East Orange Plan, minimizing traffic and other adverse
5 effects on local residential neighborhoods, abating hazardous soil conditions, or reducing runoff.

6 p. In approving the Project, the City failed to make legally required findings
that mitigation measures suggested by Petitioner and others were infeasible, even though these
8 measures could have reduced the Project's impacts on biological and other resources.
9 q. In approving the Project, the City failed to consider alternatives that would
10. have reduced significant impacts while still meeting Project objectives, failed to make legally
11 required findings that alternatives to the Project that were environmentally superior were
12 infeasible, and failed to support its alternatives findings with substantial evidence.
13 46. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and
14 failed to proceed in the manner required by law by certifying the EIR, making findings, and
15 taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, the City's
16 certification of the EIR and approvals of the Project must be set aside.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 Wherefore, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
19 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to
20 I vacate and set aside their approvals of the Project;
21 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to
22 vacate and set aside the EIR for the Project and their certification of the EIR;
23 3. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents to
24 comply with the requirements of CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public
25 Resources Code Section 21168.9;

26 4. a For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
27| injunctions restraining the Respondents and Real Parties in Interest and their representative
28 agents, servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with the Respondents and Real
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Parties in Interest on their behalf, from taking any action to implement the Project, pending full
2 compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;

3 5. For a judicial determination and declaration from this Court that Respondents'

4 actions in approving the Project violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, as set forth above;

5 6. For costs of the suit;

6 7. For an order awarding Petitioner its attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure
7 section 1021.5 and other applicable authority; and

8 8. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Litigation Challenging
Trails at Santiago Creek Project Approvals

Dear Ms. Coleman:

This letter is to notify you that the Orange Park Association (*Petitioner") will file suit against the City of Orange and its City Council (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") for failure to observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq., in connection with its approvals of the Trails at Santiago Creek Project ("Project") and certification of a final environmental impact report for the Project. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

Please note that, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the record of proceedings for the Respondents' actions includes, among other items, all "internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the
project or to compliance with [CEQA]." Because e-mails and other internal
communications related to the Project are part of the administrative record for the lawsuit to be filed by Petitioner, Respondents may not destroy or delete such documents prior to the preparation of the record in this case.
