VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation ("Petitioner") seeks a writ of
3 mandamus compelling Respondents City of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles City Council
4 (sometimes collectively "City" or "Respondents") to comply with duties which the law
5 specially enjoins under Health & Safety Code Section 34173(i) and the California
6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Additionally, Petitioner seeks declaratory and
7 injunctive relief to halt certain unlawful practices of the City that violate operative
8 redevelopment plans established under state law. The CRA/LA, its Governing Board, and
9 its Oversight Board, whose status is explained later, are joined as Real Parties in Interest as
10 the Designated Local Authority and successor agency to the former Community
SILVERSTEIN LAW FIRM, APC J00H ,e 'anuary North Marengi 11
POSL-LOLLE Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles ("former CRA") under California
12 redevelopment law because the actions of the City challenged in this case affect significant

8 13 interests of the CRA/LA.
Pasadena, 14 2. This action arises as a consequence of actions taken by the City. The City
# % 15 adopted a transfer request resolution purporting to selectively transfer to itself land use
16 permit review authority over the redevelopment plans within the City's territory, which
17 plans were established under the state's redevelopment law. However, in doing so, the
18 City did not transfer to itself the inseparable responsibilities of those redevelopment plans,
19 such as enforcing of affordable housing requirements, requiring infrastructure
20 improvements needed to implement the plans, implementing adopted mitigation measures
21 in environmental documents certified in conjunction with such redevelopment plans, and
22 complying with settlement agreement obligations arising out of prior litigation over some
23 of the redevelopment plans. These are inseparable parts of and duties required under the
24 redevelopment plans.
25 3. Although the City could have adopted a resolution asking to transfer all
26 former CRA land use plans and functions at any time since redevelopment agencies were
27 abolished in 2011, the City allowed successor agency CRA/LA to incur the expense and
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

continue to perform the planning and permit review work associated with the
2 redevelopment plans during the last 8 years. The City's position changed when, in June
2018, the CRA/LA issued an interpretation of some redevelopment plans, which

4 interpretation operated to prevent developers proposing certain Transit Oriented
Communities ("TOC") density bonus projects from obtaining residential unit densities
significantly higher than otherwise allowed under the subject redevelopment plans.
4. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that upon
8 learning that the CRA/LA would not approve the high density housing projects the City
9 was prepared to approve using the City's TOC guidelines that violate the residential unit
10 density limits of the redevelopment plans, the City sought to obtain for itself the
North Marengo Avenue, 3'° Floor APC WHH MVT UMASAA A TOS SHL 11
POSL-LOLL6 1 CRA/LA's powers to review and approve projects within and subject to the redevelopment
12 plans.

8 13 5. In the years between 2011 and 2018, the City considered, but failed to
Pasadena, 14 adopt, previous versions of transfer request resolutions that had sought transfer of all
15 CRA/LA land use plans and functions. None of the previous resolutions were adopted.
16 The City had continued to leave the CRA/LA with the responsibility to fulfill the
17 redevelopment plan obligations.
18 6. After the CRA/LA's 2018 memorandum, the City changed its approach.
19 The City then drafted a transfer request resolution that presumed it could transfer selected
20 portions of the land use permitting power of redevelopment plans, while leaving in the
21 hands of the expiring CRA/LA the obligations under and pursuant to those plans, which
22 obligations exist for the health, safety and protection of the City's residents and
23 communities. Additionally, the City drafted a zoning code amendment that purported to
24 incorporate the redevelopment plan permit review process into the City's review process -
25 but included no zoning code provisions that carry over and implement the obligations to
26 implement the redevelopment plans for the benefit of their communities.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 7. In support of this transfer request resolution and zoning code amendment,
2 the City first claimed that the actions were exempt from the California Environmental
3 Quality Act ("CEQA"). However, as objections were raised to the proposed action, the
4 City also circulated a negative declaration as the environmental review document. The
5 City's actions at issue herein are not only project subject to CEQA, but substantial
6 evidence exists to support a fair argument that they will foreseeably result in direct and/or
7 indirect impacts to the environment, including as detailed in multiple objection letters filed
8 with the City. Accordingly, the City's use of both or either a notice of exemption and
9 negative declaration violated CEQA.
10 8. The City's actions purporting to selectively transfer the permit approval
OdV 'WAL MV1 NIELSH3ATIS 11 authority under the redevelopment plans, but not their corresponding obligations, is ultra POSI-LOLL J001 p.c 'anuary obuaJej quoN 12 vires, including under the Redevelopment Dissolution Law. In addition, because the
13 proposed actions will lead to foreseeable and unmitigated impacts on the environment, the
asadena, 14 City has failed to proceed in accordance with CEQA. Finally, the City's practice as
" 5 15 described more fully below of purporting to allow certain housing projects to obtain
16 residential unit densities that exceed the limits imposed pursuant to the adopted
17 redevelopment plans, which were adopted pursuant to and under the authority of state law,
18 is subject to declaratory and/or injunctive relief to end the City's unlawful practices.

3 18. In 2011, the Legislature and Governor approved ABx1 26 to dissolve

5 various "clean-up" provisions to clarify important questions raised by ABx1 26.
6| ("Redevelopment Dissolution Laws"). The Redevelopment Dissolution Laws were
7 enacted by the Legislature in part for the purpose of releasing an ever growing percentage
8 of property tax growth back to primary governmental entities such as cities, counties, and
9 school districts. The Legislature specified an orderly process for existing redevelopment
10 plans to be implemented until their expiration.
11 19.
POSI-LOLL North Marengo Avenue, 3'° Floor OdV 'WAI MYT NELSH3ATIS 3 SH Upon dissolution of all former redevelopment agencies in the state, the
12 Legislature transferred all assets, obligations, redevelopment plans, implementation plans,
8 13
Pasadena, and employees to successor agencies, which were generally the original governmental unit
14 that created the former redevelopment agency within its territory. Such successor agencies
15 were prohibited from engaging in new redevelopment activity, but were charged with
16 carrying out the existing legal obligations, redevelopment plans, and redevelopment
17 implementation plans until their normal expiration.
18 20. However, if the original governmental unit that created a former
19 redevelopment agency did not want to assume all of the assets, obligations, redevelopment
20 plans, redevelopment implementation plans, and employees of its former redevelopment
21 agency, it could give notice that it would not assume such responsibilities. If the original
22 governmental unit that created the former redevelopment agency refused to assume the
23 duties of the successor agency, the Legislature empowered the governor to appoint a
24 Designated Local Authority to assume the affairs of the former redevelopment agency as
25 its successor agency, carry out existing obligations, and fulfill obligations associated with
26 its existing redevelopment plan(s) until normal expiration.

land use related plans and functions of the former redevelopment agency are hereby

4 25.

5 The Legislature's plain language provides an all or nothing option. Until

6 the City issues a lawful request, "all land use related plans and functions" remain in the
successor agency, CRA/LA.
7 26.

8 The transfer of "all land use related plans and functions" is a not an a la carte

9 menu where the City may select the benefits for itself and real estate developers to transfer,

10 but other duties and obligations of those plans and functions are left behind in the about-to-

OdV 'WHI MVI NIELLSHRATIS 3HL Floor 11 27.
91101-150 12 On at least two occasions, the City Council entertained motions to request

S anuant obueley YIon SIZ 13 that the CRA/LA transfer all land use related plans and functions from the CRA/LA to the

Pasadena, 14 City. On June 29, 2012, Councilmembers introduced a motion that read in part: "I

15 FURTHER MOVE that the City Council request that all land use plans and functions of

16 the former redevelopment agency (CRA/LA) are hereby transferred to the City of Los

17 Angeles." An October 15, 2012 report of the Chief Administrative Officer acknowledged

18 that the transfer from the CRA/LA, if triggered by the City Council with a request for

19 transfer, would involve absorbing "responsibilities for the planning, land-use and zoning

20 activities then managed by the CRA/LA." The February 21, 2012 Planning Director's

21 report listed the various planning and discretionary approvals required of the former CRA

22 in order to grant increases in density, all of which is more than simply building permit

23 reviews. During the consideration of this motion and reports under Council Files 12-0014-
S4 and 12-0600-S75, the City Council contemplated hiring 11 new planners and GIS
24 Information Systems Supervisor at an annual cost of $1,048,674 to handle all the planning
25

26 activities, as well as building permit reviews required by the redevelopment plans.

27 Ultimately, on December 17, 2012, the City Council, upon recommendation of its Planning

28

- 9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

and Land Use Management Committee, took action to close the file without completing the

2 request for transfer.
3 28. On June 6, 2014, in Council File 13-1482-S1, City officials began

4 consideration of a new transfer request resolution and ordinance. This second transfer

5 request read: "The City of Los Angeles hereby requests from the CRA/LA that all land use

6 related plans, records, covenants and functions, including the Transfer of Floor Area

7 Rights (TFAR) documentation, of the CRA/LA immediately be transferred to the City of
8 Los Angeles, as authorized by State law." However, the resolution also contained

9 additional statements of certain planning and discretionary approval activities that the
10 CRA/LA performed as part of its redevelopment plans, which the City was unwilling to
11 perform. This version of the transfer request resolution was condemned, including by
SL-LOLL6 OdV 'WALd MVT J00L! ue 'anuary oBUeJEIN qUoN ROARSA A OS SH 12 Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles and Hollywood Heritage, as a clear indication of the

8 13 City's intent to seek the power over project permit approvals but to shirk from the
'euapesed 14 corresponding responsibilities to implement the redevelopment plans as the CRA/LA had
15 been doing. No further action occurred in Council File 13-1482-S1 thereafter.
16 29. After nearly two years of silence, on December 20, 2018, the Planning
17 Department returned to the City Planning Commission with the current proposal, as
18 challenged in this litigation. The staff report was blunt regarding the City's proposed
19 intent to only transfer building permit review processes of the CRA/LA, but to leave
20 behind all the associated planning required to implement the redevelopment plans for the
21 benefit of affected communities. It said: "The proposed resolution authorizes the transfer
22 of land use authority and would allow the City of Los Angeles to assume only the land use
23 authority vested in the redevelopment plans consistent with state law. All other functions
24 in the Redevelopment Plans that are not land use functions called out in the land use
25 sections ("Land Uses Permitted in the Project Area") of the Redevelopment Plans remain
26 with the CRA/LA-DLA and are not part of the transfer." The proposed transfer request
27 resolution, unlike the previous versions considered by the City, attempted to redefine the

protection and benefit.

Ã 15 (CEQA And CEQA Guidelines)

16 32. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

17 Paragraphs 1 through 30, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint.

18 Initially, the City caused a Notice of Exemption to be prepared for the

19 proposed City actions regarding the transfer request resolution and the zoning ordinance.

20 The City claimed these actions were not a project under CEQA Guidelines Section

21 15378(b)(5). Additionally, if it was a project under CEQA, the City claimed it qualified

22 for two exemptions under CEQA Guidelines Sections 8 15308 (Class 8 exemption) and

23 15320 (Class 20 exemption). The proposed actions are a project under CEQA, they do not

24 qualify for either the Class 8 or Class 20 categorical exemptions, and if somehow they did,

25 no exemption is proper because the proposed actions meet one or more of the exceptions
for categorical exemptions set forth in the CEQA Guidelines, inter alia, Section 15300.2.

4 instance, in both environmental documents, the City's Project Description failed to inform
5 the public of the portions of the CRA/LA land use plans and functions the City was not
6 proposing to transfer to itself. In the staff report, the City stated it would develop
7 procedures to monitor and enforce mitigation measures, but then none of that was included
8 in the transfer request resolution or the zoning code amendment. It also appears that wen
9 the Negative Declaration was circulated, the proposed transfer resolution and zoning
10 ordinance were not attached.

14 Notice of Exemption and a Notice of Determination were recorded by the City with the
#8 15 County Clerk on or about September 24, 2019.
16 36. By adopting the Notice of Exemption, the City prejudicially abused its
17 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, requiring this Court to issue
18 a writ of mandamus vacating and invalidating all Project approvals, including the transfer
19 request resolution and zoning code amendment, that rely on the illegal Notice of

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
19 (Illegal Pattern and Practice of Permitting Residential Unit Density Of Projects To
20 Exceed The Limits Imposed Under State Redevelopment Plans Within The City)
21 54. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
22 Paragraphs 1 through 53, inclusive, of this Petition and Complaint.
23 55. An actual and present controversy has arisen and now exists between
24 Petitioner, on the one hand, and the City, on the other, in that the City has demonstrated a
25 pattern and practice that constitutes an overarching, quasi-legislative policy of City
26 officials to utilize unlawful Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Guidelines and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

H Conditional Use Permit density bonus requests to evade and ignore applicable

2 redevelopment plan limits on residential unit density and floor area ratios.

3 56. On June 27, 2018, the CRA/LA issued a memorandum concluding that the

4 redevelopment plans within the City "are not superseded by Measure JJJ and the

5 implementing TOC Ordinance." The CRA/LA memorandum refers to a "TOC

6 Ordinance," while to clarify, the City Planning Director and City Planning Commission
7 have adopted TOC Guidelines, which purport to grant a set of incentives not authorized by

8 the voters in the text of Measure JJJ. The validity of these TOC Guidelines is currently
9 under challenge in the separate case of Fix the City v. City of Los Angeles (LASC Case
10 No. 19STCP03740). However, even if adopted as an ordinance, the City's TOC
OdV WAld MVT SILVERSTEI J001 p.E 'anusay obUeJeN qUoN SIZ 11 Guidelines, as correctly interpreted by the CRA/LA in its June 27, 2018 memorandum, do
SI-L0Ll6 VO 'euapesed 12 not override the residential unit density and floor area ratio limits contained in the
13 redevelopment plans.
14 57. On April 4, 2019, the City Planning Director issued a letter to the City Clerk

# 15 advising that all projects that had filed for approval as high density TOC projects that were
16 inconsistent with residential unit density or floor area ratio limits of redevelopment plans
17 were directed to convert their projects from TOC to Conditional Use Permit under Los
18 Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.24.U.26 as an alternative, City-created process to
19 evade the redevelopment plans. However, because both the TOC Guidelines and the
20 City's Conditional Use Permit for Density Increases above that authorized by the state
21 density bonus law are locally-created programs, they both are overridden or preempted by
22 the state-created redevelopment plans within the City.
23 58. Petitioner and other community organizations made oral and written
24 comments in opposition to the City's illegal use of the transfer request resolution and
25 related zoning code amendment as a prelude to reinterpretation of or effective amendment
26 of redevelopment plans in order to allow and approve densities improperly granted under
27 the TOC Guidelines. Petitioner and other community organizations also made oral and

2 written comments in opposition to the City's improper and illegal use of a Conditional Use

3 Permit Density Bonus increase to alternatively override the residential unit density and

4 floor area limits of redevelopment plans. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative

remedies.

5 59.

6 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to it in the
ordinary course of law to redress the claims alleged in this Petition. Petitioner and the
7 public generally will suffer irreparable harm if the City is not restrained from using one or
8

9 both of these unlawful methods to evade the lawful limits of the redevelopment plans.
