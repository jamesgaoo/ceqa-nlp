INTRODUCTION
20
1.
21 This action challenges the recent decision of California State

22 University ("CSU" or "Respondent") to authorize a substantial change to the

23 Parkside North Housing Project ("Project"), as described in the July 2019

24 Addendum to the Final Environmental Impact Report, Campus Master Plan,

25 Housing Expansion Phase I - Parkside North Housing Project ("EIR

26 Addendum"), without first preparing a subsequent or supplemental

27 environmental impact report ("EIR") as required under the California

28 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.

Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et
2 seq. (hereinafter, "CEQA § 21###" and "Guidelines § 15###"). Rather than
3 keeping the soil from this construction project on-site, as the EIR Addendum
4 promised, CSU decided to deposit massive quantities of soil on a neighboring
5 parcel, which is a sacred site to Petitioner Juaneño Band of Mission Indians,
6 Acjachemen Nation-Belardes ("JBMIAN-Belardes") and is listed on the
7 National Register of Historic Places. This change to the Project-which
8 basically turns a sacred site into a construction dump-adversely affects
9 historic, archaeological, and tribal cultural resources, as defined in CEQA.
10 CSU violated CEQA by failing to analyze these new impacts in a subsequent
11 or supplemental EIR. CEQA § 21166.

12 2. The Project as described in the EIR Addendum involved the
13 construction of new on-campus student housing at CSU Long Beach, including
14 demolition of an existing university-owned structure and construction of a
15 new, approximately 136,000 square foot, three- and four-story residential
16 building with 476 student beds. Nothing in the EIR Addendum suggested the
17 Project involved dumping construction soil onto a neighboring sacred site. To
18 the contrary, the EIR Addendum specifically stated that the Project would
19| involve no soil export and that the neighboring sacred site, called "Puvunga" or
20 | "Puvungna," would be "outside" the Project site and thus unaffected by it.
21 3. After approving the Project, however, CSU decided it would export
22 soil from the Project after all, and would dump it onto the Puvunga site. That
23 site is a historic Native American village, burial ground and sacred site that is
24 of great cultural and spiritual importance to the indigenous peoples of
25 Southern California, including JBMIAN-Belardes, and continues to be an
26 active site of Native American religious worship. The historical Puvunga
27 village site underlies the entire CSU Long Beach ("CSULB") campus, most of
28 which has since been developed. The remaining undeveloped portions of the
2

Case No.

1 Puvunga site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and
2 include the 22-acre parcel where Respondent is now dumping excavated soil
3 from the Project.

4 4. CSU also violated CEQA and abused its discretion by failing to
5 consult with JBMIAN-Belardes about the change to the Project and by failing
6 to take feasible steps to avoid impacts to Puvunga, a tribal cultural resource.

7 5. By approving this substantial change to the Project without
8 conducting a subsequent or supplemental EIR or consulting with all affected
9 Native American tribes, Respondent violated CEQA. See CEQA §§ 21166,
10 21080.3.1, 21084.3(a).

11 6. For all of these reasons, Respondent's post-approval decision to
12 export soil from the Project site and deposit it onto the Puvunga site
13 constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be overturned.

14 PARTIES

15 7. Petitioner Juaneño Band of Mission Indians, Acjachemen Nation-
16 Belardes ("JBMIAN-Belardes") is a Tribal Nation which inhabits the lands of
17 present-day Orange County as well as parts of Los Angeles, San Diego and
18 Riverside Counties and has done so for over a thousand years. The Nation has
19 a citizenship of approximately 1,900 members, and is governed by a Tribal
20 Council based in San Juan Capistrano, CA. JBMIAN-Belardes is recognized by
21 the State of California. The Puvunga village is a sacred site to the
22 Acjachemen/Juaneño people, and the Puvunga site is of great cultural and
23 spiritual importance to the members of JBMIAN-Belardes, some of whom
24 practice religious worship at the site.
25 8. Petitioner California Cultural Resources Preservation Alliance,
26 Inc. ("CCRPA"), is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation based in Irvine, CA that
27 seeks to protect and preserve cultural resources such as sacred sites,
28 archaeological sites, historical sites, resource gathering areas, cultural
3
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 landscapes, burial sites, and American Indian traditional places in California.
2 Puvungna is of specific interest and concern for CCRPA board members and
3 supporters for the following reasons: (1) It is estimated that 90 percent of
4 archaeological sites in southern California have been destroyed to make way
5 for development, particularly along the coast. (2) Puvungna provides an
6 example of these losses because the construction of the CSULB campus
7 destroyed most of the major residential, ceremonial and burial sites of this
8 spiritually and historically important coastal trade center. (3) Puvungna is the
9 last remaining 22 acres of this pre-contact archaeological site complex that not
10 only is of significant historic and scientific interest, but is the only site in the
11 state with a written account of oral testimony regarding its religious
12 significance as the place of the god Ouiot's prophet Chinigichngish. (4) As
13 indicated in the National Register of Historic Places, Puvungna is a repository
14 for important information regarding thousands of years of pre-contact history
15 and should be preserved for future non-destructive archaeological research
16 using remote sensing.

17 9. The interests that JBMIAN-Belardes and CCRPA (together,
18 "Petitioners") seek to further in this action are within the goals and purposes
19 of these organizations. Petitioners and their members have a direct and
20 beneficial interest in CSU's compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the
21 Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project,
22 which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition, and which would
23 cause substantial harm to tribal cultural resources. The maintenance and
24 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by
25 protecting the public from harms to a site listed on the National Register of
26 Historic Places and eligible for listing on the California Register of Historic
27 Resources, as alleged herein.
28

Case No.

1 10. Respondent California State University is a public university
2 system with its headquarters in Long Beach, California. CSU is responsible for
3 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA as applied to
4 university actions, including campus development initiatives such as the
5 Project. CSU is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code
6 section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental
7 review of proposed actions. CSU has a duty to comply with CEQA and state
8 law.

9 11. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of
10 Respondents fictitiously named DOES 1 through 10 and sue such respondents
11 by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on the basis of
12 such information and belief, allege the fictitiously named respondents are also
13 responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities
14 and capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will
15 amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such
16 identities and capacities.

17 12. Petitioners are unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in
18 Interest Does 11 through 20 and sues such real parties in interest by fictitious
19 names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information
20 and belief, allege that the fictitiously named real parties in interest are
21 directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When
22 the true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been
23 determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of the court if
24 necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 13. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the
27 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

28
5
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief Case No.

1 14. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087,
2 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Los
3 Angeles County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of
4 mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to make substantial changes to the
5 Project that deviate from the project described in the EIR Addendum without
6 preparing a subsequent or supplemental EIR, conducting consultation, or
7 adopting feasible measures to avoid tribal cultural resources.

8 15. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the
9 State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles pursuant to Code of
10 Civil Procedure section 394. Respondent's main offices are located in and the
11 activities authorized by Respondent have occurred and will continue to occur
12 in Los Angeles County.

13 16. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central District. Los
14 Angeles County Superior Court Local Rule 3.232 provides that
15 "[n]otwithstanding Local Rule 2.3, CEQA actions must be filed in the Central
16 District where they will be referred to Department 1, as master calendar, for
17 reassignment for all purposes, including any requests for a temporary
18 restraining order or preliminary injunction, to judges designated by the
19 Presiding Judge pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.1."
20 17. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to
21 filing the instant action. Petitioners objected as soon as they learned of
22 Respondent's unannounced change to the Project, which deviated from the
23 previously approved Project as described in the EIR Addendum. Petitioners
24 only became aware of the change in the Project on or about September 15-20,
25 2019.

26 18. Respondent has taken final agency action by beginning to export
27 soil from the Project site onto the Puvunga site. This action effectuates a
28 substantial change in the Project as originally approved. Respondent has a
6
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 duty to comply with applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA,
2 prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
3 Petitioners possess no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in
4 this action other than by means of this lawsuit.
19. On October 3, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources
6 Code section 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondent a letter stating
7 that Petitioners planned to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to
8 invalidate Respondent's approval of the change to the Project, i.e.,
9 Respondent's post-approval decision to export soil and dump it on the Puvunga
10 site. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.
11 20. On October 7, 2019, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources
12 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing
13 the Attorney General of the State of California with a copy of the Petition.
14 | Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and correct copy of the letter
15 transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.

16 21. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2),
17 Petitioners elect to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.
18 Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will file a notice of election to
19 prepare the administrative record.
20 22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the
21 course of ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate
22 to require Respondent to set aside its adoption of the EIR Addendum and
23 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's
24 unannounced change to the Project will remain in effect in violation of State
25 law, and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably harmed. No money
26 damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and their
27 members for that harm.

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 23. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding
3 paragraphs in their entirety.
4 I. History of the Parkside North Housing Project and CSU's CEQA Review
5
24.
6 The Parkside North Housing Project involves the construction of

7 new student housing at CSULB, including demolition of an existing

8 university-owned structure and construction of a new, approximately 136,000

9 square foot, three- and four-story residential building with 476 student beds,

10 as well as utility infrastructure improvements; and new lighting and

11 landscaping. The Project site is located on the CSULB campus in an area

12 immediately south of East Atherton Street and west of Earl Warren Drive.
25.
13 The EIR for the California State University, Long Beach Campus

14 Master Plan Update was certified by the Board of Trustees of CSU on May 13,

15 2008. The EIR Addendum for the Project was purportedly prepared to address

16 changes to proposed on-campus student housing since certification of the

17 CSULB Campus Master Plan Update EIR. On information and belief, the EIR

18 Addendum was certified on July 24, 2019.

26.
19 According to the EIR Addendum, the Project's characteristics are

20 similar to those proposed for the Parkside North Student Housing building in

21 the 2008 Campus Master Plan Update EIR, but involve "minor" changes to the

22 building design that CSU determined were not significant enough to warrant

23 preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR. (Notice of Determination at
1). There is no indication in the EIR Addendum or the 2008 Master Plan
24

25 Update EIR that dumping of construction excavation soil on the Puvunga site

26 was contemplated as part of the Project.

Case No.

1 II. Puvunga Is a Sacred Site of Cultural and Spiritual Importance for the JBMIAN-Belardes.
2
27.
3 In constructing the Project, Respondent has begun depositing

4 excavated soil on the Puvunga site (alternatively spelled "Puvungna"), a

5 historic Native American village, burial ground and sacred site that is of great

6 cultural and spiritual importance to the indigenous peoples of Southern

7 California, including JBMIAN-Belardes.

28.
8 Puvunga once covered an area of approximately 500 acres,

9 including all of CSULB's present-day campus. The village of Puvunga was

10 inhabited by Native American peoples including the Gabrielinos (or

11 Tongvans), Luisenos and Juaneños (also known as the Acagchemem or

12 Acjachemen Nation) from around 500 A.D. until the early 1800s. The history of

13 the Juaneño people at the Puvunga site has been passed down through the

14 tribe's oral history and was documented in the 1846 writings of Father

15 Geronimo Boscana, a priest at the Mission of San Juan Capistrano. Puvunga

16 is the spiritual center of the Chinigchinich religion, which is practiced by the

17 Juaneños, Gabrielinos, Luisenos and other Native American peoples of

18 Southern California. Under the Chinigchinich faith, Puvunga is regarded as a

19 deeply significant sacred place. Puvunga has been used by Native American

20 peoples for religious and spiritual ceremonies for hundreds of years, and

21 continues to be a site of active worship.

29.
22 The historical Puvunga village site underlies the entire CSULB

23 campus, most of which has since been developed. The remaining undeveloped

24 portions of the Puvunga site have been listed on the National Register of

25 Historic Places since 1974, and the boundaries of the registered site were

26 expanded in 1982. Archeological surveys and excavations in the 1970s found

27 archeological evidence of Puvunga's pre-colonial habitation by Native

28 Americans, including shell middens, artifacts and human remains.

9
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 30. The Puvunga site was nominated to the National Register because
2 it was the best preserved of the archaeological sites on the CSULB campus,
3 which is otherwise largely developed. The site was listed on the National
4 Register for its significant archeological value and potential for future
5 research (National Register Criterion D), and was also listed for its funerary

6 and religious significance. By virtue of its listing on the National Register, the
7 Puvunga site is also eligible for listing on the California Register of Historic
8 Resources, which uses identical criteria to the National Register. In addition,
the site is listed in the California Native American Heritage Commission
10 (NAHC) Sacred Lands File (SLF) for its significance as a Native American
11 burial and ceremonial site.

12 31. The two portions of the Puvunga site listed on the National
13 Register of Historic Places constitute a 22-acre parcel located to the south of
14 Los Cerritos drainage channel, east of Bellflower Boulevard, and west of Earl
15 Warren Drive. Most of the site is located north of Beach Drive, and is
16 designated as LAn-235 by the National Register of Historic Places, while a
17 smaller portion of the site is located south of Beach Drive and is designated as
18 LAn-234 by the National Register of Historic Places.
19 32. Respondent CSU is now using heavy construction equipment to
20 dump excavated soil from the Project on LAn-235, the northern part of the
21 Puvunga site listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
22 III. CSU's Dumping of Construction Soil on the Puvunga Site Will

23 Have Significant Adverse Impacts on Historic, Archaeological, and Tribal Cultural Resources.

24 33. Because of the Puvunga site's spiritual and cultural importance to
25 JBMIAN-Belardes, CSU's dumping on the site will adversely impact tribal
26 members. The dumping of large amounts of construction soil will interfere
27 with tribal members' religious practices, desecrating a sacred site, altering its
28 physical characteristics and interfering with its relatively intact and
10
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 undeveloped state, the very qualities that made the site eligible for listing on
2 the National Register of Historic Places.

3 34. Specifically, soil dumping on the Puvunga site is likely to
4 adversely affect the site's archeological, historical and tribal cultural
5 resources. Any ground disturbance can harm archeological deposits and
6 artifacts buried on a site, and the use of bulldozers and other heavy
7 construction equipment is likely to damage the underlying archaeological
8 resources. There is a lot more that could be learned from further study of the
9 archaeological remains that underlie the Puvunga site, but these remains are
10 highly fragile and must be kept intact and preserved until future studies of the
11 site can be done using non-destructive archaeological techniques. The
12 preservation of the Puvunga site is especially important because it is the only
13 intact portion of the campus that remains in an undeveloped state suitable for
14 archaeological study.
15 IV. Dumping Construction Soil on the Puvunga Site Was Not Part of

16 the Project as Described and Analyzed in the EIR Addendum.
35.
17 The EIR Addendum for the Project discusses the presence of

18 Native American archeological resources on the Project site, but does not

19 mention that, as part of the Project, CSU planned to dump excavated soil on

20 the federally-listed Puvunga sacred site located elsewhere on the campus. In

21 fact, the EIR Addendum states that the Puvunga site is outside the Project

22 site, and thus the Addendum does not analyze any potential Project impacts at

23 the Puvunga site.
36.
24 The EIR Addendum notes that the "Project would disturb greater

25 than 1 acre of soil" (Addendum at 65) and that "[s]oils would be removed" in

26 project excavation (Addendum at 53), but states that "In]o export of soil

27 material is anticipated." (Addendum at 53).

28
11
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 37. The EIR Addendum does not include the federally-listed, 22-acre
2 Puvunga site within the scope of the Project site, and makes no mention of soil
3 deposits there. All of the federally-listed Puvunga site lies outside of the
4 Project site as described in the EIR Addendum: the Puvunga site lies south of
5 the Los Cerritos drainage channel while the Project site lies to the north of the

6 channel.

7 38. The EIR Addendum also acknowledges that it does not address
8 "tribal cultural resources" under CEQA (Archaeological and Paleontological
9 Resources Assessment for the Housing Expansion Phase I - Parkside North
10 Project, page 5).
11 39. The 2008 Master Plan EIR noted that "[p]revious consultations
12 with the California Native American Heritage Commission resulted in
13 responses that a Burial Site, Reburial Site, Village Site, Worship/Ritual Site,
14 and Sacred/Power Area exist in the vicinity" of the CSULB campus. (EIR at
15 82).
16 V. CSU Substantially Changed the Project by Deciding to Export
17 Soil from the Project Site and Dump It on the Puvunga Site.

40.
18 Between September 15-20, 2019, Petitioners became aware that

19 there were bulldozers and other heavy equipment transporting soil from the

20 Project site to the Puvunga site and dumping the soil there.

41.
21 JBMIAN-Belardes immediately contacted CSU's Native American

22 Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) Committee (also known as

23 the Committee on Native American Burial Remains and Cultural Patrimony

24 or CNABRCP) to request a joint site visit.

42.
25 In response, on September 23, 2019, Petitioners received an e-mail

26 from Dhushy Sathianathan, Vice Provost, Academic Planning, stating in

27 relevant part: "Recently, following appropriate site analysis, earth removed

28 during construction of our nearby student-housing project has been placed on

12
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 a portion of the parcel. This method of managing surplus earth is preferred for
2 both financial and environmental considerations, and is consistent with
3 interest by some constituencies to keep excavated dirt from campus here on

4 site. The university has placed an additional monitor at the 22-acre parcel
5 during this process."

6 43. On September 24, 2019, the representatives of JBMIAN-Belardes

7 and CSU met to discuss the soil dumping. At the meeting, JBMIAN-Belardes
8 asked that CSU cease and desist from any further dumping activity at the
9 Puvunga site and initiate a consultation with JBMIAN-Belardes. The
10 following day, JBMIAN-Belardes sent a letter to CSU repeating this request.
11 44. On information and belief, despite the requests by JBMIAN-
12 Belardes and others, CSU continues to deposit construction soil and debris on
13 the Puvunga site.
14 VI. CSU Did Not Notify or Consult with JBMIAN-Belardes about

15 CSU's Decision to Dump Soil on the Puvunga Site.
45.
16 In 2015, following the adoption of CEQA § 21080.3.1, JBMIAN-

17 Belardes requested, in writing, to be notified by CSU of proposed projects on

18 the campus. JBMIAN-Belardes is a Native American Nation that is

19 traditionally and culturally affiliated with the geographic area of the Project.
46.
20 JBMIAN-Belardes did not receive notice from CSU of the Project,

21 the EIR Addendum, or CSU's subsequent decision to deposit construction soil

22 on the Puvunga site.

47.
23 On or about September 24, 2019, after discovering that CSU was

24 dumping Project construction soil on the Puvunga site, JBMIAN-Belardes met

25 with CSU officials to discuss the issue. At this meeting, JBMIAN-Belardes

26 objected to CSU's decision to undertake the soil dumping and to the fact that

27 CSU made the decision without prior consultation with JBMIAN-Belardes.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of CEQA

3 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; State & County CEQA

4 Guidelines)

48. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding
6 paragraphs in their entirety.

7 49. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to
8 cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with
9 the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement
10 to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR
11 must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decision makers
12 can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
13 proposed project.
14 50. Under CEQA, a lead agency must prepare a subsequent EIR if
15 there are substantial changes to the project after an initial EIR is certified and
16 these changes will require major revisions of that EIR "due to the involvement
17 of new significant environmental effects." Guidelines 15162(a)(1). A
18 subsequent EIR is also required if substantial changes to the circumstances in
19 which the Project is undertaken or new information indicates that the Project
20 will have significant impacts not previously disclosed. Guidelines 15162(a)(1)
21 If a subsequent EIR is necessary, it must "receive the same circulation and
22 review as the initial EIR." Guidelines §§ 15162, 15163.
23 51. Prior to circulating a subsequent EIR, a lead agency must comply
24 with the consultation obligations set forth in CEQA § 21080.3.1.
25 52. CEQA also mandates that public agencies shall, when feasible,
26 avoid damaging effects to any tribal cultural resource. CEQA § 21084.3(a). §
27 53. Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and
28 violated CEQA by adopting substantial changes to the Project that created
14
Verified Pet. for Writ of Mandate and Complt. for Inj. Relief
Case No.

1 new significant impacts without first preparing a subsequent or supplemental
2 EIR. Specifically, Respondent decided, after Project approval, to export soil
3 from the Project site and deposit it on the Puvunga site, a historical,
4 archaeological, and tribal cultural resource. As described above, this change in
5 the Project will have significant, adverse environmental effects.

6 54. Respondent also violated its consultation obligations under CEQA
7 section 21080.3.1. By failing to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR,
8 Respondent unlawfully avoided its obligation to consult with JBMIAN-
9 Belardes, among other Native American Tribes. JBMIAN-Belardes is a Native
10 American Tribe that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with the
11 | geographic area of the Project. JBMIAN-Belardes requested, in writing, to be
12 notified by CSU of proposed projects on the campus. JBMIAN-Belardes did not
13 receive notice of CSU's intention to deposit construction soil on the Puvunga
14 site.

15 55. Respondent violated the substantive mandate of CEQA
16 § 21084.3(a) by failing to avoid damage to the Puvunga site. For example,
17 Respondent could have stored the construction soil on a different property that
18 does not contain a historic site, which would have avoided damage to the
19 Puvunga site. CSU failed to adopt these measures or any other measures or
20 alternatives to dumping construction soil on the Puvunga site with heavy
21 construction equipment.
22 56. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents abused their
23 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law. As such,

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil a case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money
owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that
the case is complex. CASE TYPES AND EXAMPLES
