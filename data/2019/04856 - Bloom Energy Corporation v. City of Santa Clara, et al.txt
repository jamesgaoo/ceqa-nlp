1 Petitioner and Plaintiff Bloom Energy Corporation ("Petitioner") hereby petitions for a

2 writ of mandamus and brings a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief and for attorneys'

3 fees against Respondents and Defendants the City of Santa Clara ("City") and Silicon Valley
4 Power ("SVP," and collectively with City, "Respondents"), and alleges as follows.

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. On May 7, 2019, the Santa Clara City Council adopted Resolution No. 19-8701, A
7 Resolution Amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations to Require New or
8 Modified Self-Generation Facilities to Utilize Renewable Generation and Fuel Sources (the

9 "Resolution," attached hereto as Exhibit A). The Resolution requires that all of SVP's
10 customers seeking to modify or install a self-generation power source and remain connected to
11 SVP's electrical system (except for emergency backup power) must use only a "renewable
12 electrical generation facility," as defined under Section 25741 of the California Public Resources

13 Code.

14 2. The Resolution represents a significant shift in the way SVP customers can use and
15 manage onsite power generation. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
16 the Resolution effectively bars residents and businesses in Santa Clara from installing
17 Petitioner's fuel cells unless the fuel cells are powered by renewable fuels sourced solely from
18 within the State. It is infeasible, however, to satisfy this condition because renewable biogas
19 sourced solely from within the State is virtually non-existent as a reliable fuel source or
20 prohibitively expensive for a commercial user. Indeed, at present, there are only two
21 commercially operating biomethane developments connected to pipelines in California: CR&R
22 and Point Loma. Because of the high costs and long development timelines (2-5 years) to bring
23 these projects to market in California, the current supply of in-state is biogas is extremely limited.
24 a As a result, if a self-generating facility is even able to locate in-state biogas for its projects, the
25 prices are frequently 5-10 times greater than the cost of natural gas.

26 3. Moreover, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the supply and
27 cost of biomethane are further impacted by California's current regulatory environment. The
28 combination of California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the Federal Renewable Fuel

LATHAM&WATKINSw

(•

Standard provide significant incentives for biomethane suppliers to sell all biomethane (from in-

2 state or out-of-state) only for transportation uses, not for the generation of electricity. These

3 incentives are stackable; that is, biomethane products can benefit from both the Federal and State

4 incentives if that biomethane is used for transportation. The California Council on Science and

5 Technology provided an exhaustive analysis on these market influences and concluded:
6 "Financial incentives through the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and the

7 Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) programs can be a factor of up to 18 times greater
8 than the commodity value of the biomethane itself." (Emphasis added.) Current RFS prices

9 allow biogas developers to generate around $30/MMBtu for the credit value alone if they sell
10 their product in the transportation market. Selling the same biogas into the electricity market

11 would not generate an RFS credit, and the developer would thus forgo this lucrative incentive
12 (worth more than the biogas itself). This market distortion further exacerbates the biogas price

13 challenges, making it uneconomical for non-transportation end users, such as building owners

14 and operators looking to install non-combustion, electricity generating fuel cells, to source
15 California renewable gas for their projects.

16 4. As such, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that due to the

17 infeasibility of sourcing renewable natural gas in accordance with the Resolution's requirements,

18 the Resolution causes environmental impacts by increasing electricity generation from traditional
19 gas-fired power plants to make up for the loss of electricity generation from fuel cells.

20 5. Fuel cells have been recognized by the US Department of Energy as "the most energy
21 efficient device[] for extracting power from fuels." Fuel cells support California's alternative

22 clean energy strategies under the California Public Utilities Commission's Net Energy Metering

23 program and the California Air Resources Board's Distributed Generation Certification Program.

24 In addition to providing reliable electricity, fuel cells reduce air quality emissions, health
25 impacts, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage compared to gas-fired power plants, such as

26

27 California Council on Science and Technology, Biomethane in California Common Carrier Pipelines: Assessing Heating Value and Maximum Siloxane Specifications, An Independent
28 Review of Scientific and Technical Information (June 2018), p. 79, https://ccst.us/publications/ º12018/2018biomethane.pdf.

the three power plants to which Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, are
2 owned and operated by SVP. In addition, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon
3 alleges, that fuel cells provide a level of resiliency against wildfires, earthquakes and other
4 weather related events that cannot be provided by power supplied by the grid.

5 6. Substantial evidence in the record demonstrates that the Resolution may cause significant

6 impacts on the environment. Ramboll, a leading environmental consulting firm, evaluated the

7 potential environmental impacts of the Resolution and determined it likely will increase

8 greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and
9 particulate matter. There is well-established connection between increases in criteria pollutants
10 and human health impacts. In addition, two of the three power plants owned by SVP are located
11 in State-designated "disadvantaged" communities and the third power plant is located near a
12 residential area, increasing the risk of adverse impacts on sensitive receptors. Ramboll also
13 determined that the Resolution will increase water usage and ambient noise levels, while
14 eliminating numerous environmental benefits associated with fuel cells. Similar environmental
15 concerns were raised by stakeholders in comment letters to Respondents and by members of the
16 public at the City's hearing on May 7, 2019.

17 7. Respondents acknowledged the dispute over the Resolution's environmental impacts,
18 both in informal letters from City staff and at the public hearing. Indeed, at the May 7, 2019,
19 hearing, the Assistant City Manager and Acting Electric Utility Director stated:

20 We do disagree with some of the elements in the communication you received. We disagree that required renewable energy will
21 increase gas emissions and worsen air quality. We think having renewable energy that is GHG free would actually do the opposite.
22 It will make better air quality. We're not fully aligning with their analysis, and that's okay. You know, experts can differ on
23 analysis when it comes to that for a number of reasons; one is that Bloom Energy is comparing their fuel cells just to our gas 24 generation facility.

25 In addition, in a letter dated April 30, 2019, in response to concerns from the Silicon Valley
26 Leadership Group, City staff stated without citing to technical evidence that "we disagree that
27 limiting [fuel cells] in Santa Clara "will likely increase its carbon emission and will certainly
28 worsen air quality.

1 8. Despite being aware of ample evidence that the Resolution may cause significant effects

2 on the environment, Respondents never completed a substantive environmental review under the
3 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") for public consideration. Instead, Respondents

4 simply claimed, with scant evidentiary support, that the Resolution falls within the CEQA
5 Guidelines? section 15061, subdivision (b)(3), "common sense" exemption.

6 9. Respondents erred because the common sense exemption does not apply if there is even a

7 slight showing of a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. Respondents

8 were required to demonstrate "with certainty that there is no possibility that the [Resolution] may
have a significant effect on the environment." (Guidelines §15061, subd. (b)(3), emphasis
10 added.) Respondents have not met this very high burden.

11 10. Ramboll's technical report and public comments provide substantial evidence that the
12 Resolution may cause significant effects on the environment. Respondents have repeatedly
13 recognized that an evidentiary dispute exists over the Resolution's environmental impacts, which
14 renders the City's use of the common sense exemption flatly unlawful. CEQA requires an
15 Environmental Impact Report for exactly this reason--to allow the decision-makers to make
16 informed decisions about the environmental consequences of a proposed project and to ensure
17 that the public is fairly informed of the environmental effects of a proposed project.

18 11. By refusing to perform any environmental review, Respondents have defeated the core

19 purpose of CEQA, which is to protect the health and well-being of the environment and inform
20 the public of environmental impacts. By not following CEQA's procedural requirements,
21 Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law. Respondents' passage of the

22 Resolution must be rescinded and Respondents must be compelled to comply with CEQA.

23 THE PARTIES

24 12. Petitioner and Plaintiff Bloom Energy Corporation is, and at all times relevant hereto
25 was, a Delaware corporation that develops and manufactures fuel cells. Petitioner's principal

26

27 2 CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Resources Code § 21083.) These
28 guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, sections 15000, et seq. ("Guidelines") and are binding on all state and local agencies, including Respondents.

1 place of business is located in San Jose, California.

2 13. Respondent and Defendant City of Santa Clara is, and at all times relevant hereto was, a

3 municipal corporation and charter city organized and existing under the laws of the State of
California.

14. Respondent and Defendant Silicon Valley Power is a municipal electric utility that is

6 wholly owned by the City. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that SVP
7 owns and operates three natural gas power plants within the City.

8 15. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual, corporate,

0 associate or otherwise, of Respondents and Defendants Does through 10, and therefore sues
10 said Respondents and Defendants under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition and
11 complaint to show their true names and capacities when and if the same has been ascertained.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
14 sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5. In addition,
15 the Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

16 1060.

17 17. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, in that
18 Respondents are located within the County of Santa Clara.

19 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

20 18. The California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code
21 sections 21000, et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality environment
22 for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." (Pub.
23 Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).)

24 19. In CEQA, the California Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve this
25 overall purpose, principally the environmental impact report (*EIR"). The EIR is the very heart

26 of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9
27 Cal.App.4th 644, 652, disapproved of on other grounds by Western States Petroleum. Assn. V.
28 Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559.) CEQA's procedures, including the EIR, provide both for

-

2 the determination and full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the environment

3 of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and require a

4 description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation measures to

5 lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.)
20. CEQA has two primary goals. First, CEQA is intended to allow decision makers and the
6 public to understand the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (Guidelines

7

8 § 15002, subd. (a)(1); Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

9 "[The EIR's] purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental
consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR "protects not only the
10 environment but also informed self-government. (Ibid.) The EIR has been described as "an
11 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public and its responsible officials to
12 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Mountain
13 Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1053.)

14 21. Second, CEQA requires that public entities avoid or reduce environmental impacts when
15 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation
16 measures. (Guidelines 15002, subds. (a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52

17

18 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR provides agencies and the public with information about the

19 environmental impacts of a proposed project and identifies "ways that environmental damage

20 can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002, subd. (a)(2).)
22. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA imposes clear substantive
21 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies

22

23 refrain from approving projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation
measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, subd.
24 (b).)

25 23. The alternatives analysis is the "core of an EIR.3 (Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra,
26 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The purpose of CEQA alternatives analysis is to identify and analyze

27 alternatives to a project that will avoid or substantially lessen its significant environmental
28 impacts. (Pub. Resources Code § 21002.) Thus, "before conducting CEQA review, agencies

LATHAM+WATKINSu
ATTORNEYS
LOS ANGELES 7 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Attachment, Page 10

must not 'take any action' that significantly furthers project 'in a manner that forecloses
2 alternatives or mitigation measures that would ordinarily be part of CEQA review of that public

3 project.™ (Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 138; see also Guidelines

4 § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)

5 24. "Environmental review derives its vitality from public participation." (Ocean View

6 Estates Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Montecito Water Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 396, 400.)
7 "The requirement of public review has been called "the strongest assurance of the adequacy of
8 [environmental review under CEQA]." (Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com. (1989)
9 214 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1051.) Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of
10 CEQA or to carry out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's
11 is impacts is developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that
12  requires invalidation of the public agency action, regardless of whether full compliance would
13 have produced a different result. (Pub. Resources Code § 21005.)

14 Exemptions to CEQA

15 25. Although CEQA provides some exemptions for certain projects (see, e.g., Pub. Resources
16 Code 21080, subd. (b), 21080.01 et seq.), exemptions are narrowly construed and may not be
17 expanded beyond the scope of their statutory language. (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish &
18 Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.)

19 26. One CEQA exemption, known as the "common sense" exemption, narrowly applies
20 "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may
21 have a significant effect on the environment." (Guidelines 15061, subd. (b)(3), emphasis

22 added.)

23 27. The lead agency "has the burden of establishing the commonsense exemption, i.e., that
24 there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts." (Cal. Farm

25 Bur. Federation v. Cal. Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 195, emphasis in
26 original.)

27 28. Unlike other exemptions, the common sense exemption does not provide an implied
28 finding that the project will not have a significant environmental impact. (Davidon Homes v.

LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES 8 AND COMPLAINT

Attachment, Page 11

City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 116.) Instead, the "exemption requires the agency
2 to be certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental
3| impacts." (Ibid. at 117.)

4 29. A party challenging the applicability of the common sense exemption "need only make a

5 'slight' showing of a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact." (Cal. Farm

6 Bur. Federation, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at 195; Davidon Homes, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117.)
"If legitimate questions can be raised about whether the project might have significant impact

8 and is there is any dispute about the possibility of such an impact, the agency cannot find with
certainty that a project is exempt." (Davidon Homes, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117) Therefore,

10 "if a reasonable argument is made to suggest a possibility that a project will cause a significant
11 environmental impact, the agency must refute that claim to a certainty before finding that the
12 exemption applies." (Ibid. at 118, emphasis in original; Rominger v. County of Colusa (2014)

13 229 Cal.App. 4th 690, 704 ["For the commonsense exemption to apply, the county would have to
14 show as a factual matter, based on the evidence in the record, that there is no possibility that the
15 approval of the Adams subdivision may result in a significant effect on the environment . . . .".)
16 Thus, even the possibility of a significant environmental effect necessitates conducting an initial
17 environmental study, and a notice of exemption is improper. (See Myers v. Bd. of Supervisors
18 (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 413, 427.)

19 30. In addition, even to the extent a public entity can establish the applicability of an
20 exemption, such as the common sense exemption here, CEQA a defines a number of exceptions to
21 the exemptions, which, if applicable, require the lead agency to conduct further environmental
22 review. (Pub. Resources Code § 21084; Guidelines § 15300.2.)

23 31. One such exception, known as the unusual circumstances exemption, is provided by
24 Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), which states that an "exemption shall not be used

25 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant
26 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.3

27 32. Courts review a public agency's factual determination that a project presents unusual
28 circumstances under the substantial evidence standard. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of

LATHAM&WATKINS«
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
ANGELES 9 AND COMPLAINT

Attachment, Page 12

Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1114.) However, an agency's determination of whether
2 significant environmental impacts result from an unusual circumstance is reviewed under the less
3 deferential fair argument standard. (Ibid. at 1115.)

4 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

5 Electric Generation and Fuel Cells

6 33. Prior to passage of the Resolution, SVP's customers had the ability to install a wide
7 variety of electric generation systems on their properties, including fuel cells, and still remain

8 connected to SVP's electrical distribution system. (Report to Council Re File # 19-329 (the
"Staff Report"), attached hereto as Exhibit B, at 64.)

10 34. Typical customer-owned self-generation systems include "technologies such as solar
11 photovoltaics, internal combustion driven emergency back-up generators, fuel cells, steam
12 generators, and gas turbines. learly all types of self-generation resources currently in use, other
13 than solar systems, use fossil-fuels such as diesel or natural gas." (Ibid.)

14 35. The US Department of Energy has recognized that fuel cells "are the most energy
15 efficient devices for extracting power from fuels." (May 6, 2019, Ramboll Analysis on the
16 Potential Environmental Impacts Related to the City of Santa Clara's Proposed Resolution,

17 attached to Letter from Latham & Watkins LLP to the City, attached hereto as Exhibit C, at 90.)

18 36. Fuel cells advance California's distributed energy strategies as recognized by the
19 California Public Utilities Commission, through the Net Energy Metering program, and by the
20 California Air Resources Board, through the Distributed Generation Certification Program.
21 (Exhibit C, at 74.)

22 37. Moreover, fuel cells can be used for power in remote locations, distributed power
23 generation, cogeneration (in which excess heat released during electricity generation is used for
24 other applications) and backup power when the grid has failed during emergencies or other
25 outages at critical facilities, such as emergency centers, universities, housing developments, and

26 other public facilities. (Exhibit C, at 74, 90.)

27 38. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that fuel cells present a number
28 of advantages as compared to traditional thermoelectric power generation plants, such as those

-

2 operated by SVP. Fuel cells do not use combustion. Therefore, fuel cells generate substantially

3 fewer pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, as compared to

4 natural gas-fired power plants. In addition, fuel cells lack moving parts. As such, fuel cells are a
relatively quiet form of energy generation. Fuel cells require minimal water upon start-up (about
5 250 gallons) and then require no ongoing water use, resulting in virtually no impact on local

6

7 water supplies. Finally, fuel cells can reduce the use of natural gas and the need for diesel
generators. (Exhibit C, at 74.)

8

9 39. In addition to the environmental benefits, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon
alleges, that fuel cells are more resilient than other forms of energy generation and can continue
10 to provide power during wildfires, earthquakes and other weather-related events. (April 26,
11 2019, Bloom Energy email to City Council, attached hereto as Exhibit E, at 100.)

12 Proposed Resolution

13 40. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on May 2, 2019, the City
14 posted the agenda for the City Council's May 7, 2019, public meeting, which included Item 6 to
15 allow the City Council to take action on the Resolution.

16 41. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Staff Report to the City
17 Council recommending approval of the Resolution was made available to the public on or about
18 May 2, 2019. (Exhibit B.)

19 42. The Staff Report includes four alternatives:

20 1. Adopt a Resolution amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and

21 Regulations to require that new or modified customer-owned self-generation units utilize only CEC approved renewable

22 generation and fuel sources, providing definition of renewable electric generation facility, and requiring customers to provide

23 proof of eligible certification through the California Energy Commission's certification process for self-generation other than

24 solar photovoltaic.

25 2. Do not adopt a Resolution amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations to require that new or modified

26 customer-owned self-generation units utilize only CEC approved renewable generation and fuel sources, providing definition of

27 renewable electric generation facility, and requiring customers to provide proof of eligible certification through the California

28 Energy Commission's certification process for self-generation other than solar photovoltaic.

6 43. The Staff Report recommended the adoption of the Resolution, through Alternatives 1

7 and 3, so "that customers that wish to install self-generation resources (other than emergency

8 backup generation) and remain connected to the SVP electrical system be required to use a

9 'renewable electrical generation facility' as defined in California Code, Public Resources Code
Section 25741.»3 (Exhibit B, at 65.)

10 44. The Staff Report found that the Resolution is "exempt from the California Environmental
11 Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) as the activity is
12 covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for
13 causing a significant effect on the environment. Where it can be seen with certainty that there is

14 no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the
15 activity is not subject is to CEQA." (Exhibit B, at 67.)

16 Extensive Public Opposition

17

18 45. Despite the fact that the text of the Resolution was only available to the public from
May 2 to May 7, 2019, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents
19 received extensive public comments opposing the adoption of the Resolution due to the potential
20 for significant environmental impacts.

21

22 46. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that, before the City Council

23 considered the Resolution, the City received comments letters opposing the Resolution,

24 including correspondences from Petitioner (including the May 6, 2019, technical analysis of the

25 Resolution that was conducted by Ramboll), James "Jim" Sweeney (Stanford Professor of

26 3 "Renewable electrical generation facilities" include "biomass, solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, fuel cells using renewable fuels, small hydroelectric generation of 30 27 megawatts or less, digester gas, municipal solid waste conversion, landfill gas, ocean wave, ocean thermal, or tidal current, and any additions or enhancements to the facility using that 28 technology" and must meet certain locational requirements.

6 the public comment period at the City's hearing. Collectively, these public comments
7 constituted substantial record evidence regarding the Resolution's potentially significant
8 environmental impacts.

9 The Resolution Will Cause Significant Environmental Impacts

10 47. On the basis of Bloom Energy's and Ramboll's comments, and other public comments
11 submitted to Respondents, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the
12 Resolution, which effectively precludes the installation of fuel cells and other clean-running self-

13 generation sources, will cause a shift in energy production to power generation facilities that are
14 not powered by renewable or clean fuel sources, including SVP's natural gas-fired power plants:
15 Donald Von Raesfeld Plant, Santa Clara Cogeneration Plant, and Gianera Plant. Moreover, it is
16  infeasible for fuel cells to be powered entirely by renewable fuels, as the Resolution requires,

17 because renewable biogas sourced from within State is virtually non-existent as a reliable fuel

18 source or prohibitively expensive for a commercial user. (Exhibit A, at 28-30; Exhibit F, at
19 102-03.)

20 48. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that California has limited the
21 definition of renewable biogas to in-state biogas and California has incentivized the use of biogas

22 for vehicles and transportation, as discussed in Professor Sweeney's comment letter to the City.

23 (Exhibit F, at 103.)

23 52. Thus, Petitioner's fuel cells have emissions that are 31 to 100 percent lower than the
24 Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant's emissions. Petitioner is informed and is believes, and thereon
25 alleges, that this is particularly noteworthy for NOx emissions, as Santa Clara County has been
26 designated a "nonattainment area" for ozone, as defined by the California Air Resources Board,

27 and NOx reductions are critical to bringing the county back into compliance. (Exhibit C, at 81.)

53. In addition, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that there is a

2 well-established connection between increases in criteria pollutant emissions and health impacts

3 on humans. For example, localized exposure to NOx causes respiratory impacts to humans (e.g.,

4 decreased lung function, increased inflammation, asthma development) and cardiovascular
5 impairment (e.g., congestive heart failure). (See Exhibit C, at 81.)

6 54. As reflected in Figure 1 below, which was prepared by Ramboll as part of its
7 environmental analysis submitted to the City Council, two of the three natural gas power
8 plants-Donald Von Raesfeld Plant and Santa Clara Cogeneration Plant--are located within
9 communities designated as "disadvantaged" by Senate Bill (SB) 535. Moreover, the third plant,
10 Gianera Plant, is located adjacent to a residential area. The location of SVP's power plants
11 means that increased power plant reliance will disproportionately impact the health of
12 individuals in disadvantaged communities and sensitive receptors in residential areas.

16 55. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that because the Resolution is
17 likely to shift power generation from lower-emitting sources such as fuel cells to higher emitting

18 sources such as SVP's natural gas-fired power plants, the Resolution is likely to have a
19 significant environmental impact on air quality and the health of the City's residents.

23 Greenhouse Gases

24 57. Fuel cell usage also results in lower greenhouse gas emissions on a per MWh basis.
58. For example, as shown in Table 2, Ramboll's comparison of Petitioner's fuel cells to
25 SVP's Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant reflects a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
26 emissions with respect to Petitioner's fuel cells. (See Exhibit C, at 82.)

17 Hydrology/Water Quality

18 61. Thermoelectric power generation requires significant amounts of water for cooling.

1 impacts on local hydrology and water quality due to the increase in water usage associated with
2 traditional natural gas-fired power plants. (Exhibit C, at 82-83.)

3 66. Respondents did not evaluate or disclose to the public these significant environmental
4 impacts before adopting the Resolution as required by CEQA.

5 Noise

6 67. Traditional natural gas-fired power plants produce noise from equipment such as
7 air-cooled condensers, cooling towers, and turbines/generators.

8 68. Fuel cells, on the other hand, have no moving components and operate extremely quietly.

9 69. Thus, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that by shifting generation
10 from fuel cells to traditional power plants, there will also be an associated increase in noise
11 levels in Santa Clara, which will disproportionately impact individuals in disadvantaged
12 communities and sensitive receptors in residential areas. This is particularly true of the Gianera
13 Plant, which is located near a residential neighborhood containing sensitive receptors.
14 (Exhibit C, at 83.)

15 70. Respondents did not evaluate or disclose to the public these significant environmental

16 impacts before adopting the Resolution as required by CEQA.

17 Land Use

18 71. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the aforementioned
19 environmental impacts, including, but not limited to, increased water usage and noise levels, may
20 conflict with the City's General Plan, which poses an additional significant environmental
21 impact.

22 Respondents did not Properly Consider Evidence of Possible Environmental Impacts

23 72. Although City staff provided insubstantial responses to some of the comment letters
24 Respondents received on the Resolution, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
25 that the City did not disclose to the public a technical environmental analysis of the Resolution or
26 the Resolution's potential environmental impacts as required by CEQA.
27 73. Similarly, at the May 7, 2019, City Council meeting, City staff attempted to dispute
28 various public comments about the environmental impacts associated with the Resolution.

- However, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City relied on the
2 opinions of SVP staff members and gave little or no weight to the expert analysis submitted by

3

4 Ramboll, subject matter experts from Stanford University and Santa Clara University and other
members of the public.

5

6 74. For example, at the May 7, 2019, City Council meeting, despite significant evidence in
the record that the Resolution would cause environmental impacts, Respondents relied on the
7 opinion of its Assistant City Manager and "Acting" Chief Utility Electric Officer, who, in
8 response to the Ramboll report, stated:

9

=3 We do disagree with some of the elements in the communication
you received. We disagree that required renewable energy will

12 increase gas emissions and worsen air quality. We think having renewable energy that is GHG free would actually do the opposite.

13 It will make better air quality. We're not fully aligning with their analysis, and that's okay. You know, experts can differ on

14 analysis when it comes to that for a number of reasons; one is
that Bloom Energy is comparing their fuel cells just to our gas generation facility.

15 However, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that, in approving the
16 Resolution, Respondents ignored that the elimination of fuel cell use will result in an increase of
17 emissions from traditional power plants that can result in significant environmental impacts.

18 75. At the May 7, 2019, City Council meeting, City staff attempted to dispute various public
19 comments about the environmental impacts associated with the Resolution during a presentation

20

21 to City Council. However, the public was not given a copy of staff's presentation in advance and
was not given an opportunity to respond to staff's comments (which followed the public
22 comment period).

23

24 Passage of the Resolution

25 76. Notwithstanding the significant and compelling evidence before the City Council that the

26 Resolution would cause environmental impacts, and despite the complete lack of "certainty"
over whether "there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on
27 the environment," at the May 7, 2019, City Council meeting, the City Council relied on the
28 common sense exemption when adopting the Resolution. (See Exhibit B, at 67.)

F 77. The Resolution significantly modified SVP's Rules and Regulations in two significant

2 ways:

3 a. Section 11.A of the Rules and Regulations was amended to include the
7 10 .0 requirement that:
Only generating facilities that qualify as renewable electric generation facilities, as defined in these Rules and Regulations, will be connected for Parallel Generation with Silicon Valley Power's Distribution System.
(Exhibit A, at 55.)

8 b. Section 11.A.1(i) of the Rules and Regulations was added, and states:

9 Only generating facilities that qualify as renewable electric generation facilities, as defined in these Rules and Regulations, will be connected for 10 Parallel Generation. With the exception of solar photovoltaic systems,
11 which are considered inherently renewable, Customers will be required to provide proof of eligible certification that the facility is a qualifying 12 renewable electric generation facility from the California Energy Commission prior to interconnection and upon request from Silicon 13 Valley Power. All precertification and certification must be completed through the California Energy Commission's online application process 14 found on the Commission's website. Customers will provide an annual
15 attestation demonstrating continued compliance with the California
Energy Commission's renewable certification status or documentation
16 from a CEC approved reporting entity.

17 (Exhibit A, at 56.)

18 78. Due to the new restrictions of the Resolution, SVP's customers will not be permitted to
19 install many self-generation systems, including Petitioner's fuel cells, which run on extremely

20 clean non-combustion (but nonrenewable) fuels while maintaining their connection to SVP's
21 electrical system.

22 79. Despite the substantial volume of evidence presented to Respondents regarding the
23| Resolution's significant environmental impacts, Respondents refused to perform any
24 environmental analysis pursuant to CEQA and passed the Resolution without any environmental
25 review and no public disclosure of the Resolution's environmental impacts.

26 80. Rather, on May 8, 2019, the City filed a Notice of Exemption, stating that "[t]he
27 amendments to Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations [are] subject to Section

28 15061(b)(3) as the activity is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only to projects

1 which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment." (Notice of

2 Exemption, attached hereto as Exhibit D.) The City further concluded that "[a]mendments to

3 the agency rules and regulations do not have the possibility of having a significant effect on the
4 environment, therefore, the code amendments are not subject to CEQA in accordance with

5 Section 15061(b)(3)." (Ibid.)

6 81. As explained, however, the Notice of Exemption, based on the common sense exemption,

7 is improper. Respondents have not demonstrated with certainty that there is no possibility that

8 the Resolution may cause a significant effect on the environment. To the contrary, the record

9 provides ample evidence that the Resolution may cause significant environmental impacts and
10 Respondents have acknowledged that an evidentiary dispute exists over the Resolution's
11 environmental impacts.

12 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies and Inadequate Remedies at Law

13 82. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies as required by Public
14 Resources Code section 21177. In particular, Petitioner, through its counsel, sent a letter to the
15 City on May 6, 2019, which included a technical report from Ramboll, demonstrating that the
16 Resolution would cause significant environmental impacts and that a CEQA exemption was
17 inappropriate.

18 83. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seeks a writ of
19 mandate from this Court.

20 84. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5

21 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to Respondents, a copy of which is
22 attached hereto as Exhibit H.

23 85. Petitioner will comply with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing copy of

(Against All Respondents and Defendants)

5 87. Petitioner incorporates herein and realleges the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 86,
inclusive, as if fully set forth herein.
88. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and
7 Respondents, concerning whether Respondents' environmental determination complies with

8

9

10 Public Resources Code sections 21002, 21002.1, and 21084 regarding the requirements for

11 conducting environmental review, and determining that a project is exempt from CEQA.

12 89. Respondents improperly exempted the Resolution from CEQA pursuant to Guidelines
section 15061, subdivision (b)(3), the common sense exemption. (See Exhibit D.)

13 90. The common sense exemption only applies "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that
there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the
14 environment." (Guidelines § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)
15 91. A party, such as Petitioner, challenging the applicability of the common sense exemption
16 "need only make a 'slight' showing of a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental
17 impact." (Cal. Farm Bur. Federation, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at 195.) It is the Respondents'
18 burden to establish the applicability of the common sense exemption, i.e., "that there is no
19 possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts." (Ibid.)
20

22 92. Here, at minimum, the Resolution presents a reasonable possibility of significant
21 environmental impacts. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the

23

24 Resolution will cause a shift in power generation from fuel cells to SVP's traditional natural gas-
fired power plants. As a result of this shift in the composition of electric generation, there will

26 be significant environmental impacts, including increased pollutants such as CO, NOx, and SOx;
25 increased greenhouse gas emissions; impacts to hydrology and water quality; increased noise;

27 and impacts on the City's general plan.
93. Respondents' scant evidence to date does not establish with a certainty that there is no
28 possibility the Resolution may cause significant environmental impacts.

1 94. Respondents did not evaluate or disclose to the public these significant environmental

2 impacts before adopting the Resolution as required by CEQA.

3 95. In sum, Respondents improperly relied on the common sense exemption to CEQA in

4 deciding to forego any environmental review of the Resolution. Respondents, therefore, violated
5 CEQA by failing to perform any environmental review prior to the passage of the Resolution.

6 96. Additionally, even if the common sense exemption applied, an exception to the
7 exemption would preclude using it here, meaning that Respondents must perform environmental

8 review of the Resolution. Specifically, Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), applies,

9 which states that an "exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable
10 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual

11 circumstances."

12 97. Here, unusual circumstances generate significant environmental impacts. In particular,
13 is the Gianera Plant is located near a residential community and SVP's two remaining power plants
14 are located within disadvantaged communities. Thus, the increased pollutants and noise caused

15 by greater reliance on SVP's traditional power plants will be borne by the sensitive receptors in
16 these residential and disadvantaged communities.

17 98. In violation of Public Resources Code sections 21002 and 21002.1, Respondents failed to
18 conduct sufficient environmental review, review the factual record, identify significant
19 environmental impacts, or mitigate for significant environmental impacts. As such, Respondents
20 have failed to establish the applicability of the common sense exemption and/or the
21 inapplicability of the unusual circumstance exception to the exemption. Therefore, Respondents
22 violated CEQA by failing to perform any environmental analysis of the Resolution.

23 99. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court set aside the Resolution, the Notice of
24 Exemption, and the CEQA determination that the Resolution is exempt from CEQA as contrary
25 to law, and remand the matter to Respondents to conduct the requisite environmental review.
26 100. Reversing and remanding the environmental determination is necessary and
27 appropriate at this time and under these circumstances.

Action on the Adoption of a Resolution Amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations to Require New or Modified Self-Generation Facilities to Utilize Renewable Generation and Fuel
Sources

BACKGROUND
Over the last few years, the City and State have developed significant goals related to environmental sustainability and climate change. Climate change is a significant global issue and California has
taken nationwide leadership role in leading change. As the timeframe for significant change narrows before irreparable damage is done, California has recently passed SB100 which envisions a California with GHG free energy supply by 2045. The largest source of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities is from electricity, heat, and transportation.

The City of Santa Clara, with ownership of Silicon Valley Power (the only full service, vertically
integrated publicly owned power utility in the valley owning generation, transmission and distribution assets), has the opportunity and responsibility to lead in this area and advance our local climate action plan goals. As described later in this report, the City has taken ownership of the future and
has made a commitment to renewable and GHG free energy. In fact, the proposed action is aligned to other California cities like the cities of Pasadena and Burbank which have each adopted similar requirements which are already in place -- which is indicative of cities trying to advance our mutual goal of advancing renewable energy policy.
The CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, expressed it best in his San Jose Mercury News Editorial in enthusiastic support of SB100 - "committing to 100 clean energy future is unleashing a

surge of innovation and investment, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs, improving our health,
taking an important step toward meeting the carbon emissions reductions needed to meet our commitment to fighting climate change." and "Californians know that the calamitous consequences of climate change are upon us - and that it would be folly not to do whatever we can to keep those consequences from becoming worse."
Many of the Climate Action Plan actions affect Silicon Valley Power, and the City has proactively moved forward in modifying the way we provide power to our customers to achieve many of the goals below:

Climate Action Plan
On December 3, 2013, City Council adopted the Santa Clara Climate Action Plan (CAP) which proposed to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions to 15% below 2008 levels by the year 2020. The CAP included reduction measures to address energy use, transportation, land use, water, solid waste, and off-road equipment.

California Policy
On October 7. 2015, Senate Bill 350: Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act (SB 350) was signed
into law, establishing new clean energy, clean air and greenhouse gas reduction goals through 2030 and beyond. SB 350 established California's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels. To achieve this goal, SB 350 sets ambitious 2030 targets for energy efficiency and renewable electricity, among other actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions across the
energy and transportation sectors. SB 350 will greatly enhance the state's ability to meet its long-term climate goal of reducing GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
In September 2018, California Senate Bill 100, California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program: emissions of greenhouse gases, (SB 100) was signed into law, with a goal of 50% renewable energy by 2026 and 60% renewable energy by 2030. It also sets a target for California to achieve a GHG free energy supply by the year 2045. SB 100 and its renewable energy goals were endorsed by
several Silicon Valley Power (SVP) customers and by the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. SVP supports these innovation efforts in non-GHG emitting energy and storage technologies.
Renewable Energy
California Code, Public Resources Code section 25741, defines "renewable electrical generation facility" as a facility that meets any of the following criteria: The facility uses biomass, solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, geothermal, fuel cells using renewable fuels, small hydroelectric generation of 30 megawatts or less, digester gas, municipal solid waste conversion, landfill gas, ocean wave, ocean thermal, or tidal current, and any additions or enhancements to the facility using that technology.

Private Power Generation
Currently, Silicon Valley Power (SVP) customers can install their own electric generation systems on their properties, and also choose to remain connected to SVP's electrical distribution system. Typical examples of customer-owned generation systems include technologies such as solar photovoltaics,
internal combustion driven emergency back-up generators, fuel cells, steam generators, and gas turbines. Nearly all types of self-generation resources currently in use, other than solar systems, use fossil-fuels such as diesel or natural gas. Those intended only for emergency back-up purposes are rarely operational, used only for either testing or when there is a utility supply disruption. Due to their limited use they do not emit significant air pollution or greenhouse gasses on an annual basis.

The effects of the greater GHG emissions are not factored into the customer's economic valuation of self-generation because this self-generation is not subject to the same requirements as the utility under SB 100 and SB 350. As such, there is an increased reliance by these customers on fossil fuels within the City, which is contrary to the Council approved Climate Action Plan. Also, while self- generation is not required to meet SB 100 and SB 350, the emissions from these facilities still affect Santa Clara residents. City Customers with self-generation still rely on SVP to instantly supplement their electricity, as needed, or rely on it entirely if their generating source is shut down.

DISCUSSION
In order to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and to be consistent with the Council approved CAP and the requirements of SB 100, staff is recommending that customers that wish to install self-
generation resources (other than emergency backup generation) and remain connected to the SVP
electrical system be required to use a "renewable electrical generation facility" as defined in
California Code, Public Resources Code Section 25741. SVP supports the use of local renewable electric generation facilities and SVP will continue to enable customers to install California Energy Commission (CEC) approved renewable resources to serve their on-site loads.
This aligns with SVP's commitment to renewable energy and meet the California requirements. Staff is not proposing to acquire any future GHG emitting energy, and over the last 5 years, the City has
acquired the following portfolio in this effort:

• 124 MW Tri-Dam hydroelectric power through 2023
19 MW Rooney Ranch wind power through 2045 (start 2020)

• 30 MW Sand Hill A & B wind power through 2046 (start 2020)
40 MW Central 40 solar power through 2041 (start 2021)
200 MW Viento Loco wind power through 2046 (starts 2021)

Self-Generation Facilities and Bloom Energy
Recently the City received concerns from Bloom Energy (who has installed a number of natural gas
fuel cells in the City) regarding this proposed change to renewable and/or GHG free energy. Unlike
back-up generation, self-generation resources intended to serve a customer's own electric load (such
as a Bloom Energy fuel cell) operate nearly at full capacity throughout the year. This self-generation is not adjusted to broader grid market pricing conditions and times of abundant renewable generation (such as when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing). This results in significant GHG emissions. For example, on an annual basis the GHG emissions from a natural gas fuel cell are nearly 100% greater than the equivalent 2018 SVP electric load, and the emissions are above typical power supply available from the California market. Explained another way, a natural gas fuel cell provides 0% renewable energy and 0% GHG-free electricity, while in 2017 SVP's power content was 36% renewable energy and 72% GHG free.
Bloom energy has also requested that the City consider replacing its City owned natural gas power generation with their fuel cell natural gas power. Staff does not consider this a viable approach for two reasons: 1) Staff disagrees with their analysis that the fuel cells are "cleaner" than the City's natural gas plants; and 2) It is not possible to "replace" parts of our portfolio with Bloom energy, since

City of Santa Clara Page of 6 Printed on 5/3/2019

Attachment, Page 68 Page 65

File #: 19-329, Version:

power is not procured in that manner. At times SVP will provide power to the entire City without using any natural gas (using only renewable energy or GHG free energy). During these times a Bloom Energy fuel cell would continuously provide 0% renewable energy and continuously emit GHG. Also, as stated above, the City has made a commitment to only acquiring renewable or GHG free energy in alignment with SB100. Bloom Energy fuel cells do not accomplish either of those sustainability objectives.
Staff does agree that these fuel cells are much cleaner than diesel generators and did try to explore the use of Bloom Energy fuel cells as back-up power replacement. However, Bloom did not express interest in this "green" alternative as it did not provide sufficient revenue for them.

Recommendation to Support Renewable Energy
Staff recommends that the Council approve incorporating this requirement into Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations through adoption of a resolution (Attachment 1). If approved, this requirement will apply to all customers submitting an application after June 1, 2019 to interconnect to a new self- generation resource. Applications for new self-generation facilities that are already deemed complete by the Chief Electric Utility Officer by or before June 1, 2019, will be allowed to continue the interconnection process. This requirement also applies to requests to increase the capacity rating of existing generation facilities. It would not apply to self-generation resources with existing interconnection agreements, and/or other agreements with the City which incorporate self-generation
terms, executed prior to June 1, 2019. It would not require the removal of existing natural gas
generation resources as the requirement only applies to new facilities.

The proposed amendments to SVP's Rules and Regulations (Attachment 2 for redlined version and Attachment 3 for final version) are to Section 11 and include:
Define "renewable electrical generation facility" to align with Section 25471 of the California
Public Resources Code;
Clarify that SVP will only accept requests to interconnect generating facilities that are intended
to operate in parallel with SVP's Distribution System if the facility qualifies as a "renewable
electrical generation facility" as defined in California Public Resource Code Section 25741; Require all customers interconnecting with SVP's Distribution System with a qualifying renewable electrical generation facility, except solar photovoltaic systems which are
considered inherently eligible, to provide the following: o Preliminary renewable eligibility certification from the CEC prior to interconnection with
the SVP system o Final CEC certification within 180 days of the interconnection; and
O Annual attestation signed by the customer or documentation from a CEC approved
reporting entity, such as the Western Renewable Energy Generation Information System (WREGIS), that verifies that the generation facility is in current status and proof of the renewable energy credit retirement applicable to the Calendar year generation.
O In addition, SVP may request documentation providing evidence of CEC renewable
certification of the renewable electrical generation facility at any time.

Summary
As previously discussed, these amendments to the SVP Rules and Regulations do not apply to backup generation that runs on a limited, as needed basis, and typically do not operate in parallel
with the utility system. SVP will also continue to encourage microgrids that are comprised of

renewable generation facilities and energy storage options. A recent example of this is at Santa Clara Square which is combining solar photovoltaic and storage to better manage their own usage and peak demand. The City is developing a standardized process to interconnect electric micro-grids per the State's requirements. The standards will facilitate providing customers with new ways to
manage their energy needs, but they must also assure that this is being completed in an environmentally friendly manner that aligns with California, the City and SVP's future energy goals and green energy requirements.

While this is a change to the existing options available to Santa Clara residents and businesses, the amendments align with the City and State goals and requirements for renewable and/or GHG free energy. As a private generator, these facilities do not need to meet SB 100, however staff thinks it's important for the whole City to move forward in meeting this requirement. These changes will create
a greener Santa Clara and help to address environmental and climate change issues. The City has taken the initiative by proactively ensuring all new energy acquisitions are renewable and/or GHG free. This change encourages other generators within the City to do the same.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The action being considered is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) as the activity is covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the
environment. Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA.

FISCAL IMPACT There is no direct fiscal impact of the recommended action. However, non-action would continue to allow customers to install fossil-fuel powered self-generation that would increase GHG emissions within the City and potentially lead to additional costs to offset those GHG emissions in order to meet the State's and City's Climate Action Plan goals.

COORDINATION
This report has been coordinated with the Finance Department and City Attorney's office.

PUBLIC CONTACT
Public contact was made by posting the Council agenda on the City's official-notice bulletin board
outside City Hall Council Chambers. A complete agenda packet is available on the City's website and in the City Clerk's Office at least 72 hours prior to a Regular Meeting and 24 hours prior to a Special Meeting. A hard copy of any agenda report may be requested by contacting the City Clerk's Office at (408) 615-2220, email clerk@santaclaraca.gov <mailto:clerk@santaclaraca.gov2 or at the public information desk at any City of Santa Clara public library.
Silicon Valley Power staff directly contacted customers that have installed fuel cells on their premises and companies that were known to be in discussion with fuel cell vendors. Most
companies expressed appreciation for the outreach and supported the City's efforts toward climate sustainability. There were a few companies that expressed concern regarding the timing of the self
-generation effort and preferred that more discussion occur before adoption. Staff also contacted Bloom Energy, as the main provider of fuel cells in the City and they expressed concern regarding the proposal, as it will limit their ability to install fuel cells locally until they can develop "cost- effective" renewable options.

Re: May 7, 2019, Agenda Item 6 (File No. 19-329): Action on the Adoption of a Resolution Amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations to Require New or Modified Self-Generation Facilities to Utilize Renewable Generation and
Fuel Sources (the "Resolution")
Dear Mayor Gillmor and Honorable Councilmembers:

On behalf of Bloom Energy, we respectfully submit these comments on the City Council agenda item described above. This Resolution would amend Silicon Valley Power's (SVP) Rules and Regulations to prohibit SVP customers from installing their own electric generation resources (e.g., an onsite fuel cell) on their property and remain connected to SVP's distribution system unless the generation resource meets the state definition of a "renewable electrical generation facility,"' even though the City would continue to rely upon electrical generation from SVP's natural gas power plants.3
The Resolution would represent a significant shift in the way SVP customers can use and manage onsite energy usage. Yet, the City has not done any environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) regarding the potential impacts such a shift will have on the environment by increasing emissions from natural gas power plants if fuel cell use is effectively precluded. Instead, the City simply claims without evidentiary support that the Resolution falls within the CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3) "common sense" exemption. (See City of Santa Clara Legislative Details, Report to Council, at 5.)
Ramboll, a top flight environmental firm which regularly analyzes projects under CEQA, evaluated the potential environmental impacts of the Resolution based on the scant technical evidence in the City record (Ramboll's report is attached as Exhibit A). Ramboll's technical report demonstrates the Resolution will likely increase greenhouse gas emissions and criteria pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM), which can cause public

health impacts on neighboring communities, among other potential environmental ramifications. Moreover, Ramboll identifies a myriad of environmental benefits that may be lost if the Resolution is adopted and fuel cells, including those manufactured by Bloom, are effectively precluded for SVP customers. Ramboll also demonstrates that the Resolution may result in an increase in water use and ambient noise levels.
For the reasons set forth in this letter, under CEQA, the common sense exemption does not apply if there is even a "slight" showing of a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact unless the City meets its burden of demonstrating with certainty that there is no possibility of a significant environmental impact. The City has not met this difficult burden. Indeed, Ramboll makes clear that significant environmental impacts reasonably may result from the Resolution.

Accordingly, CEQA requires the City to prepare an Environmental Impact Report
("EIR") that analyzes the Resolution's full impact on the environment. The public must be given an opportunity to review and comment on the EIR before it can be approved. As such, we request that the City Council withdraw the Resolution from its agenda and instruct staff to engage in a fulsome discourse with the public and prepare a full EIR. Bloom looks forward to participating in this transparent process.

I. CEQA OVERVIEW
CEQA (Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000(a).) In CEQA, the Legislature established procedures designed to achieve these goals, principally the EIR. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002)
103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (CEQA
Guidelines § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.)
Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and implementation of all feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental

impacts of a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided • or significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).)
If there is a possibility that an agency's action will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform, at the least, a threshold initial study. (See CEQA Guidelines § 150063(a); Communities to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185-86.) Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the full CEQA procedures requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different result. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)

II. THE RESOLUTION TRIGGERS CEQA REVIEW
CEQA applies to discretionary actions that can impact the environment. The Resolution is a discretionary action-one that "requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the
public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity"-with the potential to impact the environment as shown in the Ramboll report, thereby triggering the need for CEQA review. (CEQA § Guidelines § 15357.) If the agency evaluating a project has the ability and authority to "shape the project" and "mitigate environmental damage," that agency discretion triggers CEQA compliance. (See San Diego Navy Broadway Complex Coalition v. City of San Diego, (2010) Cal.App.4th 924, 934; Friends of Westwood Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, (1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 259, 272.) And, in this matter, the City concedes that the Resolution is a project subject to CEQA. (See City of Santa Clara Legislative Details, Report to Council, at 5.)

III. RAMBOLL'S TECHNICAL REPORT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL
FOR SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

Ramboll analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the Resolution. Ramboll's review was severely constrained by the scant technical information and environmental analysis in the City's record, and the absence of virtually any time frame between the publication of the Resolution (Thursday May 2) and the hearing (May 7). The City staff report accompanying the Resolution makes several unsubstantiated assertions about the environmental benefits of the
Resolution regarding local and state climate goals, but, notably, the City fails to (1) analyze the potentially significant impacts associated with the Resolution or (2) recognize the substantial environmental benefits that would be eliminated by essentially precluding the use of distributed fuel cells for SVP customers. State agencies have recognized fuel cells as an important technology for addressing climate change and air quality goals.3
Ramboll shows that the Resolution would likely result in an increase in NOx, sulphur oxides (SOx) and other air quality pollutants that can lead to regional and local air pollution
impacts. The correlation between air pollution and public health consequences is well

understood.4 By effectively precluding fuel cell use by requiring fuel cells to meet the definition in to facilities that meet the criteria for renewable electrical generation facilities as defined by California Public Resources Code Section 25741, the Resolution will result in greater emissions from natural gas power plants. Therefore, if the Resolution increases the level of local PM and NOx emissions, the Resolution would increase the potential for local health impacts on neighboring communities. Known health impacts associated with localized exposure to PM and
NOx include respiratory effects (e.g., decreased lung function, increases in pulmonary inflammation, asthma development) and cardiovascular impairment (e.g., congestive heart failure).5

A. Environmental Impacts of SVP's Power Plants
SVP has three natural gas power plants in the City: the Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant, the Gianera Generating Station, and the Cogeneration Plant #1. (See Silicon Valley Power Electric Resource Map, http://www.siliconvalleypower.com/home/showdocument?id=5763 (last visited May 3, 2019).) Together, these three plants can produce approximately 200 megawatts, and corresponding emissions. (See id.) As the City should know, these power plants are significant sources of air emissions and strategic use of fuel cells can reduce the City's dependency on these large power plants, and the detrimental effects their emissions have on the community, including the residential neighborhoods and schools located in close proximity the City's power plants.
The SVP-owned facilities emit air pollutants such as NOx, SOx, and PM that contribute to ozone production and local and regional air pollution. Ramboll determined that the City's Gianera Generating Station is located near residences and the Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant
and the cogeneration facility are located within disadvantaged communities that may be
disproportionately impacted by increases in ambient pollutant concentrations.
Although the City touts the Resolution as important for meeting local and state climate goals, Ramboll shows that, in fact, the Resolution would likely increase overall GHG emissions.
Ramboll also demonstrates that the Resolution may result in an increase in water use and
ambient noise levels.

B. Environmental Benefits of Fuel Cells

Ramboll discusses and attaches relevant literature citing the various environmental benefits associated with fuel cells. This literature shows that fuel cells can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, contrary to the City's unsubstantiated assertions. The use of fuel cells can advance preferred distributed energy strategies that have been recognized by the California Public Utilities Commission through the Net Energy Metering program® and by the California Air Resources Board through the Distributed Generation Certification Program.' This issue must be analyzed in the Energy section of a CEQA document prepared by the City. (See CEQA
Guidelines, Appendix G, CEQA Checklist, Energy.)
Fuel cells can also provide essential energy supplies during emergencies or other outages at critical facilities, such as emergency centers, universities, housing developments and other public facilities. Fuel cells provide local environmental benefits by, among other things:
Reducing consumption and use of natural gas;
Avoiding the combustion or burning of fuel, which reduces air pollutants and particulates; and
Reducing the need for diesel generators.
Ramboll's technical report provides additional analysis and information about the
Resolution's potentially significant environmental impacts. Again, the preliminary list of issues raised in Ramboll's initial report are limited because the City provided almost no technical analysis about the Resolution's environmental impacts. As detailed below, to comply with CEQA, the City must analyze the environmental impacts of the Resolution through an EIR and provide the public an opportunity to review and comment. Bloom Energy reserves the right to comment further as it continues to evaluate the impacts of this Resolution and after reviewing the
EIR.

IV. THE COMMON SENSE EXEMPTION DOES NOT APPLY

CEQA identifies certain classes of projects which are exempt from the provisions of CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21084(a); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15300, 15354.) Categorical exemptions are certain classes of activities that generally do not have a significant effect on the
environment.

Here, the City Staff recommend that the Council find the Resolution exempt from CEQA
under the "common sense" exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3). Section 15061(b)(3) provides that project is exempt from CEQA review when:
The activity is covered by the common sense exemption that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. Where it can be seen with
certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA.
(Emphasis added.) The City "has the burden of establishing the commonsense exemption, i.e., that there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts." (California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Board (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 195 [emphasis in original].)
Unlike other exemptions, the common sense exemption does not provide the City with an implied finding that the project will not have a significant environmental impact. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 116.) Instead, "the agency must itself provide the support for its decision..." (Id.) Likewise, "[t]he showing required of a party challenging an exemption under Guidelines section 15061, subdivision (b)(3) is slight, since that exemption requires the agency to be certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts." (Davidon Homes, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117 [emphasis added].)
"If legitimate questions can be raised about whether the project might have a significant impact and there is any dispute about the possibility of such an impact, the agency cannot find with certainty that a project is exempt." (Id.) Therefore, "if a reasonable argument is made to suggest a possibility that a project will cause a significant environmental impact, the agency must refute that claim to a certainty before finding that the exemption applies." (Id. at 118 [emphasis in original]; Rominger v. County of Colusa (2014) 229 Cal.App.4th 690, 704 ["For the commonsense exemption to apply, the county would have to show as a factual matter, based on the evidence in the record, that there is no possibility that the approval of the Adams subdivision may result in a significant effect on the environment..."].) Only a minimal showing is required to defeat the common sense exemption. (Myers v. Board of Supervisors (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 413, 427; California Farm Bureau Federation, 143 Cal.App.4th at 195 ['a party challenging what is essentially a claim of the commonsense exemption..., unlike a party asserting an exception to a categorical exemption, need only make a 'slight' showing of a reasonable
possibility of a significant environmental impact."].)
As explained in Ramboll's technical analysis, the Resolution is likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions and air quality pollutants, which can result in greater health risks to sensitive receptors and disadvantaged communities. The California Supreme Court has recently made it clear that where a project under CEQA causes significant air quality impacts, the lead agency must explain the health consequences to the public of such impacts. (Sierra Club V. County of Fresno, Case No. S219783 (2018).) The Resolution may also increase water use and noise levels, while potentially conflicting with the City's General Plan.

The technical evidence presented by Ramboll far exceeds the "slight" showing that must be made of a potentially significant environmental impact. The City cannot proceed under the "common sense" exception unless it demonstrates through technical analysis that with a certainty
there is no possibility of a significant environmental impact. Accordingly, the common sense exemption does not apply, and CEQA obligates the City to complete a full EIR to analyze and disclose potentially significant greenhouse gas, air quality, public health and other impacts.

V. EVEN IF THE CITY BELIEVES AN EXEMPTION APPLIES (WHICH IS NOT
THE CASE FOR THE COMMON SENSE EXEMPTION), THE CITY FAILED
TO ADDRESS THAT THE RESOLUTION FALLS WITHIN AN EXCEPTION TO
A CEQA EXEMPTION
Even if a project falls within a CEQA exemption, it will still be subject to CEQA review if the project falls within an exception to the exemption. (Pub. Res. Code § 21084; CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2.) There are several categories of CEQA Guidelines exceptions, none of which are discussed in the staff report. In this case, the unusual circumstances exception appears to apply, as discussed below. (See CEQA Guidelines 15300.2.) Under the unusual
circumstances exception, a CEQA exemption "shall not be used for an activity where there is a
reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c).) §
The California Supreme Court recently clarified that the substantial evidence standard applies when a court reviews an agency's factual determinations of whether a project presents unusual circumstances. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th
1086, 1114; Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 943 (Berkeley Hillside IN) (applying standard on remand).) However, an agency's determination of whether significant environmental impacts result from an unusual circumstance is reviewed under the fair argument standard.® (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.4th y
at 1115.)
Unusual circumstances appear to be present, in part, due to the City's power plant's proximity to residential neighborhoods. Ramboll's analysis demonstrates the City's Gianera Generating Station is located near residences and SVP's other two power plants are located
within disadvantaged communities, designated pursuant to SB 535, that may be

8 Under the fair argument standard, the agency must determine if there is substantial evidence in the record sufficient to support a fair argument that significant impacts may occur. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.4th at 1115.) Separately, the unusual circumstances exception will also apply if the record demonstrates that the project will result in a significant environmental impact. The agency's resolution of this question is reviewed under the substantial evidence test. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.App.4th at
1115.)

disproportionately impacted by increases in ambient pollutant concentrations.° In any instance, the City's record contains no evidence that unique circumstances are not present, and the Ramboll technical analysis supports a fair argument that a significant impact will occur from the Resolution.

VI. THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND
COMMENT

An EIR is required to analyze the Resolution's potentially significant environmental impacts because a CEQA exemption does not apply. The City must circulate the EIR for public review and comment. Here, the City attempts to shortchange public involvement through the improper application of the common sense exemption.
Failing to provide an opportunity for meaningful public review of such a significant shift in the right to use distributed energy resources undermines one of the key purposes of CEQA. "Environmental review derives its vitality from public participation." (Oceanview Estate
Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. Montecito Water Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 396, 400.) "The requirement of public review has been called 'the strongest assurance of the adequacy of [environmental review under CEQA].™ (Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Comm. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1051.)

VII. CONCLUSION

The City failed to analyze the Resolution's potentially significant environmental impacts. An exemption to CEQA does not apply. The City must evaluate the Resolution's impacts in an EIR and provide the public with an opportunity to review and comment on the EIR in accordance with CEQA. Bloom Energy respectfully requests that the City Council withdraw the Resolution from its agenda and instruct City staff to engage in a fulsome discourse with the public and prepare a full EIR for the Resolution.

Subject: ANALYSIS ON THE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
RELATED TO THE CITY OF SANTA CLARA'S PROPOSED
RESOLUTION TO REQUIRE NEW OR MODIFIED SELF-
GENERATION FACILITIES TO UTILIZE RENEWABLE
GENERATION AND FUEL SOURCES

INTRODUCTION
The analysis summarized in this memorandum evaluates the potential environmental Date May 6, 2019
impacts associated with a resolution a proposed by the City of Santa Clara ("City") City
Council that would amend Silicon Valley Power's rules and regulations to require new
or modified self-generation facilities to utilize renewable generation and fuel sources. Ramboll
This resolution introduces various potentially significant environmental impacts. Based 5 Park Plaza
on our review of the limited technical information in the City's record for this Suite 500
resolution, the technical evidence indicates that the selective requirement imposed in Irvine, CA 92614

different power generation sources that are not powered by renewable fuel sources.
Those power generation sources may have potentially significant environmental
impacts that were not analysed by the City in accordance with the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Although the City indicates the resolution does not need to be evaluated under the
state standards for environmental review embodied in CEQA, based on the analysis as
presented in this memorandum, there is sufficient scientific data regarding potentially
significant impacts resulting from the proposed resolution.
Fuel cell technology is an efficient way to generate electricity and does so without
combustion and with little-to-no water use.1 As result, fuel cells generate relatively
low amounts of criteria pollutant emissions, and have no meaningful effect on an
area's water supply.2 When distributed energy sources like fuel cells are brought
online, they reduce the amount of power required from energy sources operating on
the margin (i.e., those supplying the last unit of energy demand). Sources operating
on the margin are generally those that are the easiest to start up and shut down, but
also are the least energy efficient generation sources.3 When compared to other
forms of power production such as power plants that use natural gas, fuel cells

demonstrate clear environmental benefits. This issue should be evaluated as part of the CEQA process to assess if the selective requirement for renewable fuels for self-generation facilities may lead to
greater power generation from traditional combustion based natural gas-powered sources. As the
demand for electricity increases, increased natural gas power production could have significant
environmental effects within the following CEQA technical areas: air quality, health risks, greenhouse
gases, hydrology/water quality, noise, energy, utilities and services, and aesthetics. Each of these
areas is further explored in the sections below.

Air Quality

Fuel cell technology is characterized by high efficiency energy conversion. This inherently results in
lower criteria pollutant emissions per megawatt-hour (MWh) compared to traditional natural gas
power generation. The lower criteria emissions achieved by fuel cells can be partially attributed to
their ability to convert fuel into electricity without combustion. The degree to which fuel cells out-
perform natural gas power production can be quantified by directly comparing emissions factor data
for a Bloom Energy fuel cell with data from the primary natural gas power plant in Santa Clara, the
Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant.

As demonstrated in Table 1 above, on a per MWh basis the Bloom Energy fuel cell has emissions 31 to
100 percent lower than the Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant. The difference in NOx emissions is
particularly noteworthy as Santa Clara County has been designated a nonattainment area for ozone
and NOx reductions are critical to an area's ozone attainment strategy. It's also important to note that
traditional natural gas power plants can also be a source of particulate matter emissions (due in-part
to cooling tower usage). Ultimately, an increase in natural gas combustion which could occur as a
result of this proposed resolution would potentially result in a significant increase in criteria pollutant
emissions and have implications on the area's air quality and attainment status.

Health Risks

Although Ramboll did not calculate the potential health risks associated with this proposed resolution,
there is a well-established connection between an ambient or regional increase in criteria pollutant
emissions and health impacts on humans, particularly sensitive receptors.4,5 Given the potential
increase in criteria pollutant emissions discussed in the section above, the resolution has the potential
to cause health impacts on members of the public. It is also important to note that two of the three
natural gas power plants in Santa Clara are located within Senate Bill (SB) 535 disadvantaged
communities (see Attachment 3) and the third power plant is located near a residential area.
Therefore, these impacts have the potential to disproportionately impact disadvantaged communities
and sensitive receptors.

Greenhouse Gases

The high efficiency energy conversion capabilities of fuel cell technology inherently results in their
lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a per MWh. In addition, their high capacity factors
(generally > 90%) maximize potential greenhouse gas emission reductions on a per megawatt basis.6
These recognized benefits are part of the reason why the State of California has established
programs7,8 and passed legislation9 in support of distributed generation technologies. The degree to
which fuel cells out-perform natural gas power production can be quantified by directly comparing
emissions factor data for a Bloom Energy fuel cell with data from the Donald Von Raesfeld Power
Plant. As shown in Table 2 below, a on a per MWh basis the Bloom Energy fuel cell would on average
generate 20 percent lower GHG emissions than the Donald Von Raesfeld Power Plant. Ultimately, an
increase in a natural gas production as a result of this proposed resolution could result in a significant
increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

Hydroloqy/Water Quality
While fuel cell systems need a small amount of water on start-up (e.g., 250 gallons), they require no ongoing water use. 10 Therefore, they have virtually no impact on an area's hydrology or water supply.
In contrast, thermoelectric power generation requires significant amounts of water for cooling. In
2015, that sector alone made up 41% of the nation's freshwater withdrawals. 11 While many modern
thermoelectric plants are moving towards recirculating cooling systems to reduce water withdrawals, water consumption is still significant (mostly due to evaporation loss). While the annual usage of
cooling water for the Santa Clara natural gas power plants could not be located online, the Donald Van
Raesfeld Power Plant is permitted with a cooling tower with a rated capacity of 34,980 gallons per
minute.12 Even if this cooling water is reclaimed, there will still be potentially significant losses to

evaporation, as well as GHG emissions associated with the conveyance and treatment of that water.
The potential impacts on hydrology and water quality, and utilities and service systems that could occur a as a result of the proposed resolution should be evaluated.

Noise

Fuel cells do not use combustion and have no moving components; therefore, they are a relatively
quiet form of energy production. 13 This is especially true when compared against emergency
generators and industrial power plants, in which the latter typically features air-cooled condensers,
cooling towers, and turbines/generators. An increase in natural gas combustion-based energy
production as a result of this proposed resolution could result in noise impacts on sensitive receptors.
This is especially true were there to be increased production at the Gianera Power Plant, which is
located adjacent to a residential neighborhood.

Energy

The proposed resolution and its selective renewable fuel usage requirement is likely to impact energy
resources, including Silicon Valley Power (SVP) customer choice to use and manage onsite generation
resources during normal and a emergency conditions. As a result, the City should evaluate the proposed
resolution's impact on energy resources and the efficient use of energy by SVP customers.

Other CEOA Considerations

The proposed resolution and its selective renewable fuel usage requirement would specifically impact
the future development of energy supplies. a As a result, the City should evaluate the proposed
resolution's impact on utilities and service systems. Similarly, in the event other power generation
such as traditional power plants or solar is required, the proposed resolution's resulting impact on
aesthetics and biological and cultural resources should be evaluated. The streamlined features of fuel
cells have an environmentally better aesthetic impact than solar fields or traditional natural gas power
plants. Likewise, the land footprint for fuel cells can be much smaller than solar fields or traditional
natural gas power plants and thus result in a comparably lower impact on biological and cultural
resources.

TO: Santa Clara City Council and Mayor Gillmor FROM: Bloom Energy
DATE: April 26, 2019 SUBJECT: Santa Clara Resolution on Fuel Cells

The Proposal
Silicon Valley Power (SVP) is planning to introduce a resolution at the May 7 City Council meeting thaf would limit the types of onsite electricity generation technologies customers in Santa Clara can install. While Bloom, Equinix, Santa Clara residents and others have encouraged a data-driven approach, the original SVP proposal
would create a renewables-only mandate. Since renewable biogas in California is virtually non-existent or
prohibitively costly (3-10x more expensive), this resolution will ban fuel cells in the City of Santa Clara. We encourage the City of Santa Clara to follow universally accepted methods to measure carbon and allow technologies that reduce the marginal greenhouse gas emissions that they offset.

The Environmental Impact
Although well-intentioned, this resolution is likely to increase greenhouse gas emissions and worsen air quality. SVP owns three natural gas power plants, two of which are over 30 years old, that burn gas to generate electricity.1 By nature of their non-combustion process, fuel cells generate electricity more efficiently and more cleanly than these facilities without emitting air pollutants such as NOx, SOx, and VOCs that form smog and
worsen public health.-

The Economic Impaet
This proposal will send a chilling message to both existing businesses and prospective companies. To be successful and compete, data centers, universities and hospitals require affordable, reliable, sustainable, high
quality power. Unfortunately, the aging grid and the increasingly sever natural disasters mean that centralized power and delivery do not provide sufficient reliability or power quality, Silicon Valley Power (SVP) reported dozens of electrical outages in the last year alone, including the most recent instance on April 1, 2019 when the power was out for over six hours due to balloons.3 Innovative companies should not be handcuffed when making choices of how to reliably power their facilities.

Proposed Solutions
Bloom is committed to finding a solution that reduces GHGs, provides Santa Clara businesses, hospitals and other institutions with reliable power, and fosters ongoing private investment. We propose an alternative
approach:
1. is New projects: If Santa Clara is going to pursue a resolution, it should utilize data-driven approach that
allows the cleanest technologies to proceed. Under state law, onsite electricity generation does not count
toward SVPs emissions.4 Instead, for these types of onsite projects, the universally accepted approach is to measure marginal emissions and any technologies that are cleaner than the marginal emissions they offset should be eligible to operate in the city of Santa Clara. 2. Projects in the application queue: This resolution should not apply to projects that have submitted interconnection applications after months of planning and investment. SVP has not provided clarity on
whether the current proposal will apply to those projects for which applications are submitted.
We appreciate your time and attention to working collaboratively to power a prosperous Santa Clara.

Lisa M. Gillmor, Mayor
City Council Members
City of Santa Clara

Dear Mayor and Council members,

I understand that the City of Santa Clara is planning to vote on a resolution that would essentially ban all
behind-the-meter electricity generation that uses energy-efficient fuel cells. understand that the
resolution would technically allow fuel cells, but would require them to use only in-state biogas as their
energy source. Much of the rest of this letter explains that the requirement to use only in-state biomass
is tantamount to banning all behind-the-meter fuel cells.

am James (Jim) Sweeney, Stanford Professor of Management Science and Engineering; Senior Fellow
of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research; Senior Fellow of the Precourt Institute for Energy;
and until recently, Director of Stanford's Precourt Energy Efficiency Center.

In 2018, I chaired the steering committee for the California Council on Science and Technology (CCST)
report, Biomethane in California Common Carrier Pipelines: Assessing Heating Value and Maximum
Siloxane Specifications. 1 The report, completed at the request of the California legislature, documented
the current availability, market, economics, and technical specifications for pipeline injected biomethane
the exact fuel this resolution seeks to require all onsite electricity generators to utilize.

The first issue is that at present there are only two commercially operating biomethane developments
connected to pipelines in California, CR&R and Point Loma. Because of the high costs and long
development timelines to bring these projects to market in California, the current supply of in-state biogas
is extremely limited.

https://ccst.us/publications/2018/2018biomethane.pdf

Exhibit F
Page 102
Attachment, Page 105

Second, the combination of California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the Federal Renewable Fuel
Standard provides massive incentives for biomethane suppliers to sell all biomethane (from in-state or
out of state) ONLY for transportation uses, such as to power heavy-duty trucks or buses. These two
programs provide large subsidies for biomethane, but only for biomethane used for transportation, not for
the generation of electricity. These incentives are stackable, that is biomethane products can benefit
from both the federal and state incentives if that biomethane is used for transportation.

These incentives have led our CCST team to conclude that "The current value of the Federal and State
incentives far exceeds the market value of the biomethane. Financial incentives through the
California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)
programs can be a factor of up to 18 times greater than the commodity value of the biomethane
itself [emphasis added]."2 The result: biomethane is prohibitively expensive if used for electricity
generation. Taking into account the asymmetric federal and state subsideis, it is simply not economical
to utilize biomethane for non-transportation purposes, such as to generate electricity through fuel cells

Although couldn't be there with you in person, I wanted to make it clear that, in practice, the proposed
resolution would effectively prohibit any behind-the-meter technology, if the resolution requires such
technologies to use renewable gas. The requirement that the renewable gas be sourced from within
California simply amplifies the prohibition.

Sincerely,

James L. Sweeney

Mayor Lisa M. Gillmor City of Santa Clara City Hall 1500 Warburton Ave., Santa Clara, CA 95050
Dear Mayor Gillmor:
My name is Catherine Sandoval, and since 2004 I have worked in the City of Santa Clara as a law professor at Santa Clara University. I'm writing to express my concerns in my individual capacity as a tenured professor who works and teaches in the City of Santa Clara about the City's proposed resolution Amending Silicon Valley Power's Rules and Regulations to Require New or Modified Self-Generation Facilities to Utilize Renewable Generation and Fuel Sources. I teach courses and conduct research on
energy, antitrust, communications and contract law, I served a six-year term as a Commissioner at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). I previously served as Undersecretary of the State of California's Business, Transportation, and Housing Agency. I support the State of California's and City of Santa Clara's objectives to transition to renewable energy sources by 2045. I write to express my concern that the Resolution in file 19-329 is not supported by any analysis of the renewable natural gas market for stationary sources or the Resolution's likely Greenhouse Gas (GHG) effects.
The agenda packet for the Resolution requiring renewable fuel sources for interconnected self-generation by June 1, 2019 offers no analysis of the procurement market for renewable natural gas (biomethane) for stationary users. My research as an
energy law professor found that much of the biomethane available in California is used
for the transportation market, and insufficient biomethane is available to meet
transportation needs. The CPUC is examining renewable natural gas interconnection tariff and technical issues, and is holding a workshop on that topic on May 23 and 24. Neither the Resolution, nor the proposed Silicon Valley Power rules and regulations (SVP tariff), nor any material in the agenda packet offers the public or the City Council any analysis of the biomethane market for stationary users such as fuel cells. The absence of this analysis renders arbitrary and capricious the Resolution's proposed restriction on fuel cell generation sources to be implemented in less than one month.
Neither does the Resolution offer any analysis of the likely GHG impact of limiting
interconnected fuel cells to renewable sources if such sources are effectively unavailable for stationary source users in California. Legally sound analysis, and good government that serves the people who live and work in the City of Santa Clara,
requires more examination of the market and the proposed Resolution's consequences.

Exhibit G
Page 105
Attachment, Page 108

The proposed Resolution and SVP tariff as currently drafted do not offer a pathway to success for achievement of renewable energy goals. Neither do they analyze the proposal's consistency with reliability, safety, just and reasonable rates, competition, consumer choice, and GHG mitigation. Nor is the scope of its intended application clear or adequately supported.
urge the City Council to conduct and timely disclose for public comment independent expert of analysis of the state of the renewable natural gas procurement market for stationary sources, the Resolution's likely GHG effects, and to consider alternatives commensurate with the biomethane market's development. Such analysis is necessary for legally sound decision-making in the interests of those who live, work, and invest in the City of Santa Clara, for the people of the State of California, and to mitigate climate change. I regret that I cannot attend the City Council meeting in person and thank you for considering my comments on this proposed resolution.
