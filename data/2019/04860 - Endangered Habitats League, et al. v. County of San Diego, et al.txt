VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the June 26, 2019 decision of the County of San Diego and

3 its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "County" or "Respondents") to approve the Otay Ranch

4 Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 project ("Project" or "Village 14") proposed by Real Party

5 in Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company ("Jackson Pendo" or "Real Party"). The
6 Project includes over 1,119 single-family homes-none of which will be affordable- -on nearly

7 1,300 acres of pristine San Diego backcountry located between state and federal ecological
8 preserves.

9 2. In approving the Project, the County violated numerous state and local laws,
10 including the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the CEQA Guidelines, State
11 Planning and Zoning Law, the Natural Community Conservation Planning Act, and the
12 County's own General Plan. For example, the Project proposes development in sensitive habitat
13 areas known as PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3, which were set aside as preserve in the Multiple Species
14| Conservation Program Subregional Plan ("MSCP") adopted by the California Department of
15 Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") to ensure the
16 protection and recovery of sensitive species. This Project design leads to violations of CEQA,
17 the Fish and Game Code, and the MSCP and related plans and agreements.
18 3. The Project is also located in a very high fire hazard severity zone, with steep
19 chaparral slopes, strong Santa Ana winds, and only one evacuation route. Surprisingly, given the
20 recent devastating fire seasons in California, the environmental impact report ("EIR") does
21 nothing to disclose or analyze the increased wildfire risk that will be caused by bringing
22 thousands of people to this area. And it fails to accurately portray the significant risks associated
23 with relying on the two-lane Proctor Valley Road for mass evacuation, especially during a high-
24| speed, wind-driven fire. These issues will exacerbate fire risk and severity for existing County
25 residents, particularly those residing in Jamul and Chula Vista.

26 4. The Project will generate over 16,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas ("GHG")
27 emissions annually, primarily from the 50 million miles traveled each year by the Project's
28 future residents to reach jobs and services. The Project is precisely the type of backcountry,
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 automobile-centric development that is antithetical to the state's ambitious climate goals. Yet,

2 the EIR fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with local and regional plans to address
3 climate change. Moreover, instead of redesigning the Project or incorporating onsite measures to
4 reduce vehicle trips causing GHG emissions, the County allows the developer to buy third-party
5 carbon "offsets" based on a County program recently struck down by this Court. Such offsets

6 are unenforceable, ineffective, and not additional to reductions that would already occur. They
7 also are likely to result from projects located far from San Diego County, in contravention of the
8 County's own General Plan. This proposed mitigation violates CEQA's requirements.

9 5. For all of these reasons, the County's approval of the Project and certification of
10 the EIR constituted an abuse of discretion and must be overturned.

11 PARTIES

12 6. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL") is a is a tax-exempt non-profit
13 California corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable
14 land use and transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships
15 across Southern California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, now threatened by
16 climate change and the County's Project approval. EHL is extremely active in the San Diego
17 region, where many of its members live and enjoy the biological diversity in the area and served

18 on the County advisory committee for the 2011 General Plan Update. EHL submitted written
19 comments to the County objecting to and commenting on the Project and EIR.
20 7. Petitioner California Native Plant Society ("CNPS") is a California non-profit
21 501(c)(3) corporation. CNPS was founded in 1965 and currently has about 10,000 members in

22 35 chapters throughout California and Baja California. Its members include professional
23 botanists, landscape architects, nursery owners, professional conservation workers, agency
24 personnel, and laypersons. The members of CNPS are dedicated to the preservation of
25 California's rich native botanical heritage, the conservation of native plants and their natural
26 habitats (such as woodlands, chaparral, and wetlands), progress on issues that affect native
27 plants and people (such as wildfire and climate change), and advancement of the understanding,
28 appreciation, and horticultural use of native plants. CNPS works closely with decisionmakers,
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 scientists, and local planners to advocate for well-informed and environmentally friendly
2 policies, regulations, and land uses. CNPS submitted written comments to the County objecting
3 to and commenting on the Project and EIR.

4 8. The interests that EHL and CNPS (together, "Petitioners") seek to further in this
5 action are within the goals and purposes of these organizations. Petitioners and their members

6 have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with laws bearing on approval

7 of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which
8 violates the law as set forth in this Petition, and which would cause substantial harm to

9 Petitioners' members, the natural environment, public health, and the quality of life in the
10 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

11 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
12 harms alleged herein.

13 9. Respondent County of San Diego is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a
14| political subdivision of the State of California responsible for regulating and controlling land use
15 within the County, including but not limited to implementing and complying with the provisions
16 of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan, and the MSCP and
17 related plans and agreements. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public
18 Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental
19 review of proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and state law.
20 10. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of San Diego is, and at all times
21 herein mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County. As the
22 decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors was charged with responsibilities under CEQA
23 for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the
24 various approvals necessary for the Project. The Board also is and was responsible for
25 implementing and complying with the provisions of State Planning and Zoning Law, the
26 County's General Plan and the MSCP and related plans and agreements. The Board and its
27 members are sued in their official capacities.

4 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
5 determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to insert
6 such identities and capacities.

7 12. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
8 Interest Jackson Pendo Development is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the entity listed
as "Project Applicant" on the Notice of Determination filed for the Project on June 27, 2019. As
10 the Project applicant, Jackson Pendo Development is a recipient of the approvals granted by
11 Respondents as part of the Project, and thus is a real party a in interest within the meaning of
12 Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.

13 13. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in•
14 Interest Jackson Pendo Development Company is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a

16 applicant Jackson Pendo Development. Jackson Pendo Development Company is the only active
17 company listed on the California Secretary of State Business Entities Search with the name
18  "Jackson Pendo." While Jackson Pendo Development Company is not listed on the Notice of
19 Determination for the Project, Petitioners separately name Jackson Pendo Development
20 Company in an abundance of caution. As used in this Petition and Complaint, "Jackson Pendo"
21 refers to both Jackson Pendo Development and Jackson Pendo Development Company.
22 14. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Real Party in
23 Interest GDCI Proctor Valley, L.P. is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a Delaware limited

18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 19. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,
20 and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, the San Diego County
21 Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
22 decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project.
23 20. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California
24 in and for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394. The
25 activities authorized by Respondents will occur in San Diego County.

26 21. Venue for this action properly lies in the Central Division of the Superior Court
27 for the State of California for the County of San Diego. On information and belief, the Project is
28 located in zip codes 91914 (South Division) and 91935 (East Division). However, as this
6

petition pleads a California Environmental Quality Act claim, venue is proper in the Central

2 Division pursuant to Local Rule 1.2.2(E).

3 22. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action
4 and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and
5 required by law. Petitioners and their members submitted numerous objections to approval of
the Project based on inconsistencies with state law and the County's inadequate analysis and
mitigation of the Project's environmental impacts and consideration of alternatives in the EIR

8 prepared for the Project.
23. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the EIR and
10 approving the Project. Respondents have a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including
11 but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this
12 lawsuit.

13 24. On July 24, 2019, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section
14 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners planned to file a
15 Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval of the Project.
16 Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.

17 25. On July 25, 2019, Petitioners will comply with Public Resources Code section
18 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the
19 State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B is the true and
20 correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
21 26. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to

22 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will
23 file a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

24 27. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
25 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside
26 their adoption of the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies,
27 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners and their
28

members will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately
2 compensate Petitioners and their members for that harm.

3 28. This petition is timely filed.
STATEMENT )F FACTS
Proctor Valley and the Proposed Project Site

6 29. The Project would be located in the remote Proctor Valley area of San Diego
County, northwest of the City of Chula Vista and near the small, unincorporated town of Jamul.
8 Apart from the dirt and gravel Proctor Valley Road, a designated scenic highway, the site is
entirely undeveloped. Travelers along Proctor Valley road are treated with the undeveloped,
10 gentle hillsides of Proctor Valley, San Miguel and the Jamul Mountains, and the dense trees and
11 shrubs of Upper Otay Reservoir.

12 30. Proctor Valley is located at the crossroads of a wealth of biological resources. The
13| Project site abuts the 5,600-acre Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, owned by CDFW, to the
14 west, north, and east. The Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve provides raptor foraging habitat,
15 host plants and nectar resources for the Quino checkerspot butterfly, habitat occupied by the
16 California gnatcatcher and San Diego fairy shrimp, burrowing owl locations, and important
17 | habitat for numerous other special and protected species, including the mountain lion.

18 31. Proctor Valley also provides the last remaining connection between the San Diego
19 National Wildlife Refugee and other protected open space in southern San Diego County. The
20 Wildlife Refuge is otherwise surrounded by development. As such, Proctor Valley and the
21 Project site provide a vital wildlife movement corridor for species traveling between the
22 protected habitat of San Miguel Mountain within the Wildlife Refuge to the northwest and the
23 Jamul Mountains to the southeast. CDFW has likewise recognized the importance of water
24 sources in Proctor Valley for wildlife migration between these two areas.
25 32. The Project site itself supports numerous sensitive natural vegetation communities
26 including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian and vernal pools. Based on the County's own
27 data, 22 special-status plants and 28 special-status wildlife species occur on the Project site,
28 including the federally endangered San Diego fairy shrimp and Quino checkerspot butterfly, the
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

P federally threatened California gnatcatcher, the federally threatened/state endangered Otay
2 tarplant, the state fully protected Golden Eagle and white-tailed kite, and the federal candidate

3 western spadefoot toad. The Project site is not only replete with sensitive flora and fauna; it

4 provides some of the County's last best habitat for many of these species.

5 33. For instance, Proctor Valley contains key habitat for the federally endangered

6 Quino checkerspot butterfly, a small orange-and-black butterfly that was once one of the most

7 common butterflies in Southern California but is now on the verge of extinction. Proctor Valley

8 connects vital habitat areas for the Quino checkerspot butterfly-San Miguel Mountain and
Otay Mountain and contains significant habitat itself, including host plants and nectar sources.

10 After the wet winters of 2017 and 2018, limited surveys revealed over 50 Quino checkerspot
11 butterfly on and near the Project site. The Quino checkerspot butterfly is not covered by existing
12 take authorization under the MSCP.

13 34. In addition, recent observations and USGS tracking data show that federally listed
14 Golden Eagles frequently travel through Proctor Valley and forage on the Project site. Recent
15 scientific literature indicates that Golden Eagles are particularly sensitive to development-
16 houses, roads, and infrastructure all can cause Golden Eagles to vacate nearby areas.
17 Development in Proctor Valley would almost certainly result in the loss of important eagle
18 foraging habitat and the San Miguel Mountain/Rancho San Diego eagle territory, shrinking
19 available habitat in San Diego County significantly.
20 35. The western spadefoot toad, a state species of special concern that is not covered
21 by existing take authorization under the MSCP, is also present in Proctor Valley. This brown
22 and green amphibian requires shallow, temporary pools or streams during breeding season; the
23 Project site contains at least 16 such breeding pools.

24 36. Proctor Valley is designated as a very high fire hazard severity zone by the
25 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the California Public Utilities
26 Commission, the highest fire risk designation in California. This highest designation is well
27 deserved, as the area has burned at least 17 times in the last 100 years. The most notable fire-

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 the Harris Fireburned in October 2007 and affected over 90,000 acres, including a large
2 portion of the Project site.

3 37. Proctor Valley is uniquely at risk for fast-moving, wind-driven fires. According to
4 fire experts, a fire ignited on the Project site under Santa Ana winds would likely spread
5 southwest towards population centers at a rate of several miles per hour. The City of Chula
6 Vista's nearest residential development is less than 1.5 miles away. The steep terrain
7 surrounding the Project site, vegetated by chaparral and coastal scrub, would make effective fire
8 suppression difficult. The County acknowledges that the Project would be served by only one
9 evacuation route- the planned two-lane Proctor Valley Road.
10 38. A quick glance at a map reveals that the proposed Project is located far from job
11 centers and other services. Downtown Chula Vista is nearly 30 minutes away by car and is
a 12 already suffering from a shortage of jobs for current residents. The City of San Diego is nearly
13  an hour away. It comes as no surprise that the County forecasts that future Project residents will
14 drive 50 million miles per year in order to access these jobs and other goods and services. The
15 Project represents the precise type of status quo, backcountry development that the Executive
16 Director of the San Diego Association of Governments recently said cannot achieve state
17 climate goals.

18 39. Rainwater and other runoff from the Project site drain into Proctor Valley Creek
19 and Jamul Creek. Both are tributaries to the Upper Otay and Lower Otay Reservoirs, which
20 provide drinking water to residents in the City of San Diego. Both Jamul Creek and the Lower
21 Otay Reservoir are already listed as impaired water bodies under the Clean Water Act.
22 Development of the Project site would further impair these hydrological systems.
23 II. Applicable Land Use Plans

24 A. San Diego County General Plan

25 40. On October 28, 1993, the County approved the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan, as
26  part of the County's. General Plan. The Subregional Plan establishes land uses for the nearly
27 23,000-acre Otay Ranch. The Subregional Plan generally designates Village 14 and Planning
28 Areas 16/19 for development but acknowledges that project-level development approvals cannot
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

occur until after the County considers and addresses site-specific concerns related to such
2 development. While other portions of the Subregional Plan have been developed in the decades

3 since 1993, Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 have not.

4 41. In the General Plan, the County committed to preparing a climate change action

5 plan with detailed GHG emissions reduction targets and deadlines and comprehensive and

6 enforceable GHG emissions reduction measures that will achieve specified quantities of GHG
7 reductions. As mitigation for the harm to the climate from GHG emissions that would be caused

8 by development anticipated by the General Plan, the County adopted Mitigation Measure CC-
1.2, which requires the preparation of : County Climate Change Action Plan ("CAP"). On June
10 20, 2012, the County adopted a CAP and Thresholds for determining the significance of GHG
11 emissions for CEQA purposes. This approval was successfully challenged by the Sierra Club in
12 2014.

13 42. In response, on February 14, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors adopted a
14 revised CAP, and associated EIR. The mitigation and monitoring program adopted by the
15 County pursuant to the EIR included mitigation measure M-GHG-1, which required certain
16 projects to mitigate GHG emissions by purchasing carbon offsets. Sierra Club again challenged
17 those approvals. On December 14, 2018, the San Diego Superior Court granted the Sierra Club's
18 petition to set aside the Revised CAP and Mitigation M-GHG-1, finding in part that Mitigation
19 M-GHG-1 conflicted with the County's General Plan and associated EIR by allowing purchase
20 of carbon offsets associated with carbon reduction projects located outside of the County.
21 43. A major goal of the General Plan is to create a housing stock at a a range of prices
22 (Goal H-1), especially to meet the County's Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocations for
23 lower income households. The Housing Element recognizes that one of the most promising
24 mechanisms for achieving this goal is requiring large-scale residential developers to provide
25 affordable housing. For this reason, Policy H-1.9 "[r]equires developers to provide an affordable
26 housing component when requesting a General Plan amendment for a large-scale residential
27 project when this is legally permissible."

28
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 44. In 2016, the state passed SB 1000, which requires counties to adopt an
2 environmental justice element in their general plans "upon the adoption or next revision of two
3 or more elements concurrently on or after January 1, 2018." In September 2018, the County
4 approved the Newland Sierra project, which included concurrent revisions to the Mobility
5 Element and the Land Use Element. The County also adopted other revisions to the General
6 Plan throughout 2018. However, the County has not adopted an environmental justice element.

7 B. Multiple Species Conservation Program ("MSCP")

8 45. In response to ongoing threats to federally and state listed endangered species and

9 continued development pressures, CDFW (then, the California Department of Fish and Game)
10 and USFWS prepared an MSCP Subregional Plan for San Diego County. The MSCP is a joint
11 Habitat Conservation Plan under federal law and Natural Community Conservation Plan under

12 state law. The MSCP established mechanisms to ensure the survival and recovery of certain
13 federally and state listed species while providing the County with limited "take" authorization
14 pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. section 1531 et seq., and the
15 California Endangered Species Act, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq. Notably, the
16 MSCP does not cover many sensitive species found on the Project site, including the Quino
17 checkerspot butterfly and the western spadefoot toad.
18 46. To implement the MSCP in the vicinity of the Project, the County and the City of
19 Chula Vista worked with CDFW and USFWS to prepare a MSCP Subarea Plan. The Project is
20 located within the "South County Segment" of the Subarea Plan.
21 47. CDFW approved the County's take permit pursuant to the Natural Community
22 Conservation Program Act (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.) on March 17, 1998. The
23 County also entered into an "Implementing Agreement" with CDFW and USFWS to establish
24 the agencies' roles and responsibilities for carrying out the MSCP and Subarea Plan. According
25 to CDFW, the County's Subarea Plan, the Implementing Agreement, and the incidental take
MSCP Preserve and mitigate for impacts to covered 26 permit obligates the County to assemble an
27 species and their habitats.

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

48. The MSCP and the Subarea Plan includes an open space preserve system that
2 differs from the one originally approved by the County as part of the County's General Plan
3 (specifically, in the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan). As part of a compromise with the County

4 and the original Otay Ranch developer, the MSCP expanded the preserve system to include
5 approximately 200 acres of central Proctor Valley (known as areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3) in
6 exchange for allowing for increased development in others. PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 are

7 designated in the Subarea Plan as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take
8 Permits' Will be Issued, " and are identified in the MSCP Subregional Plan and its EIR as "100
9 percent conserved," 99 meaning such lands fall within the designated "Hardline Preserve" area. In
10 exchange, the MSCP allowed significantly increased residential density in Otay Ranch Villages
11 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11, which the City of Chula Vista subsequently developed.
12 49. The EIR prepared for the MSCP also establishes preservation of areas PV-1, PV-2
13 and PV-3 as mitigation for the impacts of the development authorized by the MSCP.
14 50. The MSCP directed the County to modify its General Plan and the Otay Ranch
15 Specific Plan to reflect changes in development and open space designations incorporated in to
16 the MSCP and Subarea Plan. Indeed, both the County and the City of Chula Vista took the
17 necessary steps to remove other inconsistencies between the MSCP and their then-existing
18 general plans. However, without explanation or approval by the wildlife agencies, the County
19 never re-designated areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 in its General Plan.
20 C. Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy
21 51. The San Diego Association of Government ("SANDAG") is the federally
22 designated regional agency directing overall transportation infrastructure funding. Every four
23 years it prepares a Regional Transportation Plan ("RTP") for the entire County of San Diego.
24 After the enactment of SB 375 (Govt. Code 65080 et seq.), SANDAG has been required to
25 also prepare a Sustainable Community Strategy ("SCS"), setting out means for using
26 transportation projects and funding to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, and in
27 particular to reduce GHG emissions from driving. The RTP and SCS are a combined plan that is
28 applicable to the entire County, with numerous policies intended to ensure the County
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

effectively addresses climate change impacts from transportation and land use by planning in a
2 manner that limits sprawl and reduces vehicle miles traveled.

III. History of the Village 14 Project.

52. On November 15, 2016, Jackson Pendo submitted an application for the Village
14 Project. The Project is a sprawling residential community located on a 1,284-acre site, with
1,119 single-family homes and "ranchettes," 10,000 square feet of commercial space, and
associated development. Discretionary approvals associated with the Village 14 Project include
amendments to the San Diego County General Plan Land Use Element and Mobility Element,
the combined Otay Ranch Development Plan/Otay Subregional Plan, a specific plan, a zone
10 reclassification, and a tentative map.

11 53. Between December 15, 2016 and January 23, 2017, the County circulated a notice
12 of preparation ("NOP") for the Draft Environmental Impact Report. CDFW commented on the
13 NOP, noting that the development footprint included areas designated in the MSCP Subarea
14 Plan as "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will Be Issued" and that a proposed
15 alternative involving exchange of CDFW preserve lands would not be feasible.
16 54. On March 1, 2018, the County released the draft environmental impact report
17 ("DEIR") for the Project. Despite CDFW's comments on the NOP, the document defined the
18 Project as the development of Village 14, 16 and 19 (including areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3)
19 with up to 1,119 single-family residential units on nearly 1,300 acres. The proposed Project did
20 not include any affordable housing component.

21 55. The analysis contained in the DEIR was deeply flawed. For instance, despite
22 Proctor Valley's significant ecology importance and the numerous sensitive species that the
23 Project would harm, the DEIR concluded that all impacts to biological resources would be less
24 than significant. Similarly, despite the extreme fire risk at the Project site and the foreseeable
25 ignition and evacuation risks that the Project would create, the DEIR concluded that these
26 impacts would be less than significant as well.
27 56. Petitioners and numerous other agencies, organizations, and individuals
28 commented on the DEIR. For instance, CDFW submitted extensive comments on the proposed
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

Project's conflict with the MSCP and associated documents and the Project's likely adverse

2 impacts on many special status plants and animals. USFWS likewise commented that "based on

3 materials presented in MSCP documents, [PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3] should be treated as
preserve," as they were "established to protect a wildlife corridor and large blocks of coastal
sage scrub, important for coastal California gnatcatcher." The San Diego Association of
Governments also submitted a comment letter questioning whether the proposed Project was
consistent with land use principles that preserve natural resources and limit urban sprawl, such
8 as those found in the General Plan, Climate Action Plan, and RTP/SCS.

9 57. On Aril 16, 2018, EHL and CNPS submitted extensive comments on the DEIR.
10 These comments included:

11 a. Jackson Pendo proposes to build at least 340 new homes in areas PV-1, PV-
12 2, and PV-3, which were set aside for preservation in the County's MSCP and Subarea Plan.
13 The County is prohibited from approving this development under the Fish and Game Code, the
14 MSCP, the Subarea Plan and its associated Implementing Agreement.
15 b. The DEIR fails to accurately describe the Project, including the necessity of
16 an MSCP amendment to develop areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3.

17 C. The DEIR fails to assess the consistency of the Project with the MSCP and
18 Subarea Plan, including is protection of areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3.

19 d. The County proposes to modify mitigation measures established for the
20 MSCP without following the process required by CEQA.
21 e. The DEIR unlawfully relies on the MSCP for mitigation for the Project's
22 biological resource impacts, as the Project is inconsistent with the MSCP.
23 f. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze, mitigate, and avoid direct, indirect,
24 and cumulative impacts to sensitive biological resources, including the western spadefoot toad,
25 the Quino checkerspot butterfly, otay tarplant, and the Golden Eagle.
26 g. The DEIR relied on flawed surveys for many biological resources,
27 including inappropriate survey periods for the Quino checkerspot butterfly and numerous
28 sensitive plant species, and on excessively fast field surveys that could not possibly identify
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

many of the small sensitive plants that likely occupy the Project site. The DEIR further
2 misidentifies high-value sensitive coastal sage scrub communities on the Project site as
3 degraded.

4 h. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze, mitigate, and avoid climate change
5 impacts. For example, the DEIR relies extensively on a carbon offset program to purportedly

6 reduce climate change impacts to a less-than-significant level. However, the carbon offset
7 program is riddled with problems, including its allowance of out-of-county offsets, its lack of

8 assurance that offsets will be "additional," its reliance on programs that may be ineffective or
unenforceable, and its inclusion of a provision that allows the applicant to ratchet down the
10 required number of offsets.

11 i. The DEIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's consistency with the
12 San Diego Association of Government's RTP/SCS, which is intended to reduce VMT and
13 promote more compact development.

14 j. The DEIR does not adequately analyze the impacts due to increased
15 wildfire risk, or the effects on evacuation, created by bringing thousands of new people and
16 significant development to an undeveloped area, and fails to mitigate or avoid such impacts. For
17 instance, the DEIR relies on faulty modeling assumptions and inaccurate or incomplete
18 information and therefore incorrectly concludes that the Project-which is in a very high fire
19 hazard severity zone-will result in less-than-significant wildfire impacts. In addition, the
20 County's wildfire evacuation plan relies on wildly optimistic assumptions, incorrect
21 information, and flawed traffic modeling; even with these errors, the technical appendix still
22 reveals that the evacuation plan will not always work.
23 k. The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Project's
24 direct and cumulative impacts on water supply. The DEIR assumes that the relevant water
25 agencies will have sufficient water for this Project; however, available evidence indicates that
26 the San Diego region will face a significant water shortage-exacerbated by this Project and
27 other cumulative projects-in the long term.

28
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1. The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Project's
2 water quality impacts, especially on Jamul Creek and Lower Otay Reservoirs, both impaired

3 water bodies.

m. The DEIR's analysis of energy impacts ignores the inefficient and wasteful
use of gasoline and diesel fuel necessitated by the Project's far-flung location.

n. The DEIR fails to accurately describe, analyze, or mitigate the Project's
aesthetic impacts, particularly for motorists on Proctor Valley Road (a designated scenic
8 highway), visitors to nearby trails and recreation areas, and for area nighttime views.

0. The DEIR's analysis of alternatives violates CEQA. The DEIR does not
10 consider a reasonable range of alternatives, instead setting up a fictitious straw-man alternative
11 and a land exchange alternative that increases rather than decreases the Project's significant
12 impacts. It also fails to adequately evaluate an off-site alternative.
13 p. Finally, EHL noted that given the significant flaws, CEQA required the
14 EIR to be recirculated for additional public comment prior to bringing the Project forward to the
15 Board of Supervisors.

16 58. On information and belief, Jackson Pendo had meetings with CDFW and USFWS
17 following the submission of the agencies' comments on the DEIR.

18 59. In the months following the release of the DEIR, Petitioners provided additional
19 comments as new issues arose.

20 a. For instance, on July 24, 2018, EHL submitted a letter to the County
21 regarding the potential cumulative impacts-including air quality, wildfire risk, GHG emissions,
22 and energy consumption-resulting from the approval of Village 14 in conjunction with the
23 approval or potential future approval of nine other major residential projects totaling nearly
24 15,000 residential units. Not one of these units is designated as affordable.
25 b. This letter also objected to the County's record retention policy. Petitioners
26 are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, throughout the administrative process
27 for the Village 14 Project and other projects, the County used a document management system
28 that automatically deleted e-mails and other records after 60 days, including e-mails and records
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

related to the Village 14 Project that are required to be included in the administrative record for
2 this case.

3 C. On August 3, 2018, EHL submitted a letter to the County explaining that it
4 could not rely on certain provisions of the Implementing Agreement to skirt the need for MSCP

5 amendments prior to approval of the Project.

60. In September 2018, the County released the Final EIR ("FEIR"). Despite the
7 significant and fundamental flaws identified in the DEIR, the FEIR contained only limited
8 revisions. The Project's key components remained unchanged.
9 61. On October 19, 2018, the Planning Commission considered the Project, ultimately
10 voting 5-1 to recommend approval. EHL and other concerned parties participated in the
11 Planning Commission hearing.
12 62. In early November 2018, the town of Paradise, California suffered a catastrophic,
13 wind-driven wildfire that took the lives of 85 people. News reports highlighted the difficulty of
14 evacuating in a fast-moving conflagration and the ineffectiveness of fire hardening, defensible
15 space, and shelter-in-place plans. On December 5, 2018, EHL requested a reassessment of the
16 County's approach for Village 14, considering the information emerging from Paradise.
17 63. In mid-May, the County set the Project for hearing before the Board of
18 Supervisors on June 26, 2019.
19 64. On June 12, 2019, just two weeks before the scheduled hearing, the County
a 20 released a new version of the FEIR. The County had made substantive modifications to EIR
21 sections on Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Transportation and Traffic as well as to the
22 proposed mitigation measures and the County's response to public comments.
23 65. On June 19, 2019, EHL submitted comments on these new documents, outlining
24 the continued flaws in the County's FEIR and the Project's ongoing inconsistencies with state
25 law and relevant plans. The letter addressed the County's response to EHL's submission on the
26 DEIR by providing additional information, expert testimony, and legal argument, and explaining
27 why the County's responses to comments were inadequate. The letter responded to new issues
28. raised by the County's responses and/or revisions. For example,
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

a. The FEIR incorrectly suggests that the voluntary carbon offsets proposed as
2 mitigation for the Project have been "approved" by the California Air Resources Board.
b. The FEIR erroneously calculates and proposes mitigation for only the first
30 years of Project emissions, even though the Project's residences and infrastructure will have
a much longer lifespan.

C. The FEIR's revision to its analysis of impacts to western spadefoot toad
reveal that the Project will destroy more breading pools than disclosed in the DEIR. Rather than

8 addressing this new impact or addressing the original flaws in the analysis, the FEIR falsely
concludes that Project impacts remain less than significant.
10 d. The FEIR fails to consider new information related to the ineffectiveness of
11 hardscaping, fire-resistant structures, and evacuation plans in wind-driving wildfires. Instead,
12 the FEIR continues to maintain that the Fire Protection Plan and Wildfire Evacuation Plan-

13 which rely almost exclusively on these techniqueswill be sufficient to address all potential
14 impacts from wildfire.

15 e. The FEIR rejects the Alternative Site Location-which would reduce
16 several the Project's significant impacts-as infeasible without adequate analysis or substantial
17 evidence.

18 f. The Project does not include any affordable housing, contrary to the
19 requirements found in the County's General Plan.
20 66. On or around June 19, 2019, just one week before the hearing, the County released
21 significant new information about the Project. For instance, the agenda and staff report indicated
22 that in addition to the Project analyzed in the EIR, the County would also be considering
23 approval of a "Dispute Resolution Agreement" ("DRA") with Jackson Pendo, CDFW and
24 USFWS, which would obligate the County and the agencies to facilitate approval of an entirely
25 new project, which had never been disclosed to the public or analyzed under CEQA, and which
26 would allow development of PV-2, portions of PV-3, and a portion of the Rancho Jamul
27 Ecological Reserve, currently owned by the State.

28
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

1 67. EHL submitted additional letters to the Board and CDFW on June 21, 2019 and
2 June 25, 2019 which commented on this new information and on the Count's proposed Findings
3 of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations in support of Project approval. Specifically,

4 EHL commented that:

5 a. The County's Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations

6 are not supported by substantial evidence and do not supply the logical step between the
7 Findings and the facts in the record.

8 b. The new project set forth in the DRA has not been adequately described in
9 the County's FEIR, leading to an unclear and shifting project description.

10 C. The new project set forth in the DRA would allow development of PV-2
11 and PV-3, in conflict with the MSCP and the Subarea Plan.

12 68. On June 26, 2019, CDFW sent a letter to the Board stating that the Department's
13 concerns with the proposed Project-including its inconsistency with the MSCP and the
.14 Subarea Planremained.

15 69. On June 26, 2019, at a public hearing before the Board, Supervisor Dianne Jacob,
16 who represents the district where the Project is located, made the following observation:
17 "[A]though our experts can plan and put out exactly how this might happen as far as
18 evacuations, and you can build houses that are as foolproof as possible from fire, bottom line,
19 there's no guarantee. When those Santa Ana winds come, and they come fast and they come
20 furious. . . . People panic, and they don't always do what the plan is laid out to do."
21 Nevertheless, the Board voted 3-2 to approve the Project. The Board also approved the DRA.
22 70. On June 27, 2019, the County filed a Notice of Determination for the Project.
23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Violations of CEQA - Against All Respondents

25 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq; State & County CEQA Guidelines;
26 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)

27 71. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
28 in their entirety.
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

72. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
2 environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute,
including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant
4 environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the
5 decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
6 proposed project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are

7 based on substantial evidence in the record.

8 73. Additionally, the EIR must identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or
avoid the project's significant environmental impacts, as well as analyze a reasonable range of
10 alternatives to the project. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible
11 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental
12| impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant
13 level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is
14 available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant
15 environmental impacts.
16 74. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would have
17 significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
18 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.
19 75. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must
20 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. State law
21 further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
22 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

23 76. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
24 by certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and
25 the CEQA Guidelines. The inadequacies in the County's analysis include, but are not limited to,
26 failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the following impacts:
27 a. Biological resources, including special status species;
28 b. Fire safety;
21

C.

2 Climate change/greenhouse gases;

d. Air quality;

3 e. Water supply;
D f. Water quality/hydrology;

g. Energy consumption;

h. Aesthetics;

i. Traffic; and

8 j. Land Use.

77. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
10 by providing an inadequate and inaccurate description of the environmental setting of the
11| Project area.

12 78. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
13 by providing an inadequate, inaccurate, and unstable description the Project.
14 79.

15 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately consider the cumulative and growth-inducing
16 impacts of the Project.
17 80.

18 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and violated CEQA
by relying on ineffective, unenforceable, unproven, and/or improperly deferred mitigation
19 measures to reduce Project impacts, including mitigation for greenhouse gas impacts, wildfire
20 impacts, and impacts to biological resources. The mitigation measures for greenhouse gas
21 impacts are the same or similar to those adopted in the County's February 14, 2018 Climate
22 Action Plan, which was successfully challenged in Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (San
23

24 Diego Sup. Ct. Case No. 37-2012-101054-CU-TT-CTL).

81. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to consider feasible Project alternatives
25 that would have reduced significant impacts while still meeting Project objectives and by
26 improperly rejecting certain alternatives. Similarly, Respondents violated CEQA by adopting
27 overly narrow Project objectives.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 22

Case No.

82. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

2 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

3 83. Respondents violated CEQA Guidelines section 15088(c) by failing to adequately
4 respond to public comments.
84. Respondents violated CEQA by modifying or ignoring previously adopted
mitigation measures without following the procedure established by CEQA.

85. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft

8 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the EIR must be amended and
9 recirculated for public review and comment. The County failed to recirculate the EIR as
10 required by law here. For instance, the County continued to add information to the EIR up until
11 the date of Project approval but did not recirculate the EIR for additional public comment.
12 86. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
13 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by certifying an EIR, making
14 findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As
15 such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violation of CEQA and County Requirements - Administrative Record - Against All
18 Respondents

19 (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; County Policies; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)
20 87. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
21 in their entirety.

22 88. Respondents violated state and local law, including Public Resources Code section
23 21167.6(e) and County Board of Supervisors Resolution 17-170 and Policy A-129, by failing to
24 retain all records necessary for a complete administrative record in a CEQA action. Petitioners

25 are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that, throughout the administrative process
26 for the Project, the County deleted records related to the Project that were required to be
27 included in the administrative record for this case.

28
23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

89. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the

2 manner required by law by failing to preserve records necessary for lawful CEQA review. As

3 such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law - Against All Respondents
(Gov. Code § 65300 et seq.; CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)
90. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
in their entirety.
91. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to
10 adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan serves as a
11 charter for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform. DeVita v.
12 County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773.
13 92. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that decisions about growth "should be
14 guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan." Government Code
15 section 65300.5 requires that the local general plan be "integrated, internally consistent and
16 compatible." Courts have held that land use decisions must be consistent with the general plan.
17 Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806. State
18 Planning and Zoning Law requires compliance with all General Plan policies that are
19 "fundamental, mandatory, and specific." Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County v.
20 Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1342; Spring Valley Lake Assn v. City of
21 Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 100-101.
22 93. The County violated the requirements of state law by approving a project that is
23 inconsistent with the requirements of the County's General Plan. For example, and as described
24 above, the Project is inconsistent with:
25 a. Policies requiring that carbon offset projects be located in the County.
26 These policies include but are not limited to Goal COS-20 and Policy COS-20.1.
27 b. Policies requiring provision of an affordable housing program when a
28 project requires a General Plan amendment. These policies include, but are not limited to, H-1.9.
24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

94. SB 1000 also requires the County to adopt an "environmental justice element, or
the environmental justice goals, policies, and objectives in other elements" in 2018 after it
amends two or more elements of its General Plan. The County amended its General Plan more
than twice in 2018, but it has failed to adopt an environmental justice element or environmental
goals and policies in its General Plan. Until it does so, the County lacks a legally adequate
General Plan. Thus, the County's approval of the Project in reliance on the General Plan is
unlawful.

95. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project, making
10 findings, and taking related actions that do not comply with the County's General Plan and State
11 Planning and Zoning Law. As such, Respondents' approval of the Project must be set aside.
12 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Violation of NCCP Act, MSCP, Related Plans and Agreements - Against All Respondents
14 (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq-; CCP §S 1085, 1094.5)
15 96. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
16 in their entirety.

17 97. CDFW approved the MSCP, a natural community conservation plan, for the
18 region in which the Project is located, pursuant to the Natural Community Conservation Plan
19 Act, Fish and Game Code section 2800 et seq. The MSCP includes both a Subarea Plan and an
20 Implementing Agreement with the County. Pursuant to these documents, CDFW approved the
21 County's incidental take permit on March 17, 1998.

22 98. The MSCP and related plans and agreements require the preservation of areas PV-
23 1, PV-2, and PV-3. For instance, the Subarea Plan designates areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 as
24 "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will be Issued."
25 Likewise, the MSCP and its EIR designate areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 as "100 percent
26 conserved," meaning such lands fall within the designated "Hardline Preserve" area.
27 99. Consequently, the County had a mandatory duty not to approve development in
28 areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. For instance, the associated Implementing Agreement obligates the
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Case No.

County to exercise its authority to comply with the terms of the MSCP and ensure that lands

2 identified for preservation in "under the Subarea Plan are conserved in perpetuity."
Implementing Agreement § 9.18 This provision is consistent with the Fish and Game Code,
which requires implementing agreements to prohibit parties from "adopting, amending, or
approving any plan or project without the concurrence of the wildlife agencies that is
inconsistent with the objectives and requirements." Fish and Game Code § 2820(b)(3)(C)).
100. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project, which
permits development of areas PV-1, PV-2 and PV-3. As such, Respondents' approval of the
10 Project and Dispute Resolution Agreement must be set aside.
11 101. The MSCP also requires that the County amend its general plan and zoning
12 ordinances to obtain consistency with the Subarea Plan, including eliminating land use
13 designations authorizing development of areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. The County has not done
14 SO in the more than 20 years since the MSCP was adopted. Petitioners are entitled to a writ of
15 mandate compelling the performance of this specific act.
16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

18 1. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to vacate and set
19 aside its certification of the EIR and Project approvals;
20 2. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply with
21 the requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan, the Fish
22 and Game Code, the MSCP, and to take any other action as required by Public Resources Code
23 section 21168.9;

24 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
25 injunctions restraining the County and Real Party in Interest and their agents, servants, and
26 employees, and all others acting in concert with the County on their behalf, from taking any
27 action to implement the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the
28 CEQA Guidelines, State law, and the County Code;
