28

PARTIES HN0 t0O0 • 1. Petitioner Save the El Dorado Canal ("STEC") is a grass-roots organization
established to promote quality local land use and development, as well as to preserve a healthy
human and natural environment in the area around the El Dorado Canal (also referred to as the
"Upper Main Ditch"). STEC and its members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest
in ensuring that EID complies with the laws relating to environmental protection. Members of
STEC live, work and recreate in El Dorado County and throughout the areas that will be
impacted by the Project. The interests of STEC will be harmed by the Project unless court

9 action is taken and Petitioner's requested relief is granted.

10 2. Respondent Defendant EI Dorado Irrigation District is an irrigation special district

11 organized and existing under the California Irrigation District Law (Water Code $20500, et

12 seq.) and authorizing statutes (Water Code §22975, et seq.). The District serves approximately

13 110,000 residents in northern California's El Dorado County. The District provides irrigation

14 water, drinking water, recycled water, and wastewater treatment services, and operates a

15 hydroelectric power project. The District acted as the lead agency for the Upper Main Ditch

16 Piping Project, and Respondent El Dorado Irrigation District Board of Directors approved the

17 Project in that capacity, as indicated in the April 22, 2019 Notice of Determination for the

18 Project.

19 3. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20 and

20 21 through 40, inclusive, and sues such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names.

21 Petitioner is informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that fictitiously named

22 Respondents also are responsible for all acts and omissions described herein. When the true

23 identities and capacities of Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of

24 Court if necessary, amend this Petition to include such identities and capacities.

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 4. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

27 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

28 alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

- Public Resources Code section 21168. The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief

2 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 and injunctive relief pursuant to Code of
00 74 00 co Civil Procedure section 525 et seq.

5. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California
in and for the County of El Dorado pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil

Procedure.

BACKGROUND FACTS

6. EID is a public water agency located in El Dorado County, and the District's

9 system contains more than 1,250 miles of pipe, 27 miles of ditches, five water treatment plants,

10 and 37 storage tanks and/or reservoirs. The Project proposes to convert the existing "Upper

11 Main Ditch" from an open and unlined conveyance to an underground raw water transmission

12 pipeline. The existing ditch is approximately 14- to 20-feet wide, including the berm, and up to

13 five feet in depth and delivers a maximum of 15,080 acre-feet annually (afa) of raw water

14 supplies from the El Dorado Forebay Reservoir (Forebay) near the community of Pollock

15 Pines to the District's Reservoir 1 water treatment plant (a distance of approximately three

16 miles) where it is then treated and distributed throughout the District's public drinking water

17 system.

18 7. The Upper Main Ditch passes through private property. The District has

19 easements across these private properties for the purpose of owning and operating the ditch as

20 part of its water supply system. A four- to five-foot wide path runs atop the outer ditch berm

21 for District maintenance purposes, and members of the public utilize this bench for recreational

22 purposes. The Upper Main Ditch typically conveys raw water supplies during the spring and

23 summer months, and is shut down for varying periods of time in the fall and winter months for

24 maintenance.

25 8. The District asserts that because the Upper Main Ditch is unlined and uncovered,

26 a portion of the water conveyed through the ditch is lost to seepage and evapotranspiration.

27 The District also has identified the objective of improving water quality by piping the water

3 28 that now flows in the Upper Main Ditch.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

9. The project alternative approved by the District Board is the "Blair Road
Alternative." The Project involves installation of an underground pipeline beginning at the
m 7 1 00 0 District's Forebay Valve House and across District property to Blair Road. The pipeline will be
installed within the Blair Road right of way for approximately 8,200 feet and then within the
existing ditch for approximately 1,500 feet, then approximately 2,200 feet across private
property to the Reservoir 1 Water Treatment Plant.

10. The District will be required to obtain new easements across private parcels to
provide the District with the right to install, maintain, and operate the pipeline.

9 11. The Blair Road alternative will require the removal of approximately 145 trees.

10 12. The Blair Road alternative will require that the pipeline cross under Blair Bridge.

11 13. The Draft EIR for the Project states that "It]he transition between the non-

12 constructed sections of the ditch and constructed sections of the ditch would leave a graded

13 slope in place to allow normal gravity flow of stormwater within the channel to be conveyed as

14 under the current (No Project) conditions.

15 14. The Upper Main Ditch is part of an irrigation ditch system known as the Main

16 Ditch. The Main Ditch is divided into 3 major reaches known as the Upper Main Ditch, the

17 Middle Main Ditch and the Lower Main Ditch. The District abandoned most of the Middle

18 Main Ditch and the Lower Main Ditch in approximately 2005.

19 15. The District's records indicate that the abandonment was "part of a larger District-

20 wide conservation strategy to eliminate, where possible, delivery of water in open earthen

21 ditches susceptible to high rates of seepage and evapotranspiration."

22 16. The District's records also state that the Upper Main Ditch is approximately 3

23 miles in length and carries water diverted from Forebay Reservoir and also "intercepts

24 approximately 378 acres of the Long Canyon and Iowa Canyon watersheds."

25 17. Since EID abandoned the Middle Main Ditch and Lower Main Ditch, storm water

26 conveyance has been compromised by accumulated vegetation and other debris in the

27 abandoned portions of the ditch.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

P 18. The District's own experts confirmed in a report during the Main Ditch

2 abandonment process that the Main Ditch system operates as the storm water collection system
NOu A w for a large watershed. The ditch system completely disrupted the natural drainage, and the
District was warned that any changes to the system would require consideration of existing
drainage patterns and level of flood protection along the ditch.

19. The District has known since at least 2005 that the Main Ditch system had altered
the natural drainage in such a way that the entire system was serving to collect and convey
co surface waters for a large watershed.

20. the capacity to 9 The District asserts that the "ditch would continue to have

10 passively receive and convey stormwater flows during storm events. Except where the Blair
11 Road Alternative would be located within the existing ditch corridor, the District would no

12 longer use the existing ditch under this alternative. As such, the District's existing easements

13 across private parcels to own and operate the unused portions of the ditch would revert to the

14 underlying property owners. The District would take appropriate future maintenance actions

15 within its pipeline easement rights to maintain the ditch as necessary to protect and maintain

16 District facilities."

17 21. The District will abandon its easements to the Upper Main Ditch (other than the

18 areas where the new pipeline will exist within the old ditch), and the abandoned sections of the

19 Upper Main Ditch will be subject to being clogged with debris or filled in by property owners,
20 and so the statement that the Upper Main Ditch would continue to have the capacity to
21 "passively receive and convey stormwater flows" is without any basis in fact.

22 22. El Dorado County commented on the Draft EIR and stated as follows: "The

23 County believes that the Proposed Project and the Blair Road Alternative would reduce the

24 capacity of the ditch to convey surface runoff at historic levels. Runoff events larger than the
25 10-year design event would have the potential to trigger these potential impacts. The effects of

26 these changes should be analyzed in greater detail in the EIR." The County asserted that a
27 more robust mitigation strategy is required. The District declined to respond to the County's
28 requests for additional evaluation and development of mitigation measures.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

- 23. On June 18, 2018, the District issued a Draft EIR for the Project. Petitioner and

2 many others submitted extensive comments on the Draft EIR. After a public meeting on June 27
00 7 1 00 00 2018, the District extended the review and comment period to September 18, 2018. The District
received approximately 200 comment letters/emails from approximately 90 individuals or
organizations during the comment period.

24. On January 9, 2019, the District staff met with El Dorado County staff to discuss
the County's significant concerns about the Project and the Draft EIR. In addition to the
County's concerns about the Project's destruction of stormwater collection and conveyance, and

9 the resulting damage that will occur, the County also raised concerns regarding impacts to oak

10 trees.

11 25. On January 14, 2019, the District Board of Directors formed a Main Ditch ad hoc

12 committee, consisting of Directors Dwyer and Osborne, for purposes of meeting with members

13 of the community regarding the Project.

14 26. On January 25,2019, the District issued the Notice of Completion of the final EIR.

15 The final EIR provides documentation of the comments received on the draft EIR, the District's

16 responses to comments, text revisions to the draft EIR, additional information, and the

17 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.

18 27. The District's Main Ditch ad hoc committee met with representatives of STEC on

19 four occasions (March 11, March 19, March 25, and April 9,2019) regarding the Project. By

20 agreement of the parties, the discussions at those meetings were subject to a confidentiality

21 agreement.

22 28. On April 22, 2019, the a District held a public hearing on the Project, heard

23 presentations from staff, and heard public testimony. The District approved the Blair Road

24 Alternative of the Project and certified the EIR.

25 29. On April 22, 2019, the District filed a Notice of Determination as provided for in

26 Public Resources Code, section 21152.

27 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

6 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

• AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY -N0tO N 30. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required
by law.

31. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all
deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral
c and written comments on the Project, and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this

9 Petition.

10 32. The District has taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and approving the
11 Project. The District has a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but
12 not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.

13 Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other
14 than by means of this lawsuit.

15 33. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section
16 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the District. A copy of this written notice

17 and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

18 34. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by
19 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

20 proceedings relating to this action. A copy of this request is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
21 35. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the District to set aside their
23 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, the

24 Districts' approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

25 36. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

26 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because
Petitioner's aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected
by the District's certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

38. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code
section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to

9 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions here in
question.

10

11 39. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

12 Petitioner brings this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil

13 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

14 affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a

15 significant a benefit on a large class of persons by ensuring that Respondent District does not

16 approve the Project in the absence of lawful environmental review and compliance with
applicable law.

17

18 40. MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA

19 CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse

20 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing

21 the significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

41.

22 The EIR is an informational document that must disclose any potentially

23 significant environmental impacts of the project, and inform decision-makers and the general

24 public of mitigation measures and alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially
lessen those impacts.

25 42.

26 CEQA is designed to ensure that the public lead agency identifies all potentially

27 significant environmental impacts of a proposed project, adequately discloses those impacts to

28 the public, and implements all feasible alternatives or mitigation measures necessary to avoid

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

or substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21100; CEQA
NmT.0 Guidelines §§ 15126.6, 15370.)

43. It is improper for an EIR to defer its analysis or the formulation of mitigation
measures until after certification of the EIR and approval of the project, and mitigation
measures must be enforceable and contain specific performance standards.

44. The EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the project that may be "cumulatively
considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of

co past, current, and probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines $$15064(h)(1), 15130(a),

9 15355.)

10 45. When significant new information is added to a final EIR, CEQA requires that the

11 lead agency recirculate the EIR for additional public review and comment. (Pub. Resources

12 Code §21092.1; CEQA Guidelines $15088.5(a).)

13 46. A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project with significant

14 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. These include

15 findings that changes or alterations have been required that mitigate or avoid the project's

16 significant effects on the environment or that specific considerations render the mitigation

17 measures or alternatives "infeasible" but that the benefits of the project nonetheless outweigh

18 the project's significant environmental effects. The lead agency's findings must be supported

19 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources Code §21081; CEQA

20 Guidelines §§15091-15093.)

21 47. CEQA requires agencies to consider "reasonable range of alternatives that will

22 foster informed decisionmaking and public participation." (CEQA Guidelines $ 15126.6 (a);

23 Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866,

24 885.)

25 48. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes a prejudicial

26 abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, regardless

27 of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those

28 requirements in the first place. (Pub. Resources Code §21005.) Abuse of discretion is

9 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or, if the agency's
determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
0 710 (Pub. Resources Code §§21168, 21168.5.)
Failure to include essential information in the EIR is a failure to proceed in the
manner required by law. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 49.

Acting as the CEQA lead agency, the District had a mandatory duty to comply Cal.5th 918.)

co with CEQA prior to approving the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION a Abuse of Discretion 10

Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq. =
12 51. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
13 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 50.

14 52. In approving the Project as described herein, EID prejudicially abused its

15 discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code of

16 Civil Procedure section 1094.5, because EID certified an EIR that fails to include information

17 necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation, including

18 information necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the Project's

19 environmental impacts, the effectiveness of mitigation measures to avoid the Project's

20 significant environmental impacts, or feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's

21 significant environmental impacts; because the EIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's

22 cumulative effects; because the EIR fails to use the best available information and/or accepted

23 methodology for analyzing information; because the Final EIR fails to provide good faith

24 responses to comments on the Draft EIR; because EID failed and refused to provide a stable,

25 finite Project description by obscuring the fact that the Main Ditch system is functionally the

26 drainage system for a large watershed, and replaced the natural drainage system when the Main

27 Ditch was constructed. EID's Findings do not disclose this fact nor include any findings

28 regarding the fact that the only functional drainage system for collecting and conveying

10 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

stormwater will be abandoned and will not be maintained nor kept functional. With respect to

a0 A w the findings required by CEQA, EID failed to make required findings, failed to support the
findings with substantial evidence, and failed to disclose the analytic route showing how the
evidence supports the findings.

53. Petitioner alleges that EID violated CEQA as detailed in a number of comment

0o letters submitted by Petitioner and others during the administrative review process. Petitioner
intends to prosecute all of the alleged violations of CEQA described herein and in the

9 documents submitted by Petitioner during the administrative review process. By way of

10 illustration, and without limitation, Petitioner alleges the following violations of CEQA by the
District:

11 I.

12 The EIR for the Project contains an inaccurate Project Description
54.

13 As set forth above, the EIR contains a project description that does not disclose

14 the fact that the District's plan to abandon the Upper Main Ditch and quitclaim its easement

15 rights to private property owners will result in the only existing stormwater collection and

16 conveyance system for the area becoming clogged and unable to drain floodwaters away.
55.

17 The District asserts that it is not required to continue to maintain the ditch, but the

18 intentional acts of the District in abandoning the only stormwater drainage system in the area

19 will result in harm to neighbors through future flooding and other malfunctions. This is a

20 critical aspect of the Project description.
II.

21 The EIR's impacts analysis is insufficient

A.

22 Impacts to recreation

56.

23 The Draft EIR for the Project includes an unsupported assumption that there is

24 "no right of public access" along the ditch. The DEIR goes on to qualify this statement as

25 follows: "However, a four- to five-foot side bench runs atop the outer ditch berm for District

26 maintenance purposes, and the District is informed that some members of the public utilize this
bench as a path."

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 11

57. The public has been using the path along the ditch for recreational purposes for
decades, without challenge and without obtaining permission from the landowners, and has a
62 7 1000∞ right to continue to do so.

58. In response to comments, the District continued to ignore this situation, claiming
that "the District is not aware of any legal document that grants or recognizes such public
access." The trails along the District's irrigation canals have been impliedly dedicated to the
public if they were used continuously a for a period of five years anytime before 1972. (Friends
of the Trails v. Blasius (2000) 78 Cal.App. 4th 810.) The District must take into account the

9 public nature of the trail, and the recreational and aesthetic impacts of the Project.

community, and 10 59. The canal a is a historic, scenic, and recreational resource in the

- ~ the EIR fails to take any of this into account.

B. Impacts to wetlands
13 60. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") submitted comments
14 on the Draft EIR, and the District improperly ignored many of them. For example, with

15 respect to the requirement for a Streambed Alteration Agreement for the Project, CDFW stated

16 as follows:

17 Lake and Streambed Alteration
Page 32 of the project's Initial Study states, "If either of the two pipeline alignments with portions located outside of the
18 Upper Main Ditch are chosen, then the District would acquire a Streambed Alteration Agreement (SAA) from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) per Fish and Game Code, Section 1600 et. seq." Because the ditch is
19 hydrologically connected to natural streams, conveys some natural flow, and provides wildlife habitat and resources, the Department strongly recommends that EID submit a Notification of Lake or Streambed Alteration prior to
20 beginning any activity subject to notiflcation under FGC section 1602 et seq, regardless of the pipeline's ultimate alignment. The jurisdictional delineation prepared for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) for the project should 21 not be used to evaluate the project's impacts to streambed and riparian habitat because the specific methods used by the USACOE to delineate Waters of the U.S. (such as use of ordinary high water mark) often exclude fish and wildlife 22 resources that may be impacted by activities subject to notification under FGC section 1602.

23 61. The District's response to the CDFW's comment was that it is "acknowledged"
24 but then goes on to say that "the District has determined that no potentially jurisdictional
25 features would be affected under the Project."
26 62. The District relied upon a delineation for jurisdictional waters that the CDFW said
27 should not be used because it did not contain reliable information.

63. Additionally, there are new State Wetland Guidelines' in place that the District -

2 failed to address in the environmental analysis for the Project, and the Project will result in
m 7.00 impacts to adjacent wetlands. The EIR should have been revised to include analysis with the
new State Wetland Guidelines and recirculated for review by responsible agencies and the
public.

64. EID improperly refused to consult with CDFW despite the fact that CDFW
requested consultation. CDFW stated that the Draft EIR should be revised to identify the
cg perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral rivers, streams, and lakes within the Project footprint

9 and any associated fish and wildlife habitats, and to fully evaluate the foreseeable impacts and

10 include specific mitigation measures, and EID chose not to do so.

C. Impacts to biological resources = 12 65. Many comments were submitted about the biological impacts of removing a water

13 source that has been flowing in the canal for over 150 years. The District responded in general

14 terms about the location of habitat, and also asserts that because of variable flow patterns, the

15 canal has not created any riparian or other habitat. The District also deferred to the Responsible

16 agency, concluding that there would not be a significant impact because it will be regulated by

17 CDFW through the 1602 process. (Id.) In response to CDFW, however, the District said that it

18 would not need to participate in the 1602 process and would not need a Streambed Alteration

19 Agreement. Under any of these scenarios, EID was required to analyze the impact and it was

20 improper to rely upon the possibility that another agency might become involved.

66. The Upper Main Ditch is hydrologically connected to natural watercourses. 21

22 Further, the Upper Main Ditch has been in place long enough to be treated under the law as a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 68. The EIR fails to adequately analyze tree mortality that will result from removing a
N0 v.00 cc 150-year old water supply. The EIR discusses only construction impacts but fails to evaluate
the long-term impacts of the Project on biological resources; the Project will have long-term
impacts on habitat for raptors and other birds, as well as other species. Also, the Project's
impacts associated with tree mortality were not adequately addressed in the EIR.

69. The EIR fails to include any expert assessment of tree impacts beyond a cursory
"walk through", but instead relies simply on a predicted number of trees that will be removed
as a result of the Project, with unsupported conclusions regarding the significance of this

9 impact.

10 70. CDFW also stated that the Draft EIR should be revised to include additional

11 analysis for foothill yellow-legged frog and raptors.

12 71. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's

13 substantial adverse impact with respect to biological resources, and its conclusions are not

14 supported by substantial evidence.

15 D. The Project increases the risks associated with wildfires

16 72. The Draft EIR concludes that the Project will not increase risks associated with

17 wild fires since the Upper Main Ditch is not a "substantial water source" and because it is

18 drinking water and not a water supply to be used for fire suppression.

19 73. The underlying water rights do not make any difference when fire personnel are

20 protecting lives and structures. There is evidence from recent wild fire events that a portion of

21 the canal east of the Main Ditch protected lives and structures and was utilized by fire

22 personnel. This demonstrated the value of ditches and canals during wildfires. Ignoring the

23 facts results in a failure of the EIR to fulfill its informational purpose. It also results in a

24 failure to analyze the impacts and develop mitigation measures designed to protect the lives

25 and property of residents in the Project area.

26 74. County General Plan Policy 6.1.1.1 and Goal 6.2 requires that fire hazards be

27 minimized in both wildland and developed areas. Other provisions of the General Plan also

28 address public safety, and the Project is patently contrary to these General Plan policies and
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 14

provisions, as it will significantly undermine the ability of fire personnel to protect lives and

structures in the area.
0 7000 co E. The Project will result in significant drainage impacts and
flooding risks

75. The District's Main Ditch system replaced the natural drainage many years ago,
and now must function into the future as the drainage for a fairly large watershed. When the
County and STEC (along with others) raised this issue, the District responded in the Final EIR.
The District essentially claims that it cannot foresee whether or not the private landowners will

9 continue to maintain the abandoned ditch segments on EID's behalf, so the issue could be

10 ignored.

11 76. The District failed to identify any mitigation measures that could reduce the

12 impacts of abandoning the only functioning stormwater collection and conveyance facility in

13 the watershed.

14 F. The EIR failed to adequately evaluate cumulative impacts

15 77. The EIR failed to disclose and evaluate the cumulative impacts associated with

16 the District's activities in abandoning the other portions of the Main Ditch system, and

17 effectively destroying the only stormwater collection and conveyance system for the

18 watershed.

19 78. The EIR also failed to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project

20 together with the impacts of drought and bark beetle infestations on tree mortality. EID

21 acknowledges that there will be tree mortality impacts from the Project, but refused to analyze

22 this impact in the context of what is occurring in Northern California with respect to tree

23 mortality.

24 79. The EIR did not conduct an appropriate cumulative impact analysis. CEQA does

25 not allow an agency to avoid looking at an incremental contribution to a cumulative condition

26 simply because it determines the project impact will be less than significant. CEQA requires

27 consideration of the severity of existing environmental impacts because "the greater the

28 existing environmental problems are, the lower the threshold should be for treating a project's
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

contribution to cumulative impacts as significant." (Communities for a Better Environment v.
California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App4th 98, 120.) The EIR's failure to consider

aü p the existing and foreseeable cumulative effects when assessing the Project's incremental
contribution violates CEQA's requirements.
III. Other CEQA violations:

80. Because EID improperly described the CEQA "project" without acknowledging
that it would alter stormwater drainage in the watershed, the public and decision makers were
c mislead by the EIR.

9 81. EID inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary investigations, studies

10 or inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and provided no

11 performance standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies used to

12 develop mitigation measures. Much of the deferral resulted from a reliance on the notion that

13 responsible agencies (such as CDFW) would conduct necessary analysis in the future, and

14 hopefully develop mitigation measures. This deferral violates CEQA.

15 82. The District failed to disclose and adequately describe the legal barriers that will

16 prevent the District from completing the Project as described in the EIR. The District does not

17 have easement rights that allow for the installation of a pipeline within the existing Upper Main

18 Ditch. The District also does not have a right to intentionally modify its operations in a way

19 that will damage property in the vicinity of the Project.

20 83. As a result of the District's failure to comply with the procedures required by

21 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering the

22 District to set aside its environmental findings and the related decision, and directing the

23 District to comply with the procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines before

24 acting on any development proposal under the Project.

2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the District to comply

Code section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by law;

3. For a stay and preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the District and
its agents, employees, officers and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement

9 the Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the

10 State Planning and Zoning Law;

11 4. For a declaration that the District's actions in approving the Project violated
