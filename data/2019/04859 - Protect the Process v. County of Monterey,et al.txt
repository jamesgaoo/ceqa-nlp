20 Protect the Process petitions this Court for a writ of mandate.

21 Introduction

22 Petitioner alleges as follows:

23 1. In June 2018 the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey

24 approved an ordinance that was intended to, and would, remove obstacles to growth

25 and would allow new development on vacant lots of record. The County ordinance at

26 issue is ordinance number 5310 ("County ordinance"). The County ordinance was

27 adopted without adequate prior review of the environmental impacts and consistency

28 with laws. Specifically, the County ordinance would allow treatment of contaminated

PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 water at the "point of use" (POU) or "point of entry' (POE) into a structure, instead of

2 the centralized water treatment that is currently required for water systems that do not

3 meet water quality requirements. The County ordinance would apply to all lots of

4 record in the County.

5 2. The County ordinance would enable development of vacant lots

6 throughout the County and would cause a significant additional demand on the

7 County's limited water supplies. The County has failed to quantify the vacant lots of

8 record in the County and those that could be developed as a result of this County

9 ordinance. The County ordinance also would enable intensification of water use on

10 developed lots by allowing additional dwelling units on lots already developed with one

11 or more dwelling units, including lots within the Cal-Am service area in Carmel Valley on

12 which there is a moratorium on new connections, in the severely overdrafted North

13 County, in the water-short B-8 zone of the Toro area, and in the unincorporated areas

14 served by water pumped from the adjudicated Seaside basin for which areas Cal Am

15 has applied to the CPUC a for a moratorium on new connections.

16 3. Essentially all of the primary aquifers in Monterey County are significantly
17 overdrafted and have been overdrafted for decades, causing environmental harm: the

18 Salinas Valley basin, all five north Monterey County subbasins, the Laguna Seca basin,

19 the Toro basin, the Carmel Valley aquifer, and the deep aquifer that supplied Marina

20 and Fort Ord. The primary water supplies in Big Sur also are overdrafted during

21 droughts and due to increased demand. No significant solution to any of the areas has

22 received final approvals and none has been constructed. It will be many years before

23 any of the areas obtains relief for existing connections, and the amounts available for

24 new development and new connections remain unknown and uncertain. No

25 significantly effective relief has been proposed or is in process for the Salinas Valley,

26 North County, and Toro basins and for the Marina/Fort Ord area.

27 4. This action is brought in the public interest and challenges the actions of

28 the County of Monterey Board of Supervisors to approve the POU/POE ordinance.

PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1° This action is brought under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the
2 Coastal Act and Local Coastal Plan, California planning and zoning law, and other law.
3 Jurisdiction

4 5. The County ordinance at issue was enacted by the Board of Supervisors
5 of the County of Monterey and the ordinance would apply throughout the County of
6 a Monterey. The County is a local agency. Venue is appropriate in the Superior Court of
7 the County of Monterey and this Court has jurisdiction over this writ action under
8 section 1094.5 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, and under sections 21168 and
9 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

10 Parties
11 6. Petitioner PROTECT THE PROCESS is an unincorporated association
12 under California law. Petitioner and its members are beneficially interested in the way
13 and manner that land use decisions are made and in the environmental consequences
14 of development in Monterey County, including the impacts of development in areas with
15 compromised water quality and/or quantity. One or more of Petitioner's members
16 participated in the administrative proceedings of the County in writing and in person and
17 Petitioner has standing to pursue this action.
18 7. Respondent COUNTY OF MONTEREY is a political subdivision of the
19 State of California that is the lead agency under CEQA for the County ordinance at
20 issue, and is responsible for ensuring that its ordinances are consistent with the Local
21 Coastal Plan, the Coastal Act, the General Plan, and other applicable plans and laws.
22 8. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF
23 MONTEREY is the governing board of the County that approved the ordinance at issue.
24 9. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of
25 the fictitiously named real parties in interest DOES 1 through 5000 may assert some
26 cognizable interest in the County ordinance such that they may be real parties in
27 interest. Petitioner does not know their true names and therefore names them by such
28 fictitious names. Petitioner will seek leave from the Court to amend this petition to

3
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 reflect the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 5000 once they are

2 ascertained.

3 First Claim

4 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act

5 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
10.
6 Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set

7 forth above as if fully set forth herein. Petitioner further alleges as follows:
11.
8 Some small water systems in the Monterey County are out of compliance
with water quality requirements. These systems have not installed centralized water

10 treatment for existing occupied homes that have legal service connections to the

systems.
11
12.
12 In 2018 or earlier, the County proposed an option for these systems to

13 improve their water quality. This option is called a "point of use" (POU) or "point of

14 entry' (POE) option. This means that the water treatment is provided at the point of use

15 within the structure or the point of entry into a structure, instead of at a centralized

16 location for the entire system that serves all service connections. County staff

17 presentations to the Board of Supervisors on a proposed ordinance emphasized a

18 focus and concern as to existing small water systems that had water quality problems.

13.
19 As the draft ordinance wound its way through the review process, it grew

20 materially broader in application. It was expanded to apply to much more than existing

21 homes on existing small water systems. The ordinance language was expanded to

22 allow and enable proposed new houses on vacant lots that were not part of an existing

23 water system. These are lots that otherwise are not developable because they do not

24 have a water supply of a quality and/or quantity that meets County code requirements,

25 General Plan policies, and zoning requirements, or other statutes and regulations.

14.
26 Petitioner has emphasized to the County that Petitioner does not object to

27 the effort by the County to improve water quality of existing residents who depend on

28 legal water systems for domestic water to supply their existing legal residences, and

4
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 where that water is contaminated. Petitioner has made no objection to the use of
2 POU/POE on a temporary basis for water systems in the inland area for existing
3 constructed legal homes that are connected to an approved legal existing constructed
4 water system where the water quality does not meet health standards and the system
5 has demonstrated that it cannot afford to put in centralized water treatment.
6 15. Prior to Board approval of the County ordinance, the County staff used
7 POU/POE to approve new development projects that were not on existing water
8 systems, or on water systems at all. The County relied on the proposed use of a
9 POU/POE device to give an after-the fact approval to an illegally constructed house and
10 illegally constructed water system in Big Sur in the coastal zone. The County relied on
11 a proposed POU/POE to allow development of a second dwelling unit at a large
12 property in Carmel Valley that was already getting water through Cal Am for the main
13 house and guest house, in addition to using water from a private well for the second
14 dwelling. The County Planning Commission approved a new house on a vacant lot in
15 the Toro area; prior to the Commission action, the County staff had not informed the
16 Planning Commission that there was no legal and safe water supply for the new house,
17 and after the Commission approval the staff used POU/POE to give an after-the-fact
18. approval to the water supply. The approvals allowed for permanent use of POU/POE.
19 None required temporary use of POU/POE or a long-term centralized treatment. This is
20 contrary to the position of the County Health Department, which is to encourage
21 connections to water systems.
22 16. The Monterey County Planning Commission did not review the proposed
23 ordinance. The materials that Petitioner has reviewed to date does not show that the
24 Monterey County planning department reviewed the ordinance for consistency with
25 adopted County land use plans and regulations and California planning and zoning law.
26 17. The County Health Department regulates water systems of a certain size.
27 The Health Department does not regulate individual lots that contain one or more
28 dwelling units unless there is a water system at the site. This means that once

5
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 development is approved on an individual lot, there is generally no ongoing oversight by

2 the Health Department of water quality.

3 18. On June 18, 2019, the board of supervisors held a public hearing and a

4 voted to adopt the final POU/POE County ordinance based on claims of CEQA

5 exemptions. Section 8 of the County ordinance states that the ordinance will become

6 effective on the thirty-first day following its adoption.

7 19. The County ordinance includes broad terminology that allows POU/POE

8 throughout the County, including the coastal zone, and for all uses including

9 commercial, industrial and visitor serving, according to the County. The County

10 ordinance allows POU/POE for new development, including multiple dwelling units on a

11 lot. (E.g., §S 15.06.010.I, 15.06.010.J, 15.06.030, 15.06.040.B, 15.06.040.C,

12 15.06.070.)

13 20. The County ordinance relies on an description of "service connection" that

14 is not consistent with section 21.06.1010 of the Monterey County Code. The code

15 limits the definition to "habitable structure." The County ordinance claims to rely on the

16 existing code definition; however, the ordinance significantly expands the definition to

17 include a "parcel which uses potable water from a water system for domestic and not

18 agricultural purposes." (Ordinance, §§ 15.04.020.o, 15.06.020.q.) The County

19 ordinance inconsistently refers to "lot," "lot of record," and "parcel." It is vague and
20 ambiguous as to whether the potable water can be used anywhere on the "parcel" for

21 agricultural purposes. The County ordinance is vague and ambiguous in several ways,
22 including as to the term "system," does not define key terms, and does not use

23 consistent terminology. The County ordinance would cause unintended consequences,

24 including property owners using more water from overdrafted sources, and the

25 elimination of incentives to conserve water for the benefit of the aquifer and for other

26 users.

27 21. The County did not do an environmental analysis of the County ordinance

28 under CEQA. Instead, the County claimed the County ordinance was categorically

6
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 exempt from CEQA under Public Resources Code sections 15301, 15302, 15303,

2 15308, and 15330. Petitioner alleges that the County ordinance does not fit within any

3 of the exemption categories claimed by the County, or any other exemption, and even if

4 it did, the cumulative impacts exception would apply. An environmental analysis is

5 required.

6 22. CEQA requires the pre-approval evaluation of growth-inducing impacts.
7 The County ordinance would remove obstacles to growth and would directly and/or

8 indirectly foster population growth and the construction of new housing and

9 development.

10 23. Section 1 of the County ordinance shows the intent to remove those

11 obstacles and to allow new housing and development. (Findings land J.) These same

12 findings were adopted in Section 6 of the County ordinance as County Code sections

13 15.06.010.l and 15.06.010.J. Those sections, underlined for emphasis, state as

14 follows:

15 - This ordinance is also intended to provide an option

16 for water quality treatment for owners of existing lots
of record who are seeking approval of new 17 development but whose water from a private onsite
18 well or existing local small, state small, or small public

19 water system does not meet drinking water standards
required for issuance of a construction permit. This
20 ordinance establishes local regulations enabling POU
21 or POE treatment meeting required standards to
22 satisfy water quality requirements for permit issuance.

23 J. The County recognizes that the County has a
shortage of housing and allowing a POU or POE 24 water treatment system may help facilitate new
25 construction on existing legal lots of record where
26 water quality does not meet drinking water standards.

27 24. The County Counsel summary references how POU/POE can enable a
28 construction permit from the County, where the summary states as follows:

7
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The ordinance also provides that if an individual

2 property owner is seeking new construction on an

3 existing legal lot with water that does not meet
primary water quality standards, the owner may install
4 POU or POE treatment as a means of satisfying

5 water quality standards necessary for a construction
permit for development.
6

7 25. However, nothing in the County ordinance would require or even

8 encourage affordable housing, social justice, or environmental justice. Nothing in the

9 County ordinance addresses or encourages affordable housing or limits the use of

10 POU/POE to any income level. The new development that the County has approved

11 based on POU/POE devices to date appear to be large market-rate houses in the

12 Toro/San Benancio, Carmel Valley, and Big Sur areas and one second dwelling unit in

13 Carmel Valley on a property compound that includes at least two other units.

14 26. The County ordinance would enable and allow development of new

15 houses, commercial development, industrial development, and more, in all areas of the

16 County where that development currently is not allowed due to water quality issues.

17 That would accommodate growth without prior CEQA compliance. This has been

18 illustrated by the County's administrative approval of POU/POE for individual

19 residences and guest houses, and by pending applications for POU/POE for use on

20 new individual residences on vacant lots. (But see, Pub. Resources Code,

21 § 21083(b)(2), CEQA Guidelines, § 15065(a)(3).) The new development would have

22 foreseeable impacts on the water supply in areas already severely overdrafted for

23 decades. The environmental impacts of other past and proposed projects are relevant

24 to the determination of cumulative impact analysis required for the environmental

25 review of the POU/POE ordinance. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(h)(1)-(3).)

26 27. CEQA requires the evaluation of cumulative impacts. Cumulatively

27 considerable means the incremental effects of a project are considerable when viewed

28 in connection with the effects of other closely related past projects, present projects,

8
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result
2 from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of
3 time. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.)

4 28. The County ordinance contains no time limit on use of the POU/POE
5 treatment, and would not require centralized treatment within a specified period of time.. a
6 The County ordinance would allow properties to avoid installing centralized system-wide
7 treatment, which is a material departure from the state regulations allowing POU/POE
8 for large systems. State regulations allow POU/POE devices on a temporary basis
9 only, along with demonstrated diligence in seeking centralized system-wide water
10 treatment.

11 29. The County ordinance would not encourage long term sustainable water
12 quality. Instead, the County ordinance would enable and entitle new development to
13 use POU/POE devices in perpetuity with no oversight. Many currently vacant lots do
14 not have any reasonable and foreseeable chance of access to a water system, much a
15 less a water system with centralized treatment. The County ordinance also would allow
16 intensification of water use for multiple dwelling units on a single lot and parcel in ways
17 not currently allowed, including in water-short areas. There would be no incentive to
18 bring an entire water system up to code through a centralized treatment, with the
19 involvement of and to the benefit of all system connections and users.
20 30. Petitioner seeks in this action to require Respondents, and each of them,
21 to comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, and all other applicable law in their actions, to
22 fulfill their statutory obligations under CEQA, the Coastal Act, and other law to provide
23 the information and investigation required by law, and to proceed in the manner
24 required by law. The policy decisions about the future of Monterey County are required
25 by law to be made by decision makers who are fully informed about the environmental
26 impacts. By avoiding the informational and procedural mandates of CEQA,
27 Respondents have not made informed and accountable decisions, and the protected
28 resources and the physical environment could be harmed as a result.

9
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. There are several pending applications for new development of single

2 family homes on vacant lots that would rely on POU/POE and would not be approvable

3 but for POU/POE treatment. Senior County planning staff has stated its intent to

4 approve these applications administrati vely on the 31st day following the Board's

5 adoption of the POU/POE ordinance.

6 32. On June 24, 2019, Petitioner emailed a letter stating its written notice of

7 intent to commence this action to the County of Monterey board of supervisors and its

8 Clerk. Petitioner subsequently had numerous communications with County counsel in

9 an effort to resolve the dispute. On July 3, 2019 Petitioner's counsel and a member of

10 Petitioner met with five senior County officials and County counsel in a further effort.
11 Petitioner performed all required conditions precedent to filing this action by complying
12 with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by on July 18, 2019

13 mailing the same written notice of its intent to commence this action to the board of

14 supervisors and its Clerk. (See Exh. A to this petition.)

15 33. On June 24, 2019, the County filed a CEQA notice of exemption for the
16 County ordinance. This action is timely brought.
17 34. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that as of
18 July 18, 2019, the time for filing an appeal to the California Coastal Commission had

19 not yet begun, or if it has begun, it has not yet elapsed for the County ordinance as of
20 the filing of this petition, if an appeal lies. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 1311.)

21 35. Petitioner has standing in this action, and has exhausted, or has not yet
22 been able to exhaust, or has been excused from, all administrative remedies

23 reasonably and legally available to Petitioner. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or
24 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as described below.
26

27

28

10
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1° Second Claim

2 Violation of California Coastal Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 30000 et seq.)
3 36. Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set
4 forth above as if fully set forth herein, and further alleges as follows:
5 37. Under the Coastal Act, a Local Coastal Plan includes a county's: (a) land
6 use plans, (b) zoning ordinances, (c) zoning district maps, and (d) within sensitive
7 coastal resources areas, other implementing actions. (Pub. Resources Code,
8 § 30108.6.) Changes in a coastal county's zoning laws that effectively amend a
9 county's Local Coastal Plan, and which constitute a "development," require approval
10 from the California Coastal Commission, which oversees land use in California's
11 Coastal Zone. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 30108.6, 30510.)
12 38. The County ordinance here purports to apply to all lots of record in the
13 County, including lots in the coastal zone and thus would effectively amend the
14 County's Local Coastal Plan and prior approval for the California Coastal Commission
15 is required. Respondents have not complied with the Coastal Act, the adopted
16 Monterey County Local Coastal Plan and the coastal implementation plan because the
17 County did not obtain the approval of the California Coastal Commission prior to the
18 Board's approval of the County POU/POE ordinance.
19 39. The Monterey County Local Coastal Plan includes the Coastal
20 Implementation Plan, which is title 20 of the Monterey County Code. Title 15 of the
21 County Code addresses public services. Coastal Implementation Plan section
22 20.96.010 states that County Code chapter 15.04 is adopted and incorporated into title
23 20 by reference. (County Code, § 20.96.010.C.1.)
24 40. Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the County POU/POE ordinance purport to amend
25 County Code chapter 15.04 and add new sections thereto, and thus amends a chapter
26 that is incorporated by reference into the local coastal plan. Respondents failed to
27 obtain prior approval from the Coastal Commission to amend the local coastal plan.
28

11
PROTECT THE PROCESS V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 41. Section 6 of the County ordinance purports to add a new chapter 15.06 to
2 County Code title 15. Respondents have failed to obtain prior approval from the

3 Coastal Commission to amend the local coastal plan to include new chapter 15.06.
4 42. Parts of the County ordinance are not consistent with the adopted local

5 coastal plan. The County did not perform a prior environmental review of the

6 inconsistencies and potential impacts before adopting the County ordinance.
7 43. For each and every one of the reasons stated, Respondents have not

8 complied with the Coastal Act.

9 Third Claim

10 Violation of California Planning and Zoning Law, Monterey County General Plan,
11 Monterey County Code
44.
12 Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set

13 forth above as if fully set forth herein, and further alleges as follows:
45.
14 Respondents did not comply with policies in the 2010 Monterey County

15 General Plan as to the inland area and did not comply with policies in the 1982 General

16 Plan as to the coastal zone before Respondents approved the County POU/POE

17 ordinance. The applicable general plans contain policies that apply to water quality and

18 water supply. Many of the 2010 general plan policies have not been implemented by

19 the County through implementing ordinances. The County POU/POE ordinance is

20 inconsistent with the general plan policies, including those that have not yet been

21 implemented, and/or may affect the ability of the County to implement those policies.

22 The County ordinance also is inconsistent with parts of the County Code.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for entry of judgment as described below.

24 Prayer

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for:

26 1. An alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents, and

27 each of them,

(a) To vacate and set aside their approvals of the County ordinance, in

5 temporary basis for existing constructed legal homes, not in the
6 coastal zone, who receive domestic water from an approved legal
7 existing water system where the domestic water is contaminated

Supervisor John Phillips, Chair Monterey County Board of Supervisors 168 West Alisal St., 1st Floor
Salinas, CA 93901

Subject: Notice of intent to initiate litigation - ordinance 19-018, point-of-use and point-of-entry (POU/POE) water treatment systems, adopted June 18, 2019.

Chair Phillips and members of the Board:

This letter serves as formal notice that Michael Weaver and/or an organization of which he is a member of intend to file a lawsuit in the public interest against Monterey County regarding the adoption of the POU/POE Ordinance by the Board of Supervisors. on June 18, 2019, amending Chapter 15.04 of the Monterey County Code and adding Chapter 15.06 to the Monterey County Code relating to point-of-use and point-of-entry
water treatment systems.

The intended lawsuit would raise issues raised in the County proceedings, including lack of compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21167.5.) The ordinance would have unintended consequences that are foreseeable. The ordinance is inconsistent with the 2010 Monterey County General Plan and area plans and LCP. The County has not implemented many of the General Plan's public services policies applicable to water, according to the County's most recent implementation report. (See attached.) You should not be misled by statements to the contrary by County staff. A significant problem of the ordinance is its enabling of new individual single family residences, new offices, new commercial buildings, new industrial buildings, new connections and new development. That is
growth-inducing and has cumulative impacts that have not been considered in a CEQA analysis. Key aspects of the adopted County ordinance go materially beyond the State law applicable to POU/POEs.
URGENCY. The matter is urgent. By approving the ordinance the County has started the time running in which a lawsuit must be filed. The County can take prompt action to avoid a lawsuit. The future course of this matter is within the control for the Board. There is no need to rush to adopt an ordinance without a full and accurate
analysis of the problems presented.

REQUEST. Mr. Weaver asks that the Board of Supervisors rescind the adoption
of the POE/POU Ordinance and advise me and him of that no later than close of
business July 8, 2019.
The Board could easily adopt a substitute ordinance that allows POU/POE on a temporary basis for no more than three years, consistent with State law, that would allow existing customers in existing development on existing water systems to have

Exhibit A, cont'd

access to safe and clean drinking water. That is the purpose of the State law. Mr. Page 2

Weaver urges the Board to focus on that goal, consistent with the State law and with the statements by the Community Water Center. A POU/POE ordinance should apply to currently existing legal systems and their legal existing connections and legal existing development only, to ensure existing residences and households have safe water.

OFFER TO MEET. Mr. Weaver and Ioffer to meet with the County in the hope of avoiding litigation and resolving the concerns.
Your prompt attention is appreciated. We remind the Board that the adopted Final EIR for the Salinas Valley Water Project urged the County to aggressively
implement land use plans in order to address growth Inducement and cumulative impacts. That exhortation is applicable to this situation, and we urge you to comply with

Very truly yours, the County General Plan. Thank you.
