14 Petitioner, QUALITY ACT

15 CITY OF AMERICAN CANYON, a municipal

16 corporation; and DOES 1-100, inclusive,

17 Respondents.

19 Petitioner California Clean Energy Committee, by and through its attorney, alleges as

20 follows:

21

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 1. Rcspondent City of American Canyon (city) is a general law city and a political

24 over the project subdivision of the State of California. Having discretionary approval authority

25 described herein, the city is the lead agency responsible under the California Environmental Quality Act

26 (CEQA) for preparation of the environmental impact report and for design of the environmental

27 mitigation for the project described hercin.

28 2. Petitioner California Clcan Encrgy Committee (CCEC) is a nonprofit corporation

Petition for Writ of Mandate -
100s Recycled Paper

incorporated under the laws of the State of California maintaining its principal place of business in the

2 City of Davis, California. CCEC has advocated on bchalf of the general public throughout the State of

3 California for energy conservation, the development of clean energy resources, reduced greenhouse gas

4 emissions, smart growth, more efficient transportation systems, farmland preservation, and related issues
in connection with numcrous projects and issucs since 2008. During 2016 and 2017, CCEC submitted

6 comments and negotiated environmental mitigation for Watson Ranch, a 309 acre specific plan project

7 for over 1200 residential units, a new elementary school, and commercial uses located in the City of

8 Amcrican Canyon. CCLC actively supports the application of the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) to energy conservation and related issues. Over twenty (20) individuals in the City of

10 Amcrican Canyon have joined in support of the CCEC campaign to cnsure that the City of American

11 Canyon provides an cfficient transportation system design, accurate impact analysis, robust energy
12 conservation, and environmental stewardship in connection with the Broadway District Specific Plan.

13 3. Clean Encrgy's supporters in American Canyon and surrounding areas will be directly

14 and adversely impacted by the implementation of the project and by the failurc of the City to adequately

15 cvaluatc the impacts of the project and by its failure to identify feasible mitigation for the impacts of the

16 project as required pursuant to CEQA. Petitioner brings this action as a representative of the general

17 public in the arca of American Canyon who will be affected by the project.

18 4. Without a representative organization such as Clean Energy, it would be impractical and

19 uneconomic for individual members of the public to cnforce CEQA with respect to the project discussed

20 hercin. Without a representative action such as this one, the violations of CEQA described in this

21 petition would remain immune from judicial review. No governmental agency is prepared to evaluate

22 the environmental issues or to enforce the public rights that arc at stake.

23 5. Venuc for this action is proper in this court because the environmental impacts of the

24 actions alleged herein will cause direct and substantial impacts within the County of Napa and because

25 the principal office of the respondent agency is situated within the County of Napa.

26 6. Concurrently herewith petitioner is filing a declaration of prior service by mail upon the

27 City of American Canyon of written noticc of intent to commence this action in compliance with the

28 requircments of Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
Pctition for Writ of Mandate - 2 100% Reryeled 1M

7. Pctitioner is further filing and serving hercwith notice of its election to prepare the

2 administrative record in this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.
8. The true names and capacities of the respondents and real partics in intercst sued herein

4 under California Code of Civil Procedurc section 474 as Docs 1 through 100, inclusive, are 1 presently

5 unknown to petitioner. Does through 100 include agents of the county, state, and federal government

0 who are responsiblc in some manner for the conduct described herein and real parties in intercst

7 presently unknown to the petitioner who claim some legal or equitable interest in the project who

8 petitioner therefore sues by such fictitious namcs. Petitioner will amend this petition to include these

9 Doc respondents' true names and capacitics when they are ascertained. Each of the fictitiously-named

10 respondents is responsible in some manner for the conduct alleged herein.

11 9. CCEC's action hercin will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the

12 public interest and confer substantial benefits on the general public. The necessity and financial burden

13 of private enforcement justify an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedurc section

14 1021.5.

15 10). The public comment period on the draft environmental impact report (DEIR) cxtended

16 through January 24, 2017. Despitc the cxtensive comments received, the City has nevertheless prepared

17 and relied on an EIR that falls well below CEQA'S minimum standards. If the City is allowed to

18 proceed with the project, irreparable harm will result to the environment and to the public. No adequate

19 remedy, other than that prayed for hercin, exists by which the rights of the petitioner and the class it

20 represents may be protected.

21 11.CCEC has cxhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written comments on two

22 occasions requesting compliance with CEQA and a full and adequate environmental review. All issucs

23 raised in this pctition were raised with the City by CCEC or by other members of the public or public

24 agencies prior to the certification of the EIR. The City has made its final decision. This petition is

25 timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code scction 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section

26 15112.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

2 12. In 2009 the Association of Bay Arca Governments (ABAG) in cooperation with other

3 local agcncies established a program known as the Priority Development Area Program, which is

4 intended to maximize residential devclopment and job growth in areas of cxisting communities that arc
served by frequent and convenient transit. The Broadway District consists of land in the City of
American Canyon located on cither side of Statc Route 29 (SR 29 or Broadway), starting at the
Solano/Napa County linc and extending 2.38 miles north and ending at Green Island Road. The

8 Broadway District serves both as the commercial core of the city and as a main thoroughfare for
commuter, tourist, and commercial travel. Pursuant to a request by the City of American Canyon,

10) ABAGi designated the Broadway District as a potential priority development arca. Pursuant to that

11 designation, it was incumbent upon the city to adopt a specific plan for the Broadway District area.

12 13. In November, 2017, the city released a draft Broadway District Specific Plan (BDSP)

13 along with a draft environmental impact report. The proposed BDSP is intended to become the guiding

14 document for growth and improvement of the BDSP arca, "transforming the auto-oriented Highway 29

15 commercial district into a livable, mixed use, small town neighborhood." The document contains goals,

16 objectives and policies. I1 scts forth the location and extent of different land uses, the location and

17 cxtent of roadways, and the major infrastructure. The BDSP provides for 1,200 net new residential units

18 and approximately 840,000 nct new square fcet for non-residential uses including office and

19 commercial, which the city projects will generate 3,379 residents and 1,666 jobs, which will gencrate an

20 additional 148,735 miles of vehicle travel daily. (EIR 3.2-47.)

21 14. The draft EIR is intended to address "all public infrastructure improvements and all

22 futurc development that are within the parameters of the proposed project." The draft EIR was relcased

23 for a 60-day public revicw period which ended on January 24, 2018. It was reviewed by various

24 governmental agencies and members of the public. CCEC submitted comments during the public

25 comment period on the draft EIR. The city published the Final Environmental Impact Report on April

26 10, 2019, which consisted of copics of comments received, the city's responses to comments, and minor

27 revisions to the text of EIR. On June 3, 2019, CCEC submitted comments and documents addressing

28 the final EIR.

15. On Junc 18, 2019, the City Council met and approved (i) a resolution adopting findings

2 pursuant to CEQA, certifying the final environmental impact report, and adopting a statement of

3 overriding considerations; (ii) a resolution adopting a mitigation monitoring and reporting program; (iii)

4 an ordinance amending the City's gencral plan; and (iv) an ordinance approving the Broadway District

5 Specific Plan.

7 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT ANALYSIS

g 16. Cumulative Impact Analysis. The analysis of cumulative traffic impacts in the EIR

( purports to restate the environmental analysis completed in 2013 for the city's general plan Circulation

10 Element. The EIR states that build-out of the general plan along with increases in regional traffic

11 traversing the Broadway corridor would result in "an unacceptable LOS under the proposed plan

12 conditions" and concludes that the impact of the specific plan would be significant. It gocs on to statc

13 that the impact is unavoidable because "there are no feasible mitigation measures that the City of

14 American Canyon can undertake independently to fully mitigate this impact." The EIR states that "[i]n

15 the absence of an established regional and state funding mechanism, the necessary improvements to

16 mitigate regional growth on top of local traffic will not occur." The EIR statcs that "there are no fcasible

17 improvements beyond the proposed widening to six lanes that the City of American Canyon can perform

18 independently." (EIR 3.12-42.) The city's analysis of cumulative traffic impacts does not comply with

19 CEQA and is unsupported. The changes proposed under the specific plan were not analyzed as part of
20 the general plan environmental review and the specific plan does not tier off that revicw. It docs not

21 make the analysis in the gencral plan available to the public at a location specified by the lead agency.

22 The EIR must cvaluate the impact of proposed specific plan vicwed in connection with past projects,

23 other current projects, and probable future projects. The analysis must identify current baseline

24 conditions. The city erroncously declined to set forth mitigation that other agencies, or the city in

25 cooperation with other agencies, could adopt. The lead agency may find that mitigation is within

26 another agency's responsibility and jurisdiction and that the other agency has adopted the mitigation or

27 can and should adopt it. Such a finding is only appropriate when another agency has cxclusive
28 responsibility. The analysis fails to identify the combined impact of the proposed specific plan and

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 5
, Recycied Paper

other projects or the incremental impact of the specific plan.

2 17. Congestion Management Plan. The EIR further indicates that SR-29 is a congestion
management plan facility and states that build-out of the spccific plan would generate new vehicle trips

4 that would contribute to unacceptablc opcrations on SR-29. (EIR 3.12-43.) It concludes that there would

5 be a significant impact because it is not feasible to widen SR-29 to eight lanes. The analysis does not

() comply with CEQA because it fails to identify the spccific conflict with the congestion management

7 plan.

8 18. Generated Traffic. Ilighway cxpansion on congested links such as SR 29 is likely to

( generate considcrable amounts of additional traffic and to provide only temporary congestion reduction

10 benefits. Under typical urban conditions, more than half of the added capacity is filled within five years
11 of project complction, by additional vchicle trips that would not otherwise occur, and with continued but

12 slower growth in later years. CCEC informed the city that ignoring gencrated traffic underestimates the

13 magnitude of future traffic congestion problems, overestimates the congestion reduction bencfits of

14 increasing roadway capacity, and underestimates the benefits of alternative solutions to transportation
15 problems. Building increased highway capacity increases vchicle miles travelled and related impacts.

16 Over the it long term it helps create more automobile dependent transportation systems and land use

17 patterns. The KIR failed to consider this impact. The city's response was inadequate and unsupported.
18 The EIR should cvaluate and mitigate gencrated traffic impacts.

19 19. Vehicle Miles Traveled. The city was furtber informed that the transportation analysis
20 should address the project impact on vehicle miles travelled (VMT). The city responded that VMT had

21 been disclosed in the discussion of cnergy impacts. The analysis of VMT in the energy section and in
22 the air quality section of the EIR does not comply with CEQA. The city used full project build out as
23 the baseline. CCEC informed the city twice that the discussion of transportation impacts must use a

24 current conditions bascline. Disclosing total VMT associated with the project did not constitute an

25 evaluation of the project impact on VMT because the EIR failed to identify or compare to any basclinc

26 and failed conduct any analysis of the cxpected change in per capita VMT. The failure to analyze VMT

27 creates the false and mislcading perception that inducing people to regularly take longer vchicle trips to
28 reach their destinations creates no greater impact to air quality, transportation, cnergy, or grcenhouse gas

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 6
100% Recycled Papcr

impacts than would occur for shorter vehicle trips. The EIR fails to provide an analysis of the projcct's

2 impact to VMT and would not he substantial cvidence to support a finding of no significant impact to

3 transportation.

5 MITIGATION USING LAND USE POLICIES

( 20. Transit-Oriented Development. The city failed to evaluate and adopt feasible mitigation

7 for the significant air quality and transportation impacts of the specific plan. CCEC urged the city to

8 reducc commuting traffic by implcmenting transit-oriented development through policies such as

() locating increased residential density near transit stops. The city responded that the proposed specific

10 plan would accommodate 1,200 nct new dwelling units most of which would be multi-family. This did

11 not analyze or address whether the impacts of the plan could be mitigated by implementing transit-

12 oriented devclopment. The specific plan strategics for public transit are limited to improving bus stops
13 On Broadway and participating in studies of transit demand undertaken by Napa Valley Transportation

14 Authority (NVTA). (SP, 4-12.) The specific plan contains no policy addressing where transit stops

15 should be located or whether land uses that generate transit riders will be located within a convenient

16 distance of transit service.

17 21. Workforce Housing. The proposed specific plan would continue a long and unfortunate

18 trend in Napa County of failing to provide enough affordablc housing opportunities for employees and

19 effectively induces cmployces to commute to Solano County or Contra Costa County at considerable

20 cxpense to them, to the public, and also ai significant cost to the environment. Ironically, the City of

21 American Canyon, itsclf' enduring tremendous regional traffic that burdens and splits the core of the city,
22 is one of major casualties of this long-term trend. CCEC pointed out to the city during the public

23 comment period that NVTA had demonstrated that housing costs require many lower and middle

24 income cmployecs in Napa County to commute to Solano County and to Contra Costa County for

25 affordable housing and that the congestion and air quality impacts of the project could be mitigated by

26 providing additional workforce housing and housing density in the specific plan. The city refused to

27 evaluate incorporating increased affordability standards into the specific plan to ensure greater amounts

28 of housing affordablc to the local work force and thereby to reducc commuting distances. Under the

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 7
100% Recycled Paper

specific plan fewer than 1200 dwelling units could be built. The city responded that workforce housing
would nol represent fcasible mitigation for transportation impacts because employees residing in

3 workforce housing in the Broadway District would still commute on SR-29. The city's position is

4 unsupported. The fact that cmployees would travel some reduced distance to work does not establish

5 that the impacts of that travel would not be significantly less than the impacts of travelling daily from

0 another county to job in Napa County. The city failed to comply with CEQA by failing to respond to

*7 comments with a detailed, reasoned and good faith analysis of mitigation for the significant air quality
and transportation impacts of' the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, $ 15088(c).) Further, it failed to

0 describe and adopt fcasible mitigation measures that could minimize the significant adversc impacts of

10 the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(1).)

11

12 MITIGATION USING TRANSIT POLICIES

13 22. Transit Facilities in Broadway Corridor. The specific plan calls for reconfiguring
14 Broadway to make regular bus service possible and straightening the express bus route. CCEC urged

15 the cily to mitigate congestion impacts by incorporating additional specific plan provisions that would

16 foster improved transit service through the Broadway Corridor and thereby increase transit mode sharc.

17 These included intersection controls that can give transit priority by setting a traffic light to stay green

18 for several cxtra scconds to allow a bus to avoid stopping, real time passenger information at transit

19 stops, shoulder operation 10 bypass congestion, queue bypass lanes at congested intersections, enhanced

20 transit stops, improved signago, and expanded park and ride. Fcatures such as these have been

21 recommended by NVTA in the Gateway Corridor Improvement Plan and in the Express Bus Corridor

22 Study. The city failed to evaluate policics that would design the Broadway Corridor for increased transit

23 ridership. It responded that these lypes of improvements are subject to Caltrans approval and that the

24 City of American Canyon did not have the ability to install transit signal priority and queue jumps on

25 SR-29. However, it is cvident that the city is alrcady proposing certain changes to transit serviccs in the

26 Broadway District and that the city secks to exercise considerablc influence over Caltrans regarding the

27 configuration of the SR 29 and the speed limit through the Broadway District. The city failed to address

28 improved transit fcatures in the Broadway Corridor with Caltrans during the preparation of the EIR and

Pctition for Writ of Mandatc - 8
100% Rueycled Paper

WAn

2 stated that these suggestions would be evaluated in the future. Adopting policics in the specific plan that

3 would enhance transit facilities in the Broadway Corridor constitutes feasible mitigation which should
have heen analyzcd and cither adopted or recommended to other agencies.

4

5 23. Enhanced Transit Serviccs. CCEC further urged the city to incorporate policies into the

6 specitic plan that would mitigate transportation impacts by establishing a transportation management

7 agency to provide funding for improved transit service, expanded operation hours, shorter headways,

8 and faster service on corridors. CCEC particularly urged the city to mitigate impacts by providing frec

0 or discounted transit passes to residents and employees, which are an effective tool for incrcasing transit

10 mode sharc. Potential funding sources for such mitigation include development fces, annual charges to

J1 land uses that impact the transportation system, funding through a transportation management

12 association, and fce revenuc derived from supplying public parking facilitics. The city lailed and

13 refused to evaluate such mcasures. The city failed to determine whether the Napa Valley Transportation

14 Authority would be amenablc to using funds collected by American Canyon to implement programs

15 such as these. It refused to evaluate these policies asserting that they were the prerogative of the NVTA

16 and simply noted in the specific plan that the city would participate in studies to identify ways to

17 improve bus transit. The city failed to comply with CEQA by failing to respond to comments with a

18 detailed, reasoned and good faith analysis of mitigation for the significant air quality and transportation

19 impacts of the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088(c).) Further, it failed to describe and adopt

20 feasible mitigation measures that could minimize the significant adverse impacts of the project. (Cal.
Code Regs., tit. 14, $ 15126.4(a)(1).)

21

22 PARKING

23

24 24. Parking Development. The proposed specific plan provides for the crcation of a more

25 acccssiblc and efficient system of surface parking that will adequately serve the project area. It asserts

26 that a well-managed public and private parking supply is critical to the long-term success of the

27 Broadway District. It contains no policy provision that there would be any fce charged for parking, and

28 it mUsI be assumed that the proposal will providc free-parking. Research has established that providing
increased parking is associated with an increase in automobilc mode share. Providing parking scrvcs as

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 9
100% Reeycleel P'aper

an inducement to driving and thercby contributes to greater traffic congestion, reduces energy
3 efficicncy, and increases the emission of air quality pollutants. CCEC urged the city lo evaluate the
3 impacts of providing parking in the LIR, but the city did not provide such an evaluation. Paid parking
4 reduces driving and CCEC recommended that paid parking be evaluated in the EIR and adopted as
5 mitigation for the congestion impacts of the project. The city failed to evaluate paid parking as
6 mitigation.

7 25. Parking Management. In order to mitigate transportation impacts, CCEC recommended
8 that the specitic plan provide that parking management plan be prepared for the Broadway District.
a The plan should designate parking areas, parking circulation, special signage, parking fecs, time limits,
10) ride share incentives, biking and walking options 1o mitigate project impacts. Parking management is
energy efficient and mitigates air quality and congestion impacts. It reduces the amount of time drivers
12 nced to spend cruising for parking and creates a close, more pedestrian-oriented streetscape, which is
13 conducive to walking. The city failed to evaluate a policy for adopting a parking management plan as
14 mitigation.

15

16 TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT
17 26. Provisions of the Specific.Plan. The specific plan contains a weak and infeasible
18 transportation demand management (TDM) program that consists of (i) a reference to the land use
19 provide on-strect and off-strect parking, policics contained in the specific plan; (ii) commitment to
20 which actually encourages driving; (iii) encouraging NVTA to provide bus service on Broadway, which
21 it alrcady docs; and (iv) working with businesses to "spread the word about rideshare serviccs." CCEC
22 informed the city repeatedly that these provisions do not constitute an effective TDM program. They
23 amount to referencing TDM and reducing it to a few ineffective statements. Both Caltrans and CCEC
24 urged the city to adopt a "robust" TDM program to mitigate project impacts. Both urged the city to plan
25 for a transportation management association (TMA) to devclop a partnership among affected
26 developments and involved public agencies to implement an effective TDM program.
27 27. Rccommendations for a TDM Program. Caltrans and CCEC provided the city with
multipic cxamples of policics that would enable the city to mcct transportation demand while reducing 28

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 10
100% Recyeled Paper

traffic congestion and air quality impacts. The city cxpressly declined to adopt a policy to develop a

2 robust TDM program, rclying on the unsupported assertion that providing for such a program in the

3 specific plan would be "premature." The city neverthelcss amended the final EIR to erroneously assert

4 that the specific plan included a Broadway District Transportation Demand Management Program,

5 which would require project applicants to submit some type of TDM proposal to the Public Works

0 Department for approval. (FEIR 5-2.) The specific plan does not contain such a program, and the

7 hypothetical policy provides only for a document prepared by the project applicant without standards,

8 requirements, or oversight. Effective mitigation would be a policy that calls for achicving specified

4 reduction in peak period motor vehicle trips reducing them below what would be typical for

10 devclopment in the applicable land use category. An cffcctive policy would call for reductions that

11 would be deemed aggressive yet feasible and that could range from 15 to 45 percent. Exceptions could

12 be allowed for hardship cases. An effective TDM policy would involve monitoring by the city on an

13 are not met. annual basis. I1 should provide enforcement mechanisms and penalties that accrue if targets

14 28. Fee or Trade in Licu. To further reducc impacts to less than significant, CCEC

15 rccommended that the city require new devclopment projects to offset significant impacts to peak period

16 motor vehicle trips cither by directly contracting with another property owner or organization to reduce

17 trips gencrated from another site or by paying an annual fce to the City for use in reducing motor vehicle

18 trips to the extent feasiblc through the provision of transit services, carpool/rideshare incentives, bicycle

19 lancs, and other similar programs and improvements. The city failed to comply with CEQA by failing

20 [0 respond to comments with a detailed, rcasoned and good faith analysis of mitigation for the

21 significant transportation impacts of the project. (Cal. Codc Regs., tit. 14, § 15088(c).) Further, it failed

22 10 describe and adopt feasible miligation measurcs that could minimize the significant adversc impacts

23 of the projcct. (Cal. Codc Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(1).)

24

25 ENERGY

26 29. Operational Energy. The EIR states that the long-term operational energy usage of the
27 project would consist of an estimated 20.4 million kWh of clectricity and 92.1 million cubic feet of

28 natural gas and that the project would be required to comply with Title 24 energy efficiency standards.

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 11
100% Recycled Paper

Based upon that, the EIR concludes the project would not result in the unnccessary, wasteful or

2 incfficicnt use of cnergy. CCTC notified the city that the discussion of encrgy impacts in the EIR is

3 insufficicnt and that it provides no useful disclosurc because there is no discussion of what constitutes

4 cnergy efficiency for the type of projects that would be built under the specific plan and no basis for

5 concluding whether those projects would achieve energy efficiency. The discussion of energy offered

6 by the city consists primarily of filler material addressing cxtraneous matters with no identified bearing

7 on the matter to bc decided. No bascline condition has been identified. No cumulative impact analysis

8 has been provided. The discussion consists of an estimate of the gross energy consumption at build out

() o1 some undefined population and an unsupported conclusion. The analysis should consider what Lypcs

10 of cnergy uses will likely be located in the specific plan area, discuss the typical energy consumption for

11 such uscs, consider whether that level of cnergy consumption compares well to efficient designs, and

12 address n process for evaluating individual projects. The discussion of operational energy efficiency is

13 unsupported and docs not mect minimal CEQA standards.

14 30. Transportation Energy. The International Energy Agency defines "transport energy

15 cfficiency" as the maximization of travel activity with minimal cnergy consumption through

16 combinations of land-usc planning, transport modal share, energy intensity, and fuel type. With respect

17 to transportation cnergy, the FIR simply states that vehicle fucl efficiency standards are set at the federal

18 level and cstimates that 802,935 gallons of motor vehicle fuel would be used annually in association

19 with the specific plan. It points out that there would be increased opportunities for non-motorized travel

20 and more direct routes for motor vchicles. It then concludes that the project would not result in the

21 unnecessary, wasteful or incfficient usc of gasoline or diesel fucl. That conclusion is not supported by

22 substantial cvidence, and the analysis does not meet CEQA's information disclosure requirements.

23 There is no discussion of whether the use of transportation energy is efficient in view of the specific plan

24 policies related to land-use planning, transport mode share, energy intensity, and fuel types. For

25 example, the specific plan does not provide that dwelling units be convenient to frequent destinations

26 such as employment sites and transit so that residents are not required to drive an unnecessary number of

27 miles and to consume cxcessive amounts of encrgy for travel. The specific plan contains no policies that

28 would maximizc rcliance on more efficient modes of transport such as transit. The proposed specific

Petition for Writ of Mandatc - 12 100% Recycled Paper

plan provides for cxpansion of SR 29 to a six-lane highway which would accommodate increased

2 singlc-occupant-vehicic commuting and trucking while failing to incorporate a policy of maximizing

3 reliance on transit. The proposed specific plan provides that the city would ensurc an ample supply of
4 parking without providing that any fee be charged to consumers of parking services. Such a policy
5 cncourages commuting by car and is cnergy inefficient. The city cannot ignore these issues. The

6 discussion of transportation energy efficiency is unsupported and docs meet minimal CEQA disclosure

7 standards.

31. Renewable Encrgy. The EIR states that electrical energy supplied to the project would be
sourced by Marin Clean Encrgy and asserts that that grid-sourced electricity would be as clean as on-site
10 generated solar electricity. That conclusion is clearly erroncous. The EIR should cvaluate options for
11 increasing reliance on renewable energy such as putting new buildings in the project arca on 100 percent
12 renewable electrical cnergy, or some lesser percentage as may be fcasible, and evaluate the extent to
13 which transportation systems associated with the operation of the project can be fueled from renewable
14 clectricity. The specific plan fails to include any policies that would ensure that commercial projects
15 cvaluated under it would maximize rcliancc on costs-effective and feasible renewable cnergy sources.
16 As such it is an inefficient and wasteful energy design. The specific plan does not provide for electric
7 vchicle charging or hydrogen fucling facilities which increases the likelihood that transportation services
18 will unnecessarily rely on fossil fuels. The failure to provide for the installation of rooftop solar, such as
19 is used on the Amcrican Canyon Walmart, along with solar parking canopies where feasible is cnergy
20 inefficient. The EIR should discuss how failing to implement reliabic and efficient local energy
21 generation would pre-empt future clean energy development by subjecting project occupants to
22 administrative and financial obstacles as well as the additional construction costs of retrofitting
23 renewable generation to an operating building. The EIR should evaluate ways in which the projccted
24 electric demand can be served in an efficient and environmentally-sustainable way.

26 GENERAL TOPICS

27 32. Project Level EIR. The EIR statcs that it provides a project-level analysis of the effects
28 of the Broadway District Specilic Plan, but the staff report for the project refers to it as a program EIR.
Pctition for Writ of Mandate - 13
1009 Recycled Paper

CCEC informed the city during the public rcview period that it considered the EIR to be a project-level
2 EIR based upon the cxpress terms of the EIR. The city did not dispute that characterization. (FEIR 3-
3 88.) As a result it is now unclear whether the city intended to do a programmatic EIR or a project EIR.
4 The uncertainty about the naturc of the EIR requires that the project approval be set aside.
5 33. Growth Inducing Impact. At the present time with Broadway configured with two lancs
6 in each direction, considerable traffic congestion occurs during the morning and evening hours which
7 limits the number of vehieles that can commutc from the Bay Area to destinations north of American
8 congestion, the proposed project Canyon. By expanding the roadway to six lanes, thereby reducing
allows for a greater number of vehicles to commute and encourages greater residential and commercial
10 devclopment in Napa Valley. The proposed specific plan failed to comply with CEQA becausc it did
11 not contain a discussion of the growth inducing impacts of the projcct.
12

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
14 (Failurc to Comply with CEQA)
15 34. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
16 35. CEQA requires that lcad agencies prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of
17 the statute. The lcad agency must also provide for public review and comment on the projcct and
18 associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
19 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
20 proposed project.

21 36. Respondent violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the project that is inadequate and
22 fails to comply with CEQA and approving the project on that basis. Among other things, respondent:
23 a. Failed to adequatcly disclosc or analyze the project's significant environmental impacts
24 including but not limited to the project's impacts on transportation and energy;
25 b. Failed to provide a consistent and appropriate environmental bascline for analysis of the
26 projcct's environmental impacts;

27 c. Failed to adcquately analyzc the significant cumulative impacts of the project;
28 d. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures;

100% Rerycled Paper

2 C. Failed to discuss potcntially fcasible mitigation measures; and
f. Failed to adopt and makc cnforceable feasible mitigation for project impacts.

4 37. As a result of the foregoing defects, respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

5 certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the project in rcliance thereon.

6 Accordingly, respondent's certification of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8

4 (Inadequate Findings)

3 38. Petitioner hereby incorporates by refcrence each and cvery allegation set forth above.
39. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

12 substantial cvidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an

13 cxplanation of how cvidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

14 40. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadcquate as a matter of law in

15 that they are not supported by substantial cvidence in the record, including, but not limited to the

following:

16 a.

17 The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted

18 mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the project's significant effects on the
environment;

19 b.

20) The determination that certain mitigation was infeasible;

21 c. The determination that overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits

22 of the projcct outweighed its significant impacts on the environment.

23 41. As a result a of the forgoing defects, respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

24 adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the project in

25 reliance thercon. Accordingly, the agency's certification of the EIR and approval of the project must he
set asidc.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Failure to Recirculate the EIR)
42. Pctitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth abovc.

4 43. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is

S prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the EIR must be recirculated for public review and

6 comment.

7

8 44. Comments submitted to respondent after the draf EIR was circulated provided

9 significant new information within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA

10 Guidelines section 15088.5 including, but not limited to, information about greenhouse gas cmissions,
energy conservation, and fcasible mitigation for project impacts.

I1

12 45. Despite the availability of this significant new information, respondent failed to

13 recirculatc the BIR, or any portion of the EIR. As a result of respondent's failurc to recirculatc the EIR,

14 the public and other public agencies were deprived ofany meaningful opportunity to review and

15 comment on the project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new information
regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the project.

16

17 46. Respondent's failure to recirculate the EIR is not supported by substantial evidence and
rcpresents a failurc to proceed in the manner required by law.

18 WHEREFORE, petitioner respectfully requests the following relief:

19 1. A peremptory writ of mandatc commanding that:

20 D.

1 Respondent vacate and set aside its certification of the EIR, approval of the project

22. and the related approval of the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan, Statement
of Overriding Considerations and findings;
23
24 b. Respondent withdraw the notice of determination;

25 c. Respondent prepare and circulate a revised EIR for public review and comment that
is in compliance with the requircments of CEQA; and

26

27 d. Respondent suspend all activity pursuant to the certification of the EIR and the

28 related approvals that could result in any changc or altcration to the physical
it environment until it has taken all actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

2. Preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining respondent, its agents, employces,
2 contractors, consultants and all persons acting in concert with them, from undertaking any construction
3 or devclopment, issuing any approvals or permits, or taking any other action to implement in any way
4 the approval of the project without full compliance with California law;

5 3. A declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited to a

6 declaratory judgment that prior to undertaking any action to carry out any aspect of the project,
7 respondont must prepare, circulate, and adopt a revised EIR in accordance with the requirements of
8 CEQA;

() 4. Petitioner's costs of suit and reasonable attorney fees; and
10 5. Such other relief as the court deems just and proper.
