Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of San Diego ("City" or

3 "Respondent") of the Balboa Avenue Station Area Specific Plan ("Plan" or "Project"), and the related

4 failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000,

5 et seq.

6 2. Among other things, the City failed to consider the environmental impacts associated with

7 the Plan, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider and

8 adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation.

9 3. Additionally, the City failed to comply with its own General Plan, Climate Action Plan, and

10 Pacific Beach Community Plan.

11 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

12 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

13 PARTIES

14 5. Petitioner Friends of Rose Creek ("Petitioner") is an unincorporated association of residents

15 and property owners within the City of San Diego who seek to preserve the aesthetic and

16 environmental qualities of Rose Creek in the City of San Diego; and who seek to ensure accessibility,

17 protect bicyclist and pedestrian safety, and otherwise protect the environment, health and safety of

18 Rose Creek for residents, visitors, and businesses. Petitioner and its members have been injured as a

19 result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy, and benefit from the resources

20 affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the aesthetic, recreational,

21 economic, environmental, and health and safety interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The

22 interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be adversely affected by

23 Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner's and

24 Petitioner's members' injuries.

25 6. Respondent City of San Diego is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body

26 corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of

27 the State of California.

Writ Petition

7. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as
2 Does 1 through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioners will amend

3 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

4 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

5 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

6 8. The Plan states: "The Specific Plan area is approximately 210 acres and is located in the

7 Pacific Beach and Clairemont Mesa communities, just north of Mission Bay ... Rose Creek borders the

8 western part of the Specific Plan area and provides an open space connection to Mission Bay Park.

9 Interstate 5 (I-5) runs north-south through the Specific Plan area and is the boundary between the

10 Pacific Beach community on the west side and the Clairemont Mesa community on the east side."

11 9. The eastern portion of the Plan area is located with the Clairemont Mesa Community Plan

12 area. The western portion of the Plan Area is located within the Pacific Beach Community Plan area.

13 10. The City has represented that the Plan was intended to provide a framework to guide
14 transit-oriented development within the Plan area and implement the goals and policies of the General

15 Plan, including the City of Villages strategy. The City also represented that the Plan was intended to

16 identify necessary improvements including, among others, to transportation and public facilities. In

17 addition, the City has represented that the Plan seeks to complement and further the recommendations

18 of the Clairemont Mesa Community Plan and the Pacific Beach Community Plan. The City has also

19 represented that the Plan seeks to implement the goals and objectives of the City's Climate Action

20 Plan.

21 11. In December 2017, a draft of the Plan was made available for public review. Subsequent

22 drafts of the Plan were made available in April 2018, November 2018, and July 2019.

23 12. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was published for public comment on or

24 about April 13, 2018. Comments on the DEIR, including from Petitioner and Petitioner's members,

25 noted concerns about the Plan's impacts to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, traffic, transportation

26 and circulation, noise, water quality, parking, historical and cultural resources, watershed, open space,

27 land use, community character, public parks and facilities, lighting, cumulative impacts. Comments

28 also noted impacts to Rose Creek and to biological resources, habitat, mobility, and public/street trees

Friends of Rose Creek v. City of San Diego Page 3
Writ Petition

along Rose Creek and in the Pacific Beach Community Plan area. Comments additionally noted the

2 DEIR's failure to include Rose Creek and the surrounding area in its analysis of impacts. In addition,
comments noted the Pacific Beach Community Plan's requirement for parkland along Rose Creek.
Additional comments noted concerns about the current inadequate management of public lands at and
around Rose Creek, and the related potential impacts under the Plan. Comments also noted the EIR's

6 failure to adopt mitigation measure to address the Plan's significant impacts to, among other things, air
quality. Comments submitted on the Plan and DEIR noted inconsistencies with and violations of the
City's Climate Action Plan.
13. The Final EIR ("FEIR") was published on or about July 22, 2019.

10 14. Numerous comments, including from Petitioners, were received regarding the Plan and

11 FEIR. Comments noted concerns about traffic, pedestrian safety, mobility infrastructure
12 improvements, public health and safety, public facilities, and parkland along Rose Creek. Comments
13 also noted the Plan's inconsistencies with the General Plan and the Pacific Beach Community Plan
14 including, among other things, General Plan requirement for adequate park acreage.

15 15. On December 13, 2018, the Planning Commission met to consider the Plan and the EIR.

16 Testimony was received regarding several concerns. Comments noted concerns about the lack of

17 analysis of impacts to Rose Creek despite the identified functions of Rose Creek identified in the Plan.

18 Comments also noted concerns about the Plan's inconsistency with the Pacific Beach Community

19 Plan, impacts to mobility, public safety, transportation and circulation. In addition, Commissioner

20 Vicki Granowitz noted concerns about the failure to adopt mitigation measures to address impacts to
21 Rose Creek and the adjacent areas relied upon by, and impacted by, the Plan. Despite these concerns,

22 the Planning Commission voted to recommend to the City Council certification of the EIR and

23 approval of the Plan.

24 16. On January 15, 2019, the Clairemont Mesa Community Planning voted to recommend

25 conditional approval of the Plan. On January 23, 2019, the Pacific Beach Planning Group voted to

26 recommend conditional approval of the Plan.

27 17. On August 1, 2019, the City Council met to consider the Plan and EIR. Testimony,

28 including from Petitioner and Petitioner's members, was received regarding numerous concerns.

Friends of Rose Creek v. City of San Diego Writ Petition Page 4

Comments noted concerns about, among other things, the Plan's impacts to air quality, noise,

2 transportation and circulation, mobility, cumulative impacts, and public safety. Comments also noted

3 the need to improve existing infrastructure to mitigate impacts caused by the increased density under

4 the Plan. In addition, numerous comments were received concerning the Plan's reliance on Rose

5 Creek to accomplish its objectives without considering the related impacts to Rose Creek. Moreover,

6 comments noted concerns about the FEIR's failure to analyze the Plan's impacts to Rose Creek and the

7 surrounding area. Comments noted concerns about the neglected and environmentally compromised

8 existing condition of Rose Creek and the surrounding publicly owned land, and the impacts of the Plan

9 on these existing conditions. Testimony urged, among other things, the impacts to and planning for

10 Rose Creek be included in the Plan as the Plan relies on Rose Creek to accomplish its objectives and to

11 improve the currently inadequate management of Rose Creek, and to dedicate the area for public

12 parkland.

13 18. At the August 1, 2019 meeting, in discussing the Plan and its impacts, Councilmember

14 Barbara Bry noted serious concerns about the existing condition and management of Rose Creek, as

15 well as concerns regarding the City's decision to omit consideration for designating the area around

16 Rose Creek as parkland in spite of the Plan's impacts to the area. Councilmember Bry also noted

17 concerns about the failure to consider such measures for concurrent consideration, rather than deferral,

18 due to the Plan's increased density and related impacts for the area. Despite the numerous concerns,

19 City Council voted to approve the Plan and certify the FEIR.

20 19. On September 10, 2019, the City Council met to consider ordinances required for the

21 implementation of the Plan. Comments, including from Petitioner, noted the Plan's violation of City's

22 General Plan and the Pacific Beach Community Plan. Comments also noted that the EIR failed to,

23 among other things, analyze and address significant impacts, adequately analyze impacts to public

24 facilities, and address impacts to endangered species. In addition, comments noted the failure to adopt
25 mitigation measure to address significant impacts, to address a reasonable range of alternatives, and

26 that the proposed findings were inadequate. Comments also noted concerns with the City's violations

27 of CEQA, including but not limited to, the failure to consider substantial evidence of significant
28 environmental impacts. Despite these concerns, the City Council voted to adopt the ordinances.

6 Community Plan area; and Ordinance No. 0-2020-8, adopting the Balboa Avenue Station Area Specific

7 Plan.

8 21. A Notice of Determination was filed on September 13, 2019.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

10 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

11 22. Petitioners exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project
12 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section
13 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

14 hearings.

15 23. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section

16 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct

17 copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

18 24. Petitioners have advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
19 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

20 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

21 25. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

22 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

23 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

24 26. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

25 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the EIR. In the absence of such

26 remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners will suffer

27 irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.
