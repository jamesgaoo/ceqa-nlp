VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE! (*Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition

3 for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declarative and Injunctive Relief (*Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the determinations by Respondent City of Los Angeles

6 ("City" or "Respondent") that the "Permanent Supporting Housing Ordinance" ("PSHO") and
7 the "Interim Motel Conversion Ordinance" ("IMCO") are statutorily exempt from the California
8 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The two land use ordinances (Ordinance No. 185492 and
9 Ordinance No. 185489) were both adopted by the Los Angeles City Council on April 11, 2018 to
10 provide the City and real estate developers with streamlined approval methods; environmental
11  review exemptions; and other land use concessions (the "Project"). ME T |ouueuo 'dnous d77 LLZ06 12 2. Petitioner timely challenged the environmental reviews conducted by the City for

8 0SL BYNS *PAE EUJYSIM €888 13 the Project in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Petitioner alleged that the Project was not
Hills, Beverly 14 subjected to adequate environmental review under CEQA. The City had certified a Mitigated
15 Negative Declaration ("MND") for the PSHO, a Negative Declaration ("MND") for the IMCO,
16 and an addendum to the Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") prepared for the
17 Regional Transportation Plan (the "Environmental Review Documents.") While that legal action
18 was pending, the City lobbied the legislature in an effort to obtain a retroactive statutorily

19 exemption from CEQA for the two ordinances. That effort was successful, and the legislature
20 passed AB 1197 which was signed by the Governor and became effective on September 26,
21 2019. However, as explained below, AB 1997 as applied to Petitioner is unconstitutional and
22 therefore the City cannot deem the Project exempt from CEQA.
23 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
24 exemption determinations related to the Project. The City filed Notice of Exemptions with the
25 Los Angeles County Recorder on September 27, 2019. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate
26 the Project because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
27

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local laws and therefore failed to proceed a in a manner
3 required by law.

4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
Approvals and the exemption determinations for the Project because Respondent failed to
comply with CEQA and applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.

PARTIES 8

5. Petitioner, FIGHT BACK, VENICE!, formerly known as Venice Vision, is an
10 organization dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment in Los
11 Angeles and the Venice area. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial
Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 12 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental
13
8 0SL B}NS "PALE UIJYSI!M E8€8 protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure
'SIIIH Áueneg 14 to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims
15 raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests
16 are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.
17 6. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is charter city incorporated under the laws of
18| the State of California. The City is the lead agency under CEQA.
19 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
20 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
21 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
22 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
23 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
24 alleged in this Petition.

adopted for the Project. That action is 5 with the County Recorder. On or about May 11, 2018, Petition filed an action in Los Angeles

6 Superior Court challenging the environmental clearances

7 titled Fight Back, Venice! v. City of Los Angeles (Case No. BS173566). Among other things,
8 Petitioner has alleged that the City: (a) Failed to prepare a full EIR when one was required by
9 law, (b) Improperly analyzed the Project as two separate actions when they were legally one
10 project under CEQA, and (c) Illegally precommitted the city to known future projects without
adequate analysis of those future projects. Petitioner has further alleged that the City certified
d11 'dnoJ5 MET |ouueyo L1Z06 12 Environmental Review Documents which: (1) Were legally inadequate in their description of the 11
8

13 8 eyins "palg eujysi!m £ses Project and their analysis of its environmental impacts, (2) Were improperly piecemealed from
SILH AueAa 15 subjected to required public review, (4) Illegally failed to disclose the creation of a new local 14 each other and environmental review of other projects, (3) Were improperly circulated and not

16 CEQA exemption, (5) Inadequately addressed the environmental consequences of, possible
measures for, and potential alternatives to the Project, and (6) Did not adequately 17 mitigation
18  address issues raised by public comments.

20 legislation provides for a statutory exemption from CEQA for Ordinance Nos. 185492 and 19 16. Assembly Bill 1197 (AB 1197) became effective September 26, 2019. The

21 185489. The Legislature adopted AB 1197 as an urgency statute, to take effect immediately after

24 Los Angeles County Recorder asserting usage of the new exemption on September 27, 2019. 23 IV, Section 16 of the California Constitution. The City filed two Notices of Exemption with the

25 17. In bringing this challenge to the statutory exemption determination, Petitioner is
26 excused from any defense that may be raised by the City pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21177
27

5 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

(exhaustion of administrative remedies). Pub. Res. Code § 21177(e) specifically states the
following: "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this
3 division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to
4 raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project, or if the public
5 agency failed to give the notice required by law." The Supreme Court has confirmed that public

6 agencies such as the City must provide "notice of the ground for exemption determination"

7 before the exhaustion of administrative-remedies requirements will apply. Tomlinson v. County
8 of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal. 4th 281, 286. The City did not conduct any public hearings or provide
other opportunities for members of the public to raise objections to the usage of the statutory
10 exemption in question.

11 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

LIZ06 12 18. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
13 8 0S eYNS "PAla UIJYSIIM €8E8 Channel Law 'dnoig d17 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
'SIl!H Aueneg 14  implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
15 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
16 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
17 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
18 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
19 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
20 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
21 19. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
22 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. Mitigated negative declarations are
23 prepared when a project applicant revises a project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
24 by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
25 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
26 incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
27

6 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
2 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
3 agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative declaration. An agency
4 adopting a mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation monitoring or reporting
5 program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative declaration.

6 20. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
7 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a

8 result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an
9 environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the
10 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
11 provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
Channel Law. 'dnoig d17 4LZ06 12 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to

8 0GL EUNS "PAIE EJJYSI!M €8€8 13 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible
'SIlIH Auereg 14 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, a for which the lead
15 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration.
16 21. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a
17 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
18 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
19 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
20 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
21 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
22 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
23 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
24 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
25 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
26 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Project is Not Statutorily Exempt from CEQA Because AB 1197 is an Invalid Special

3 Statute Under Article IV, Section 16 of the California Constitution

4 22. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
5 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

6 23. Article IV, Section 16(b) of the California Constitution prohibits special statutes

7 "if a general statute can be made applicable." In Hollman v. Warren, the Supreme Court held that

8 where a special statute expressly chooses without reason to limit its scope to one county, and one
9 county only, it leaves "no room for the presumption of constitutionality or the presumption that
10 the Legislature had a conceivably rational basis." Hollman v. Warren (1948) 32 Cal.2d 351, 359.

11 24. In determining whether a "general statute can be made applicable," the issue is
90211 12 whether "there is a rational relationship between the purpose of the enactment . . . and the
13 § 0gL EINS "PAIE EUJYSIIM €8€8 d11 'dnoJs MET ¡ouueyO singling out." White v. State (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 298, 305. The classification must not be
SIIIH AueAeg 14 arbitrary, for the mere purpose of classification, that legislation really local or special may seem
15 to be general, but for the purpose of meeting different conditions naturally requiring different
16| legislation." Sagaser v. McCarthy (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 288, 305.
17 25. The Legislature found in AB 1197 that the bill was special statute within the
18 meaning of Article IV, Section 16(b), but except for citing "the unique circumstances faced by
19 the City of Los Angeles," it did not provide a rational relationship between a state interest and
20 singling out the City of Los Angeles. The Legislature singled out the City of Los Angeles
21 without providing a reason which might rationally be held to justify the classification except "the
22  unique circumstances faced by the City of Los Angeles." While amelioration of the
23 homelessness crisis is an issue of statewide importance, AB 1197 only refers to "unique
24 circumstances" as explanation for why a special statute is necessary and a general statute cannot
25 be made applicable. The conclusory explanation in AB 1197 is not enough to justify the diversity
26 of the legislation, showing no consideration of different conditions naturally requiring different
27

8 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1  legislation. Sagaser v. McCarthy, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 288. The homelessness crisis is
2 not "unique" to the City of Los Angeles.

3 26. As in the Hollman case, the Legislature here approved AB 1197, a special statute,

4 without giving a rational basis for singling out the City of Los Angeles. Hollman, supra, 32

5 Cal.2d at p. 359. The floor analyses in both the Assembly and State Senate are similarly absent

6 of any explanation of why "different conditions naturally require different legislation." Sagaser
7 V. McCarthy, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 288.

8 27. For these reasons, the Court should find that AB 1197 is unconstitutional as an
9 invalid special statute under Article IV, Section 16 of the California Constitution.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 10

11 (Project is Not Statutorily Exempt from CEQA Because AB 1197 May Not Be Applied
d11 'dnoJg MET |3uueuO LLZ06 12 Retroactively as Urgency Legislation which Grants a Special Privilege to Respondent)
13 28. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in 8 0gL BINS "PALE EUJYS|!M €888 'SIl!H ALEASg 14 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
15 29. Article IV, Section 8(d) of the California Constitution provides that an urgency

17 the Legislature enacts an urgency statute in violation of Section 8(d), which prohibits urgency 16 statute may not "grant any franchise or special privilege, or create any vested right or interest." If

18 statutes from granting a "special privilege," the remedy is to strike the offending portion of the
19 statute "as invalid." Sagaser v. McCarthy, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 307.
There is no question that this was urgency legislation. Nor is there any question
21 that the City of Los Angeles has been granted the special privilege of avoiding compliance with 20 30.

22 CEQA with respect to the PSHO and IMCO. Sagaser is distinguishable. Sagaser held that a

owners to sell the 23 particular bill did not involve a "special privilege" because it merely authorized prison
24 construction on a site a and did not mandate purchase of the site or require the
25 land to the state. "The owner of Section 34 could refuse to sell to the state. The state could

26 decide that the prison should be built on another site. AB No. 2251 merely authorizes
27

9 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

construction on a particular site. Should another site be purchased, the Legislature could amend
2 the provision to authorize construction on the new site. Section 5, in amending section 9 of the
3 1983 statute, grants neither an exclusive nor a special privilege." Sagaser v. McCarthy, supra,

4 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 307. Authorizing construction on a site does not directly confer or take
5 away a right, whether the rights of the state or of the owners of the land. If the price was not
6 right, the state could decide not to buy the land, or the owners of the land could decide not to sell
7 the land to the state. In the instant case, the right of the public to access the information about
8 environmental consequences of PSHO and IMCO is diminished, while the City of Los Angeles
9 is directly exempted from the requirements of CEQA for the purposes of adopting PSHO and
10 IMCO. Meanwhile, any other city or county adopting similar ordinances will still need to comply
11 with CEQA.
MET uueyO Group, d17 L1Z06 12 31. By granting a special privilege to the City of Los Angeles through urgency
13 8 0GL OUNS "PALE EUJYSIM €888 legislation, AB 1197 violates Article IV, Section 8 of the California Constitution.
14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 'SIl!H ÁLeA3g 15 (Project is Not Statutorily Exempt from CEQA Because AB 1197 Violates Petitioner's
16 Equal Protection Under the Law)
17 32. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
18 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
19 33. AB 1197 violates Petitioner's equal protection rights. Strict scrutiny is the is
20 applicable standard of review in this instance because the Legislature has targeted a "class of
21 one." Although legislation may impose special burdens upon a defined class to achieve t
22| permissible goal, there must be some rationality in the nature of the class. In the instant case,
23 only PSHO and IMCO were granted a statutory exemption from CEQA, only one case was
24 challenging the PSHO and IMCO in court, and no other petitioner could challenge the PSHO and
25 IMCO due to the passage of the applicable statute of limitations in May 2018.
26 34. A petitioner "can establish a 'class of one' equal protection claim by
27

10 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1  demonstrating that the petitioner 'has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly
2 situated and that there is no basis for the difference in treatment." Squaw Valley Dev. Co. v.
3 Goldberg (9th Cir. 2004) 375 F.3d 936, 944. Petitioner contends that the City of Los Angeles
4 lobbied the Legislature to secure a statutory exemption from CEQA because Petitioner was set
a on a course to successfully challenge the PSHO and IMCO. Further, Petitioner contends the

6 Legislature passed AB 1197 with animus toward Petitioner fueled by Respondent's lobbying.
7 35. Petitioner is clearly a "class of one" with respect to the retroactive exemption of
the PSHO and IMCO. There are no other persons who challenged the PSHO and IMCO under
9 CEQA. The only person in the class to which the exemption in AB 1197 applies is the Petitioner. 8

10 36. "Class of one" equal protection claims often involve claims that a government
11 action was based on vindictive action, illegitimate animus, or ill will. Vill. of Willowbrook v. 8 d17 "dnoJg MET |BuueyO 41Z06 ezns "paia eujys|!m €:e8 12 Olech (2000) 528 U.S. 562, 564. Since Petitioner initiated litigation, Respondent has coordinated
13 8 with multiple parties and news outlets, including the United Way and the Los Angeles Times, in
'SIl!H ÁpeAeg 14 an attempt to disparage Petitioner. Editorials in the Los Angeles Times as well as targeted
15 advertisements placed throughout the City have been used to undermine Petitioner's reputation

17 Petitioner's Motion to Compel Production of a Privilege Log in Fight Back, Venice! v. City of 16 and motives, as well as the legitimacy of the litigation. After the court ruled in favor of

18 Los Angeles (Case No. BS173566), Petitioner alleges that the City upped the ante by going
19 directly to the Legislature to kill the ongoing case.
20 37. A heightened standard of review is also applicable because fundamental rights are
21 at play, namely the third right declared in Article I of the California Constitution (the Declaration
22 of Rights). Only the inalienable rights of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring,
23 possessing, and protecting property, pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy, the
24 freedom of speech and press, come before the right of the people to be involved in their
25 governance. Cal. Const., art. I, § 3. The rights in Section 3 are declared even before the rights
26 related to the free exercise and nonestablishment of religion. Cal. Const., art. I, § 4. §
27

11 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

38. Among the rights of the people in Article I, Section 3 are "the right to instruct
2 their representatives" (Cal. Const., art. I, § 3(a)), and "the right of access to information
3 concerning the conduct of the people's business (Cal. Const., art. I § 3(b)). These are

4 fundamental rights for the same reasons that education was held to be fundamental interest in

5 Serrano v. Priest (1971) 5 Cal.3d 584. The rights implicated in this case, like education, "not

6 only affect[] directly a vastly greater number of persons than the criminal law, but it affects them
7 in ways which-to the statehave an enormous and much more varied significance." Id. at p.
8 607. Like education, these rights."support[] each and every other value of a democratic society"
9 (Ibid.), "are crucial to participating in, and the functioning of, a democracy" (Ibid.), and are
10 "preservative of other basic civil and political rights" (Id. at p. 608). Furthermore, like education,
11 they "make[] more meaningful the casting of a ballot" and are "likely to provide the MET |BuueYO Group, d17 LLZ06 12  understanding of, and the interest in, public issues which are the spur to involvement in other
8 OGL EUNS "PAIE EUJUSIIM €888 13 civic and political activities." (Ibid.)'
'SIl!H Auereg 14 39. The conclusion in Sagaser that "[t]he rights derived from the environmental
15 quality act are not of constitutional dimension and that the Legislature may eliminate any of its
16 requirements" (Sagaser v. McCarthy, supra, 176 Cal.App.3d at p. 299) is not relevant to this
17 equal protection claim raised by Petitioner. As support for this proposition, Sagaser relied on Lee
18 V. Lost Hills Water Dist. (1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 630, 635, but this case merely involved the
19 question of whether due process considerations required notice beyond that which was required
20 by statute. Furthermore, the conclusion in Sagaser is mere dicta because Sagaser only held that
21 "no fundamental right is involved in the granting of a construction permit." 176 Cal.App.3d at p.
22 303. This is not relevant to the situation before the court in the instant case, nor are the cases that
23 Sagaser cites. Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Com. v. Bd. Of Trs. (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 274 also
24 dealt with a construction permit. Mountain Def. League v. Bd. of Supervsiors (1977) 65

26 See also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907. (*The California

2 right in his neighbor receiving or behind denied a zoning variance or in his neighbors receiving &
3 special use permit. (Id. at p. 730).
4 40. Sagaser also erroneously relied on inapposite federal precedent relating to NEPA:
5 "We also point out that California courts rely upon federal precedents to aid in their
6 interpretation of parallel provisions contained in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
7 (42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq.). In the environmental case, Ely v. Velde (4th Cir. 1971) 451 F.2d
8 1130, 1139, the Fourth Circuit court refused to elevate to a constitutional level such concerns as

9 voiced by appellants. The federal act, NEPA, has been held to create only procedural, not
10 substantive rights." Sagaser v. McCarthy, supra, 176. Cal.App.3d at p. 299. The analysis in
11
® Sagaser misses critical distinction between NEPA and CEQA. As stated by a leading treatise:
Channel Law Group, d17 L1Z06 12 "The duties placed on federal agencies by NEPA have been characterized by the U.S. Supreme
13 8 eyng "pAg eujus|!m €:s8 Court as "essentially procedural." In contrast, CEQA is not merely procedural but requires state
'SII!H ÁueAES 14 and local agencies to protect the environment by adopting feasible mitigation measures and
15 alternatives identified in EIRs.* CEQA and NEPA also differ in the details of their
16 implementation."* See San Francisco Ecology Center v. City and County of San Francisco
17 (1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 584, 590-591, 122 Cal. Rptr. 100 (CEQA places higher priority on

20 41. One of the basic purposes of CEQA is to inform the public generally of the
21 environmental impact of a proposed project. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d
22 68, 86. This is accomplished by conducting environmental reviews and providing the public the
23 right to access and comment on that information. Courts have recognized that there is a direct
24 relationship between CEQA and the democratic process. The environmental review process
25 enables the public to determine the environmental and economic values of their elected and
26 appointed officials, thus allowing for appropriate action come election day should a majority of

the voters disagree. People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 842.

2 42. Because AB 1197 impinges on a fundamental right, it is subject to strict scrutiny,

3 and must be justified by a compelling interest under equal protection. Plyler v. Doe (1982) 457
U.S. 202; Chandis Sec. Co. v. City of Dana Point (1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 475, 483. Under the

5 "compelling interest test," the state must show the law serves a compelling government interest,

6 and further, that any distinction drawn is necessary to further that interest. Bjornestad v. Hulse
7 (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1568, 1587.

8 43. In adopting AB 1197, the Legislature did not show compelling government

0 interest in singling out Petitioner as a "class of one" a and that singling out Petitioner was not
10 necessary to further any otherwise applicable state interest in developing supportive housing.

16 45. Article I, Section 3(b) of the California Constitution guarantees "the people have
17 the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and therefore,

21| concerning the environmental impacts of government action. While our state Constitution
22 contemplates that this right can be constrained, any statute that is adopted "that limits the right of

2 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Project is Not Statutorily Exempt from CEQA Because Applying AB 1197 Retroactively
Violates Petitioner's Due Process Rights)

5 47. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
6 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

48. The Legislature may statutorily exempt projects from certain requirements under
8 CEQA prospectively, but a retrospective law, such as AB 1197,
9 may contravene the due process

10 clause of the Fourteenth Amendment if it impairs vested rights. (In Re Marriage of Bouquet

11 (1976) 16 Cal.3d 583, 592.) In In Re Marriage of Bouquet, the Supreme Court observed that

Channel Law Group, d77 +LZ06 retroactively was "frequently disfavored" (Id. at p. 592), and noted that one of the key factors in

8 12 determining whether a right is vested, and when a statute may be applied retroactively is whether
13 it was "necessary to subserve a sufficiently important a state interest. Id. at p. 593.
~ 14 49.

Beverly The urgency clause of AB 1197 identifies the state interest in retroactive
15 application of AB 1197 as the City's need to develop supportive housing "in an expeditious
16 manner." While homelessness is a significant issue for the State of California, the interest
17 addressed in AB 1197 is not of statewide significance. Instead, AB 1197 is a concerned with one
18

19 approach to supportive housing in one municipality. The state interest here is only a local
interest, a not one of concern to the state as a whole. This is in contrast to Sagaser, where the
20 Legislature was concerned with alleviating critical overcrowding in the
21 Cal.App.3d at p. 305. state prison system. 176

22 50.

23 When weighing the importance of the state issue in question with the rights being

24 compromised, the interests of the Petitioner in this case are clearly of greater public policy

25 significance, as enshrined in the state constitution. As discussed above, California residents have
a constitutional expectation that the business of public officials and agencies is open to public
26 scrutiny. As discussed above, Article I, Section 3(b) provides, in relevant part: "The people have
27

28 15

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the right of access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and therefore,
2 the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to
3 public scrutiny."

51. CEQA is one of the primary tools for ensuring the preservation of the rights'
5 delineated in Article I. Section 3 of the California Constitution. For example, CEQA Guidelines
6 section 15201 provide that "[p]ublic participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. The
7 purpose of an EIR is "to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental
8 consequences of their decisions before they are made." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of
Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. Environmental review documents must contain facts and
10 analysis, not bare conclusions or opinions about them, and must include sufficient detail for
OgL EyNS "PALE EJJYSIIM €888 11 those who did not participate in the preparation to understand and consider the issues raised by Channel Law Group, LLP 90211 12 the proposed project. Preservation Action Council v. City of San Jose (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th

8 13 1336, 1353. Further, agency explanations must be sufficient to enable meaningful public
'SIllH ÁueAeg 14 | participation and criticism. Save Round Valley Alliance v. Cnty. of Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th
15 1437, 1458.

16 52. Petitioner has perfected its rights by virtue of it challenge to the PSHO and IMCO
17 before the City Council and the subsequent legal challenge to the PSHO and IMCO currently
18 pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Petitioner has extensively relied on the
19 procedures and processes outlined in CEQA that allow for challenge to PSHO and IMCO. AB
20 1197 would completely disrupt and disseminate the actions undertaken by Petitioner to date and
21 would absolve the City of its obligations to adhere to the mitigation measures that it has
22 committed to undertake in conjunction with the Project. In its MND, the City admitted that the
23 PSHO would have potentially significant environmental impacts with regard to the following
24 resource categories: (1) Noise, (2) Tribal Cultural Resources, (3) Cultural Resources and (4)
25 Hazards and Hazardous Materials. Yet, AB 1197 wipes clean all of the City's responsibilities to
26 reduce those potential impacts and enforce a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
27

28 16

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Moreover, the major environmental issues of concern brought by Petitioner in its original
2 challenge were not addressed in AB 1197.

3 53. Unlike construction permits (Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Com. V. Bd. of Trs.
4 (1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 280 ("[there is] no fundamental right [] involved in granting, as
5 opposed to the cancellation, of a construction permit')), particular zoning designations (City of
6 Carmel-By-The-Sea v. Bd. of Supervisors (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 229, 237), or development
7 standards (Plan for Acadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 725), the
8 constitutional right to access information concerning environmental consequences of decisions
9 before they are made is a vested right.
10 54. Under the present circumstances, Petitioner has acquired a vested right that cannot
11
8 be impaired by AB1197. To do so would retroactively deny Petitioner's due process rights.
MET |euueuO dnoJg d77 L1Z06 12 Respondent cannot therefore rely on the statutory exemption provided by the statute.
13 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 8 oyn "pAIE EJJYSIM €8E8 'SIl!H ALBAOS 14 (Declaratory Relief)
15 55. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
16 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
17 56. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' exemption determination
18 failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA because the statutory exemption provided by
19 AB 1197 was unconstitutional as applied to Petitioner.
20 57. Respondents have mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal
21 requirements applicable to the Project.
22 58. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
23 59. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
24 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
25 60. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
26 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other

laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which
2 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
3 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
4 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
5 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is

6 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
7 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
8 Procedure section 1060.

9 61. Petitioner requests a judicial declaration that Respondents' actions and conduct
10 alleged in this Petition have violated and will violate CEQA and other laws identified herein.

18 served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
19 against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of the letter

To Whom It May Concern:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Fight Back, Venice!, formally known as Venice Vision, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City erroneously determined that the Permanent Supportive Housing Ordinance (No. 185492) and the Interim Motel Conversion Ordinance (No. 185489) was statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to PRC 21080.27(b)(1) and PRC 21080.27(b)(3). The Petition will also challenge that the Addendum to the Southern California
Association of Government's 2016-2040 RTP/SCS Programmatic Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") is not statutorily exempt from CEQA. The Petition will allege that the statutory exemption is not applicable because AB 1997 is unconstitutional. The City Council of the City of Los Angeles approved the Ordinances and the Addendum on or about April 11, 2018. The City filed Notice of
Exemptions with the County Recorder asserting usage of the statutory exemption provided by AB 1197 on September 27, 2019.
