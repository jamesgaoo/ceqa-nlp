23 INTRODUCTION

24 This action challenges the decision of the City and County of San Francisco and its

25 Planning Department (*Respondents") to approve the Environmental Impact Report (*EIR") and

26 associated project approvals for the India Basin Mixed-Use Project (the "Project"). The Project

27 proposes conversion of industrial zoned land to residential and a development of approximately

28 1.575 dwelling units, 209,000 square feet of non-residential land use, 1,800 parking spaces, and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT Banya 2000 LLC v. CCSF et al.

- approximately 24.5 acres of open space attended by transportation, utility, infrastructure, and

2 geotechnical and shoreline improvements.

3 2. Petitioners BANYA 2000 LLC alleged throughout the administrative process that

4 significant new information had been added to the EIR after public notice was given but beford

5 certification, to wit, the addition of more than 300 residential units. Petitioner alleges that this

6 new information required recirculation of the EIR.

7 3. Petitioner alleges that the proposed addition of residential units would create new and
8 significant environmental impacts requiring further mitigation measures.

10 THE PARTIES

11 Petitioner BANYA 2000 LLC is a Limited Liability Company doing business in the State

12 of California and owner of the property housing Archimedes Banya SF, a community bathing
13 facility providing cultural and recreational opportunities to San Francisco. BANYA 2000 LLC

14 a owns property located on a lot adjacent to and surrounded by the proposed site of the Project and
15 will be directly affected by environmental impact of the Project. BANYA 2000 LLC objected to
16 the approval and construction of the Project and will be directly and adversely affected by the
17 Project.

18 5. Petitioner has environmental, educational, recreational, and aesthetic interests in the

19 Project area and its plants and wildlife. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by

20 the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause

21 lirreversible harm to the natural environment and its recreational assets. Petitioner has a direct

22 and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and California Code of
Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). The maintenance and 23

24 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public

25 from the environmental and other harms alleged herein.

26 6. Respondent SAN FRANCSICO PLANNING DEPARTMENT ("DEPARTMENT") is

27 government agency of the CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO (*CITY") and is the "lead agency" for

28 the purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
Banya 2000 LLC v. CCSF el al.
2 -

conducting environmental review of the proposed actions. The Department has a duty to comply

2 with CEQA and other State Laws.

3 7. Respondent CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO is a political subdivision of the State of

4 California responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the County of San Francisco.

5 including implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA. The City, acting through

6 its elected officials, is charged with the responsibility under CEQA to conduct a proper review of
7 the proposed action's environmental impacts, and the City, acting through its elected officials,

8 grants the various approvals necessary for the Project. The City has a duty to comply with
9 CEQA and other State Laws.

10 8. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest is BUILD, INC. a
11 Corporation doing business in the City and County of San Francisco and is the applicant for
12 approval of the Project.

13 9. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
14 associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue said
15 respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true names

16 and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent and/on
17 employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the

18 course and scope of such Respondents' agency and/or employment.

19 10. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
20 associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and therefore
21 sue said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to
22 show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

23

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 11. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside Respondents' decision
26 to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively
27 section 1085) and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively 21168) and 21168.9.

- 12.

2 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court of San Francisco because

3 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in this County. The significant

4 environmental impacts of the Project would occur in the City and County of San Francisco, and
the Project would impact the interests of San Francisco residents.

5 13.

6 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

7 21167.5 by serving written notices of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on

8 Respondents on December 6, 2018. A copy of the written notices and proof of service are
attached hereto as Exhibit A.

9 14.

10 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

11 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioners' election to prepare the record of

12 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of Petitioners' election to prepare the

13 record of administrative proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

15.

14 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has

15 exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law including, inter alia,

16 submitting extensive comments objecting to the approval of the project and presenting to
Respondents the flaws in its environmental review.

17 16.

18 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

19 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside certification

20 of the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval
will remain in effect in violation of state law.

21 17.

22 This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Recourses Code section 21167 and
CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

23

24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 The Proposed Project

26 18.

27 By this action, Petitioners challenge the decision of Respondents to approve the Project
based upon a legally inadequate EIR.

1 19. The Project is located on approximately 39 acres located along the India Basin shoreline

2 in San Francisco.

3 20. The Project location is biologically sensitive as running along a shoreline and containing

4 wetlands habitat, and there is data about actual and possible contamination on the site of the

5 Project that if disturbed could adversely affect the environment.

6 Petitioner's Comments on the Draft EIR

7 21. On or about June 1, 2016, the CITY, acting through the DEPARTMENT, provided public

8 notice of determination that project known as "India Basin Mixed Use Project" ("Project") will

9 require EIR under CEQA by publication in a newspaper of general circulation.

10 22. On or about September 13, 2017 the DEPARTMENT published the Draft EIR

11 ("DEIR"), and provided public notice in a newspaper of general circulation of the availability of

12 the DEIR for public review and comment and of the date and time of the Planning Commission
13 public hearing on the DEIR; Petitioner believes that this notice was mailed to the Department's

14 list of persons requesting such notice and to property owners and occupants within a 300-foot

15 radius of the site on September 13, 2017.
16 23. The DEPARTMENT did not provide a translated Notice of Availability of the DEIR to
17 the public at the time of its publication, despite the subject matter of the EIR being located
18 among communities of Concentrated Numbers of Limited English Speaking Persons and in

19 derogation of SF Administrative Code section 91 et seq, the San Francisco Language Access

20 Ordinance.

21 24. The DEIR included two project alternatives: the "Proposed Project" and the "Variant".

22 The Proposed Project included 1,240,100 gross square feet ("gsf") (1240 units) of Residential

23 Space, 275,330 gsf of Commercial Space, 50,000 gsf of Institutional/Educational space, 679,900
24 gsf (1,800 spaces) of Parking spaces, and 1,240 of Bike spaces. The Variant included 417,300

25 gsf (500 units) of Residential Space, 1,000,000 gsf of Commercial Space, 50,000 gsf of

The Lead Agency's Modification of the EIR

2 25.

3 During the period between publication of the DEIR and the approved EIR, the DEIR was

4 modified by the Project Sponsors and the "Revised Proposed Project" was added. Revised

5 Proposed Project included 1,506,234 gross square feet (*gsf") (1,575 units) of Residential Space,
209,106 gsf of Commercial Space, 0 gsf of Institutional/Educational space, 679,900 gsf (1,800
spaces) of Parking space, 1,575 of Bike spaces.
Petitioner's Comments on the Final EIR

8 26.

9 Under the Revised Proposed Project there is substantial increase in proposed residential

10 use of the Project: over 20% in gross square footage and almost 30% in number of residential

11 unit, which in turn will greatly change traffic patterns, energy consumption, utilities load levels
and patterns, levels and patterns of noise and light.

12 27.

13 Despite the significant new information of the Revised Proposed Project detailed above,
the DEPARTMENT did not recirculate the revised EIR.

14 Respondents' Approval of the EIR

15 28.

16 On or about July 26, 2018 the Planning Commission certified the Final Environmental
Impact Report (*FEIR").

17 29.

18 On or about August 23, 2018 Mikhail Brodsky filed a letter on behalf of Archimedes

19 Banya SF to the BOARD OF SUPER VISORS ("BOARD") appealing the FEIR certification.
30.

20 The BOARD held public hearings on October 2, 2018 and October 16, 2018, and

21 following public hearings the BOARD affirmed the Planning Commission's certification of the
FEIR.

22 31.

23 32. On or about November 1, 2018 the DEPARTMENT approved Project as revised.

DN On or about November 8, 2018 then DEPARTMENT filed Notice of Determination of
the Project approval with San Francisco County Clerk.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

W Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR

4 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

5 33.

6 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

7 CEQA is designed to ensure that long-term protection of the environment be the guiding

8 criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the a potential to

9

10 cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements

11 of the statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially
significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such

12

13 that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on
the proposed project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that

14

15 are based on substantial evidence before the decisionmakers. Additionally, the EIR must analyze
feasible mitigation measures and a reasonable range of alternatives to the project.
35.
16 The EIR was defective for the above purposes because it was

17 disseminated among

18 I communities of limited English speakers without translation, and thus deprived community

19 members the opportunity to meaningfully participate in the process and provide relevant
information and feedback to decisionmakers.

36.

20

21 CEQA mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures

22 that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the

23 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated a to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars

24 the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the
project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.
37.
25

26 CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of the

27 EIR and agency's findings and conclusions, and that the agency explain how the evidence in the
record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
38.
28 Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
manner required by law by relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of CEQA for

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
Banya 2000 LLC v. CCSF et al.
.7-

-

2 disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts on biological resources, air
quality, water supplies, water quality, traffic, aesthetics, and noise.

3 39.

4 Between the time of the DEIR and the FEIR evidence of environmental fraud related to

5 radioactive contamination on the adjacent property was discovered. This resulted in a retesting

6 on the adjacent property. During the retesting radioactive waste was discovered on the adjacent
property in locations with no historical record of radioactive use. The draft EIR stated that no
7  radioactive testing was required on the land in question because historical record review

8

9 determined that no such use occurred. Considering these new uncovered facts related to

10 widespread fraud and the discovery of radioactive waste at locations with no historical record off

11 radioactive use, it would be adequate for the Planning Commission to reconsider their decision to
not perform radiological testing at the site of the project.
12 40.

13 Under the Revised Proposed Project there is substantial increase in proposed residential

14 use of the Project: over 20% in gross square footage and almost 30% in number of residential

15 units, which in turn will greatly change traffic patterns, energy consumption, utilities load levels

16 and patterns, levels and patterns of noise and light, none of this was addressed in the DEIR on

17 FEIR.as the impacts and mitigations were not adjusted for the Revised Proposed Project.
41.

18 At the Board of Supervisors meeting to approve the EIR, the Bay Area Air Quality

19 Management District in collaboration with the Planning Commission suggested additional

20 mitigations related to air quality during construction. The Board of Supervisors acknowledged
the legitimacy of some of these mitigations, but did not send the EIR back to the Planning
21 Commission to revise the EIR.

22 42. Based

23 upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under CEQA.

24 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project.
As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
25  certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

3 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
4 43. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
44. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is
6 prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be amended and
7 recirculated for public review and comment.
8 45. The revised Project proposal amounts to substantial changes to the Project, which added
significant new information to the EIR prior to the City's decision to certify the EIR as compliant
10 with CEQA and approve the Project on November 1, 2018.
11 46. Substantial changes and significant new information includes but is not limited to:
12 increasing the project residential density by almost 30% without considering the additionall
13 impacts and mitigations, new information related to radioactive waste and fraudulent data on
14 adjacent properties without considering mitigations such as testing before excavation and
15 significant testimony related to the cultural importance of Archimedes Banya SF.
16 47. Despite the significant changes, Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR as required
17 under CEQA. As a result of Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, the public and othen
18 public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the
19 approved Project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new information
20 regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.
21 48. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Respondents failed to proceed in the mannen
22 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial
23 evidence.
24

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010

To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil in case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money
owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real of property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
