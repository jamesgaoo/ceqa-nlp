9 "Real Parties in Interest"), and by this verified First Amended Petition and Complaint ("First

10 Amended Petition") allege as follows:

INTRODUCTION
11 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the City's July 2, 2019 and July 16, 2019
12 decisions to adopt environmental findings pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act,
13 Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. and Title 14, California Code of Regulations
14 ("CCR"), § 15000 et seq. ("CEQA"), certify the Final Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIR"
15 or "FEIR"), approve a Mitigation Monitoring And Reporting Program (*MMRP"), adopt a
16 Statement Of Overriding Considerations, and adopt ordinances approving Development Agreement
17 No. 18-032 and Development Agreement No. 18-033 ("Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732")
18 (collectively, "Project Approvals") for the Citadel Outlet Expansion and 10-Acre Development
19 Project in Commerce, California (SCH 2016091024) (*Project").

20 2. The Project is a massive retail, industrial, and hospitality development expanding

21 the City's existing 8-acre Citadel Shopping Outlet by over a million square feet on a 44-acre

22 Project site. The Project would add four new retail buildings, five restaurants, three hotels (with a

23 total of 770 guest rooms), three multi-level commercial buildings, a combined warehouse /

24 industrial building, a movie/entertainment complex, thousands of new parking spaces, a public

25 facility, and its own on-site monorail transportation system to the Project site. The Project will take

26 over six years to construct and employ hundreds of construction workers during that time. It will

27 employ 1,750 workers at operation. The Project site is located in the City of Commerce, just six

28 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

-1-
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

3. Throughout the life of the Project, the development will generate significant traffic,

2 and localized and regional air pollution from greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, reactive organic

3 gases ("ROG"), and nitrogen oxides ("NOx"). The Project will also generate significant cancer-

4 causing diesel particulate matter ("DPM") emissions during the Project's lengthy six-year

5 overlapping demolition, construction and operation phases, causing an excess cancer risk to adults,

6 children, and infants living near the Project site of 11, 81, and 84 in one million, respectively,

7 during Project construction, and an elevated lifetime cancer risk of 180 in one million for a 30-year

8 exposure duration during the life of the Project. The air pollution that will be generated by the

9 Project's emissions from mobile sources, operations, and construction vastly exceeds the South

10 Coast Air Quality Management District's ("SCAQMD") applicable air quality significance

11 thresholds, resulting in potentially significant and unmitigated air quality and public health
impacts.
12 4. The Project is also likely to create potentially significant growth-inducing impacts
13 in the City and surrounding communities, will cause significant and unmitigated noise impacts
14 during construction and operation, and will require the use of substantial amounts of water that
15 may significantly impact local residents and the region by straining local water supplies. The City
16 failed to analyze and mitigate these potentially significant impacts prior to approving the Project, in
17 violation of CEQA.
18 5. The FEIR prepared for the Project was fundamentally inadequate, and the City
19 failed to fulfill its most basic duties under CEQA, including, in particular, the duty to formulate
20 feasible and effective mitigation measures to mitigate significant impacts caused by the Project. In

21 the FEIR, the City failed to provide even basic data required for proper analysis of numerous

22 potentially significant impacts, failed to show the connection between the data it did provide and

23 it the conclusions it purported to draw, and lacked substantial evidence to support many of the City's

24 impact and mitigation determinations. As a result, the City failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate

25 the Project's significant impacts on the environment and public health in the FEIR, in violation of

26 CEQA.

6.
27 The City also failed to prepare a mandatory water supply assessment ("WSA") for

28 the Project, as required by both CEQA and the State Water Code. Under the CEQA Guidelines

- 2-
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

pnd and Water Code, a WSA is required for all "water-demand projects," which includes any shopping

2 center or business establishment employing more than 1,000 persons or having more than 500,000

3 square feet of floor space, a commercial office building employing more than 1,000 persons or

4 having more than 250,000 square feet of floor space, or a hotel or motel having more than 500

5 rooms. The Project indisputably meets these standards, yet the City failed to prepare the requisite

6 WSA.

7. 7 The Los Angeles region experienced a prolonged drought in the early years of this

8 decade. The FEIR disclosed that the City's local water service provider, California Water Service
Company ("Cal Water"), currently lacks the capacity to produce and deliver its allocated State
Water Project water supply, and lacks other accessible water sources. The FEIR estimated that the 10 Project will use at least 185 acre-feet of water per year, comprising up to 6% of Cal Water's current
11 annual production, yet failed to include a WSA to disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's
12 potentially significant impacts on water supply. Instead, the FEIR summarily concluded, with no
13 evidence, that the Project's water supply impacts would be less than significant, in violation of
14 both CEQA and the Water Code.
15 8. Petitioners and other members of the public submitted substantial evidence
16 demonstrating that the Project would have significant and unmitigated impacts on air quality,
17 traffic, noise, and water supply that the FEIR failed to disclose and mitigate, including over 500

18 pages of written comment letters on the Project. These comments, which included the technical

19 comments of several qualified consultants, raised serious concerns about the Project's unexamined

20 impacts and inadequate mitigation of the Project's impacts on air quality, noise, future water

21 supply, transportation and traffic, land use and planning, hydrology, and the failure to consider a

22 reasonable range of alternatives to lessen the Project's impacts, to name a few.

23 9. Petitioners and other members of the public and community representatives also

24 showed up in force at Project hearings to voice their concerns about the City's failure to comply

25 with its legal duty to disclose and mitigate the Project's significant environmental impacts prior to

26 approval.

10. The City's response was a rushed and inadequate FEIR which failed to 27

28 meaningfully respond to public comments, and failed to correct the substantial errors and

- 3 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 omissions in the City's analysis. The City's environmental review process failed on every level to

2 inform the public of the Project's significant impacts on the environment and feasible alternatives

3 to the Project and to examine, much less incorporate, feasible, enforceable mitigation measures that

4 would lessen or avoid those impacts.

5 11. In approving an FEIR with systemic flaws, which include, but are limited to, factual

6 inconsistencies, analytic gaps, and misleading statements, and which fails to include legally-

7 mandated documents and studies, the City acted in a manner that was arbitrary and capricious, in

8 violation of its duties and obligations under CEQA and the Water Code.
12.
9 The City abused its discretion and proceeded in a manner inconsistent with law in

10 certifying an inadequate FEIR and adopting findings that the Project's significant impacts would be

11 mitigated to the fullest extent feasible with the mitigation measures included in the MMRP, when,

12 in fact, the FEIR substantially failed to disclose and mitigate all of the Project's potentially
significant impacts. Because the manner in which the City reviewed and approved the Project
13 violated CEQA and the Water Code, its approval of the Project must be set aside.
14 13. Petitioners also bring this action to challenge Respondent City Council's September
15 17, 2019 action to "table" two timely filed citizen-sponsored referendum petitions seeking
16 rescission of Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732 ("Referendum Petitions") without continuing the
17 hearing on the Referendum Petitions to a specified time and a place.
18 14. On September 17, 2019, the City Council opened its hearing to determine the City's
19 action on the Referendum Petitions, as required by Elections Code section 9241. Rather than
20 conduct the hearing, the City Council instead voted to "table this item to a later date." (City of

21 Commerce Minutes of September 17, 2019 City Council hearing, Item 15 (*Minutes")). The City

22 Council failed to specify a date, time, or place for the continued hearing, as required by the Ralph

23 M. Brown Act, Government Code sections 54950-54962 ("Brown Act"), and has failed to take any

24 action to re-open the hearing or take any legally required action on Referendum Petitions since the

25 Petitions were "tabled." These actions by the City Council violated the Brown Act's hearing

26 adjournment and continuance requirements, pursuant to Section 54955 and 54955.1 of the Act,

27 violated the public's due process rights, and violated the City's duty to provide for an open meeting
in accordance with Section 54953 of the Act.
28

- 4-
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 15. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate requiring the City to rescind its certification of

2 the FEIR and to require the City to fully comply with CEQA before considering the issuance of

3 any permits for the Project.

4 16. Petitioners also seek a writ of mandate, and declaratory and injunctive relief,

5 requiring the City Council to un-table the Referendum Petitions, and to reschedule the Referendum

6 Petitions for an immediate public hearing at which the City must take the previously agendized

7 actions related to the Referendum Petitions that were identified in the September 17, 2019 City

8 Council Agenda.

21 (administrative mandamus); and PRC section 21168 and/or section 21168.5 (judicial review under

22 CEQA). The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to CCP section 1060 and

23 injunctive relief pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure, sections 525 et seq.

24 32. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

25 in and for the County of Los Angeles pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public

26 officers), 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and 395 (actions generally) because

27 the Respondents include a local agency of the State of California, and public officers of a local

28 agency of the State of California. Venue is proper in this Court because the majority of Project

- 9-
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

activities will occur within the County of Los Angeles, and the environmental impacts of the

2 Project will be acutely felt within the County. The causes of action alleged in this Petition, or some

3 part of those causes of action, arise in this County. (CCP, § 393; Cal. State Parks Foundation v.

4 Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 826.)

5 33. The original Petition, and this First Amended Petition, are timely filed within all

6 applicable statutes of limitations. This action is timely under CEQA because the original Petition

7 was filed within 30 days of the City's July 3, 2019 and July 17, 2019 Notices of Determination.

8 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167(b), (c) (e); CEQA Guidelines § 15112(c)(1).) This First Amended

9 Petition is timely under the Brown Act because it is timely filed following the City's failure to

10 respond to Petitioners' demand to Respondents to cure, correct, cease, and desist, their Brown Act

11 violations, in accordance with Sections 54960, 54960.1, and 54960.2 of the Brown Act ("Cure
Letter").
12 34. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying
13 with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by serving prior notice of the
14 Petition in this action on Respondents. A true and correct copy of the written notice and proof of
15 service was attached to the original Petition on August 2, 2019, and is attached to this First
16 Amended Petition as Exhibit A.
17 35. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b), Petitioners have elected to
18 prepare the record of proceedings in this matter, and simultaneously filed their notice of intent to
19 prepare said record of proceedings with the original Petition on August 2, 2019. A true and correct
20 copy of Petitioners' Notice of Intent to Prepare Record is attached to this First Amended Petition as

21 Exhibit B.

22 36. Petitioners will provide notice of the First Amended Petition to the Attorney

23 General of the State of California, by serving a copy of this Fist Amended Petition along with a

24 notice of its filing, as required by Public Resources Cod section 21167.7 and California Code of

25 Civil Procedure section 388.

26 37. Petitioners have satisfied all statutory prerequisites for seeking judicial resolution of

27 the instant claims under the Brown Act by first making a demand to Respondents to cure, correct,

28 cease, and desist, their Brown Act violations by sending the Cure Letter, and by amending the

10 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petition to include Petitioners' cause of action under the Brown Act within fifteen (15) days and

2 sixty (60) days, respectively, of the City's failure to act in response to Petitioners' Cure Letter. Id.

3 A true and correct copy of the Cure Letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 38. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the

6 administrative process to the extent notice was provided and such participation was permitted, and

7 thus have fully exhausted their administrative remedies.

8 39. Petitioners satisfied the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21177 prior

9 to filing this action. Petitioners, other agencies, interested groups and individuals made oral and

10 written comments on the Draft and Final EIR and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in
this Petition.
11
40. The City has taken final action with respect to the subject Project approvals.
12 41. The City has a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to undertaking the
13 discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
14 42. Petitioners satisfied the requirements of Brown Act Sections 54960, 54960.1, and
15 54960.2 by submitting the Cure Letter to the City, and amending the Petition following the City's
16 failure to cure, correct, cease, and desist its violations of the Brown Act related to the City
17 Council's illegal "tabling" of the Referendum Petitions.
18 43. Petitioners possess no other remedy to challenge the City's failure to proceed in the

19 manner required by law and abuse of discretion of the claims raised herein other than by means of

20 this lawsuit.

21 IRREPARABLE HARM

22 44. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

23 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

24 Project approvals. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect,

25 in violation of state law. If Real Parties in Interest construct the Project pursuant to Respondents'

26 flawed approvals, Petitioners, the environment and the general public will be irreparably harmed.

27 No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm. A temporary restraining order and

28

. 11 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue restraining Respondents and Real Parties in

2 Interest from proceeding with the Project.

3 PUBLIC BENEFIT

4 45. Petitioners also file this action in the public interest. Petitioners seek to enforce

5 important public duties and rights under CEQA and the Brown Act. Other members of the public

6 who will be adversely affected by the Project's impacts would find it financially, practically, and/or

7 procedurally difficult to protect their rights in the complex administrative and judicial processes for

8 reviewing the Project and enforcing compliance with State and local laws. Thus, this action

9 involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest. Petitioners will confer a

10 substantial benefit to the citizens of Los Angeles County and the region in which the City of

11 Commerce is located, as well as on citizens of the State of California generally. Therefore,
Petitioners bring this action to vindicate their own legal rights, as well as to enforce important 12 public rights significantly affecting the public interest as a private attorney general under CCP
13 section 1021.5, Government Code section 54960.2, and all other applicable laws.
14 STATEMENT OF FACTS
15 46. The Project proposes to expand the existing Citadel shopping center in Commerce,
16 California by over a million square feet on a 44-acre Project site. The Project site is divided into
17 three areas, described as Areas 1, 2, and 3 in the EIR. The Project would add four new retail
18 buildings, five restaurants/restaurant areas, and thousands of new parking spaces. The Project also
19 includes three, multi-level commercial buildings, a combined warehouse / industrial building,
20 three hotels with a total a of 770 guest rooms (the 96-room Loft Hotel and 174-room Travelers

21 Hotel, both in Area 1, and an unnamed, 500-room hotel in Area 2), a "Movie / Entertainment

22 complex with a fast food court," a two-level, 23,000 sq./foot building for "Adventure Experiential

23 Retail," a public building on Area 3, and an on-site monorail to move employees and guests

24 throughout the site.

25 47. The Project includes three distinct geographic areas - Area 1 (8 acres), Area 2 (26

26 acres), and Area 3 (10 acres) - and requires demolition of existing buildings and substantial

27 construction activities to proceed. Commensurate with the Project's massive size and scope,

28

- 12 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- demolition, construction and operation will occur in three overlapping phases over six years, from

2 2020 to 2026.

3 48. The Project requires several discretionary approvals, including Development

4 Agreement No. 18-032 (Areas 1 and 2), Development Agreement No. 18-033 (Area 3), a Master

5 Sign Plan, up to four zone changes, certification of the FEIR, approval of an MMRP, and adoption

6 of a Statement of Overriding Considerations concerning the Project's significant and unavoidable

7 impacts to construction air quality, operational air quality, cumulative air quality, operational

8 greenhouse gas emissions, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic, among other

9 approvals.

10 Procedural Background

11 49. On or about October 22, 2018 the City released a Notice of Preparation ("NOP")

12 and Initial Study (SCH # 2016091024) for the Project.

13 50. On or about February 19, 2019, the City published an incomplete Draft EIR that was

14 missing appendices, contained numerous clerical and substantive errors, and appeared to be in

15 I administrative draft form.

51. 16 On March 14, 2019, during the public comment period on the Draft EIR, Petitioners

17 submitted written comments to the City informing the City of these defects, and urging the City to
withdraw the unfinished Draft EIR and reissue a finalized, accurate, and complete Draft EIR, with
18

19 a new public comment period.

52. On or about March 27, 2019, the City withdrew the incomplete Draft EIR and
20 issued a revised Draft EIR for public review and comment.
21 53. On May 10, 2019, prior to the close of the public comment period, Petitioners
22 submitted written comments on the revised Draft EIR ("DEIR Comments"), explaining that the
23 Draft EIR remained substantially deficient.
24 54. Petitioners' comments included a technical report from water resources consultant
25 Matt Hagemann, P.G, C.Hg. and air quality consultant Kaitlyn Heck of Soil Water Air Protection
26 Enterprises ("SWAPE"). SWAPE concluded that the Project would have significant environmental
27 and public health impacts that were not accurately disclosed or adequately mitigated in the Draft

28 EIR, including potentially significant impacts on local water supply, significant air pollutant
13 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P emissions of ROGs, NOx and GHGs, and significantly elevated cancer risk to local sensitive

2 receptors from exposure to toxic DPM emissions during Project construction and operation (*May

3 2019 SWAPE Report").

4 55. Petitioners' comments also included a technical report from acoustical consultant

5 Derek Watry of Wilson Ihrig ("Watry Report"), who concluded that the Draft EIR failed to

6 accurately establish existing noise levels in the vicinity of the Project site, lacked substantial

7 evidence to support its conclusions that the Project's increased noise levels would not exceed local

8 standards, and failed to disclose and mitigate the potentially significant noise impacts from

9 substantial increases in ambient noise levels during Project construction and operation.
56. Petitioners' comments also included a technical report from traffic and 10 transportation consultant Daniel Smith, P.E. of Smith Engineering ("Smith Report"). Mr. Smith 11 concluded that the Draft EIR failed to properly disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
12 admittedly significant impacts to transportation and circulation, and relied on vague, ineffective,
13 and unenforceable traffic mitigation measures which failed to reduce the Project's traffic impacts
14 to the greatest extent feasible.
15 57. Petitioners also commented on other Draft EIR deficiencies, including, but not
16 limited to the City's failure to provide access to all documents referenced or relied upon in the
17 Draft EIR, the failure to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and the failure to accurately
18 disclose and mitigate the Project's potentially significant impacts on population and housing, and
19 growth-inducing impacts.

20 58. Based on these and other comments, Petitioners recommended that the City revise

21 the Draft EIR to disclose and mitigate these significant impacts, and resolve the errors and

22 omissions, and recirculate the Draft EIR for public review and comments.

23 59. Nevertheless, on or about June 20, 2019, the City issued the FEIR, refusing to

24 prepare and circulate a revised Draft EIR and erroneously claiming that the Project's significant

25 and unavoidable impacts on air quality, traffic, and from GHG emissions were mitigated to the

26 fullest extent feasible. The FEIR's responses to comments failed to rectify the numerous errors and
deficiencies Petitioners had outlined in their comments. 27

28

14 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 60. On July 2, 2019, the City held a public hearing to consider the FEIR and related

2 approvals.

3 61. On July 2, 2019, prior to the close of the hearing, Petitioners submitted a written

4 comment letter identifying numerous deficiencies in the FEIR ("FEIR Comments"), and attaching
a supplemental technical report from SWAPE addressing ongoing deficiencies in the FEIR's

6 analysis and mitigation of air quality and GHG impacts (*July 2019 SWAPE Report"). Petitioners

7 also attended the hearing and submitted oral comments on these issues.

8 62. At the July 2, 2019 hearing, the City Council voted unanimously to certify the
FEIR,
9 approve the MMRP, and adopt the Statement of Overriding Considerations. The City

10 Council also conducted a first reading of Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732.

63.
11 The City issued a Notice of Determination on July 3, 2019 concerning the FEIR and
related CEQA approvals.
12 64. On or about July 16, 2019, the City conducted a second reading of Ordinances Nos.
13 731 and 732, and approved them.
14 65. The City issued a second Notice of Detcrmination on July 17, 2019 concerning the
15 Development Agreements and final CEQA approvals.
16 66. The City's decision to certify the FEIR and approve the Project in reliance on a
17 substantially deficient environmental document was an abuse of discretion, and the City's findings
18 supporting the Project approvals are not supported by substantial evidence.
19 67. As described below, the FEIR contained numerous errors and omissions and a
20 fundamentally deficient mitigation plan, which require the City's approvals to be set aside.

21 68. On August 5, 2019, the City received the two timely filed citizen-sponsored
22 Referendum Petitions seeking rescission of Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732.

23 69. On August 12, 2019, the City Clerk forwarded the Referendum Petitions to the

24 County Clerk to validate the signatures, as required by the Elections Code.

25 70. On August 26, 2019, the County Clerk deemed both Referendum Petitions

26 sufficient, pursuant to the Elections Code.

27 71. On September 17, 2019, the City Council opened an agendized hearing on the

28 Referendum Petitions. The Agenda for the September 17, 2019 meeting specified, as Item No. 15,

. 15 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

F that the City Council would consider three options for action on the Referendum Petitions, as

2 required by the State Elections Code, including "(1) Repealing Ordinance Nos. 731 and 732; or (2)

3 Calling a Special Election; or (3) Consolidating with the March 3, 2010 Election for Submitting

4 Measures to Voters." (See Minutes, Item 15.)

5 72. The City Council did not take any of these actions at the September 17, 2019

6 meeting. Instead, Mayor Pro Tem Altamirano moved, seconded by Councilmember Rebollo, to

7 take a non-agendized action to "table this item to a later date." (Id.)
73. 8 The City Council failed to specify a date, time, or place for a future hearing on this

9 agenda item, as required by the Brown Act. To date, the City has failed to take any legally

10 required action on the Referendum Petitions, including failing to "un-table" the Referendum
Petitions, and failing to continue the public hearing on the Referendum Petitions to a specified time 11 and place. As a result of these actions, the City Council violated the Brown Act and the public's
12 due process rights.
13 74. On October 17, 2019, Petitioners submitted the Cure Letter to the City Clerk, the
14 Mayor, and the City Council. The Cure Letter advised the City of the City Council's September
15 17, 2019 illegal action to "table" the Referendum Petitions without continuing and/or adjourning
16 the Council's hearing on the Referendum Petitions to a specified time and place, in violation of
17 Brown Act adjournment and continuance requirements, including, inter alia, sections 54953,
18 54955, 54955.1, and 54954.2 of the Act.

19 75. The City failed to respond to Petitioners' Cure Letter, and has failed to take any

20 action to cure, correct, cease, or desist the Brown Act violations alleged herein.

21 Hydrology, Water Quality and Utilities

22 76. The FEIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
23 potentially significant and interrelated impacts to hydrology, water quality, and utilities in violation

24 of both CEQA and the Water Code. The FEIR's responses to comments failed to correct these

25 errors and omissions.

26 77. The FEIR concluded that the Project will not require new or expanded water supply

27 facilities, will not result in insufficient water supplies beyond existing entitlements, and will not

28

16 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

deplete or interfere with groundwater supplies or recharge. In all of the above-cited areas, the FEIR

2 concluded that impacts would be less-than-significant, and that no mitigation was required.

3 78. The FEIR's conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence, and were

4 contradicted by substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that the Project is likely to have

5 potentially significant water impacts.

6 79. Water Supply: When an agency determines that a project is subject to CEQA, it

7 must comply with the provisions of California Water Code, sections 10910 to 10915, concerning

8 the adequacy of water supply necessary to support a project. The CEQA Guidelines, section 15155

9 contain additional, specific requirements for "water demand projects."

80.
10 The Project will develop over a million square feet of floor space, contain 700 hotel

11 rooms, and employ over 1,000 people. These facts demonstrate that the Project fulfilled multiple
criteria to constitute a "water demand" project under CEQA and the Water Code. Accordingly, the
12 City was required to prepare a WSA to identify available water supplies and provide substantial
13 evidence demonstrating the applicant's legal entitlement to the water required for the project under
14 all potential water supply scenarios (including normal, dry, and drought years). Further data and
15 analysis is also required if the project will use groundwater.
16 81. The FEIR initially stated that a WSA had been prepared for the Project, but failed to
17 attach the WSA to the Draft or Final EIR, failed to provide the WSA in response to public record
18 requests, failed to describe its contents, analysis, or conclusions, and failed to incorporate any

19 mitigation measures related to the Project's water supply impacts.

20 82. It appears the WSA never existed.

21 83. The City also failed to provide a "will-serve" letter from the local water purveyor,

22 Cal Water, or any other evidence demonstrating that the water purveyor had prior notice of the

23 Project or was ready, willing, and able to supply the water required to implement the Project.

24 84. Hydrology and Stormwater Management: The FEIR's discussion of hydrology and

25 stormwater management was similarly inadequate. As the May 2019 SWAPE Report detailed, the

26 FEIR's hydrology report covered only the 10-acre portion (Area 3) of the Project, and omitted any

27 discussion of hydrology and stormwater management for the remaining 34 acres of the Project site

28
17 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 (including Areas and 2). This omission resulted in a complete failure to disclose or mitigate the

2 Project's potentially significant hydrological impacts on three-quarters of the Project site.

3 85. The City's responses to comments on these issues was inadequate, misleading, and

4 nonresponsive, and violated CEQA including, but not limited to, the following ways:

5 a. In response to the City's failure to produce a WSA in the Draft EIR, the FEIR

6 stated that the Project was not a residential project. This response failed to comply

7 with the standards set forth in CEQA and the Water Code for a "water demand"

8 project, and failed to rectify the FEIR's omission of this mandatory study.

9 b. The FEIR also erroneously responded to Petitioners' comments regarding the

10 Project's water supply by discussing stormwater management. These statements

11 were nonresponsive to issue raised.

C.
12 In response to Petitioners' comments that the FEIR's hydrology report analyzed

13 only a 10-acre portion (Area 3) of the Project, the FEIR failed to prepare an updated
study to address the remaining 34 acres of the Project site. The FEIR simply
14 confirmed that the existing hydrology report covered only 10 acres of the 44-acre
15 site.
16 Air Quality
17 86. Petitioners' DEIR Comments and May 2019 SWAPE Report raised serious
18 concerns regarding the EIR's use of the Localized Significance Threshold ("LST') look-up table
19 for air modeling; underestimation of emissions and impacts; failure to conduct health risk
20 assessments ("HRA"); reliance on inadequate and ineffective mitigation measures; and failure to
21 consider and include all feasible measures to lessen or avoid this significant and unavoidable

22 impact. The FEIR failed to correct these errors and omissions. Absent this analysis, the FEIR

23 failed as an informational document and the City lacked substantial evidence to support its findings

24 in the Statement of Overriding Considerations.

25 87. Air Modeling: The FEIR relied on emissions calculated from the California

26 Emissions Estimator Model Version, CalEEMod.2016.3.2 ("CalEEMod"). SWAPE reviewed the

27 Project's CalEEMod output files and concluded that several of the values inputted into the model

28 were not consistent with the information disclosed in the FEIR. As a result, the FEIR's air

- 18 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

] modeling underestimated the impacts on air quality from construction and operation by

2 underestimating the number of truck haul trips needed during site demolition and failing to account

3 for emissions overlap during the Project's overlapping construction phases and operations.

4 88. Construction and Operational HRA: SWAPE explained in Petitioners' DEIR
Comments that the risk to human health from the Project's construction and operational DPM

6 emissions, a toxic air contaminant ("TAC"), was inadequately evaluated because the City failed to

7 prepare an HRA to analyze the risk to public health during Project construction and operation.

8 89. The FEIR erroneously failed to include this analysis, yet concluded that health risks

9 to nearby sensitive receptors (approximately 222 feet away from the Project) from exposure to

10 DPM during Project construction and operation would be less-than-significant without additional

11 mitigation measures. The FEIR reached this conclusion without conducting a quantitative
I construction or operational health risk analysis, and incorrectly attempted to justify this omission
12 by referring to inapplicable criteria air pollutant emissions.
13 90. The FEIR also erroneously concluded, with no quantitative analysis of DPM
14 emissions, that the FEIR's existing air quality mitigation measures (which do not address DPM)
15 will reduce the Project's toxic air emissions to the "fullest extent possible."
16 91. Potentially Significant Health Risks to the Public During Project Construction and
17 Operation: SWAPE performed an independent HRA using emissions factors derived from the

18 Project facts disclosed in the FEIR, including the correct parameters for truck trips during site

19 demolition, overlapping emissions during Project construction and operation, and emissions of
20 both criteria pollutants and DPM.

21 92. The SWAPE HRA revealed potentially significant health risks to sensitive receptors
22 during Project construction and operation, including an excess cancer risk to adults, children, and

23 infants living near the Project site of 11, 81, and 84 in one million, respectively, and an excess

24 cancer risk over the course of a residential lifetime (30 years) to the maximally exposed individual

25 1 As used herein, the term "Health Risk Assessment" refers to the discussion and analysis required
26 by CEQA of the human health effects of a Project associated with exposure to particular air

27 pollutants and the estimated amount of such pollutants the project will likely produce. See Sierra Club, 6 Cal.5th at 525; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd. of Port Comm'rs

28 (*Berkeley Jets") (2001) 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1371.

19 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

resident ("MEIR") of approximately 180 in one million. These health risks vastly exceed the

2 SCAQMD threshold of 10 in one million, resulting in significant health impacts that the FEIR

3 failed to disclose or mitigate.

93. In light of this substantial evidence of health risks to the public, the City was

5 required to recirculate the FEIR to include an HRA for public review and comment, and

6 incorporate feasibly mitigation to reduce health impacts to less than significant levels, but failed to

7 do so.

8 94. Mitigation Measures: The Project's air quality mitigation measures are vague,

9 unenforceable, and of uncertain efficacy, in violation of CEQA. Petitioners and their experts

10 analyzed the proposed mitigation measures and described the ways in which they are inadequate to

11 lessen or avoid impacts suggested, and suggested additional, feasible mitigation measures to reduce
or avoid construction and operational impacts.
12 95. For example, MM-5 stated the Project Applicant and future tenants will incentivize
13 employees to utilize alternative modes of transportation. However, the measure failed to describe
14 any specific programs that will achieve this goal, and lacked any performance standards. The
15 FEIR failed to revise MM-5 to correct these errors, despite specific measures proposed by SWAPE
16 which could have implemented MM-5's goal, including a commute trip reduction program, a
17 riding sharing program, price workplace parking, and employee parking "cash-out."
18 96. Additionally, MM-8 requires the Project site to provide kiosks and directories
19 depicting mass transit times and routes, the location of bicycle racks, and the location and timing of
20 Project shuttles. The FEIR then concludes that this measure will substantially lessen or avoid

21 traffic impacts. However, the FEIR lacks any evidence to support this conclusion.

22 97. Finally, MM-9 states that the Project will encourage local hire, through job fairs and

23 similar events, and concludes this will somehow address both air quality and "environmental

24 justice" impacts. While local hire is a laudable goal, this mitigation measure is vague and its is

25 efficacy in reducing air quality impacts is not supported by any evidence in the FEIR. Thus, the

26 FEIR lacks substantial evidence to support its conclusion that MM-9 will reduce vehicle miles

27 travelled ("VMT') or otherwise lessen or avoid any air quality impacts.

28

- 20 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

98. SWAPE proposed several mitigation measures to reduce or avoid both construction

2 and operational emissions, including measures recommended by government agencies with

3 substantial air quality expertise, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the

4 California Air Pollution Control Officer's Association ("CAPCOA"), regional air districts, and
measures that have been adopted in other jurisdictions to mitigate development impacts for specific

6 projects. The FEIR failed to incorporate any of these measures, and instead added 13 new

7 mitigation measures from the SCAQMD which did not address the deficiencies identified in
Petitioners' comments.
8
99.
9 Then FEIR's analysis and mitigation of air quality impacts was wholly inadequate

10 and failed to comply with CEQA. As a result, the City lacked substantial evidence to support its
Statement of Overriding Considerations and related findings that the Projects' air quality impacts
11 would be "significant and unavoidable."
12

13 GHG Emissions and Impacts to Global Climate Change

100. The FEIR concluded that the Project's operational and cumulative GHG emissions
14 will a be significant and unavoidable, and that a Statement of Overriding Considerations was
15 required to approve the Project.
16 101. However, the FEIR failed to accurately disclose the Project's GHG emissions in the
17 first place, then failed to mitigate the Project's significant GHG emissions to the fullest extent
18 feasible. The City's findings in support of its Statement of Overriding Considerations were
19 therefore not supported by substantial evidence.
20 102. First, SWAPE's review of the CalEEMod files revealed that many emissions
21 reduction measures claimed by the FEIR to reduce the Project's GHG emissions were already

22 included as input factors in the FEIR's CalEEMod output files. The FEIR thus incorrectly

23 incorporated mitigation measures as "design features," in violation of CEQA. (See generally Lotus

24 v. Department of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 655-656 [EIR invalidated when

25 project features incorrectly identified and analyzed as mitigation measures].) As a result, rather

26 than achieving GHG reductions beyond the GHG emissions disclosed in the FEIR, the FEIR's

27 "emission reduction measures" were incorrectly used as input parameters to support the FEIR's

28
- 21 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

GHG original emissions estimate of 28,949 MT CO2e/year. These measures therefore provided no

2 actual "mitigation" for the Project's GHG impacts.

3 103. Second, the FEIR failed to establish a legally supported GHG. significance

4 threshold. The FEIR stated that the Project's operational GHG emissions are expected to exceed a

5 10,000 MTCO2e/year threshold, but failed to disclose the source of this threshold. SWAPE

6 explained that that the threshold was taken from the Interim CEQA GHG Significance Threshold

7 for Stationary Sources, Rules, and Plans report released by SCAQMD on December 2008 (which

8 was never officially adopted). SWAPE further explained that use of this threshold was

9 inappropriate because it does not reflect the current California GHG reduction goals set forth in SB

10 32, and therefore does not reflect current scientific knowledge and regulatory schèmes, and applies

11 to industrial projects (not commercial/mixed use projects like the Project). The FEIR failed to
correct these errors and failed to adopt an applicable GHG threshold against which to measure the
12 Project's significant GHG impacts.
13 104. Third, the FEIR's determination that GHG impacts were less-than-significant
14 because the Project will not conflict with applicable plans, policies or regulations was not
15 supported by substantial evidence, for two reasons. First, the FEIR purported to analyze the
16 Project's consistency with thirty-nine actions outlined in the CARB's 2017 Climate Scoping Plan
17 ("Scoping Plan"), but contained only conclusory statements asserting compliance, and failed to
18 include the meaningful analysis required by CEQA's informational disclosure requirements for a
19 project-level EIR. Second, the City failed to analyze the Project's compatibility with other
20 applicable plans, including, for example, the Southern California Association of Government's

21 ("SCAG') Regional Transportation Plan / Sustainable Communities Strategy ("RTP/SCS") which

22 was developed pursuant to Senate Bill 375 and was adopted in 2016. Given that transportation

23 emissions are the largest source of emissions produced by the Project, the FEIR should have

24 included an analysis of the Project's compatibility with the SCAG RTP/SCS measures and

25 recommendations, which is designed to achieve the GHG emission-reduction targets set by CARB

26 for the transportation sector, consistent with statutory mandates.

27 105. Finally, the FEIR's GHG mitigation measures, GHG Mitigation Measure (a)-(f),

28 were vague, unenforceable and of uncertain efficacy, rendering them inadequate under CEQA.

- 22 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 106. For example, GHG Mitigation Measures (b) and (d) are dependent on the
2 Metropolitan Transportation Authority ("MTA") "Gold Line" extension to the Citadel Shopping

3 Center. However, as SWAPE explained, the Gold Line Extension has not been adopted by the

4 MTA, is not within the City's jurisdiction to implement, and is not otherwise part of the Project in
any way. Measures (b) and (d) are therefore unenforceable and of uncertain efficacy.

6 107. The GHG mitigation measures are also deficient because they focus on reducing
mobile-source GHG emissions but fail to address energy-related emissions, which account for 23%

8 of the Project's total operational emissions. As SWAPE explained, to effectively reduce GHG

9 emissions, the City was required to adopt mitigation measures that target these GHG sources in

10 addition to mobile sources. The FEIR failed to adopt any GHG mitigation measures for energy
related emissions, thus leaving 23% of the Project's significant GHG emissions totally unmitigated.
11
108. Because the FEIR lacked an adequate and through disclosure, analysis, and
12 mitigation of the Project's significant GHG impacts, the City lacked substantial evidence to support
13 its findings in the Statement of Overriding Considerations that the Project's significant GHG
14 emissions would be mitigated to the fullest extent fcasible, and that the Project's benefits outweigh
15 its significant and unavoidable operational and cumulative impacts to global climate change from
16 GHG emissions.

17 Noise

18 109. The FEIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
19 potentially significant direct, indirect, and cumulative noise impacts on sensitive receptors located

20 in the Project's vicinity during the Project's six-year overlapping construction/operation phases,

21 and during ongoing Project operation.

22 110. As Petitioners' noise expert explained, the area surrounding the Project is heavily

23 impacted by noise, which already approaches or exceeds the City's desirable or maximally

24 allowable noise levels, and the Project will substantially exacerbate ambient noise levels.

25 111. Yet, the FEIR concluded that the Project's potential to expose persons to noise.

26 levels in excess of local noise standards, expose people to or generate excessive ground-borne

27 noise, permanently increase ambient noise in the vicinity above existing levels, substantially

28 increase noise levels, and cumulatively noise impacts would be less-than-significant with no

- 23 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-

2 mitigation measures. The FEIR's conclusions were not supported by any substantial evidence, and

3 were contradicted by substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that the Project will have
potentially significant and unmitigated construction and operational noise impacts.

4 112. First, the FEIR failed to perform the required studies upon which to make accurate

5 and adequate noise determinations. The FEIR did not contain a Technical Noise Study. Instead,

6 the FEIR included "Noise Worksheets" contain raw noise data with no analysis or discussion.

7 113. As Mr. Watry explained, with a Project of this size (over 1 million square feet) and

8 duration (6 years in construction), a formal Technical Noise Study should have been prepared in

9 order to disclose the severity of the Project's noise impacts. The FEIR's responses to comments

10 added some updated noise data, but still failed to conduct a Technical Noise Study to analyze noise

11 impacts.

12 114. Furthermore, the FEIR contained numerous obviously erroneous statements which

13 misled the public and frustrated the informational purpose of the FEIR. For example:

a.
14 The data in the Noise Worksheets (Appendix B) was not accurately labelled or

15 defined. All of the screen shots are labeled, "Existing Noise Levels,'" although

16 some are "without Project" while others are "with Project.'"* As Mr. Watry

17 explained, because the Project has not been built, the data in the Noise Worksheets

18 cannot possibly reflect "existing" noise levels with the Project. The data in the FEIR
was therefore clearly erroneous.

19 b.

20 The FEIR cited to General Plan Policy that does not exist.

C.

21 The FEIR stated that noise levels of 84 and 89 dBA "do not exceed 70 dBA," which
is mathematically impossible and clearly erroneous.

22 115. The FEIR failed to establish the existing setting (baseline) for the Project's noise
23 analysis, as required by CEQA. The FEIR failed to include in the environmental setting the largest

24 roadway and dominant noise source - the Interstate 5 ("I-5") Freeway. This issue was clearly

25 demonstrated in Table 3-12, which purports to establish "Existing Roadway Noise Levels" but

26 entirely excluded the I-5 Freeway. By failing to include the most dominant local noise source in

27 the environmental setting, the FEIR utterly failed to establish the existing noise conditions in the

28 vicinity of the Project site, in violation of CEQA.

24 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

116. The FEIR's analysis of operational noise impacts was not supported by substantial

2 evidence because the FEIR failed to consider all existing noise-sensitive receptors, failed to

3 accurately disclose the distance of sensitive receptors from the Project site, failed to analyze

4 ambient noise impacts from the dominant noise source, traffic from I-5, failed to consider

5 applicable Caltrans standards for noise exposure, and incorrectly analyzed the Project's impacts to

6 ambient noise allows noise levels on a project-by-project basis, in an area that is already

7 significantly impaired by noise, provided that each increase is not individually perceptible. As Mr.
Watry explained, this approach was expressly rejected by the Federal Transit Administration

9 ("FTA"), and fails to provide substantial evidence addressing the Project's cumulative noise

10 impacts in relation to other projects.

11 117. Updated modelling provided in the Watry Report demonstrated that the Project will

12 result in significant noise impacts which require mitigation. The Watry Report and modelling
demonstrated that the Project will create significant noise impacts in the Rosewood area, the
13 nearest residential neighborhood. Specifically, the Watry Report concluded that the noise levels in
14 the Rosewood area due to increased traffic on Telcgraph Road alone would result in noise levels
15 that exceed the City noise ordinance's "Maximum Allowable" limit, creating dangerous levels of
16 disruptive noise for sensitive receptors. The FEIR failed to disclose this significant impact, and
17 failed to mitigate it.
18 118. The FEIR's analysis of construction-related impacts was similarly unsupported

19 because the FEIR failed to account for all sensitive receptors, and failed to quantify the type of

20 construction equipment that will be used and for what duration, even though the necessary input

21 factors were disclosed in the FEIR's air quality analysis.

22 119. The FEIR attempted to justify its lack of analysis by dismissing construction

23 impacts as merely "short-term" and "temporary." This "Catch-22" approach violated CEQA, and

24 was wholly nonresponsive to the question posed in the EIR Impact 3.8.4.4, which expressly

25 required an environmental review document to analyze "temporary or periodic increases in

26 ambient noise levels," i.e., construction noise.

27 120. Finally, the FEIR's cumulative noise impact analysis was wholly deficient. As Mr.

28 Watry explained, the FEIR made no attempt to analyze whether the cumulative noise levels

- 25 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

A

2 resulting from all the foreseeable projects presented in the FEIR's Cumulative Projects list will

3 result in cumulatively significant impacts. it Had it done so, Mr. Watry explained, the FEIR it would

4 have found that the Project's noise impacts will be cumulatively significant because the existing

5 noise levels already pose a significant impact on noise-sensitive receptors in the area. The FEIR
failed to comply with CEQA Guidelines sections 15130(a) and (a)(1)'s requirements that "an EIR

6 shall discuss cumulative impacts of a project when the project's incremental effect is cumulatively

7 considerable ... a cumulative impact consists of an impact which is created as a result of the

8 combination of the project evaluated in the EIR together with other projects causing related

9 impacts.",

10 121. The Watry Report includes several suggested mitigation measures to lessen or avoid

11 noise impacts. The FEIR's responses to comments were inadequate and conclusory, failed to

12 respond to the substantial evidence included in the Watry Report, and failed to adopt any noise

13 mitigation measures. The Project's potentially significant noise impacts therefore remain

14 undisclosed and unmitigated, in violation of CEQA.

15 Transportation and Circulation

122.
16 The FEIR failed to properly disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's impacts to

17 transportation and circulation (collectively, "transportation").

123. The FEIR acknowledged significant traffic impacts to at least ten signalized
18 intersections as a result of the Project's operations, but failed to incorporate adequate mitigation to
19 reduce these impacts to the fullest extent feasible before declaring them significant and
20 I unavoidable.

21

22 124. The FEIR presents a "mitigation program for the project" which includes three

23 major components: implementation of a Transportation Demand Management (*TDM") program

24 for the Project site to promote peak period trip reduction, Transportation Systems Management

25 improvements ("TSM") and "specific intersection improvements," including physical mitigations
and signal phasing enhancements. As Mr. Smith explained, the FEIR's conclusion that these

26

27 mitigation measures would effectively reduce significant transportation impacts was not supported
by substantial evidence.

28

• 26 •
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 125. First, Mr. Smith explained that the TDM program, which includes a list of potential

2 alternative transportation strategies designed to reduce peak hour vehicular traffic to and from the

3 Project site, incorrectly assumes a 10% vehicle trip reduction, which ignores the fact that travelers

4 to the specific uses proposed in the Project are generally non-responsive to TDM initiatives due to

5 the sporadic nature of their trips.

6 126.  Second, the TMS improvements proposed in the FEIR assume an unsupported

7 increase in the efficiency of traffic signals and resulting capacity increases of 7 to 20% along

8 coordinated corridors. Mr. Smith explained that the assumptions behind the effectiveness of the

9 TSM were not supported by the evidence because the FEIR failed to establish any direct link

10 between the TSM actions and increased capacity at the specific intersections where significant

11 traffic impacts have been identified. As a result, the FEIR's conclusion that intersection impacts

12 would be effectively mitigated by a generalized TSM program was not supported by substantial
evidence. The FEIR also failed to demonstrate that funding for the TSM improvements is currently
13 available, nor does the City require any commitment from the Applicant to provide any funding,
14 rending the TSM measure uncertain and potentially infeasible.
15 127. Finally, the FEIR's specific intersection improvements measure is infeasible. Under
16 the headline "Potential Physical Improvement Measures" the FEIR states that "[t]he following is a
17 description of the feasible proposed intersection mitigation measures," and follows that statement
18 with a list of proposed physical improvements in four intersections which will remain impacted,

19 even after the implementation of the TDM and TSM measures. Although the FEIR explicitly calls
20 these measure "feasible," the text of the measure itself states that, should the measure be

21 determined to be infeasible, impacts will remain unmitigated. On its face, this measure is therefore

22 admittedly ineffective.

23 128. The FEIR's responses to Petitioners' comments on these issues were inadequate

24 and conclusory, and failed entirely to respond to the Smith Report.

25 129. The FEIR failed to revise the TDM, TSM, or identify any source of funding for the

26 specific intersection improvements, leaving these mitigation measures wholly inadequate.

Population and Housing

2 130. The FEIR states that the Project will create jobs during the Project's six years of

3 construction, and 1,750 jobs at operation. Yet, the FEIR concludes that there will be "no impact"

4 regarding the Project's potential to result in substantial population growth and need for housing.

5 The FEIR lacked substantial evidence to support this conclusion.

6 131. The FEIR's baseline for population and housing in the City explained that the City

7 currently has a considerable shortfall of housing. The FEIR also stated that the City is currently

8 experiencing a period of population growth, as the average household size continues to grow. As a

9 result, the FEIR disclosed that there is already considerable pressure on the City's small and aging

10 housing stock.

132.
11 Recent data published on the City's website explained that the City's population is
12,960 people. The total number of dwelling units in the City is 3,384, causing a substantial
12 housing deficiency. The City's lack of housing, including workforce housing, was discussed in
13 detail and at length by the Applicant's own company representative at the City's approval hearing
14 on July 2, 2019. The Applicant stated the following:
15 a. The City has not built any new housing in 20 years.
16 b. The existing Citadel Shopping Center has lost employees over the last several years
17 because they could not find affordable housing in the City, and could not maintain
18 the sustained commutes necessary to work at the existing Citadel Shopping Center.
19 This project would expand the Shopping Center and will make this situation even

20 worse.

21 c. The Applicant has sought many times in the past to develop housing in the City in

22 order to address the critical shortage of affordable workforce housing, and the City

23 has repeatedly rejected these plans.

24 133. The Project will generate a significant amount of jobs which the FEIR claims will

25 be sources locally to the extent feasible, almost 40% of all jobs projected in the next 20 years in the

26 City. This is a significant contribution to local workforce which will also require local housing.

27

28

• 28 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 134. Despite these undisputed facts regarding the City's existing housing deficiency, the

2 FEIR inexplicably concluded that there will be "no impact" to population and housing. This

3 conclusion is not supported by any evidence in the Project record.

4 Growth-Inducing Impacts

5 135. The FEIR concluded that there will be no growth-inducing impacts from the Project,

6 which will create temporary construction jobs and 1,750 jobs at operation. In making this

7 conclusion, the FEIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's growth-

8 inducing impacts. The FEIR's conclusion was not supported by any substantial evidence.

9 136. CEQA mandates that an EIR analyze growth-inducing impacts. CEQA Guidelines,

10 section 15126.2(e) provides that an EIR's growth-inducing analysis must describe the "ways in

11 which the proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of

12 additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment…It must not be
assumed that growth in any area is necessarily beneficial, detrimental, or of little significance to the
13

14 environment." In determining if a project has growth-inducing impacts, the agency must assess
whether the project sets in motion forces that can lead to pressure for growth. (Napa Citizens for
15 Honest Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 368.)
16 137. The FEIR purported to "analyze" the Project's potential for indirect population
17 growth from job creation with a simple statement that the Project "will respond" to regional
18 demand for goods and services (entertainment and retail services), resulting in a complete lack of
19 disclosure of the Project's impacts.
20 138. This brief discussion in no way satisfies the requirements of CEQA Guidelines,
21 section 15126.2(e). The FEIR therefore lacked any analysis or substantial evidence to support its

22 conclusion that this impact would be less than significant.

23 Alternatives

24 139. One of the most substantive is aspects of CEQA is section 21002, which forbids
25 agencies from approving projects with significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can

26 substantially lcssen or avoid such impacts. An EIR must consider a "reasonable range" of

27 alternatives, "which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would

28 avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." (CEQA Guidelines, §

- 29 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

15126.6(a).) An inadequate alternatives analysis can invalidate an EIR. (Banning Ranch

2 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 937 ("the EIR did not meaningfully
3 address feasible alternatives or mitigation measures ... [and] the decision to forego discussion of
4 these topics cannot be considered reasonable."); id. at p. 942 (finding the lead agency abused its

5 discretion when it certified an inadequate EIR); Washoe Meadows Community v. Department of

6 Parks and Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277, 287.)

7 140. The FEIR failed to include a legally adequate alternatives analysis because the FEIR

8 failed to analyze any alternatives that would avoid or substantially lessen the Project's significant

9 impacts to air quality, GHG, transportation or other resource areas, and the FEIR's selection of

10 3 Alternative 3 as the "environmentally superior alternative" was not supported by substantial

11 evidence. The FEIR's response to comments regarding alternatives was misleading, and the FEIR
failed to provide additional alternatives analysis to resolve these deficiencies, as it claimed it did.
12 141. The FEIR acknowledged that the Project will result in significant and unavoidable
13 impacts to air quality, GHG, and transportation. Yet, every proposed alternative in the FEIR would
14 have the same (or grcatcr) impacts as the proposed Project with regard to these impact areas. A
15 "reasonable range" of alternatives must include an alternative, such as a "reduced project"
16 alternative, which would lessen or avoid these impacts. The FEIR's alternatives analysis failed to
17 meet this threshold requirement.
18 142. Furthermore, substantial expert evidence, comment letters, and testimony submitted
19 to the City demonstrate that there are likely to be significant impacts to other resource areas as
20 well, including noise and population and housing. The FEIR's "reasonable range" of alternatives

21 therefore should have included an alternative, such as a "reduced project" alternative, which would

22 lessen or avoid impacts to these areas. The FEIR failed to include such an alternative.

23 143. Additionally, the EIR's selection of Alternative 3 as the "environmentally superior

24 alternative" was not supported by any evidence. Alternative 3 is the "Institutional/Office Use

25 Alternative." This alternative would construct a 70,000 square-foot, four-level office building in

26 place of restaurants in Pad 5 of Area 3, as currently planned. The FEIR stated that this alternative

27 would have less impacts to aesthetics than the Project. This conclusion was not supported by

28 substantial evidence. For example, the discussion of Alternative 3's aesthetic impacts contained no

- 30 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 facts, evidence or analysis supporting the City's conclusion that substituting several restaurants on

2 Pad 5 in Area 3 with a 3 tall office building or public building would lessen aesthetic impacts.

3 144. Similarly, Alternative 2, the "Residential Development Alternative" would

4 consistent construct a six-story, 96-unit residential building. The FEIR was unclear whether these

5 would be rental or homeowner units, but noted that they would be "market-rate." The FEIR

6 summarily dismissed this alternative, stating that it would have similar impacts to the Project,

7 without analyzing whether Alternative 2 would lessen or avoid the Project's potentially significant

8 impacts to population and housing and growth-inducing impacts. Therefore, the FEIR lacked

9 substantial evidence to support its findings that Alternative 2 is undesirable or infeasible.
145.
10 The FEIR's responses to comments on Alternatives issue was misleading and non-
responsive. The FEIR stated that it contained additional analysis concerning alternatives, but did
11 not contain any additional analysis.
12
LEGAL BACKGROUND
13

14 CEQA

146.
15 CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

16 proposed actions in an EIR, except in very certain limited circumstances. (See, e.g., Public
Resources Code, § 21100.)
17 147. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9
18 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature
19 intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within
20 the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. Cal.
21 Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
22 148. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision
23 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (CEQA
24 Guidelines, 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the
25| environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR protects not

26 only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of

27 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 ("Citizens of Goleta Valley").) The EIR has been described

28 as "an environmental alarm bell whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials

• 31 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep

2 Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 (*Berkeley Jets").)

3 149. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

4 when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation

5 measures. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2), (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p.

6 564.) The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental

7 impacts of a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or

8 significantly reduced." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a)(2).)
150. If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may 9

10 approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant
effects on the environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the
11 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA
12 Guidelines, § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).)
13 151. A lead agency may not approve a project that will have a significant effect on the
14 environment unless it has it first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate or substantially
15 lessen all significant impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002-21002.1; CEQA Guidelines, §
16 15002(a)(2)-(3).) CEQA defines "feasible" as "capable of being accomplished in a successful
17 manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social,
18 and technological factors." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.1.) The lead agency may not defer the
19 formulation of mitigation measures until a future time, unless the EIR also specifies the specific
20 performance standards capable of mitigating the project's impacts to a less than significant level.

21 (Endangered Habitats League v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 793-94; Defend

22 the Bay v. City of Irvine (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1261, 1275.) A public agency may not rely on

23 mitigation measures of uncertain efficacy or feasibility. Mitigation measures must be fully

24 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally binding instruments. (CEQA

25 Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(2).) Mitigation measures that are vague or So undefined that it is

26 impossible to evaluate their effectiveness are legally inadequate.

27

28

- 32 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

152. An EIR must consider an "reasonable range" of alternatives, "which would feasibly

2 attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the

3 significant effects of the project." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a).)

4 153. The CEQA Guidelines, section 15088(a) sets the rule concerning the sufficiency of

5 an agency response to comments. The agency must provide "good-faith, reasoned analysis in

6 response [to comments]. Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not

7 suffice. The level of detail contained in the response" should "correspond to the level of detail

8 provided in the comment." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088(c).)

9 Standard of Review under CEQA

10 154. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the

11 reviewing court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project

12 proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no

13 judicial deference." (Berkeley Jets, 91 Cal. App. 4th 1344, 1355, emphasis added, citing Laurel

14 Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12.)

155. Claims of informational deficiency and procedural error in an EIR are reviewed de
15 novo under the independent review standard. (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th
16 502, 517.) Under this standard, whether an EIR's description of an environmental impact is
17 insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the magnitude of the impact is "not a substantial
18 evidence question." (Id. at p. 519.)
19 Water Supply Analysis under CEQA and Reliance on Documents and Studies
20 156. Under the CEQA Guidelines, section 15155(a)(1)(A)-(D) "A 'water-demand

assessment." If there is no public water system, the city must prepare the WSA. The

2 assessment must be included in the EIR. in

3 158. A CEQA document may not rely on hidden studies or missing information

4 because it "must contain facts and analysis, not just the bare conclusions of a public agency.

5 An agency's opinion concerning matters within its expertise is of obvious value, but the

6 public and decision-makers, for whom the EIR is prepared, should also have before them

7 the basis for that opinion SO as to enable them to make an independent, reasoned judgment."

9 "[TJhe substantiality of the evidence supporting such administrative

10 decisions is question of law" and "a court generally may consider only the administrative

11 record in determining whether quasi-legislative decision was supported by substantial
evidence within the meaning of Public Resources Code section 21168.5.
12 160. Information referenced or relied upon in an EIR must be made available for
13 public review. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15147.)
14 Recirculation of an EIR
15 161. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification is addressed in Public
16 Resources Code section 21092.1 and the CEQA Guidelines, section 15088.5. "When
17 significant new information is added to an environmental impact report after notice has
18 been given pursuant to Section 21092 but prior to certification, the public agency shall
19 give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104
20 'and 21153 before certifying the environmental impact report." (Pub. Resources Code, §

21 21092.1.) "Significant new information" includes:

22 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or

23 from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

24 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would

25 result…

26 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably

27 different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the

28 significant environmental impacts of the project...

5 (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

6 162. In Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of

7 California (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112 ("Laurel Heights I/"), the Supreme Court explained that

8 Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation prior to certification. The Court stated:
Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment.
9 (See State Bar Rep., supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that

10 demonstrates that an EIR commented upon by the public was SO fundamentally and basically inadequate or conclusory in nature that public

11 comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation under section
21092.1.

12 (Laurel Heights II, 6 Cal.4th 6 at p. 1130.)

13 WATER CODE

14 163. The State Water Code mandates that, at the time that a city determines to conduct

15 environmental review of a water demand project, defined as including a project with 500 or more

16 hotel or motel rooms or which will have more than 1,000 employees, the city shall identify any

17 water system whose service area includes the project site and request a water supply assessment,

18 among other requirements. (Water Code § 10910.)

19 164. Pursuant to the Water Code, if the city is not able to identify any public

20 water system that may supply water for the project, the city shall prepare the water supply

21 assessment. (Id.) The city must then include the water supply assessment and, if

22 applicable, any information on insufficiency of water supplies and plans to acquire

23 additional water supplies, in any environmental document prepared for the project pursuant
to CEQA. (Water Code § 10911(b).)
24 165. The city "shall determine, based on the entire record, whether projected
25 water supplies will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the project, in addition to existing
26 and planned future uses." (Water Code § 10911(c).) If the city determines that water

P supplies will not be sufficient, the city shall include that determination in its findings for the

2 project. (Id.)

3 BROWN ACT

• 4 166. The Brown Act provides that all meetings of the legislative body of a local

5 agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of

6 the legislative body of a local agency. Gov. Code §§ 54950, 54953.

7 167. The Brown Act imposes requirements on public agencies concerning

8 meeting notice, availability of documents distributed to legislative body members in

9 connection with matters for discussion at public meetings, the right of the public to take

10 part in public meetings, procedures for hearing adjournments and continuances, and other
matters related to meetings of public agency legislative bodies, including enforcement of 11 the Brown Act's public meeting requirements. See e.g. Gov. Code §§ 54952.2, 54953;
12 54954.2, 54955, 54955.1, 94956.
13 168. "It is the intent of the law that [agency] actions be taken openly and that
14 their deliberations be conducted openly." Gov. Code § 54950. "A major objective of the
15 Brown Act is to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government." Cohan v.
16 Thousand Oaks (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 547, 555.
17 169. If a legislative body runs out of time to complete its agenda or has a specific
18 reason to resume its meeting later, the Brown Act permits the body to adjourn any regular
19 or special meeting (or a previously adjourned regular or special meeting) "to a time and
20 place specified in the order of adjournment." Gov. Code § 54955 (emphasis added).

21 170. Under such circumstances, the legislative body may also continue a specific

22 agenda item to a subsequent meeting of the legislative body. Gov. Code § 54955.1.

23 Continuances must follow the same procedure as adjournments under Section 54955,

24 including the requirement to continue the hearing to a specific "time and place." Id. As the

25 League of California Cities has explained, "[t]he time and place when the hearing will
must be announced at the time of the continuance." See League of California 26 resume

27 Cities, California Municipal Law Handbook (2005), Section 2.2.10(C)(5) (continued

28 hearings).

171. Section 54960 of the Brown Act provides that "any interested person" may
2 commence an action for injunctive or declaratory relief to stop or prevent violations of the
Brown Act. Gov. Code § 54960; see McKee v. Orange Unified School Dist. (2003) 110

4 Cal. App. 4th 1310, 1316-1320, (standing requirements for "interested person" liberally

5 construed).

6 172. Violations can include any "action taken" in violation of Brown Act

7 requirements. Gov. Code § 54952.6.

8 173. Actions taken in violation of the Brown Act may be declared null and void

9 by the court. Gov. Code § 54960.1. §

174. The Brown Act is
10 "specific statute" regarding open meeting requirements.

11 See San Francisco Taxpayers Assn. v. Board of Supervisors (1992) 2 Cal.4th 571, 577;
Common Cause v. Bd. of Supervisors (1989) 49 Cal.3d 432, 443 (to the extent specific
12 statute is inconsistent with general statute potentially covering the same subject matter,
13 specific statute must be read as exception to the more general statute).
14 PARLIAMENTARY HEARING RULES
15 175. City councils may adopt their own rules for the conduct of council
16 proceedings. Gov. Code § 36813.
17 176. The City Council of the City of Commerce has adopted Robert's Rules of

18 Order ("Robert's Rules"). Commerce Muni. Code sec. 2.08.130 ("Robert's Rules of Order.

19 In all matters and things not otherwise provided for herein, the proceedings of the council

20 shall be governed by Robert's Rules of Order, 1915 revised edition.")

21 177. Robert's Rules include Rule 28, Lay on the Table. Rule 28 permits a city

22 council to move to "temporarily" table an item "in order to attend to more urgent business."

23 See Robert's Rules, Rule 28. Rule 28 contemplates un-tabling the item during the same

24 meeting, or at the council's next session. Id.

25 178. Rule 28 explains that a tabling motion is only properly used when it is is

26 necessary to suspend consideration of a main motion in order to deal with another matter

27 that has come up unexpectedly and which must be dealt with before the pending motion can

28 be properly addressed.

- 37 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

179. Rule 28 does not authorize indefinite tabling of an agendized item, as the

2 City Council improperly did here. Instead, Rule 28 cautions that "[t]hese are dangerous

3 privileges which are given to no other motion whose adoption would result in final action

4 on a main motion. There is a great temptation to make an improper use of them, and lay

5 questions on the table for the purpose of instantly suppressing them by a majority vote,

6 instead of using the previous question, the legitimate motion, to bring the assembly to an

7 immediate vote." See Robert's Rules, Rule 28 (emphasis added).

12 180. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs

13 in their entirety.

14 181. Respondents were at all times under a mandatory duty to comply with all
15 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents failed to perform that duty. This

16 failure is arbitrary and capricious.

17 182. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an FEIR that failed to comply with

18 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The FEIR failed to perform its function as an informational

19 it document that it is "meant to provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed

20 information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment" and "to
list ways
21 in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized." (Laurel Heights
Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391.) 22 183. CEQA requires the Court to establish whether an agency abused its discretion by
23 determining whether an agency failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and/or whether the
24 agency's decision is not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.)
25 Based on these legal standards, Respondents abused their discretion, exceeded their jurisdiction
26 and proceeded a in a manner contrary to law without the support of substantial evidence in the record
27 by committing the following violations.

16 Violations of CEQA - Inadequate Findings (CCP, § 1094.5 or in the alternative, CCP, § 1085; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5)
17 (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents and All Real Parties in Interest)

18 223. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs
19 in their entirety.
20 224. a CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
21 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
22 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
23 reached.

24 225. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
25 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited
26 to, the following:
27 a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that
28 adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects
. 43 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P on the environment, including but not limited to air quality, GHG impacts, and

2 transportation impacts;

3 b. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures

4 that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were

5 infeasible;

6 c. The determination that the Project, as approved, would have no significant effects

7 on the environment with regard to other resource areas including but not limited to,

8 hydrology and water quality, utilities, and noise;

o d. The determination that the Project complied with all applicable laws.

10 226. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

11 discretion by making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements

12 of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon, and by adopting a legally inadequate

13 Statement of Overriding Considerations that failed to mitigate all significant impacts to the greatest

14 extent feasible before concluding that any remaining significant environmental impacts are

15 acceptable due to overriding considerations.

227.
16 Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project
must be set aside.
17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
18 Violations of the Water Code

20 (By All Petitioners Against All Respondents and All Real Parties in Interest)

21 228. Petitioners hereby re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the

22 preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

23 229. The Water Code requires that, at the time that a city determines to conduct

24 environmental review of a water demand project, defined as including a project with 500 or

25 more hotel or motel rooms or which will have more than 1,000 employees, a city shall

26 identify any water system whose service area includes the project site and request a water

27 supply assessment, among other requirements. (Water Code § 10910.)

28 230. If the city is not able to identify any public water system that may supply

- 44 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 water for the project, the city shall prepare the water supply assessment. (Water Code §

2 10910.)

3 231. The city shall include the water supply assessment and, if applicable, any

4 information on insufficiency of water supplies and plans to acquire additional water

5 supplies, in any environmental document prepared for the project pursuant to CEQA.

6 (Water Code § 10911(b).)

7 232. The city "shall determine, based on the entire record, whether projected

8 water supplies will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the project, in addition to existing

9 and planned future uses." (Water Code § 10911(c).) If the city determines that water

10 supplies will not be sufficient, the city shall include that determination in its findings for the
project. (Id.)
11 233.
12 As city and the CEQA lead agency for the Project, Respondents were at all
times under a mandatory duty to comply with all requirements of the Water Code prior to
13 approving the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.
14 234. The Project creates over 700 hotel rooms and will employee 1,750
15 individuals at operation.
16 235. The FEIR lacked a water supply assessment.
17 236. In approving the Project and certifying the FEIR, Respondents proceeded in
18 excess of their jurisdiction, abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a manner

19 required by law, in violation of the Water Code by, inter alia, failing to include a water
20 supply assessment in the FEIR prepared for the Project.

21 237. In approving the Project and certifying the FEIR, Respondents proceeded in

22 excess of their jurisdiction, abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a manner

23 required by law, in violation of the Water Code by, inter alia, failing to determine whether

24 projected water supplies will be sufficient to satisfy the demands of the Project, including

25 its planned future uses.

26 238. Accordingly, Respondents must prepare a WSA for the Project, and

27 Respondents' certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project was contrary to law and
invalid and must be set aside.

15 or special meeting (or a previously adjourned regular or special meeting) "to a time and

16 place specified in the order of adjournment." Gov. Code § 54955 (emphasis added).
242. 17 Under such circumstances, the legislative body may also continue a specific

18 agenda item to a subsequent meeting of the legislative body. Gov. Code § 54955.1.

19 Continuances must follow the same procedure as adjournments under Section 54955,
including the requirement to continue the hearing to a specific time and place. Id. 20 243. Robert's Rules provide that city council may temporary table an agenda
21 item during its meeting, or to the next scheduled meeting, but do not authorize indefinite
22 tabling of an item to an uncertain time or date. See Robert's Rules, Rule 28.
23 244. The Brown Act is a "specific statute" regarding city council meeting
24 requirements. San Francisco Taxpayers Assn., 2 Cal.4th at 577; Common Cause; 49 Cal.3d
25 at 443. The Act's requirements supersede the application of Robert's Rules, or any other
26 hearing rules adopted by a local agency pursuant to Government Code section 36813. Id.
27 245. The City Council's September 17, 2019 action on Agenda Item No. 15, the

28 Referendum Petitions, to "table this item to a later date,' violated Brown Act sections

- 46 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

54953, 54955, and 54955.1 of the Act, and the public's due process rights, because City

2 Council failed to specify a date, time, or place for a future hearing on this agenda item, as
required by the Brown Act.

246. The City Council's action to "table" the Referendum Petitions to an
indefinite "later date" is not authorized by the Brown Act, Robert's Rules, or any other

6 applicable law. In tabling the Referendum Petitions, the City Council did not identify any

7 urgent matter on its agenda that took precedence over the Referendum Petitions, and has

8 failed to un-table the Referendum Petitions at any subsequent meeting.
247.
9 On October 17, 2019, Petitioners submitted the Cure Letter to the City

10 Clerk, the Mayor, and the City Council, advising them of the City Council's unlawful

11 actions to "table" the Referendum Petitions without continuing and/or adjourning the
Council's hearing on the Referendum Petitions to a specified time and place, and asking the
12 City Council to cure the violations.
13 248. Since September 17, 2019, the City has failed to "un-table" the Referendum
14 Petitions, failed to reschedule the public hearing or otherwise take any legally required
15 action on the Referendum Petitions, and has failed to respond to Petitioners' October 17,
16 2019 Cure Letter.

17 249. The City Council's motion to table, subsequent action to vote in favor of
18 tabling the Referendum Petitions, and Respondents' failure to respond to the Cure Letter,

19 constitute "actions taken" within the meaning of Government Code section 54952.6.

20 250. As a result of these actions, the City Council violated the Brown Act and the

21 public's due process rights for the City's to act on the Referendum Petitions. These

22 violations remain ongoing.

23 251. Petitioners have satisfied all statutory prerequisites for seeking judicial

24 resolution of the instant claims under the Brown Act by first making a demand to

25 Respondents to cure, correct, cease, and desist, their Brown Act violations by sending the

26 Cure Letter, and by amending the Petition to include Petitioners' cause of action under the

27 Brown Act within fifteen (15) days and sixty (60) days, respectively, of the City's failure to

28 act in response to Petitioners' Cure Letter.

- 47 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 252. Respondents' failure to respond to the Cure Letter, and failure to cure,

2 correct, cease, or desist from its Brown Act violations has left Petitioners with no other

3 recourse than to file the instant action.

4 253. Accordingly, the Court should issue declaratory and injunctive relief
requiring Respondents' to correct their violations of the Brown Act related to the City

6 Council's September 17, 2019 actions on the Referendum Petitions.

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

8 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief and judgment as follows:
1.
9 That the Court place a stay on Respondents' decisions certifying the FEIR and

10 approving the Project pending trial.

2.
11 That the Court issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent
injunction barring Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and all other persons working on their
12 behalf, from proceeding with any activity that may result in any physical change in the
13 environment on the Project site until the Respondents take all necessary steps to bring their actions
14 in compliance with CEQA, the Water Code, and the Brown Act, and until the writ is discharged.
15 3. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate and declaratory relief directing
16 Respondents to:
17 a) Vacate and set aside the certification and approval of the FEIR and other
18 Project approvals for the Project;

19 b) Refrain from approving any further permits or entitlements for the Project

20 20 until Respondents have prepared and certified a legally adequate EIR and
21 complied with all other applicable requirements of CEQA, as directed by
22 this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9;
23 c) Prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate EIR and

24 otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve

25 the Project; and

26 d) Comply with all other applicable requirements of CEQA, as directed by this

27 Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9.

28 e) Comply with the Water Code.

- 48 -
4686-034acp VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

f) Comply with the Brown Act, including issuing a declaration that

2 Respondents violated the Brown Act by taking an illegal action to "table"

3 the Referendum Petitioners to an indefinite, unspecified time and date, and

4 an injunction requiring Respondents to immediately un-table the

5 Referendum Petitions, conduct a public hearing on the Referendum

6 Petitioners, and take all action(s) required by the Elections Code with regard

7 to the Referendum Petitioners, as originally noticed for the Council's

8 September 17, 2019 meeting.
4.
9 That Petitioners be awarded costs of this proceeding.
5.
10 That Petitioners be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees for this action pursuant to

11 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, Gov. Code section 54960.5, and any other applicable
provisions of law or equity.
12 6. That Petitioners be awarded such other and further equitable or legal relief as the
13 Court deems just and proper.

County Superior Court against the City challenging the City's unlawful approval of Citadel Holdings Group, LLC and Wash-Tel Commerce, LLC's (collectively, "Applicant") Citadel Outlets Expansion & 10-Acre Development Project, State Clearinghouse Number 2016091024 ("Project"), including the City's certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program prepared for the Project, adoption of CEQA findings, and approval of related Project entitlements, based on violations of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").1 The City Council certified the FEIR and approved the Project on July 2, 2019 and July 16, 2019, and filed Notices of Determination pursuant to CEQA on July 3, 2019 and July 17, 2019, respectively.

The petition being filed will seek the following relief:

1. For a stay of the City's decisions certifying the FEIR and approving the Project pending trial.

2. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction restraining the City and the Project Applicant from taking any action to carry out the Project relying in whole or in part upon the FEIR pending trial.

3. For a peremptory writ of mandate, preliminary and permanent injunction and declaratory relief directing:

a. The City to vacate and set aside its resolutions certifying the FEIR and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program for the Project, making CEQA findings, and approving the Project.

b. The City to suspend all activity under the certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment until the City has
taken all actions that may be necessary to bring the certification
and Project approval into compliance with CEQA.

C. The City to prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate EIR/FEIR and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project.

Our clients may be willing to forego this lawsuit if the City promptly contacts us to set forth its plan for rescinding its certification of the FEIR and approvals for the Project, or to propose alternative, potential terms of settlement acceptable to our clients. Otherwise, we will promptly serve the petition as soon as it is completed and filed.

Re: City Council Action on Referendum Petitions Against City of
Commerce Ordinance Nos. 731 and 732 (Citadel Project) on
September 17, 2019: Demand for Cure Pursuant to Gov't Code
§§ 54960 and 54960.1

Dear Mayor Soria, Honorable Members of the City Council, Ms. Shumway, Ms.
Verdin, Mr. Tapia:

This is a demand for cure pursuant to California Government Code sections 54960 and 54960.1 (the "Brown Act") concerning the action taken by the City Council on September 17, 2019 regarding Agenda Item No. 15, Referendum
Petitions Submitted Against Commerce Ordinance Nos. 731 and No. 732 -
4686-028j

C'o printed on recycled paper

Consideration of Options (1) Repealing Ordinance Nos. 731 and 732; or (2) Calling a Special Election; or (3) Consolidating with the March 3, 2010 Election for
Submitting Measures to Voters ("Referendum Action") related to the Citadel
Shopping Outlet Center and development of a ten acre parcel at the corner of Washington Boulevard and Telegraph Road ("Project"). This demand is made on behalf of Coalition for Responsible Equitable Economic Development Los Angeles, Carlos Mendivil, James Moreno, And David Pimenov (collectively, "CREED LA").
The Brown Act provides that all meetings of the legislative body of a local
agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency. Various provisions of the Brown Act impose requirements on public agencies concerning meeting notice, availability
of documents distributed to legislative body members in connection with matters for discussion at public meetings, the right of the public to take part in public meetings, procedures for hearing adjournments and continuances, and other matters related to meetings of public agency legislative bodies, including enforcement of the Brown
Act's public meeting requirements.

Section 54960 of the Brown Act provides that "any interested person" may commence an action to stop or prevent violations of the Brown Act. Section 54960.1 of the Brown Act provides that "any interested person" may commence an action for
a judicial determination that an action by a legislative body taken in violation of the Brown Act is null and void.

The City Council violated the Brown Act and acted in a manner contrary to
law on September 17, 2019 by taking a non-agendized action to "table" the Referendum Action and by failing to continue and/or adjourn its hearing on the Referendum Action to a specified time and place.1
On July 2, 2019, the City Council approved the first reading of two
ordinances approving two development agreements concerning the expansion of the
Citadel Shopping Outlet Center: Ordinance No. 731, approving Development
Agreement No. 18-032 between the City of Commerce and Citadel Holdings Group,
LLC concerning the expansion of the Citadel Shopping Outlet Center; and
Ordinance No. 732, approving Development Agreement No. 18-033 between the City of Commerce and Citadel Holding Group, LLC and Wash-Tel Commerce, LLC

4686-028j Gov. Code §§ 54955, 54955.1, and 54954.2.

for the development of a ten acre parcel at the Corner of Washington Boulevard and Telegraph Road (collectively, "Ordinances"). On July 16, 2019, the City Council approved the second reading and adoptions of Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732. On August 5, 2019, the City received two timely filed citizen-sponsored referendum petitions (collectively "Referendum Petitions") seeking rescission of Ordinances Nos. 731 and 732. The City Clerk forwarded the Referendum Petitions to the County
Clerk on Monday, August 12, 2019 to validate the signatures. On August 26, 2019,
the County Clerk deemed both Referendum Petitions sufficient.

On September 17, 2019, the City Council conducted a hearing on the Referendum Action. The Agenda for the Referendum Action specified that the City Council would consider three options for action on the Referendum Petitions, as required by the State Elections Code,2 including:
1. Repealing the Ordinances; 2. Adopting a Resolution Calling and Giving Notice of the holding of Special Municipal Election for submission to voters for Referendums; or
3. Adopt Resolution calling and giving notice of the Consolidated General Municipal Election to be held on March 3, 2020 for submission to voters for
Referendums.3

The City Council did not take any of these three actions at the September 17, 2019 hearing. Instead, the City Council took a non-agendized action to "table this item to a later date."4 Neither the Agenda nor the Staff Report for the hearing
identifed "tabling" as a proposed action, nor is such action authorized by the Brown Act. The Council also failed to specify a date, time, or place for a future hearing on

this agenda item, as required by the Brown Act.5 As a result of these actions, the City Council violated the Brown Act, and failed to provide for an open meeting in accordance with Section 54953 of the Act.

On behalf of CREED LA, we respectfully demand that the City Council of the
City of Commerce to revisit and cure the violations of the Brown Act that occurred
at the September 17, 2019 City Council meeting. In so doing, we also respectfully demand that the City Council carefully consider and revisit the Referendum Action, and take one of the three specified actions identified in the Agenda, and required by the Elections Code, to resolve the Referendum Petitions. We respectfully demand,
in accordance with Sections 54960 and 54960.1 of the Brown Act, that the City
Council cure the Brown Act defects that occurred in connection with the September
17, 2019 hearing on the Ordinances, including the City Council's non-agendized decision to take an action that was not identified in the Agenda, and the failure to continue the hearing to a specified date, time, and place.
Within 30 days of the date of this demand, please cure and correct the challenged action, and inform us in writing of the City Council's decision to cure and
correct the challenged action. We hope that the City Council will use the opportunity afforded by this letter to correct the public proceedings related to the Referendum Action. If the City Council does not take action to cure and correct the
challenged action within 30 days of the date of this letter, that inaction will be deemed a decision to not cure or correct the challenged action. In that case, CREED LA reserves all its rights concerning the City Council's action at its September 17,
2019 meeting.
Please inform us of any and all meetings at which this request will be considered.

Sincerely,
