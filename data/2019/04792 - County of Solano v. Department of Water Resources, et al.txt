24 INTRODUCTION
25 1. This action challenges a decision by the
26 Department of Water Resources ("DWR") to approve or carry out the Lookout Slough Restoration Project ("Project") without first
27

28 evaluating, in the manner required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Pub. Res. Code, § 21000, et seq.), the effects that the Project is likely to have on the environment.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 2. DWR's decision to approve or carry out the Project is reflected in two contracts or

2 funding agreements entered into by DWR with the entities named as real parties in interest in this

3 Petition. The first contract, executed by DWR on or about October 2, 2018, is with Ecosystem

4 Investment Partners III, LLC, EIP III Credit Co., LLC, and EIP California LLC (collectively

5 "EIP"). Pursuant to this first contract, EIP will design and construct the habitat restoration

6 portion of the Project. The second contract or funding agreement, executed by DWR on or about
7 January 31, 2019, is with Reclamation District 2098 ("RD 2098"). Pursuant to this second

8 contract, RD 2098 will design and construct the flood risk reduction portion of the Project.

9 3. Prior to entering into either contract, DWR did not conduct environmental review

10 of the Project or either portion of it in the manner required by the California Environmental

11 Quality Act. Instead, under the first contract, EIP will prepare and deliver "final CEQA/NEPA

12 compliance documentation" to DWR after completing 60% design of its habitat restoration

13 portion of the project and prior to construction. Under the second contract, RD 2098 is to is

14 consider EIP's environmental compliance documentation after completing 60% design of its

15 flood risk reduction portion of the Project, and to supplement EIP's environmental documentation

16 as RD 2098 deems necessary.

17 4. Together, the two contracts provide for the construction of the habitat restoration

18 and flood risk reduction portions of the Project, at the location identified and in the manner

19 specified in the contracts, regardless of the magnitude of any environmental impacts that might be

20 disclosed through EIP's environmental "compliance documentation" or RD 2098 supplemental

21 documentation. Neither contract provides that commencement of construction is contingent upon

22 DWR's review and consideration of the information contained in the environmental "compliance

23 documentation" yet to be prepared.

24 5. "CEQA requires that an agency determine whether a project may have a

25 significant environmental impact, and thus whether an EIR is required, before it approves that

26 project.' A fundamental purpose of an EIR is to provide decision makers with information

27 they can use in deciding whether to approve a proposed project, not to inform them of the

28 environmental effects of projects that they have already approved. If postapproval environmental

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing more than post hoc rationalizations to

2 support action already taken." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of

3 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394, quoting No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Ca.3d

4 78, 79.)

5 PARTIES
D A 6. Petitioner County of Solano ("County"), a political subdivision of the State of
California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated territory of

8 Solano County and is a Responsible Agency for the Project. The fundamental development

9 policy reflected in the County's General Plan is one of city-centered development, with the fertile

10 portions of the unincorporated area to be maintained in productive, commercial agricultural use to

11 the greatest extent practicable. While habitat areas, both naturally existing and artificially

12 created, are often compatible with commercial agricultural uses, they sometimes are not. One

13 purpose of CEQA is to evaluate whether new land uses and newly-created habitat areas will

14 cause, directly or indirectly, impacts to existing agricultural resources.

15 7. Respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") is an agency within the

16 executive branch of state government for the State of California and is the Lead Agency for the

17 Project. Among its many functions and responsibilities, DWR works with many federal, State,

18 and local partners to protect and restore the critically important Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in

19 ways that also ensures long-term water supply reliability for the state.

20 8. County does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
21 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents Doe through Doe 10, inclusive, and therefore

22 sues these Respondents under fictitious names. County alleges, upon information and belief, that

23 each fictionally named Respondent is responsible in some manner for committing the acts upon

24 which this action is based. County will amend this Petition to show their true names and
capacities if and when they have been ascertained. County alleges, upon information and belief, 25

26 that each Doe Respondent is the agent and/or employee of each other Doe Respondent, and each

27 performed acts on which this action is based within the course or scope of such Doe Respondent's

28 agency and/or employment.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 9. Real Party in Interest Ecosystem Investment Partners III, LLC, (aka Ecosystem

2 Investment Partners, LP) is a Delaware limited liability corporation, registered with the Secretary

3 of State to do business in California, and engaged in the business of real estate fund management.

4 10. Real Party in Interest EIP III Credit Co, LLC, is a Delaware limited liability

5 corporation, registered with the Secretary of State to do business in California, and engaged in the

6 business of real estate.

7 11. Real Party in Interest EIP California LLC is a Delaware limited liability

8 corporation, registered with the Secretary of State to do business in California, and engaged in the

9 business of real estate investment.

10 12. Real Party in Interest Reclamation District 2098 ("RD 2098") is a reclamation

11 district formed and operating pursuant to Division 15 of the Water Code section 50000 et seq.

12 The territory of RD 2098 is located in southeastern Solano County, within the area known as the

13 Cache Slough Complex and adjacent to Yolo County, and is comprised of approximately 6,100

14 acres.

15 13. County does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

16 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Doe 11 through Doe 20, inclusive,

17 and therefore sues these Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. County alleges, upon

18 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some

19 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based. County will amend this Petition

20 to show their true names and capacities if and when they have been ascertained. County alleges,

21 upon information and belief, that each Doe Real Party in Interest is the agent and/or employee of

22 each other Doe Real Party in Interest, and each performed acts on which this action is based

23 within the course or scope of such Doe Real Party in Interest's agency and/or employment.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 14. This court has jurisdiction of the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code

26 of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9.

27 County alleges that DWR has prejudicially abused its discretion with respect to the Project in that
28 DWR has not proceeded in the manner required by law.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 15.

2 Although the Project is proposed for construction within Solano County and the

3 environmental effects of the Project will be felt within Solano, venue is proper in this Court
because DWR's headquarters is in Sacramento County.

16.

5 County has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

6 21167.5 by serving written notice of County's intent to commence this action on DWR on March

7 27, 2019. A copy of this notice and proof of service on DWR is provided as Exhibit A in the
Exhibits to Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed separately with this Petition.

17.

0 County will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

10 21167.7 by furnishing a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General.

18.

11 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and

12 has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. DWR did not

13 conduct a public hearing, or otherwise provide an opportunity for members of the public to raise

14 objections orally or in writing, prior to taking its action to approve or carry out the Project.

19.

15 County has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

16 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require DWR to set aside its approvals

17 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, DWR's approvals of the Project will remain in
effect in violation of law.

18 STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 20.

20 Section 15378, subdivision (a), of the CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,
§ 15000, et seq.), defines the term "project" as follows:
21

22 "Project" means the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

23 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

24 change in the environment, and that is any of the following:

25 (1) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to

26 public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land,

27 improvements to existing public structures, enactment and amendment of zoning

28 ordinances, and the adoption and amendment of local General Plans or elements
thereof pursuant to Government Code Sections 65100-65700.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.. .

AW N (2) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported in whole or in part through
public agency contacts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one
or more public agencies.
(3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license,

a N 21. certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.
The reference to "whole of an action" in subdivision (a) of section 15378 is
explained more fully in subdivision (c) of that section, as follows:
8

9 The term "project" refers to the activity which is being approved and which may be

10 subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The term

11 22. "project" does not mean each separate governmental approval.

12 Subdivision (b) of section 15378 lists various types of governmental activities that

13 do not come within that section's definition of "project,"
(b)(4): including the following at subdivision

14

15 The creation of government funding mechanisms or other government fiscal activities

16 which do not involve any commitment to any specific project which may result in a

17 potentially significant physical impact on the environment.
23.

18 In addition, section 15262 of the CEQA Guidelines provides that certain types of

19 feasibility and planning studies are not, by themselves, "projects" subject to CEQA, as follows:

20 A project involving only feasibility or planning studies for
which the possible future actions

21 agency, board, or commission has not approved, adopted, or funded does

22 not require the preparation of an EIR or Negative Declaration but does require
consideration of environmental factors. This section does not
23 apply to the adoption of

24 a plan that will have a legally binding effect on later activities.
24.

25 Under the current Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp) for the State Water

26 Project (SWP) and Central Valley Project (CVP), DWR has an obligation to restore or create

27 8,000 acres of tidal habitat within the Delta and Suisun Marsh to benefit Delta Smelt. DWR also

28 has an obligation under the 2009 Salmonid BiOp with US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 provide 17,000 to 20,000 acres of seasonal floodplain rearing habitat for juvenile salmonids in the
lower Sacramento River Basin.

3 25.

4 Between 2016 and 2018, DWR issued one or more Request for Proposals (RFP)

5 inviting private companies, non-profit groups, and individuals to submit proposals to create

6 wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. For example, in RFP Number 10127576, issued

on

7 or about December 20, 2016, DWR stated that entities responding to that RFP were to provide

8 a proposal that was based on demonstrated control of property desirable for habitat restoration,

Q and to agree to provide DWR a minimum number of creditable habitat acres through development

10 of a restoration project. Upon acceptance of a proposal, DWR would enter into a Habitat

11 Restoration Project Agreement with the selected contractor(s), which would obligate the

12 contractor(s) to perform three sets of tasks. In the first set of tasks, the contractor(s) would

13 complete the restoration design, project permitting (to the extent required by agencies other than

14 DWR), and environmental documentation; in the second set of tasks, the contractor(s) would

15 transfer the property in fee title to DWR, clear of any conflicting encumbrances; finally, the

16 contractor(s) would complete the habitat restoration on the property with verification of restored

17 acres. RFP Number 10127576 does not indicate that DWR's approval of the contractor(s) project

18 design or that any decision by DWR for the contractor(s) to proceed with construction of habitat

19 restoration would in any way be contingent on the information regarding potential environmental

20 impacts that might be disclosed in the contractor(s) environmental documentation.

26.

21 Based on information and belief, County alleges that Ecosystem Investment

22 Partners, LLC, EIP III Credit Co., LLC, and/or EIP California LLC submitted : proposal to DWR
to design and construct tidal habit on the Lookout Slough Property.

23 27.

24 The Lookout Slough a Property is a site consisting of approximately 3,400 acres

25 located in the Cache Slough Complex in southeastern Solano County, adjacent to Liberty Island
and at the southern end of the Yolo Bypass.

26 28.

27 Construction of tidal habitat on the Lookout Slough Property would include

28 excavating tidal channels throughout the property to facilitate full tidal hydrology within the
property, then breaching the existing Shag Slough levee along the eastern side of the property and

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 the Cache Slough levee along the southern and southwestern side of the property. After these

3 levees were breached, water from adjacent sloughs would flow onto and across the constructed

4 and naturally-existing contours of the property, as dictated by the tides. DWR anticipates that

5 natural revegetation of the property would occur, thereby creating approximately 3,200 acres of

6 creditable habitat. This construction of tidal habitat or other related types of habitat on the
Lookout Slough Property will be referred to as the Habitat Restoration Work.

7 29.

8 To keep tidally-influenced waters from flowing beyond the Lookout Slough

9 Property and onto adjacent farmlands to the north and northwest, a new setback levee would be

10 constructed along the northern and northwestern sides of the property; this levee would become

11 part of the State-Federal levee system and would replace the existing levee system along Shag

12 Slough and Cache Slough. These levee construction activities will be referred to as the Levee

Setback Work.

13 30.

14 The Habitat Restoration Work and the Levee Setback Work are inter-related and

15 inter-dependent parts of a single multi-benefit project commonly referred to as the Lookout

16 Slough Restoration Project ("Project"). A brief description of the location and features of the

17 Project is provided as Exhibit B in the Exhibits to Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed separately

with this Petition.

18 31.

19 On or about March 21, 2019, DWR issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP"; see

20 Pub. Res. Code, § 21080.4, subd. (a), and CEQA Guidelines, § 15082), providing notice that

21 DWR would prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. A copy of the

22 NOP is provided as Exhibit C in the Exhibits to Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed separately

with this Petition.

23 32.

24 Section 15352 of the CEQA Guidelines defines the term "approval" as follows:

25 (a) "Approval" means the decision by a public agency which commits the agency to a

26 definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any

27 person. The exact date of approval of any project is a matter determined by each

28 public agency according to its rules, regulations, and ordinances. Legislative action in
regard to a project often constitutes approval.

7 When a public agency enters into a contract that includes a CEQA compliance
condition, the California Supreme Court has provided the following guidance on the issue of

9 whether the agency's approval of such a contract constitutes approval of a project: "A CEQA

10 compliance condition can be a legitimate ingredient in a preliminary public-private agreement for

11 exploration of a proposed project, but if the agreement, viewed in light of all the surrounding

12 circumstances, commits the public agency as a practical matter to the a project, the simple insertion

13 of a CEQA compliance condition will not save the agreement from being considered an approval
requiring prior environmental review." (Save
116, 132.)

project." (Save Tara, supra, 45 Cal.4th at p. 135.)

LLC (aka Ecosystem Investment Partners III, LP), EIP III Credit Co., LLC, and EIP California

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

I LLC (collectively, "EIP") for the design and construction of, or significant elements of, the
2 Habitat Restoration Work. Based on information and belief, County alleges that the construction
3 of breaches in the existing Shag Slough and Cache Slough levees are not part of this contract. A
t copy of this contract is provided as Exhibit D in the Exhibits to Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed
separately with this Petition, and will be referred to in this Petition as the EIP Contract.
6 38. Construction and/or operation of the overall Lookout Slough Restoration Project
7 may have a significant effect on the environment.

8 39. Construction and/or operation of the Habitat Restoration Work may have a
9 significant effect on the environment.

10 40. DWR did not certify an environmental impact report or adopt : negative
11 declaration or mitigated negative declaration for the overall Lookout Slough Restoration Project
12 prior to executing the EIP Contract.
13 41. DWR did not certify an environmental impact report or adopt a negative
14 declaration or mitigated negative declaration for the Habitat Restoration Work prior to executing
15 the EIP Contract.

16 42. DWR did not file a notice of determination or notice of exemption for the overall
17 Lookout Slough Project following its execution of the EIP Contract.
18 43. DWR did not file a notice of determination or notice of exemption for the Habitat
19 Restoration Work following its execution of the EIP Contract
20 44. Exhibit A to the EIP Contract is a Scope of Work that identifies eight tasks to be
21 performed sequentially by EIP; several of these tasks include subtasks. Task 2 requires EIP to
22 prepare a restoration plan for the Lookout Slough Property, including the project description and
23 30% design drawings. Task 3 requires EIP to "complete all necessary California Environmental
Quality Act/ National Environmental Policy Act (CEQA/NEPA) draft documents for review 24

25 and approval by DWR" and to prepare 60% design drawings. Task 4 requires EIP to deliver
26 "final CEQA/NEPA compliance documentation" to DWR, together with "a plan for meeting
27 mitigation requirements." Task 6 requires EIP to transfer fee title 6 of the Lookout Slough Property
28 to DWR, clear of any encumbrances that would conflict with habitat restoration. Task 7 requires

10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

:

EIP to "implement project construction," which includes activities such as "equipment

2 mobilization, habitat restoration work, construction contract management and administration,

3 environmental compliance and construction monitoring, and land management." Task 8 requires

4 EIP to complete project construction and deliver as-built plans to DWR.

5 45. Although the tasks identified in the Scope of Work are to be performed

6 sequentially, the EIP Contract does not provide that EIP is required to obtain a new or separate

7 approval from DWR following delivery of the "final CEQA/NEPA compliance documentation"

8 described in Task 4 and before commencing the construction activities described in Tasks 7 and

9 8.

10 46. The EIP Contract does not provide that the 60% design drawings, to be prepared

11 by EIP as part of Task 3, will be subject to review and revision by DWR following delivery to

12 DWR of "final CEQA/NEPA compliance documentation" in Task 4. More generally, to the

13 extent the "final CEQA/NEPA compliance documentation" may identify potentially significant
14 environmental impacts of the Lookout Slough Restoration Project or the Habitat Restoration

15 Work and recommend ways to reduce those impacts to a less-than-significant level, the EIP

16 Contract does not provide any opportunity or mechanism for DWR to incorporate those

17 mitigation measures into, or impose them on, the Project.

18 47. The EIP Contract does not provide any meaningful opportunity or mechanism for

19 DWR to consider project alternatives that might be evaluated as part of the "final CEQA/NEPA

20 compliance documentation" for the overall Lookout Slough Restoration Project or the Habitat

21 Restoration Work, including consideration of a "no project" option.

22 48. As described in Exhibit B to the EIP Contract, DWR is to make payments to EIP

23 promptly following EIP's completion of each of the eight tasks listed in the Scope of Work.

24 49. DWR has given its political assistance to the Project.

25 50. DWR has given its financial assistance to the Project.

4 prepare 100% civil design plans and specifications "which will be used for construction." Task 4

5 requires RD 2098 to complete "all activities required to deliver flood benefits," including

6 building the new setback levee and degrading the existing Shag Slough and Cache Slough levees.

7 60. Although the tasks identified in the Scope of Work are to be performed

8 sequentially, the RD 2098 Contract does not provide that RD 2098 is required to obtain a new and

9 separate approval from DWR following DWR's receipt and consideration of any "environmental

10 compliance" documents to be prepared under either the EIP Contract or this RD 2098 Contract

11 and before commencing the construction activities described in Task 4.

12 61. The RD 2098 Contract does not provide that the 60% or 100% civil design plans

13 and specifications, to be prepared by RD 2098 as part of Tasks 2 and 3, will be subject to review .

11 Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.) "This standard is consistent with the principle that
12 *environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into many
13 little ones-each with a minimal impact on the environment-which cumulatively may have
14 disastrous consequences.™ (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 396, quoting Bozung v. Local
15 Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.)
16 69. Whether two or more agency activities constitute a single project for purposes of
17 CEQA, such that an agency would be improperly reviewing the potential environmental impacts
18 of the "whole of the action" in piecemeal fashion if it evaluates the impacts of each activity
19 separately, is a question of law. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012)
20 211 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1224, citing Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City
21 of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 435.)

22 70. DWR acknowledges that by superimposing the Levee Setback Work onto the
23 Habitat Restoration Work and developing both construction projects in tandem, the combination
24 a is a single multi-benefit project "that allows for efficiencies and cost savings to California's
25 taxpayers that would not otherwise be possible if [the Levee Setback Work] was completed
26 independently."

27 71. On or about September 26, 2018, through its Resolution No. 2018-09-02, RD 2098
28 authorized the President of its Board of Trustees to sign a funding agreement with DWR for the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 Levee Setback Work. A copy of this resolution is attached to the RD 2098 Contract. DWR
executed the EIP Contract approximately one week later.

72. Based on information and belief, County alleges that DWR would not have entered
into the EIP Contract, at least in its present form, if RD 2098 had not expressed its willingness to
sign a contract for the Levee Setback Work.

73.

7 Based on information and belief, County alleges that DWR would not have entered

8 into the RD 2098 Contract, at least in its present form, if DWR had not already entered into the

EIP Contract.

o 74.

10 Based on information and belief, County alleges that the Habitat Restoration Work

11 and the Levee Setback Work, at least as presently described by DWR, could not be implemented

12 independently of each other and are therefore a single "project" as that term is defined in CEQA
and the CEQA Guidelines. .|

13 75.

14 Task 3 of the RD 2098 Contract states that while EIP "js responsible for obtaining

15 the necessary regulatory permits and environmental compliance for the habitat restoration project,

16 RD 2098 will be responsible for supplemental work necessary to amend, or to obtain additional

17 permits and/or environmental compliance/mitigation requirements related to flood risk reduction,

18 if required. For example, evaluation alternatives to satisfy requirements of CEQA and the

19 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) may require analysis of the difference between the

20 [Habitat Restoration Work] and this [Levee Setback Work] that provides flood risk reduction

improvements."

21 76.

22 The "environmental compliance documentation" to be prepared by EIP pursuant to

23 Tasks 3 and 4 of the EIP Contract will not evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the

24 Levee Setback Work. Instead, DWR has shifted responsibility onto RD 2098 to assess whether .'¡

25 the "environmental compliance documentation" prepared by EIP is adequate for the overall

26 Project, and to prepare supplemental "environmental compliance documentation" to the extent

necessary,

27 77.

28 DWR has improperly piecemealed the environmental review to be conducted for
the overall Lookout Slough Restoration Project by requiring additional environmental review of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

1 the RD 2098's portion of the Project to be conducted subsequent to the completion of the
2 environmental review to be done for EIP's portion of the Project.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
5 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondent to vacate
6 and set aside its approvals of Agreement Number 4600012583 (EIP Contract) and Agreement
7 Number 460001212776 (RD 2098 Contract), and any subsequent approvals to carry out the
8 Project;

9 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondent to comply
10 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by Public Resources
11 Code section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by law.
12 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
13 injunctions restraining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest, and their respective agents,
14 servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking
15 any action to implement the Project pending full compliance with CEQA and the CEQA
16 Guidelines.

17 4. For costs of suit;
18 5. For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
19 other provisions of law; and

20 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Noticing Related
Writ Cases and
Possible Consolidation:

Step Action
When filing a Notice of Related Case pursuant to rule 3.300(d) of the California Rules of Court regarding two or more writ cases assigned to different judges in this court, file the Notice in each writ case.

When filing a Response to a Notice of Related Case pursuant to rule 3.300(g) of the California Rules of Court, file the Response in each writ case.
3, Serve the Notice or Response on each party to each case.

Note that the court proceeds with respect to related writ cases under rule
3.300(h)(1) of the California Rules of Court (CRC) as follows:
The judges assigned to civil writ cases listed in a Notice Of Related Case filed and served pursuant to CRC 3.300(d) identify which one of them is assigned to
the earliest filed case, information which should be included in the Notice of
Related Case pursuant to CRC 3.300(c)(2). That judge proceeds under CRC 3.300(h)(1)(A) to determine whether the cases are related within the meaning of
CRC 3.300(a).
If the judge assigned to the earliest filed case determines that the cases are
related, the judge orders the cases related and assigned to his or her department.
That order is filed in each of the related cases and served on the parties to each
of the related cases pursuant to CRC 3.300(i). In addition, an Amended Notice of Case Assignment, reassigning to the judge each of the related cases not previously assigned to him or her, is filed and served upon all parties to each reassigned case. Courtesy copies of the order and Amended Notice(s) of Case Assignment are sent to the judges previously assigned to any of the related
cases.

If the judge assigned to the earliest filed case determines that the cases are not related within the meaning of CRC 3.300(a), the judge issues a minute order stating and briefly explaining the determination. This minute order is filed in each of the cases listed in the Notice of Related Case and is served on all parties
to the listed cases pursuant to CRC 3.300(i).
In response to an order determining that the cases are not related, any party to
any of the cases listed in the Notice of Related Case may file a motion pursuant to CRC 3.300(h)(1)(D) to have the cases related. The motion must be filed with the Presiding judge or a judge designated by the Presiding Judge.

Applying for a
Temporary Stay in
Administrative Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1094.5 (g) or (h)):
Step Action

Prepare an ex parte application for an order temporarily staying operation of the administrative decision under review in the proceeding. Identify whether the temporary stay order is requested pursuant to subdivision (g) or (h) of the CCP § 1094.5. Specify "Ex Parte" in the title of the application.
Pursuant to rules 3.1201 and 3.1202 of the California Rules of Court and this Guide
to the Procedures for Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs, an ex parte application for a stay order includes the following supporting documents and papers: Endorsed copy of the petition. Points and authorities, declarations and other supporting documents, including relevant portions of the administrative record if available.
Proposed order to show cause why the administrative decision under review in the
proceeding should not be temporarily stayed pending a hearing on the merits of the
writ petition (OSC). This proposed OSC should contain: • blank spaces for the date and time of the hearing on the OSC, an order for service of the OSC and any supporting papers not previously served with a blank space for a date of service prior to the hearing on the OSC, and
an order staying the administrative decision pending the hearing on the OSC.
Proposed stay order. Notice of hearing on the petition with blank spaces for date and time (unless the stay is being requested in conjunction with an application for an alternative writ).
Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3.1204.
In addition, CCP § 1094.5 (g) and (h) require that proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent accompany an application for a stay. See a
subdivisions (g) and (h) for required manner of service.

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an ex parte hearing date and time and to determine whether the assigned writ department requires any of the documents or papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing. Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

Notify respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the hearing on the ex parte stay application in accordance with rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include the details of this notification in the declaration regarding notice prepared pursuant to rule 3.1204.
Note: The Court prefers at least 48 'hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, a will accept less notice.

If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in
Step 1 to be filed before the ex parte hearing, file and serve the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing. (See rule 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court.)

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs
Revised 1.1.2014 Page 4 of 11

Superior Court of California, County of Sacramento
Civil

At the ex parte hearing, depending on the nature of the factual and legal issues
raised by the stay application and the practical exigencies of the matter, the court will either rule on the stay application immediately or issue the proposed OSC with
or without a temporary stay order pending the hearing on the OSC at a specified
date and time.
If the court grants a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court
will sign and file the proposed stay order and set a date and time for a hearing on the
merits of the petition. The court clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, in the alternative writ.
If the Court denies a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court, upon petitioner's request, will set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ,
in the alternative writ.

Applying for a
Temporary Stay in Traditional Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1085):
Step Action

1. Follow the statutory and regulatory provisions for obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO), an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued (OSC),
and/or a preliminary injunction, set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure (including but not limited to CCP §§ 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529) and rule 3.1150 of the California Rules of Court. These provisions constitute rules of practice for temporary stays in mandate proceedings brought under CCP § 1085 in the absence of temporary stay provisions specific to such mandate proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

2. When following the statutory and regulatory procedures for obtaining TRO and/or an OSC, comply with the ex parte procedures outlined above in "Applying for a Temporary Stay in Administrative Mandate Proceedings" and in rule 3.1201 et seq. of the California Rules of Court.

If no TRO or OSC is sought, notice a motion for a preliminary injunction following the procedures set forth below in "Bringing Motions Before the Hearing on the Merits

Note that a temporary stay in proceedings on a petition for a writ of prohibition may
be obtained by following the procedures set forth below under "Setting a Hearing
on the Merits of a Petition, (2) Securing issuance of alternative writ." An alternative
writ of prohibition, unlike an alternative writ of mandate, stays specified action by the respondent until further order of the court. (See CCP §§ 1087, 1104.)

Bringing Motions before
The Hearing on the
Merits of a Writ Petition:
Motions on the pleadings and other pretrial matters brought in civil actions including motions for change of venue, demurrers, motions to strike, motions to
dismiss, discovery motions, and motions for summary judgment -- may generally be brought in writ proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)
Motions addressing the merits of the petition in whole or in part should be
calendared for a hearing at the same time as the hearing on the merits. Motions
directed at resolving issues preliminary to and distinct from the issues related to the
merits of the petition, such as untimeliness of the petition under an applicable statute of limitations, should be calendared before the hearing on the merits of a writ petition. The court, in the exercise of its discretion to control the order of litigation before it, may advance the hearing on a motion to a date before the hearing on the merits or may postpone a motion to the hearing on the merits when such advancement or postponement will promote the efficient conduct and disposition of
the proceeding.
Because a writ petition is usually disposed of by a hearing on the merits which is
limited to oral argument on written briefs and documentary evidence, the usefulness of a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication in economically disposing of an unmeritorious case or claim is substantially reduced in writ
proceedings. Thus, before bringing a motion for summary judgment or summary
adjudication, counsel should carefully evaluate whether the purpose of the motion
can be achieved more directly and completely through a hearing on the merits of the
petition.
Step Action

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve a date and time available on the department's calendar for a hearing on the motion. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Some assigned writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

Notice the motion in accordance with the civil law and motion procedures in CCP § 1005
and in compliance with the California Rules of Court, including rules 3.1110 through 3.1113, 3.1115, 3.1116, 3.1300, and 3.1320 through 3.1324. Comply with the page limits for memoranda set forth in rule 3.1113.
If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the notice of motion must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

Setting a Hearing
on the Merits of a
Writ Petition:
If a hearing on the merits of a writ petition has not been set in conjunction with an
ex parte hearing on an application for a temporary stay, it may be set either by (1) noticing a hearing on the petition or (2) securing issuance of an alternative
writ. Note: The court prefers, as more efficient and economical for both itself
and the parties, the procedure of noticing a hearing on the petition.
The date set for a hearing on the merits of a writ petition, whether by notice or alternative writ, should allow the parties to file briefs in accordance with the following schedule established in Local Rule 2.26(D):
Opening brief: Due 45 days before the hearing
Opposition brief: Due 25 days before the hearing
Reply brief: Due 15 days before the hearing
Note that Local Rule 2.26(D) limits the length of opening and opposition briefs to 30 pages and reply briefs to 20 pages instead of the page limits in rule 3.1113 of the
California Rules of Court.
The date of the hearing on the merits may be expedited and the briefing schedule shortened upon an application setting forth circumstances warranting an expedited hearing. The application for an expedited hearing may be made orally at hearing for a temporary stay or alternative writ or on an ex parte basis in accordance with rules 3.1201 through 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court.
(1) Noticing a hearing on a writ petition
Step Action

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for a hearing on the writ petition. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Writ petitions are normally heard on Fridays.
2. Prepare and file a notice of hearing on the writ petition specifying the reserved hearing date and time. If the ssigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the
notice of hearing must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

3. File the notice of hearing either at the civil front counter in Room 102 or by mail
addressed to the Civil Division• Room 102, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.

4. Serve a copy of the notice of hearing on respondent(s) and real party(ies) no later than the time allowed for filing and serving the opening brief. If not previously served, the writ
petition, the Notice of Assignment, and this Guide should also be served no later than the time for filing and serving the opening brief.

Civil

(2) Securing issuance of an alternative writ
The alternative writ is an order to show cause that calendars a writ petition for a
hearing on the merits. With the exception of an alternative writ of prohibition issued pursuant to CCP § 1104, the alternative writ does not, in and of itself, accomplish a stay or afford any affirmative relief.
Note that, with the alternative writ method, two writs may be issued in the
proceeding. First, the alternative writ is issued to set a hearing on the merits of the
petition. Second, a peremptory writ may issue after the hearing on the merits.
Step Action

Prepare an ex parte application for an alternative writ. Specify "Ex Parte" in the title of
the application.
As provided in rules 3.1201 and 3.1202 of the California Rules of Court and this Guide, an ex parte application for an alternative writ includes the following supporting documents and papers:
Endorsed copy of the petition.
Points and authorities and any other supporting documents.
Proposed order directing issuance of alternative writ.
Proposed alternative writ with blank spaces for the date and time of a hearing on the petition. (Include a signature block for the clerk, not the judge.) Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3,1204.

2. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for an ex parte hearing on the application for an alternative writ and to determine whether the department
requires the papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing.
Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays. Also note that, absent a showing of good cause or waiver by the respondent(s) and real party(ies), some departments will not issue an alternative writ unless the writ petition and application for the alternative writ have been served on respondent(s) and real party(ies) at least five days before the ex parte hearing. (See CCP § 1088, requiring service of copy of petition in conjunction with application for alternative writ; CCP § 1107, providing a five-day period for respondent(s) and real party(ies) to respond to a writ petition after receiving service of the petition.)
Notify the respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the date and time of the ex parte hearing on the alternative writ pursuant to rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include the details of this notification in the declaration regarding notice pursuant to rule
3.1204.

Note: The Court prefers at least 48 hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, will
accept less notice.

If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in Step to be filed before the hearing, file and serve on all parties the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing.

If the court grants the application for an alternative writ, the court signs and files the proposed order directing issuance of the alternative writ that sets the petition for a hearing on the merits. The clerk then issues the proposed alternative writ with the
date and time of the hearing and provides it to the petitioner after the petitioner has
paid the issuance fee in Room 102. The writ must be served upon respondent(s)
and real party(ies) in the same manner as a summons in a civil action unless the
court expressly orders otherwise. (See CCP §§ 1073, 1096.) Once served, the writ
must be filed with a proof of service.

Applying for a
Continuance:
After a hearing has been set on a motion or on the merits of a petition, it may be continued only upon approval of the Court. If the continuance requires a change in the briefing schedule, such change must also be approved.
Step Action

Present a telephone request for a continuance of the hearing to the clerk in the assigned
writ department, including the reason(s) for the continuance and any necessary changes
in the briefing schedule. Present the request as far in advance of the scheduled hearing
date as possible.
Upon the court's approval, the clerk will provide available dates on the court's calendar to which the hearing may be continued.

2. Promptly confer with all counsel to agree upon a mutually convenient hearing date from among the dates provided by the clerk and any necessary changes in the briefing schedule.
If counsel cannot agree to a continuance, a new hearing date and/or changes in the briefing schedule, the party seeking the continuance may apply for a continuance by
noticed motion.

Promptly present to the court a stipulation signed by all parties, including the reason for the continuance, the agreed upon hearing date and any agreed upon changes in the briefing schedule, with a proposed order.
Pay the filing fee for the stipulation pursuant to subdivision (c) of Government Code section 70617 in Room 102.

When the stipulation and order has been signed and filed by the Court, serve the stipulation and order on all parties.

Note that these procedures do not apply when a motion is dropped from the calendar by the moving party. In such circumstances, the moving party must telephonically notify the court and all other parties as far as possible in advance of the date on which the motion is to be heard and send a confirming letter to the court
with copies to the other parties.

The North Delta Habitat Arc concept has been championed by UC Davis as a core area with the Bypasa best potential to benefit native fishes through an interconnected series of mostly tidal habitats (Fig 2). The Cache - Lindsey Slough - Liberty Island Complex features prominently in this recovery strategy, as it makes up a significant portion of the North Delta and one of the few remaining places Delta smelt have been found. A small portion of the Delta smelt population is believed to remain in the Cache Slough Complex year-round'.
The Lookout Slough Restoration Project is located in the heart of the North Delta Habitat Arc
in a critical location connecting Liberty Island and the Yolo Bypass with the Cache-Lindsey Slough
network of waterways.

INTRODUCTION

The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) is planning to prepare a Draft Environmental Impact Report (Draft EIR) for the Lookout Slough Restoration Project. The Draft EIR will meet the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). DWR has issued this Notice of Preparation (NOP) to provide responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and other interested parties with information describing the proposal and its environmental effects.
The Proposed Project described below would restore within the Proposed Project Site approximately 3,000 acres of tidal marsh that will help satisfy the Department's obligations under Reasonable and Prudent Alternative (RPA) 4 of the 2008 United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp) and consistent with RPA 1.6.1 of the 2009 National Marine Fisheries Service Salmonid BiOp for the coordinated operations of the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project. The Proposed Project would create habitat that is beneficial to wildlife including Delta Smelt, Giant Garter Snake (GGS), and other fish and wildlife species, and widen a portion of the Yolo Bypass to increase flood storage and conveyance, increase the resiliency of levees, and reduce flood risk.
When completed, the Proposed Project would be the largest freshwater tidal habitat creation project in California, and would provide habitat for Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Chinook Salmon, Green Sturgeon, Steelhead, GGS, and other species. The Proposed Project is also designed to meet regional flood protection objectives in a manner consistent with the 2017 DWR Sacramento Basin-wide Feasibility Study (BWFS).
The Proposed Project involves constructing a new setback levee along Duck Slough and Liberty Island Road. The existing levee at Shag Slough will be breached and degraded to provide connectivity between Lookout Slough and Shag Slough. The existing Cache Slough levee will be strengthened to accommodate the Proposed Project and prevent increased water surface elevations upstream of the Cache Slough complex. Grading, placement of fill material, and revegetation will be used to restore and enhance upland, tidal, subtidal, and floodplain habitat.

PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
The Lookout Slough Habitat Restoration Project is designed to achieve the following goals and objectives.
Goal 1: Create and maintain a diverse landscape of intertidal and associated subtidal habitat that supports habitat elements for native species and improved food productivity within the Project area.

Objectives:

a. Improve primary and secondary productivity and food availability for Delta Smelt and other native fishes within the Project and the immediate tidal sloughs surrounding the Project Site.
b. Improve rearing habitat for Delta Smelt, salmonids, and other native fish.

C. Promote suitable spawning habitat with appropriate water velocities and depths accessible for Delta Smelt within the Project and the immediate tidal sloughs surrounding the Project Site.

d. Increase on-site diversity of foraging, breeding, and refuge habitat conditions for aquatic and terrestrial wetland-dependent species.

e To the greatest extent practical, preserve existing topographic variability to allow for habitat succession and resilience against future climate change.
f. To the greatest extent practical, avoid promoting conditions adverse to Project biological objectives, such as those that would favor establishment or spread of invasive exotic species,
Goal 2: Design and implement a Project that also supports viable populations of special status aquatic and terrestrial species.
Objectives:

a. Minimize temporary effects to special status aquatic and terrestrial species when implementing Project activities (e.g., earth disturbance and vegetation management activities).
b. Include habitat elements for special status aquatic and terrestrial species.
Goal 3: Provide additional flood storage and conveyance within the Yolo Bypass to reduce the chance of catastrophic flooding and protect existing nearby infrastructure (e.g., agriculture, power, and human habitation).
Objectives:

a. Protect existing nearby infrastructure surrounding the Project and avoid any adverse flood- related impacts in the region.
b. Provide flood management benefits by reducing flood stages in the lower part of the Yolo Bypass.

PROJECT LOCATION
As shown in Figure 1, the Project Site is a 15-parcel, 3,395-acre area located in unincorporated Solano County, California, near the border with Yolo County. The Project Site is located approximately 20 miles southwest of Sacramento and 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. The Project Site is located in the Liberty Island United States Geologic Service (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle, and neighbors several large protected areas including Liberty Island Ecological Reserve, Liberty Island Conservation Bank, and Little Hastings Island Conservation Bank. It is
bordered on the west by Duck Slough and on the east by Shag Slough. The southwestern boundary of the Project Site is formed by Cache Slough and its tributary, Hass Slough, and the northern boundary is Liberty Island Road. The Project Site and its immedlate vicinity are depicted in Figure 2.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Proposed Project would restore tidal hydrology and promote habitat conditions suitable for special-status species such as Delta and Longfin Smelt, Chinook Salmon, Steelhead, and Giant
Garter Snake in the Proposed Project Site while protecting nearby infrastructure through the following actions. Each action is discussed below in greater detail: 1) construct a new setback levee along Duck Slough; 2) breach the Cache Slough Levee; 3) breach the Shag Slough Levee (also called the Yolo Bypass West .evee); 4) breach the Vogel Island levees; 5) protect, relocate, and replace infrastructure; and 6) restore approximately 3,400 acres of native habitat, including tidal and subtidal marsh through grading, fill placement, and natural revegetation. Figure 3 provides an overview of the Proposed Project.
1) Construct Setback Levee along Duck Slough
A new setback levee would be constructed on the northwestern and northern sides of the
Proposed Project Site, which would become part of the State-Federal levee system and replace the protection currently offered to Reclamation District 2098 by the existing levee system along Shag Slough and Cache Slough. The existing levees have become degraded overtime. The Setback Levee would protect properties to the north and west of the Proposed Project Site from inundation upon degradation and breaching of the Shag and Cache/Hass levees. The levee would begin near the confluence of Hass Slough and Duck Slough, run parallel to Duck Slough on the northwestern side of the Proposed Project; and upon reaching the northwestern corner of the Proposed Project Site, turn east and run parallel to the south side of Liberty Island Road- eventually tying into the Shag Slough levee system in the northeast corner of the Proposed Project
Site. The segment of levee running parallel to Duck Slough would be offset to provide a refugia
habitat buffer on the land side for Giant Garter Snake (Thamnophis gigas).
2) Breach of Cache Slough Levee
A single 100-foot wide breach opening would be created at the east (left bank) levee of Cache Slough at the southern terminus of the existing Lookout Slough alignment. This opening would re-establish hydraulic connectivity to Cache Slough, creating opportunity for tidal exchange and habitat connectivity. The dimensions of the Cache Slough levee breach opening have been constrained to avoid raising water levels significantly in Cache Slough and Hass Slough during high flow conditions. Rock slope protection would be placed at the opening to prevent degradation.

Lookout Slough Restoration Project Notice of Preparation

3) Modification of Shag Slough Levee
The west (right bank) levee of Shag Slough and the Yolo Bypass would be breached at eight locations to provide hydraulic connectivity to Shag Slough and restore normal tidal exchange to
the majority of the site and habitat connectivity to Shag Slough. The remainder of the existing levee would be degraded to the match the elevation of the ten year storm event. In large flood events, the remnant levee segments would divert additional flood overflows from the Yolo Bypass onto the Proposed Project Site providing flood storage and convenience benefits.
4) Breach of Vogel Island Levees
The uncertified agricultural levees that form the perimeter of Vogel Island would be breached at three locations to provide hydraulic connectivity to Cache Slough and restore normal tidal
exchange to the island and habitat connectivity to Cache Slough. In large flood events, the remnant levee segments would continue to be allowed to overtop as they do today.
5) Excavation Work
Tidal channels would be excavated throughout the Liberty Farms, Bowlsbey Ranch and Vogel properties to facilitate full tidal hydrology within the Proposed Project Site and tidal connectivity between the Proposed Project Site and the CSC. Unused excavated soils within the interior of the site would be disposed in a manner that is consistent with the ecological goals of the Proposed Project.
6) Infrastructure Protection, Relocation, Replacement, and Demolishment
Utility infrastructure located on site would be protected or relocated to allow for completion of restoration and levee improvement components. Various PG&E power poles and associated overhead lines would be removed, relocated, or preserved, depending on their function. Buildings, sheds, barns, fences, posts, the condemned Shag Slough Bridge, concrete pads and any other such materials within the construction footprint would be demolished and hauled to a nearby landfill or used on-site, as appropriate.
7) Re-Vegetation and Restoration of Native Habitat
Approximately 3,400 acres of native habitat, including tidal and subtidal marsh, would be restored through grading, fill placement, and natural revegetation. Based on the limited amount of sediment in the channel and preliminary shear stress and velocity estimates, it is expected that the tidal marsh would be fully vegetated and relatively stable in plan and profile. The rehabilitated and re- established tidal marshes are expected to revegetate through natural recruitment. Foraging habitat for GGS and spawning habitat for Delta Smelt would be created as part of the Proposed Project.

ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE

CEQA Guidelines Section 15125 states that an EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the Project Site, as they exist at the time the NOP is published from local, regional, and, in this case, state perspectives (existing conditions). The
environmental setting will constitute the baseline physical conditions that DWR, the CEQA Lead
Agency will use to determine whether an impact is significant. In general, the environmental baseline is the same as existing conditions.

PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
In addition to the no project alternative, additional alternatives will be developed following the
scoping process and will consider the views of agencies and the public.

POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

As required by CEQA, the Draft EIR will identify and evaluate any potentially significant adverse impacts, whether direct or indirect, that may result from the Proposed Project. The Draft EIR will also determine whether feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives can be implemented that
will substantially reduce the Proposed Project's adverse environmental effects within its objectives. Each section will analyze the impacts associated with Proposed Project construction and operation.
An Initial Study (IS) was prepared to scope the Proposed Project's potential for significant impacts
to the environmental issue areas listed below. Based on the findings of this analysis, the Draft
EIR will address, at minimum, the following areas for which potentially significant environmental
impacts were identified.

EXHIBIT A, ATTACHMENT 3 Exhibit A, Attachment 3
Geodetic Branch, Division of Engineering, Department of Water ResourCage 1 of 4 Procedures, Guidelines, Standards, and Requirements for Land Acquisition Boundary Surveys, Legal Descriptions and Mapping
It is the responsibility of the Geodetic Branch of the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to prepare, maintain and manage accurate land records, mapping, and continuity with existing records of land rights under the control of the Department of Water Resources (State of California). These records are an integral part of the DWR Geographic Information System (GIS) and are used extensively by the Department staff in maintaining the vast inventory of land rights for all DWR facilities. It is the further responsibility of the branch to review and approve all land boundary, legal descriptions, and maps prepared by others prior to the conveyance of any real property rights to DWR. When entities other than DWR are acquiring real property rights to be transferred to DWR, there is a critical two-step process that must be followed to ensure a smooth transfer of those rights to DWR. Prior to negotiated acquisition or eminent domain action by the entity, the cadastral land net, boundary survey, legal description and proposed deed of the real property right to be conveyed must be reviewed and approved by the Geodetic Branch to ensure the real property rights being conveyed are correctly and completely surveyed and described according to the Geodetic Branch standards. This will help streamline the transfer of the real property rights to the Department reducing delays and additional expense. The following standards and documentation are required for new acquisitions of real property rights under the control
of the Department.

1. All affected boundaries shall be surveyed prior to the acquisition deed being written and the resulting land surveys shall comply with the State of California Professional Land Surveyors Act and Public Resources Code as required, as
well as any additional requirements in the standards quoted below. A land survey map of the boundary, existing encumbrances, and the proposed acquisition shall be prepared and submitted for review. In cases where real property rights are being purchased over multiple parcels, a land net survey of the boundary, existing encumbrances, and the proposed acquisition may be developed covering multiple parcels in one document. All surveys shall be reviewed and approved prior to submittal of the proposed legal descriptions and
deeds.

2. Once the proposed legal description has been approved, final legal description with DWR Parcel No. shall be sealed, signed and dated by a land surveyor or
engineer licensed to practice land surveying in California. For transfer of
acquisitions to DWR, the Geodetic Branch staff will provide the appropriate deed
cover and signature pages.
3. Descriptions shall include the following: a) Preamble with general location references such as Section, Township and
Range, City, County, and State. b) DWR Parcel Number assigned by Geodetic Branch staff shall be added between the preamble and the body of the final description.
C) The Point of Beginning shall be referenced to a basis of bearing based on two found property monuments of record including recording or filing information. Courses that intersect or adjoin an existing senior deed or

ownership line of record shall call to or along that line citing deed anade 2 of 4 map of record information.
d) Area shall be depicted in acres or square feet (if under 0.02 acre). e) The Basis of Bearing shall be the California Coordinate System, CCS83, and shall comply with the California Public Resources Code (Section 8801-8819). Distances shall be California Coordinate System grid distances in US survey feet.
g) Each legal description shall have an accompanying exhibit map.
4. CCS83 coordinates must be determined by ties to at least 3 California Spatial Reference Network (CSRN) monuments. In areas where ground movement or subsidence may be occurring, ties to the CSRN must be made with minimum 2
hour observations of the CSRN Continually Operating Reference Stations (CORS) or California Spatial Reference Center (CSRC) Continues Global Position System (CGPS) stations. The epoch used must be the same for all three primary control points and must be 2010.00 or newer. The names and values of
primary control points and the epoch utilized shall be shown on the map. If current date-of-survey mid-epoch is used, the method used to establish current epoch must also be stated.
5. Elevations (Orthometric Heights) shall be shown on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) utilizing Geoid 12b or newer. Method for establishing vertical datum must be stated.

6. To translate existing CCS27 coordinates to CCS83 coordinates, field surveyed ties to a minimum of two applicable found monuments that have previously surveyed CCS27 values is required. Calculated conversions from models (CORPSCON, etc.) are unacceptable.
7. All survey monuments referenced in an existing DWR deed that may be affected or lie adjacent to or adjoining the new deed shall be surveyed.

8. All survey monuments of existing record surveys of the subject properties shall be located and shown on the map. This includes monuments from record maps of adjoining properties. If monuments are not available on the parcel or adjoining parcels the survey must reach far enough to re-establish the cadastral land net.
9. Water boundaries when required must include a description of the method utilized to determine ordinary high water. If the subject property lies in tidal areas, ties to tidal benchmarks must be shown on the map and description of process for determining mean high tide including elevation on NAVD 1988 survey epoch must be stated on the map.
10. Contact the Department of Water Resources, Division of Engineering, Geodetic Branch for existing DWR survey monumentation and mapping information that may be applicable to the project.
11. Monumentation shall be set along the new DWR right of way and/or property a boundaries, and a Record of Survey shall be filed in accordance with local and

iv. Original signature and date (in ink) of RD 2098's authorized representative or Project Manager.
b. The State will review each Progress Report and each Statement of Costs along with evidence of completed Scope of Work to determine whether RD 2098 has provided adequate information to verify that the Scope of Work was completed.

C. The State may reject a Statement of Costs if: (1) it is submitted without signature; (2) it contains non-Eligible Project Costs; or, (3) it is submitted under signature of a person other than RD 2098's Project Manager or RD 2098's authorized representative.
d. A Statement of Costs containing a mathematical error will be corrected by the State's Project Manager, after a telephone call or email to RD 2098; and will thereafter be treated as if submitted in the corrected amount. The State will provide RD 2098 with notification of the corrected Statement of Costs.

e. The State will notify RD 2098 in writing, whenever, upon review of a Statement of Costs, the State determines that any portion or portions of the costs claimed: (1) are ineligible to be paid under Federal or State law, or the terms of this Agreement; (2) do not constitute Eligible Project Costs approved by the State for funding under the terms of this Agreement; or (3) are not supported by deliverables or documentation acceptable to the State. RD 2098 may, within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of such notice, submit additional documentation to the State to cure such deficiency(ies). If RD 2098 fails to timely submit adequate documentation curing the deficiency(ies), the State will adjust the pending Statement of Costs by the amount of the ineligible and/or unapproved cost(s).

eligible for reimbursement, and no further payment will be made for that task or item.

B-1. SCOPE OF WORK

Lookout Slough Levee Setback Project Reclamation District 2098

1. Introduction and Purpose
The Lookout Slough Levee Setback Project (Project) is located within RD 2098 approximately 10 miles north of Rio Vista, California. Two funding agreements will be executed to complete two primary objectives: habitat restoration and flood risk reduction, resulting in a single multibenefit project. This Funding Agreement between the DWR and RD 2098 will provide flood risk reduction improvements using funds from Proposition 1 with the objective to increase the resiliency of levees within the Delta to withstand earthquake, flooding, and sea level rise (Project). This Funding Agreement is for the design and construction of the necessary improvements to enlarge the new setback levee adjacent to Duck Slough and Liberty Island Road; and to degrade portions of the existing Shag Slough levee that will result in lower flood water stages in the Yolo Bypass.
The Project, for purposes of the OMRR&R Agreement (Exhibit D), is further defined as the new setback levee adjacent to Duck Slough and Liberty Island Road and any associated federally- or State-authorized flood facilities constructed as part of this Funding Agreement.
The separate contract between DWR and Developer (Agreement No. 4600012583) will create creditable acres for Delta Smelt habitat restoration that will satisfy DWR obligations under the 2008 United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Delta Smelt Biological Opinion (BiOp), and salmonids under the 2009 National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Salmonid BiOp (DSC Project).

When this Project is superimposed on the DSC Project, the overall result is the Multi-benefit Project (Multi-Benefit Project) that allows for efficiencies and cost savings to California's tax payers that would not otherwise be possible if this flood risk reduction project was completed independently.
Achieving the flood risk reduction tasks defined in this Scope of Work rely on the successful execution of the DSC Project since the geotechnical work, hydraulic design, civil design, and permitting processes will be interrelated.
2. Project Location
The Lookout Slough Levee Setback Project area encompasses the majority of RD 2098, located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) at the southern end of the Yolo Bypass, within the Cache Slough Complex, approximately 10 miles north of Rio Vista, California.
3. RD 2098 Tasks Flood Risk Reduction Improvements
3.1. Task 1 - Baseline Study Deliverable for Flood Conveyance Optimization
RD 2098 will provide a Baseline Study Report for flood risk reduction that includes:
3.1.1. Locations and extents of the existing Shag Slough levee to be degraded to the 10-year water surface elevation (WSE).

DWR Agreement 4600012776
Page 20 of 39

3.1.2. Determine the 100-year design WSE and the enlarged levee improvements needed to provide protection considering the 100-year WSE (or 1957 Authorized Design WSE Profile, whichever is greater), plus 6 feet of freeboard, plus 1 foot for resiliency/climate change adaptation.
3.1.3. Demonstrate that the proposed design concept achieves equal or superior hydraulic performance as the preferred Yolo Bypass improvement concept (Yolo Bypass Option 3) described in the Central Valley Flood-Protection Plan Basin- wide Feasibility Study - Sacramento River (November 2016 Draft).
3.2. Task 2 - Design Documentation Report Deliverables
The results of engineering analyses required to design the enlarged setback levee and degrade the existing Shag Slough levee will be provided as Design Documentation Report deliverable(s). As described above, the Multi-benefit Project will create both Delta Smelt habitat restoration credits (Agreement No. 4600012583) and flood risk reduction improvements. From design standpoint, these outcomes will be interrelated since the base setback levee will be built as a result of the work required to produce Delta Smelt credits and cannot be physically separated from the work required to provide flood risk reduction improvements with respect to the geotechnical work, hydraulic design and civil design.
RD 2098 will provide Design Documentation Report Deliverable(s) to include:
3.2.1. Geotechnical Basis of Design Report with supporting data for the Project,
3.2.2. Hydraulics and Hydrology (H&H) Risk and Uncertainty Analysis with descriptions of the difference between the DSC Project and the Project that provides additional flood improvements, and
3.2.3. 60% Civil Design Plans and Specifications which will be used for permitting and environmental compliance documents for the Multi-benefit Project.

3.3. Task 3 - Permits and Environmental Compliance Deliverables
The Multibenefit Project is composed of the DSC Project and this Project, and these components will be interrelated and generally inseparable for regulatory permitting and environmental compliance. While the DSC Project is responsible for obtaining the necessary regulatory permits and environmental compliance for the habitat restoration project, RD 2098 will be responsible for supplemental work necessary to amend, or to obtain additional permits and/or environmental compliance/mitigation requirements related to flood risk reduction, if required. For example, evaluation alternatives to satisfy requirements of CEQA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) may require analysis of the difference between the DSC Project and this Project that provides flood risk reduction improvements.

3.3.1. Permits. In general, regulatory permits will include USACE Section 404 and 408 permits; Central Valley Flood Protection Board permit pursuant to California
Code of Regulations, title 23, chapter 1, article 3; Regional Water Quality Control

DWR Agreement 4600012776
Page 21 of 39

Board water quality certification; State Water Resources Control Board Construction Stormwater Permit, etc.
3.3.2. 100% Civil Design Plans and Specifications which will be used for construction.

3.4. Task 4 - Flood Benefit Completion and Project Closeout Deliverables
RD 2098 will complete all activities required to deliver flood benefits, including environmental mitigation costs associated with flood conveyance levee degrade configurations and placement of additional levee prism. Deliverables include as-built drawings and an updated O&M manual revised to latest OMRR&R format for the new setback levee.RD2098 shall work with DWR to remove the sections of degraded or breached Shag and Cache Slough levees from RD 2098's OMRR&R responsibilities, which may include creating a new State maintenance area for the area south of the new Duck Slough levee. While these efforts are taking place and until the area is removed from RD 2098's OMRR&R responsibilities, DWR shall be fully responsible for and obligated to fulfill any necessary or appropriate OMRR&R obligations for the Shag and Cache Slough levees, and the habitat area, south of the new Duck Slough levee.
This task shall include all labor, equipment and materials to build the new setback levee from the elevation of the DSC Project to the elevation of the Multi-benefit Project, and to degrade portions of the existing Shag Slough levee from the existing grade, at the locations and to the elevations that the H&H Risk and Uncertainty Analysis determines.

4. Design Criteria and Acceptance

Engineering design and construction for levee improvements will be in accordance with Central Valley Flood Protection Board criteria set forth in California Code of Regulations, title 23, chapter 1. It will be DWR's sole determination as to whether a deliverable has been
successfully completed and is acceptable.
