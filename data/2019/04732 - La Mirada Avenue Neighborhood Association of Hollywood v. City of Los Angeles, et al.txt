2Z006 vO 'sajabuy so7 4317 Kingswell Avenue 12 10. The City determined that the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA.

13 11. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that a Notice

14 of Exemption to carry out the Project was filed by the City on or about October 19, 2018.

15 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in

16 August of 2016, Real Party purchased a 1914 Craftsman duplex on an approximately

17 9,602 square foot lot located at 4321 - 4323 Burns Avenue in East Hollywood, which is

18 in Subarea A (Neighborhood Conservation) of the Vermont/Western Transit Oriented

19 District Specific Plan (*Specific Plan"). Real Party acquired the property from a prior

20 developer who had purchased the site in 2014 and who had sought entitlements from the

21 City for a five- (5) unit Small Lot Subdivision. The application for the smaller proposed

22 project was assigned three Case Numbers by the City Planning Department: The City's

23 Advisory Agency designated the request for the Vesting Tentative Tract Map for the

24 subdivision of one (1) parcel into five (5) small lots as Case No. VTT-73056-SL, with a

25 Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND") required for the CEQA clearance designated as

26 Case No. ENV-2014-4125-MND; and the City Planning Department further designated

27 the application for Specific Plan approvals as Case No. DIR-2014-4124-SPP.
12.

28 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
subsequent to Real Party purchasing the 4321 - 4323 Burns Avenue site and

N m t0000 0 improvements in 2016, Real Party submitted an updated Small Lot Subdivision
application to the City increasing the proposed number of units from five (5) to six (6)
units, and also requesting an adjustment to allow increased transitional building height.
The City determined that the new six-unit Project was Categorically Exempt from
CEQA. The City did not change the Case Numbers assigned to the former five-unit
project when accepting the new Project, with the exception of adding a suffix
representing the requested height adjustment, with the updated Case No. being DIR-
2014-4124-SPP-SPPA, and altering the environmental case number to have a "CE"

7138 ION3UMVI GIAVO 10 S301440 MV7 3H1 10 suffix reflecting that the City now found the six-unit Project categorically exempt, rather

11 than requiring an MND: ENV-2014-4125-CE.

Angeles, 13 about April 27, 2017, the City Planning Department held a public hearing on Real Party's

14 application for a Tentative Tract Map for the Property. At the April 27, 2017 hearing,

15 Petitioner's representative Doug Haines and other members of the public attended and

16 raised objections regarding the proposed Project, including objections to the City's

17 determination that the 1914 duplex is not a historic resource, and that the Project is

18 Categorically Exempt from CEQA.
14.
19 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or

20 about February 6, 2018, the Advisory Agency issued a decision letter approving the

21 Project's Tentative Tract Map for a six-unit Small Lot Subdivision, and the demolition of

22 the 1914 duplex.
15.
23 On or about February 15, 2018, Petitioner and the community group Save
24 Hollywood timely filed a joint appeal with the City Planning Department of the Advisory

25 Agency's decision to approve the Tentative Tract Map. Historic Preservation architect

During the City's hearing, Petitioner's Los Angeles, ( 13 representative and others gave testimony in opposition to the Project and in support of 14 the appeals, including substantial evidence presented in written and oral testimony by 15 Historic Preservation expert Charles Fisher confirming that the 1914 duplex on the 16 Project site is of historic and architectural significance subject to CEQA review, and that 17 a Categorical Exemption is improper. Following public testimony, at which Real Party's 18 representative stated that they no longer sought the Project's height adjustment, the 19 Commission voted to deny Petitioner's appeals. 20
19. On or about June 29, 2018, Petitioner and Save Hollywood filed a timely 21 joint appeal to the City Council of the Commission's action approving the Tentative 22 Tract Map, including submitting additional substantial evidence that the 1914 duplex on 23 a the Project site is a historic resource, and that its demolition would be a significant 24 environmental impact for which no mitigation has been proposed, and therefore an 25 Environmental Impact Report is required. 26

v000∞0 Virgil Village Neighborhood Association. However, following Real Party's written
request to continue the City's consideration of the appeals to October 15, 2018, the City
Council unanimously voted to refer the item back to the Council's Planning and Land
Use Management ("PLUM") Committee.

21. On or about September 18, 2018, the City's PLUM Committee held a
public hearing to consider Petitioner's and Save Hollywood's joint appeal, as well as the
appeal filed by the Virgil Village Neighborhood Association. Real Party did not attend

THE LAW OFFICES OF DAVID LAWRENCE BELL 3 10 the hearing or send a representative to speak on its behalf, nor did Real Party submit any

11 written correspondence into the record prior to the hearing refuting the merits of the

LZ006 4317 Kingswell Avenue 12 appeals, thereby waiving its right to contest Petitioner's objections. During the hearing,
Petitioner's representative gave testimony

8 Los Angeles, 13 in support of the appeal of the grant of the

14 Project's entitlements, and of the City's finding that the Project is Categorically Exempt
from CEQA. Following public testimony, including

15 further oral and written testimony

16 providing substantial evidence of a fair argument that there are significant cumulative

17 impacts related to the Project, and that the 1914 duplex on the Project site is a historic

18 resource whose proposed demolition requires analysis in an Environmental Impact

19 Report, the Committee voted to recommend to the City Council that it deny petitioner's

20 and Virgil Village Neighborhood Association's appeals and approve the Project.
22.

21 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or

22 about October 5, 2018, the City Council approved on a consent vote the Categorical

23 Exemption and the Project. Petitioner's representative submitted a speaker's card but

24 was not allowed to speak. Petitioner did enter into the record prior to the hearing

25 additional written testimony in support of the appeal. Real Party did not attend the City's
hearing or send a representative on its behalf.

27 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that a Notice
of Exemption was recorded by the City with the County Clerk on or after October 19,
2018.

- 24. Petitioner, other interested groups, and individuals made oral and written ooNaDDWN comments in opposition to the Project. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative
remedies.

25. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing
this action, including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code Section
21167.5 by sending notice to the City that this action would be filed.
26. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney
General as required by law.
27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to it in the 10 ordinary course of law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner and the 11
anuaAy ij3msbury LLEY T138 BONBUMVI GIAVO HO $301940 MV13HI 8 22006 vD 'sajaBuy so7 public generally will suffer irreparable harm if the City is not required to comply with 12 CEQA and the LAMC's regulations, and to vacate and set aside the above-described 13 Project approvals.
14
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 15 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Does Not Comply with CEQA) 16 28. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of 17 Paragraphs 1 through 27, inclusive, of this Petition. 18
29. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to comply with the requirements 19 of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on the 20 project and associated environmental documentation. An agency must provide sufficient 21 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider 22 environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects. 23 30. The City's action in approving a Categorical Exemption for the Project 24 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the 25 manner required by law.
26
31. Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires the CEQA Guidelines 27 to include a list of categories of projects which have been determined not to have a 28

-8-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the D00 - auAw N provisions of CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.) These exemptions are
commonly referred to as "categorical exemptions."
32. On its face, the CEQA exemption relied upon by Respondents does not
apply to the Project. The City exempted the Project from CEQA, stating "there is no
substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a CE pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies."
33. By law, a categorical exemption must be narrowly construed. Real parties'
proposed project does not fit into the scope of this exemption including because 1138 3ONEXMVI GIAVO JO S3JWH0 MV1 3H1 10 substantial evidence has been submitted into the record that the 1914 duplex on the
Project site is a historic resource. By attempting to squeeze the Project into a narrow 11

I2006 anuary ijamsbun LLEt 12 CEQA exemption that, on its face, does not apply, Respondents failed to proceed in the 8
'sajabuy so1 13 manner required by CEQA.
14 34. CEQA prohibits exemption of the Project from CEQA review because 15 there is a reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the 16 environment due to cumulative impacts. By CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, 17 subdivision (b), "All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative
type in the same place, over time is 18
impact of successive Projects of the same
19 significant." Petitioner submitted evidence identifying 421 residential dwelling units 20 proposed or approved within a ½/ mile of the Project site, including other projects 21 proposed by Real Party, By exempting the Project from environmental review under 22
8 * CEQA, in the face of a demonstrated reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the
environment, Respondents further failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.
35. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good faith, reasoned
and objections in detail, 25 analysis in response to comments, to address recommendations 26 and to explain why specific comments and suggestions, especially those of experts, were
comments on the Categorical 27 not accepted. The City failed to respond adequately to

-9- 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

L Exemption, including comments from Petitioner and other members of the public, 2 including but not limited to comments regarding land use and planning, and historic mv.no resources.

36. Because of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in
that Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the
significant environmental impacts of the Project prior to the City's approval of the 7 Project and approval of the Project as Categorically Exempt. 8
37. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its 9 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and 10 by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, the City's approval of the 11

LZ006 anuany ljamsbuny lier 1138 3ON3HMVI GIAVO JO S301H:0 MV1 3H1 finding that the Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA, and approval of the Project 12
8 and the Land Use Entitlements, must be set aside.
Angeles, 13 38. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable 14 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is allowed to operate in 15 the absence of full and adequate CEQA review, and absent compliance with all other 16 applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.
17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 18 (Violation Of California Subdivision Map Act, LAMC § 17.01 et al; Improper Grant 19 Of Vesting Tentative Tract) 20 39. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of 21 Paragraphs 1 through 38, inclusive, of this Petition.
22 40. California Government Code Sections 66473.1, 66474.60, .61, and .63 23 require, among other things, that a proposed Vesting Tentative Tract Map and design be 24 consistent with the applicable general and specific plans, and that it is not likely to cause 25 substantial environmental damage. 26
41. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City 27 Council abused its discretion and otherwise violated the law in that the findings are 28

2 incomplete, and as to those findings that were made and the subsequent approvals, those
a0p0 were unsupported in fact or in law and do not satisfy the requirements of the pertinent
Government Code to support the subdivision granted by the City and City Council.
HIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation Of City LAMC § 11.5.7.C and Section 5 of the Vermont/Western Transit
Oriented District Specific Plan and its Development Standards and Design

8 Guidelines)

O• 42. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
1138 30N3UMVI GIAVO 10 Paragraphs 1 through 41, inclusive, of this Petition.
43.
11 LAMC Section 11.5.7.C.2 requires that a Specific Plan Project Permit

d 13 monitoring measures when necessary, or alternatives identified in the environmental
ö
THE LAW OFFICES *sajabuy so 14 review which would mitigate the negative environmental efforts of the project."
44.
15 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City

16 abused its discretion by failing to follow the clear language of LAMC Section 11.5.7.C.2

17 and requiring that environmental review be conducted for the Project, instead approving

18 without evidence that the proposed Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA.
45.
19 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

20 including in violation of LAMC Section 11.5.7.C.2, the Director of Planning acting

21 without, or in excess of, jurisdiction issued a determination in favor of Real Party that

22 deviated from and violated the Specific Plan Development Standards and Design

23 Guidelines, and that the Project as approved is inconsistent with the requirements of

24 Specific Plan Subarea A, also referred to a
informed and believes, and based thereon "Neighborhood Conservation." Petitioner is

25 alleges, that in 2001 the City approved the

26 Specific Plan in order to 'guide all development, including use, location, height and

27 density, to assure compatibility of uses." The Specific Plan Guidelines further state that

28 the purpose of Subarea A "is to preserve the prevailing density and character of the

-11-

existing neighborhoods," and that "New development should meld with the surrounding 2 structures and incorporate the best design features that already exist on the block." NO0AW Petitioner is alleges that the Project is incompatible with these requirements.
Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City abused
its discretion by granting Project Permit Compliance Review in direct conflict with the
legislative restrictions expressly imposed upon the property by the elected legislative
body, the City Council.
