Printed on Recycled Paper 01 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Over public opposition and in violation of the California Environmental Quality

3 Act (CEQA), on April 30, 2019, the County of Los Angeles (County) certified an

4 environmental impact report (EIR) and approved a statement of overriding considerations for

5 the Tejon Ranch Centennial Project ("Project").

6 2. The Centennial Project approvals authorize construction of a new, sprawl city on
7 Los Angeles County's rural northern border with Kern County. Specifically, the Project

8 permits construction of 19,333 houses and 8.4 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and

9 business park uses on 12,323 acres of some of California's largest remaining native grasslands

10 and revered wildflower fields, atop the San Andreas and Garlock earthquake faults.

11 3. Located more than 65, 50, and 35 miles from the job centers of Los Angeles,
12 Bakersfield, and Santa Clarita, respectively, the Project is exactly the type of leapfrog sprawl

13 development that climate legislation such as SB 375 sought to prevent. Isolated from existing

14 population centers and infrastructure, the Project's 57,000 residents will be forced to drive long

15 distances to reach jobs, schools, and supplies for decades during Project build-out. The Project
16 would generate 75,000 new vehicle trips per day, with an average trip length of 45 miles. The

17 greenhouse gas emissions of long car trips to existing population centers will be many orders of

18 magnitude greater than those of a non-sprawl development and will hinder California's efforts

19 to combat climate change.

20 4. The Project would induce the widening of State Route 138, although the EIR treats

21 it as a foregone conclusion and fails to analyze the environmental impacts of the freeway

22 widening.

23 5. As the Project would be located far from existing infrastructure, extensive offsite
24 construction and trenching would be required to extend electricity, natural gas, telephone, cable,

25 cellular phone, and water service from existing termini in Gorman and Lebec to the Centennial

26 site. The Project would also require the widening and realignment of several highways and the
27 construction of several water treatment plants, pumping stations, and retention basins.

28 6. The Project site sits at the intersection of two mountain ranges and includes rolling

Printed on Recycled Paper 02 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 hills, steep grades, and frequent high winds. The site has been designated a Very High or High
2 Fire Severity Zone. Without nearby development, this Project would be entirely located in the
3 wildland-urban interface. Climate change, drought, and high, seasonal winds have exacerbated

4 fire dangers at the wildland-urban interface and have resulted in recent megafires, such as the

5 2017 Thomas Fire, which burned much of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties and the Woolsey

6 Fire, which burned 96,949 acres and destroyed 1,643 structures as the Board of Supervisors was
7 considering the Project. Despite this, the County Board of Supervisors conditionally approved

8 the Project before the Woolsey fire was out, with limited mitigation for the Project's severe fire
9 danger.

10 7. The Project will require 532 million gallons of groundwater per year, despite the
11 fact that area groundwater basins are overdrafted and replenishment water from the California
12 Aqueduct is not guaranteed.

13 8. Due to its unique geography, Tejon Ranch is where the Mojave Desert, Central
14 Valley, Sierra Nevada, and the Transverse Ranges of Southern California ecoregions intersect.
15 The Project site has high biodiversity and serves as an important wildlife corridor for mountain
16 lions, bears, and bobcats. California condors, bald eagles, and burrowing owls live and forage
17 on the Project site, as do pronghorn antelope and badgers.
18 9. The vast majority of California's native grasslands and wildflower fields have
19 already been destroyed. The Centennial Project site encompasses some of the last, best and
20 largest native grasslands and wildflower fields remaining in the state. Much of the Project site
21 was slated for inclusion in the San Andreas Significant Ecological Area (SEA) No. 17 based on
22 the presence of the grasslands and other outstanding ecological conditions, but was removed at
23 the Project proponent's request.
24 10. The EIR estimates 40,000 cubic yards of grading will occur every day, for a total
25 of 100 million cubic yards of grading over 20 years. This mass grading will alter the area's
26 rolling topography, kick up harmful dust potentially laden with Valley Fever spores, and emit
27 noxious diesel particulate matter, a designated carcinogen.
28 11. Additionally, the addition of tens of thousands of long-distance commuters to L.A.

Printed on Recycled Paper 03 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P County's crowded freeways will drive up traffic, particularly on Interstate 5. These commutes

2 will generate air pollution that causes asthma, lung cancer and birth defects and exacerbate the

3 region's noncompliance with existing air-quality standards.

4 12. The Project claims to incorporate green development standards and measures to

5 reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but these measures are vague, speculative or deferred to

6 future plans.

7 13. The EIR prepared for the Project admits the Project will have significant and

8 unavoidable impacts on air quality, biological resources, climate change, conversion of

9 agricultural land, noise, public services, growth-inducement, traffic, visual resources, and water

10 supply, but the County improperly rejected feasible alternatives that would have reduced these

11 impacts.

12 14. The County's findings claim that potential environmental impacts have been

13 mitigated to the extent feasible, but much of the Project's mitigation is speculative because it

14 relies on the Ranchwide Agreement and the underfunded, understaffed Tejon Ranch

15 Conservancy for implementation. As result, many of the Project's impacts on the biological

16 resources and conserved lands remain significant and unmitigated.

17 15. The Statement of Overriding Considerations claims the Project will benefit the
18 County by providing orderly development in close proximity to jobs, but there is no guarantee

19 that jobs will materialize for the Project's 57,000 residents who will commute 35-65 miles to
20 existing jobs in Los Angeles, the Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita, and Bakersfield.

21 16. Since the EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's

22 significant impacts, and the Statement of Overriding Considerations lacks substantial evidence,

23 the County's approval violates CEQA, and the Project approvals must be rescinded.

24 17. Additionally, the Centennial Project is inconsistent with several policies of the Los

25 Angeles County General Plan, including those aimed at avoiding new development in fire-
26  prone areas and suburban sprawl.

27 18. Finally, in processing and approving the Centennial Project, the County of Los
28 Angeles has failed to exercise its independent judgment as required by law.

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 The Centennial Project and Location

3 27. The Centennial Project would construct a new city of about 57,000 residents,

4 19,333 residential units and 8.4 million square feet of commercial and industrial development

5 distributed among nine new "villages" on Los Angeles County's northern border. The

6 Centennial Project is located approximately 50 miles south of Bakersfield, 5 miles east of

7 Gorman, 36 miles west of Lancaster, 35 miles north of Santa Clarita, 36 miles west of Lancaster,

8 and 65 miles from downtown Los Angeles.

9 28. The 12,323-acre Centennial Project site is located on Tejon Ranch in the
10 northwestern portion of the Antelope Valley in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles

11 County contiguous to the southern boundary of Kern County. The Project site's western

12 boundary is approximately one mile east of Interstate 5 (I-5). State Route 138 (SR-138) bisects

13 the southern portion of the Project site. The California Aqueduct diverges into its east and west
14 branches immediately north of the Project site. The Angeles National Forest is located

15 approximately one mile southeast of the Project site.
16 29. The Project site is predominately native grassland, much of which has historically

17 been used for grazing. The site provides a wildlife corridor for bears, mountain lions, and

18 bobcats, and is also home to grey foxes, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, and a variety

19 of bird and bat species. Notably, the site provides nesting and foraging areas for rare and listed
20 species including the California condor, bald eagle, and burrowing owl. In the past, the County

21 designated portions of the Project site as part of the San Andreas Significant Ecological Area

22 (SEA) No. 17.

23 30. One thousand acres of the Project site are currently used by Tejon Ranch as pivot

24 fields and have been designated as Prime Farmland by California's Farmland Mapping and
25 Monitoring Program.

26 31. The Tehachapi Mountains border the northern and western perimeter of the Project

27 site, and the San Gabriel Mountains are located to the south of the Project site. Elevations range

28 from approximately 2,975 to 3,635 feet above mean sea level.

Printed on Recycled Paper 06 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

32. Located at the intersection of several mountain ranges and of the San Andreas and
2 Garlock Faults, Project topography is rolling to steep and bisected by the California Aqueduct as
3 well as many existing streams and drainages. Flattening the Project site for construction will
4 require 100 million cubic yards of grading, at an estimated 40,000 to 100,000 cubic yards of
5 grading per day, for up to 20 years,

6 33. As the Project site is currently vacant and rural, the Project would require the
7 construction of massive amounts of infrastructure, including a network of roads and highways,
8 trenching for water and other utilities, construction of electrical substations and a materials

9 recovery facility, the extension of electrical lines and telephone access from existing termini,
10 the construction of two water treatment plants and detention basins, and more so that residents
11 may access essential services. The Project also includes the construction of schools, fire
12 stations, police stations, and a library.

13 34. Due to its long distance from established business and population centers, the
14 Project would add an estimated 75,000 commuter trips per day, with an estimated length of 45
15 miles each, generating greenhouse gases that could be reduced if the Project were located
16 nearer to existing population centers.
17 35. The Project will rely primarily on 532 million gallons of groundwater per year and
18 speculative water supplies procured from the California Aqueduct, despite the area's low
19 rainfall and history of groundwater basin overdraft.
20 36. Despite recent requirements to include rooftop solar power in all new residential
21 construction in California, the Project does not include rooftop solar for all of its 19,333
22 residential units.

23 Project Review and Approval
24 37. On March 15, 2004, the County of Los Angeles issued a Notice of Preparation for
25 the 12,000-acre Centennial Project. The County accepted comments until April 14, 2004.
26 Scoping meetings were held on March 30, 2004, and March 31, 2004.
27 38. In 2008, Tejon Ranch Co. entered into the Ranchwide Agreement with several
28 environmental organizations. The Ranchwide Agreement called for preservation of large

Printed on Recycled Paper 07 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 portions of the Tejon Ranch property and the creation and funding of the Tejon Ranch

2 Conservancy. In exchange, these environmental organizations agreed not to oppose Tejon

3 Ranch Co.'s efforts to develop several projects, including the Centennial Project. The Tejon

4 Ranch Conservancy recently lost half of its staff and much of its funding.

5 39. A revised Notice of Preparation was issued on October 1, 2015. The County

6 accepted comments on the revised Notice of Preparation from October 5 to November 4, 2015.

7 The County held a scoping meeting on October 21, 2015.

8 40. Project entitlements consist of a specific plan, a zone change to change the zoning

9 on the site to "specific plan," a general plan amendment to reflect the Project's roadways, a

10 vesting tentative parcel map to create 20 large-lot parcels for lease, conveyance, and financing

11 purposes, and conditional use permit, and a development agreement.

12 41. The Draft EIR (DEIR) for the Centennial Project was released on May 15, 2017

13 a for a 90-day review comment period ending August 17, 2017. Hundreds of comments were

14 submitted to the County by petitioners, state and federal agencies, local entities, Native

15 American tribes, and members of the public. Groups objecting to the Project include SoCal

16 350, Great Old Broads for Wilderness, Tri-County Watchdogs, Wild Heritage Planners, Idle No

17 More SoCal, Defenders of Wildlife, Investing in Place, Center on Race, Poverty & the

18 Environment, Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice, and Los Angeles

19 Walks.

20 42. A County Hearing Examiner hearing was held on July 17, 2017 to receive public

21 comments.

22 43. In May 2018, the County released a final EIR (FEIR) and Responses to Comments

23 that reflected changes made to the Project in responses to comments and new information

24 provided.

25 44. The County Regional Planning Commission held hearings on the Project on June

26 6, 2018, July 11, 2018, and August 29, 2018. Petitioners provided additional comment letters

27 and testimony at hearings during this time.
28 45. At the close of the hearing period, the Regional Planning Commission

Printed on Recycled Paper 08 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- recommended that the Board of Supervisors certify the final EIR and adopt CEQA Findings, a

2 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
3 46. In November 2018, the County produced a Consolidated Final EIR that included

4 responses to public and agency comments, as well as clarifications, corrections, and revisions to

5 the text, tables, figures and appendices of the Draft and Final EIR.

6 47. On December 11, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors held a hearing a on the
7 Project. At the conclusion of this hearing, after much testimony in opposition, the Supervisors
8 voted 4-1 in favor of recommending certification of the final EIR and adoption of CEQA

9 findings and a statement of overriding considerations for the Project. In voting against the
10 recommendation, Supervisor Sheila Kuehl stated, "I think it is a little bit of pie in the sky, as I
11 listen to it, that people who live there are going to work there. Don't kid yourself." The
12 Supervisors directed staff to prepare a Project Labor Agreement related to the construction of
13 backbone infrastructure, a job training program, peer-review of fire mitigation strategies, and to
14 increase the percentage of affordable housing in the Project from 15 to 18 percent.
15 48. On April 30, 2019, the County Board of Supervisors voted to approve the Project
16 as part of the consent calendar. Supervisor Sheila Kuehl requested that the clerk record her
17 opposition to the Project. Petitioner Center testified in opposition to the Project at this hearing.
18 By the end of the administrative process, over 5,500 comments had been submitted that
19 objected to the Project and its enormous environmental impacts.
20 49. The City posted a Notice of Determination for the Project approvals on or about
21 April 30, 2019.

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

24 50. Petitioners objected to the Project in the administrative process and fully exhausted
25 their administrative remedies. Petitioners submitted multiple letters during the comment period
26 raising the issues set forth herein and appeared at hearings held on the Project.
27 51. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
28 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of

Printed on Recycled Paper 09 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 such remedies, Respondent's approval of the Centennial Project would form the basis for a

2 development project that would proceed in violation of state law.

3 52. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a

4 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as

5 Exhibit A.

6 53. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

7 providing the County of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors with

8 notice of its intention to commence the action. Copies of these notices are attached as Exhibit

9 B.

10 54. Petitioners elect to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

11 attached as Exhibit C.

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

14 55. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
15 Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Impacts

16 56. CEQA requires the County to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

17 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal.

18 Code Regs. § 15004).

19 57. CEQA imposes upon the County a clear, present and mandatory duty to certify an

20 EIR only if the EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may

21 occur. The EIR for the Centennial Project lacks the necessary analysis.

22 58. Further, CEQA requires adoption of all feasible mitigation measures that will

23 reduce adverse environmental impacts. Many feasible mitigation measures were ignored in the

24 EIR.

25 a. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Aesthetic and
Recreational Impacts.
26 59. Although the Project will construct a city of 57,000 people in an otherwise rural
27 and undeveloped area, the EIR fails to adequately analyze, disclose, and mitigate the Project's
28 myriad visual impacts.

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 60.

2 The Pacific Crest Trail will be realigned through the Project site. The EIR claims

3 that any impacts to the trail will be minimized by MM 13-4 which will construct a wall to

screen

4 structures and residences. However, the Pacific Crest Trail's purpose is to allow hikers

5 to experience nature, tranquility, and the open vistas of preserved lands extending from the

6 Mexican border to the Canadian border. Requiring hikers to follow a wall will remain a
significant impact compared with the existing, unspoiled setting.

7 61.

8 The EIR contains no binding mitigation measures requiring provision of a natural
setting for the trail.

9 62.

10 The EIR fails to acknowledge impacts on scenic highways including State Route

11 138, based on the road's inclusion in a development area of the Antelope Valley Area Plan.
63.

12 The EIR's mitigation measures for light and glare are inadequate to truly mitigate

13 the impacts of installing thousands of people in an undeveloped area, especially with regard to

14 wildlife that rely on dark skies for foraging, navigation, regulation of day-night cycles, and
protection.

15 64.

16 The EIR fails to even try to mitigate the visual impacts of 20 years of construction
in violation of CEQA.

17 65.

18 The EIR's mitigation measures concerning the impacts of converting rural lands to

19 urban lands, MM 7-13, 13-1, 13-2, and 13-3, are inadequate and conditioned on the developer's
definition of "if feasible."

20 b.

21 66. The EIR Failed to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Biological Impacts.

22 CEQA requires that environmental review assess a project's potential for adverse a
impacts on wildlife and sensitive natural communities.

23 67.

24 The EIR fails to disclose and analyze information necessary for decisionmakers

25 and the public to evaluate the Project's impacts on wildlife and sensitive natural communities.
68. The Project would convert thousands acres of natural lands to suburban
26 development where the Sierra Nevada, Mojave Desert, and the Transverse Ranges ecoregions
27

28 converge. The Project site also sits near the convergence of California's two largest faults,
resulting in soil conditions that lead to unique biological and botanical resources.

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 69. Development over the last century has destroyed nearly all of California's native

2 grasslands. The Project site is one of the largest remaining stands of native perennial grassland

3 in the state. The perennial bunchgrass community on the site covers 5,500 continuous acres

4 with minimal intrusion of introduced annual grasses and a high richness of bunchgrass species.

5 Countless rare plant species are found on and near the Project site, including California

6 androsace, crownscale, round-leaved filaree, Mojave spineflower, sylvan scorzonella, and

7 adobe yampah.

8 70. Habitat destruction is a leading cause of plant and animal species extinction.

9 71. Even where habitat is not directly destroyed, development near habitat results in

10 fragmentation and the imposition of "edge effects" on the habitat that remains. Noise, and light

11 pollution, invasive species, polluted runoff, and direct impacts of roads and fences harm

12 wildlife or render remaining lands suboptimal.

13 72. Despite the conversion of thousands of acres from open space wilderness into a

14 city, the EIR concludes that the Project's impacts will be less than significant after mitigation.

15 73. As the EIR rejected feasible alternatives and mitigation measures that would

16 further reduce or avoid the Project's impacts on biological resources, this conclusion lacks

17 substantial evidence.

18 74. Further, the Project's incorporated mitigation measures are unlikely to mitigate the
19 Project's significant impacts on biological resources. This is especially true with regard to
20 native grasslands.

21 75. The Project proposes to mitigate for development of Project lands by setting aside

22 other lands for conservation. However, the grasslands slated for development were previously

23 proposed by the County for designation as part of a Significant Ecological Area as grasslands of
24 high species diversity. In contrast, the grasslands proposed for conservation lack data showing

25 they are comparable in species richness and diversity.

26 76. The loss of several thousand acres of a unique type of native perennial grassland is

27 a significant and unavoidable impact not recognized by the EIR.

28 77. The biological reports underlying the EIR vastly understate the quality and

Printed on Recycled Paper 12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

ecological value of the site's native grasslands and omit discussion of geology or soils.

2 78. The biological reports underlying the EIR's analysis inadequately analyze

3 wildflowers and the Project's potential impacts on species.

4 79. The EIR downplays several important plant communities by lumping them

5 together as "Native Perennial Grassland/California Annual Grassland," resulting in the failures

6 to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate impacts to native perennial grassland and

7 wildflower field communities.

8 80. Additionally, the lands being proposed for conservation have already been

9 conserved. Three of the Project's proposed mitigation areas already have conservation
10 easements that were recorded after California's Wildlife Conservation Board paid the Tejon
11 Ranch Co. $15.8 million for their preservation. The Project impermissibly seeks to use past

12 conservation for future development.

13 81. Project mitigation relies on mitigation ratios that are too low to ensure mitigation
14 success, such as 1.8:1 for landscape connectivity.
15 82. An adequate EIR analysis requires an environmental baseline that accurately
16 represents pre-project conditions.

17 83. However, the EIR's consulting biologists failed to conduct comprehensive surveys
18 of the entire Project site. Between this and the lack of access to private property, the EIR
19 understates the species diversity of the Project site.
20 84. The EIR fails to adequately mitigate the Project's impacts on rare plants. MM 7-1
21 defers surveys and formulation of Special Status Plan Species Restoration Plan and a
22 Biological Resource Mitigation Plan until the future. CEQA requires that mitigation measures
23 be formulated before project approval so their efficacy can be evaluated by the public and
24 decisionmakers. This is especially important with regard to native plant species, as relocation
25 and reestablishment of populations is only successful eight percent of the time.
26 85. The Project site hosts ten species of oak trees and is a living laboratory of oak
27 hybridization.

28 86. Although the EIR relies on an Oak Woodland Mitigation Plan and an Oak

Printed on Recycled Paper 13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Maintenance Plan to conclude that impacts to oak woodlands will not be significant, these plans

2 have been deferred to a future process, without adequate performance criteria. This violates

3 CEQA's prohibition against deferred mitigation.

4 87. The EIR also impermissibly excluded Alternative G, the Reduction of Oak
5 Woodland Impact Alternative.

6 88. The Project site is consistently used by state and federally-listed California

7 condors, but the County rejected recommended mitigation for condors. MM 7-6 addresses

8 construction-related impacts and the removal of dead cattle that might attract condors to the

9 site, but fails to contain an enforceable timeline for implementation. No mitigation is included

10 to offset the impacts of microtrash, litter, vehicle fluids, and food waste of 57,000 people on

11 condor populations.

12 89. Project implementation would result in the loss of 6,416 acres of foraging habitat

13 for raptors including golden eagles, northern harrier, and white-tailed kites. These raptors are

14 also directly impacted by residential development through poisoning, collisions, and power

15 lines. Yet the Project fails to include mitigation beyond MM 7-6, which is limited to

16 construction impacts. The Project lacks mitigation for operational impacts that may harm

17 protected raptor species.

18 90. Similarly, in reliance on flawed MM 7-6, the EIR concludes, without support, that

19 the Project will not impact bald eagles known to frequent the Project site near Quail Lake. The
20 EIR fails to include protection for roosting or nesting sites.

21 91. Swainson's hawks, which are listed as threatened under the California Endangered

22 Species Act, use the site and its farmed lands. The EIR admits the Project would destroy the

23 habitats used by these protected birds, but concludes, without support, that these impacts would

24 not be significant.

25 92. The EIR failed to survey for ringtail, a mammal found in the Project area.

26 93. Although the EIR identified willow flycatchers, least Bell's vireos, and western

27 yellow-billed cuckoos on the Project site, it dismissed the potential for impacts in its analysis.

28 MM 7-5, intended to avoid impacts to migratory individuals, fails to actually require surveys or

Printed on Recycled Paper 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- actions to protect these species.

2 94.

3 The tri-colored blackbird, listed as a threatened species under the California

4 Endangered Species Act, was identified nesting at the north edge of the Project site, in Oso

5 Creek, and on the shores of Quail Lake. The EIR estimated that the Project would reduce the

6 population 20 percent, and recommended habitat enhancement measures but provided no

7 requirements or metrics for actually implementing the habitat enhancement. Thus, impacts to
this species remain significant.

8 95.

Q The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate potential impacts to American

10 badgers or silvery legless lizards, burrowing owls, northern harrier, and loggerhead shrike.
96.

11 The Project site hosts the southernmost herd of pronghorn antelope in California.

12 Pronghorn, for which Antelope Valley is named, rely on California's remaining native

13 grasslands. Removal of the Project site's native grasslands will likely adversely affect this

14 small but persistent population. Even so, the EIR failed to analyze the Project's impacts to this
iconic animal.

15 97.

16 The Project site is an important connectivity site for mountain lions and bears,

17 among others. The EIR's evaluation of wildlife connectivity and corridors fails to depict

18 wildlife movement and instead focuses on locating bridges across the California aqueduct.
98.

19 Although much of the Project site was removed from the County-designated
Significant Ecological Area during the Antelope Valley Area Plan at Tejon's request,
20 information in the EIR and elsewhere confirms that the Project site continues to meet the
21

22 County's criteria for designating a Significant Ecological Area.
99.

23 The EIR fails to analyze Project impacts to wildlife under climate change, despite

24 the fact that the Project will have multi-decade implementation schedule.

25 100. The EIR relies on the Ranchwide Agreement to mitigate project impacts.

26 However, the County is not a party to the Ranchwide Agreement. The Agreement may only be

27 enforced by the Tejon Ranch Conservancy, which is partially controlled by the Project
proponent.

28 C. Greenhouse Gas Emissions are Not Adequately Analyzed or Mitigated.

Printed on Recycled Paper 15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

101. As a sprawl development with long commutes and massive construction
2 requirements for infrastructure and buildings, the Centennial Project's construction and

3 operation will emit many tons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the

4 atmosphere.

5 102. The California Air Resources Board recognized, "The Project is currently one of, if

6 not the, largest land use development projects proposed in California and, as currently proposed,

7 substantially conflicts with the State's climate goals. As currently proposed, its laudable housing

8 goals do not outweigh the public health, environmental, and quality of life costs that will be

9 imposed by its development."

10 103. The EIR vastly underestimates the Project's greenhouse gas emissions, leading to

11 its failure to adequately analyze or mitigate these emissions.

12 104. The EIR improperly relies on the fallacies that most Project residents will be
13 employed onsite and that employees will not commute to or from the Project site.

14 105. The EIR fails to consider the Project's greenhouse gas emissions if the Project is

15 not built in the order proposed, although the Project is not required to produce jobs at any

16 particular point in Project implementation and the Project may be modified at-will based on
17 market conditions and economic factors.

18 106. The EIR also improperly relies on the state's Cap and Trade program and on other

19 climate plans to mitigate the Project's massive greenhouse gas emissions.

20 107. CEQA requires the inclusion of all feasible mitigation when a Project will have

21 significant impacts on the environment. (Public Resources Code § 21002.) Additional, feasible

22 mitigation measures proposed by Petitioners, CAPCOA, and others, are available, but were not

23 adopted by the Project.

24 108. While the EIR discusses limits for the greenhouse gas emissions of its electricity,

25 the County did not require the Project to be fully "zero net energy." Zero net energy
26 developments are feasible and being implemented currently, most recently at Newhall Ranch.

27 A development that reduces onsite greenhouse gases to the maximum extent practicable and

28 offsets all other emissions through local emissions projects is feasible and should have been

Printed on Recycled Paper 16 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- required.

2

3 109. The Project could contain more EV charging stations, faster EV charging stations,
and technology in addition to EV charging stations.

4

5 110. The Project fails to require distributed or rooftop solar installations, required by
the California Energy Commission for all new homes as of 2020.

6

7 111. An EIR is required to analyze whether the energy conservation measures in

8 Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines could be adopted in a project. (California Clean Energy

9 Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 209.) The EIR lacks this analysis.
d.

10 The EIR's Noise Analysis is Inadequate.

11 112. Traffic created and exacerbated by the Project will have direct, indirect, and

12 cumulative impacts on noise, with significant impacts on sensitive receptors, including wildlife.

13 113. However, the Project's noise mitigation measures are not binding and enforceable,

14 as required. For example, MM 12.1 requires the submission of a noise assessment, but does not

15 require that mitigation be formulated using the information gathered in that assessment.

16 114. The EIR fails to account for the noise perceptibility of wildlife.

17 115. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's consistency

18 with General Plan policies and County Code provisions governing noise.
116. Construction mitigation measures, such as MM 12-3, are too vague to provide
19 sufficient protection to sensitive receptors.

20 117. The EIR fails to analyze cumulative impacts on noise based on these
21| impermissibly vague and deferred mitigation measures.

22 e. Transportation and Traffic Impacts Are Not Sufficiently Analyzed or

23 Mitigated.

24 118. As it is located 65 miles from downtown Los Angeles and 35 miles from the

25 closest job centers of Lancaster and Santa Clarita, the Centennial Project is the very definition

26 of urban sprawl. As residents will have to drive an estimated 45 miles per trip outside Project

27 boundaries, the Project will generate large amounts of traffic on State Route 138 and Interstate
5.
28 119. To determine environmental impact, an EIR compares the existing conditions on a

Printed on Recycled Paper 17 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 project site with the conditions expected after the project is implemented. The pre-project

2 conditions are known as the baseline. An improper baseline skews environmental analysis and

3 precludes informed decisionmaking.

4 120. The Centennial Project EIR artificially inflates the traffic baseline by including

5 projects that do not currently exist, such as Tejon Mountain Village and the Grapevine Specific

6 Plan. While these projects should be included in cumulative traffic analysis for the Centennial

7 Project, they cannot be treated as part of the existing conditions at the time of the Project's

8 Notice of Preparation. A court recently found that Kern County violated CEQA in approving

9 the Grapevine Specific Plan and required the county to rescind those project approvals. Tejon
10 Mountain Village's project approvals are currently in litigation.

11 121. The EIR's analysis of traffic impacts is further infected by its use of the outdated

12 2012 Southern California Association of Governments Regional Transportation

13 Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy for growth projections instead of the 2016-2040

14 version, which was adopted April 7, 2016, three years before the Centennial Project was

15 approved.

16 122. The EIR understates traffic impacts and trip generation by assuming, without

17 evidence, that all onsite jobs will be filled be Project residents.

18 123. The EIR further underestimates traffic impacts by assuming, without assurance,

19 that the Project will create jobs for existing residents and that residents will work at the jobs
20 created by the Project instead of continuing existing employment. The Project does not require

21 buildout of job-creating land uses in any particular order, and permits buildout of the entire

22 Project without job-creation land uses based on "market conditions."

23 124. The EIR fails to allow for increases in existing, without-Project traffic.

24 125. The EIR fails to analyze Project impacts on State Route 138 using the Vehicle

25 Miles Travelled (VMT) measure.

26 126. The EIR underestimates Project traffic generation by assuming that residents will

27 rely on bicycle trips for 3-mile trips in a hot and arid region with hilly topography.

28 127. In relying on the separate and outdated 2004 North County Combined Highway

Printed on Recycled Paper 18 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Corridors Study, the EIR fails to account for the impacts on air pollution and climate change

3 that will occur if State Route 138 is widened to accommodate the Project.

4 128. The EIR claims that traffic impacts will be mitigated because the Project "must"

5 meet certain mobility performance standards, including minimum percentages of different types

6 of non-single occupancy vehicle (SOV) trips. However, the EIR never explains how these

7 minimum standards will be met, or what will occur if those standards are not met.

8 129. The Project's estimates and environmental analyses rely on the planning and

9 implementation of plans by the Transit Management Association (TMA). However, the EIR

10 does not specify how or how well the TMA will be funded. Thus, project design features and

11 mitigation measures dependent on the TMA are speculative.

12 130. The EIR improperly determines certain mitigation measures are "significant and
unavoidable" in lieu of actually analyzing their feasibility, especially with regard to highway
13 improvements.

14

15 131. Other traffic mitigation measures identified by the EIR are deferred, illusory, or

16 unenforceable. For example, MM 10-2 merely requires the submission of a traffic study. MM

17 10-6 requires compliance with the Centennial Transportation Improvement Plan. However, the

18 Project proponent is not actually required to enter the Centennial Transportation Improvement

19 Plan, it need only "seek" to enter such a plan. MM 10-3 and 10-6 are similarly voluntary.
132. Mitigation measures MM 10-7, 10-8, and 10-9 permit the Project proponent to
20 contribute an unspecified "fair share" toward infrastructure improvements in lieu of complying
21

22 with the Centennial Transportation Improvement Plan.

23 133. The EIR has similar deferred and illusory mitigation language regarding
cooperation with Caltrans that cannot be relied on to reduce or avoid significant and
24 unavoidable traffic impacts.

25

26 134. Accordingly, the EIR fails to adequately analyze, disclose, and mitigate the
Project's very large and significant traffic impacts.
27 f.

28 Population and Housing Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed or Mitigated.
135. The EIR assumes that population and housing impacts will not occur because the

Printed on Recycled Paper 19 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project will provide 1.22 jobs per housing unit. However, the Project contains no guarantees

2 that the land uses that would produce these jobs would ever be built, although residential uses

3 would begin construction immediately. On the contrary, commercial and industrial land uses

4 and phases of development containing these uses could be deferred indefinitely based on
market forces and the state of the economy.

6 136. Moreover, even if jobs do materialize in the future, there is no guarantee that

7 residents living in the Project will work on site. More likely, residents from Los Angeles

8 County with stable jobs that enable them to purchase a home in the Project will choose to retain
their higher-paying existing job, rather than move to a likely lower-pay job in the grocery stores

10 and resident-serving business that will be constructed first.

11 137. The EIR also fails to account for Kern County's high unemployment rate and the
12 likelihood that Kern County residents will welcome and travel to new jobs created by the

13 Project.

14 138. Although the EIR itself admits the Project would increase population and housing

15 at the Project site, it fails to discuss mitigation measures for this significant impact, based on
16 alleged consistency with the Antelope Valley Area Plan.

17 139. Thus, the Project's significant impacts on population and housing are not

18 adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in the EIR.

19 g. Growth-Inducing Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed or Mitigated.

20 140. EIRs are required to provide a detailed discussion of the growth-inducing impacts

21 of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 2100(b)(5); 21156.)

22 141. The Project will extend urban infrastructure into a rural area, 35 miles from the

23 nearest job centers of Santa Clarita and Lancaster, and will induce growth to the northernmost

24 reaches of Los Angeles County.

25 142. The EIR improperly assumes disclosure and analysis of the Project's growth-
26 | inducing impacts based on the previous analysis contained in the Antelope Valley Area Plan.

27 The Antelope Valley Area Plan did not evaluate the growth-inducing impacts of the Project.

28 143. Although the EIR admits unplanned development could occur, the EIR's analysis

Printed on Recycled Paper 20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- assumes that unplanned development will not occur.

2

3 144. The EIR concludes that growth-inducing impacts will be limited by the 2008

4 Ranchwide Agreement; however, the Agreement is not binding on property owners outside of

5 Tejon Ranch, and the County lacks authority to enforce the Agreement.

6 145. The EIR fails to acknowledge the Project's contribution to the potential widening
and realignment of State Route 138.

7

8 146. Finally, the EIR's growth-inducing impacts analysis is internally inconsistent and
conflicts with other analyses of the EIR.

9 h.

10 Fire Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed or Mitigated.

11 147. The Project is located in an area designated by the County and CALFIRE as a

12 Very High or High Fire Severity Zone, complete with steep terrain and high winds.

13 148. In addition to endangering the residents and workers of the Project, the placement

14 of some 57,000 people and their vehicles in a fire prone area increases the likelihood of fire in
and around the Project site.
15

16 149. Even so, the EIR relies on mitigation measures that do not take into account the

17 dangers of building new facilities and installing a permanent population in a fire prone area.

18 150. Although the County required "peer review" of the Project's fire prevention and

19 safety measures when it approved the Project, these procedures not reduce or eliminate the

20 danger of placing some 57,000 residents in a fire prone area in the first place.

21 151. The EIR also fails to include sufficient specificity about the Project's fuel

22 modification plan and the extent to which it will have impacts on the Project area's important
biological resources.

23 152. While much of California's native species
24 are adapted to fire, the recent megafires

25 experienced in California burned hotter and further than previous fires, resulting in greater and

26 sometimes permanent damage to plant communities. The EIR fails to analyze the impacts to

27 biological resources that will occur if more frequent or severe fires impact the area.
i.

28 Land Use Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed.
153. The EIR is unclear as to whether areas designated as "open space" will truly

Printed on Recycled Paper 21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 remain open space in perpetuity. While the EIR claims that nearly 6,000 acres are designated

2 as "open space" under the Project, only 3,681 acres are designated as Significant Ecological

3 Area 17 "to be preserved in perpetuity."

4 154. The Project's development of a city of some 57,000 people in an otherwise rural

5 area will extend urban infrastructure far from other employment and population centers and

6 induce growth in an area rich with sensitive habitat and species. This growth-inducement will

7 result in significant impacts to offsite biological resources, air quality, traffic, greenhouse gases,

8 water resources, and other areas that were not adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated in

9 the EIR.

10 155. The Project will develop 1,000 acres of farmland, including land deemed Prime

11 Farmland by the State of California. Feasible alternatives and mitigation were available to

12 avoid this significant and unavoidable impact, but were rejected.

13 156. CEQA requires an EIR to disclose, analyze, and mitigate a Project's conflicts with

14 applicable land use plans.

15 157. The applicable Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy is

16 a plan with which the Project must be consistent.

17 158. The Project's estimated 57,000 residents at buildout exceed the Southern

18 California Association of Government projections for 2040, rendering the Project inconsistent

19 with the applicable Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy required

20 by SB 375.

21 159. Land use decisions must be consistent with all applicable land use policies,

22 including the Los Angeles County General Plan and all of its elements. (Pfeiffer v. City of

23 Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1562-63.)

24 160. The County violated state planning and zoning law when it approved the Project

25 because the Project is incompatible with the General Plan and related development ordinances
26 because it does not meet their development standards and goals, examples of which are

27 described in the following paragraphs.

28 161. General Plan Policy LU 3 provides that development patterns in the County should

Printed on Recycled Paper 22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- discourage suburban sprawl.

2

3 162. The Los Angeles County General Plan provides, "Jobs-housing balance is reached

4 by working toward increasing opportunities for people to work and live in close proximity, and

5 reduce long commutes that are costly both economically and environmentally."

6 163. Instead, the Project would site thousands of people dozens of miles (at least) from
employment opportunities.

7

8 164. The General Plan also discourages suburban sprawl because it contributes to

9 "traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions." The Project will

10 disproportionately add to all of these harms, rendering it inconsistent with General Plan LU 3.

11 165. The Antelope Valley Area Plan (AVAP), adopted in June 2015, governs land use
in the Project area.

12

13 166. The Project is inconsistent with various portions of the adopted AVAP's Land Use
Element, including, but not limited to:

14

15 167. Goal LU 2 requires land use patterns that protect environmental resources.

16 However, the Project will be built on land that was, until recently, designated by the County as
a significant ecological area.

17 168. The Project is sited in an area prone to natural hazards and is, therefore,
18 inconsistent with Goal LU 3 and Policies LU 3.1 and 3.5.

19 169. The Project is inconsistent with Goal LU 5, which requires that land use patterns
20 decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will disproportionately add to the region's
21

22 greenhouse gas emissions by siting residents far from existing employment, schools, and city

centers.

23

24 170. Policy LU 5.1 requires consistency with the Sustainable Communities Strategy

25 required by SB 375. However, the Project would exceed the Southern California Association of

26 Government's population projections in the 2016-2040 Regional Transportation

27 Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The Project's location far from employment centers is
also the antithesis of any sustainable community.
28 171. By not assuredly providing local employment opportunities, the Project is

Printed on Recycled Paper 23 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

inconsistent with Policies LU 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4

2 172. Policy LU 5.3 requires preservation of open space areas, but the Project will

3 reduce existing open space by approximately 6,000 acres.

4 173. Since the Project will not require any land use patterns that promote alternatives to

5 the automobile, the Project is inconsistent with the AVAP Mobility element, in particular, Goal

6 M1, Policy M1.1, goal M2, Policy M2.2, Policy M2.3, and Policy M2.4

7 174. The Project fails to identify sustainable water resources, and is therefore

8 inconsistent with the AVAP's water resources policies and Policies COS1.1 and COS 2.1 of the

9 AVAP Conservation Element.

10 175. By requiring long commutes for early residents, the Project would further impair

11 air quality in already-degraded air basins, placing the Project in conflict with AVAP Air

12 9 Quality Goal COS 9 and Policies COS9.1, 9.2, and 9.3

13 176. The Project will not adequately protect residents from high fire danger or seismic

14 hazards inherent in developing a new city at the intersection of two active faults, and will

15 therefore be inconsistent with the AVAP Public Safety, Services, and Facilities Element.

16 177. The EIR's failure to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's inconsistencies

17 with these land use plans and policies violates CEQA.

18 178. Additionally, the EIR fails to analyze the project's significant and adverse impacts

19 on existing urban areas, especially given that the Project proponent's own market study

20 I predicted that the Project would draw demand away from existing towns.

21 j. Water Quality Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed.

22 179. The new Centennial Project city will generate urban runoff, water containing

23 dissolved solids, pesticides, fertilizers, oil, grease, heavy metals, bacteria, trash, nutrients, and

24 other pollutants known to harm water quality.

25 180. The EIR contains inconsistent information regarding the Project site's hydrology,
26 resulting in an inadequate disclosure of the Project's potential water quality impacts. For

27 example, the EIR states both that 55 percent of the site is in the Gorman Drainage Area and that

28 4 percent of the site drains into Gorman Creek.

Printed on Recycled Paper 24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 181. Pesticides and other residential chemicals adversely affect water quality and

2 species that rely on watercourses. Amphibian species including the California treefrog,
3 California toad, and black-bellied salamander are especially sensitive to water quality
4 disturbances. Yet the EIR does not disclose the riparian wildlife present in Gorman Creek, Oso

5 Creek, Quail Lake, or the Santa Clara River, watercourses into which the Project site ultimately

6 drains. As a result, the EIR does not disclose, analyze, or fully mitigate the Project's potential

7 water quality impacts on those or other watercourses.
182. Similarly, the EIR fails to analyze the potential impacts of commercial or

9 industrial chemicals associated with the Project, although the Project fails to ban harmful
10 chemicals from use.

11 183. The Project relies on Best Management Practices to mitigate undisclosed water

12 quality impacts, but fails to require any of these practices as enforceable mitigation measures.
13 184. The EIR claims that pesticide impacts will be reduced by the use of "integrated
14 pest management" techniques, but fails to explain what these techniques are or actually require
15 their use.

16 185. The Project will construct 28 onsite detention and retention basins. Such basins

17 may attract invasive bullfrogs, which outcompete and ultimately replace native populations.
18 Even so, the EIR fails to disclose, analyze, or mitigate the impacts of bullfrogs on existing
19 amphibian populations.

20 k. Air Quality Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed.
21 186. The U.S. government estimates that 10 to 12 percent of the country's total health
22 costs are attributable to air pollution. Air pollution adversely affects wildlife, plants, and
23 agricultural crops.

24 187. The adverse impacts of air pollution are felt most heavily by young children, the
25 elderly, pregnant women, people with existing heart and lung disease, and environmental
26 justice communities.

27 188. Southern California, and Los Angeles County, in particular, is one of the most
28 polluted regions in the country. Much of the pollution in Southern California is caused by

Printed on Recycled Paper 25 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I transportation. The South Coast Air Basin, San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, and Mojave Desert

2 Air Basins currently fail to satisfy health-based standards of the Clean Air Act.

3 189. Construction and operation of the Project will result in large air emissions.

4 However, the EIR fails to fully analyze how the Project's emissions will affect the San Joaquin,

5 South Coast, and Mojave Desert air it basins and whether it will prevent the state from meeting
6 California's State Implementation Plans.

7 190. Although unlikely, the EIR assumes that the Project's 23,675 employment

8 opportunities will be filled by Project residents. Thus, the EIR's air quality analysis is

9 understated by the emissions from trips made by residents who retain existing jobs when they

10 move to the Project and by residents forced to commute because the Project does not actually

11 require the implementation of job-creating land uses along with the construction of houses.

12 191. Even if the Project's optimistic employment numbers are met, the Project will

13 require 12,501 people to commute outside the Project to jobs located 35-65 miles away. The

14 emissions of each of these daily commutes contributes to regional air pollution.

15 192. The EIR contains mitigation for air quality impacts, but MM 11-4, 11-5, and 11-6

16 fail to address the pollution generated by external automobile trips.

17 193. The EIR fails to acknowledge that particulate matter generated by Project-related

18 trips, through wind and vehicle movement, will affect the San Joaquin Valley or Mojave Desert

19 air basins.

20 194. Air quality impacts are further underestimated because the EIR underestimates trip

21 lengths and overestimates trip capture within the Project.

22 195. Mitigation measures, including MM 11-4 and 11-6 are vague and unenforceable.

23 MM 11-5, pertaining to bicycle parking, is laudable, but it is unlikely that bicycles will become

24 a dominant form of transportation in a region with hilly topography and summer temperatures

25 that exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

26 196. The EIR fails to discuss or analyze feasible mitigation measures submitted by

27 Petitioners to the County. As CEQA requires the adoption of all feasible mitigation measures

28 for impacts found to be significant and unavoidable, the failure of the County to adopt these

Printed on Recycled Paper 26 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 measures violates CEQA.

2 I. Seismic Risks are Not Adequately Analyzed.

3 197. CEQA requires an analysis of a project's potential impacts to human beings,

4 including risks caused by active earthquake faults.

5 198. The Project site is located at the intersection of California's two largest faults: the

6 San Andreas and Garlock.

7 199. Despite this, the EIR claims that the Project's seismic risk is no higher than
8 anywhere else in Southern California.

9 200. According to probabilistic seismic hazard maps prepared by the United States
10 Geological Survey and the California Geological Survey, the Project site has the highest level
11 of earthquake hazard in the state.

12 201. The EIR analyzes earthquake risk for the center of the Project site instead of areas
13 of the site that would experience greater impacts and fails to incorporate seismic risks into the
14 siting of schools and hospitals.

15 202. Otherwise, the EIR fails to include mitigation for seismic risk at the Project site,
16 instead deferring to building codes.

17 203. The EIR further fails to evaluate risks associated with earthquake-triggered
18 landslides.

19 m. Water Supply Risks and Impacts are Not Adequately Analyzed.
20 204. The Project site is arid and devoid of local water supplies beyond groundwater.
21 205. Water Code section 10632(a)(2) requires a water shortage analysis to be based on
22 the driest three-year historic period for an agency's water supply.
23 206. Instead, the EIR relies on an outdated water shortage analysis that excludes the
24 2011-2017 drought.

25 207. An EIR must discuss the reliability of a project's water supply in the short term
26 and the long term, as well as the environmental impacts of procuring those water supplies.
27 208. The EIR also relies on 6,700 acre-feet of banked water, inflating the availability of
28 water in the long term.

Printed on Recycled Paper 27 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

209. The EIR's water supply analysis fails to take into account the impacts of climate

2 change and likely decreased rainfall and aqueduct deliveries in the future.
210. The EIR assumes that proper management of the Project's water bank will ensure

4 water availability in dry years. However, dry years that would require water bank water are not

5 guaranteed to follow extra wet years in which water could be banked.

6 211. The EIR also relies on availability of water in an overdrafted water basin that is
subject to adjudication. Excess supplies for the Project are speculative.
212. The EIR fails to analyze the environmental impacts of the Project's use of the

9 "Nickel water" or to analyze its reliability.

10 213. Additionally, the EIR fails to adopt concrete or enforceable water mitigation

11 measures.

12 214. The Project will have a significant impact on water supplies that is not adequately

13 disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated.

14 Reliance on the Tejon Ranch Conservancy to Implement Mitigation Violates CEQA.

15 215. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be feasible, effective, concrete and

16 enforceable.

17 216. "Feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a a

18 reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and
19 technological factors." (Public Resources Code § 21061.1.)

20 217. Project mitigation measures rely heavily on the Ranchwide Agreement and the

21 Tejon Ranch Conservancy. For example, the Conservancy will "adopt, update, monitor, and

22 enforce implementation of the Ranch-wide Management Plan…on dedicated conservation areas

23 and option areas subject to conservation, mitigation, and enhancement measures." The Project

24 also relies on the Conservancy to implement habitat enhancements and monitor pronghorn

25 populations. Similarly, the Ranchwide Agreement transfers long-term responsibility for

26 mitigation activities from Tejon Ranch Company to the Conservancy that include vegetation
27 planting and management, animal control for nonnative animals, condor feeding, signage,

28 nonnative plant control, and wetland and stream course restoration.

Printed on Recycled Paper 28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

218. However, the Tejon Ranch Conservancy is facing severe financial challenges that
2 may render it unable to function beyond 2021. The Conservancy's President and CEO resigned

3 on February 6, 2019, and the Conservancy will not be filling those positions or vacated positions

4 that include Conservation Communications Manager, Public Access Manager, or Stewardship

5 Manager. The Conservancy is currently operating with half of its normal staff and very limited

6 financial resources, if any.

7 219. Given that the Conservancy is underfunded and understaffed and that future of the

8 Conservancy itself is speculative, it is unclear how or if the mitigation measures prescribed in

9 the EIR and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program will be implemented. Mitigation
10 measures relying on the Ranchwide Agreement and the Tejon Ranch Conservancy, therefore,
11 are speculative and violate CEQA.

12 220. Accordingly, the Project's significant impacts on land use, biological resources,
13 and other impact areas that rely on the Ranchwide Agreement and Conservancy implementation
14 remain unmitigated in violation of CEQA.

15 The Project Description is Unstable.

16 221. An EIR's analysis of environmental impacts is based on the project description.
17 Accordingly, an "accurate, stable, and finite project description is the sine qua non of an
18 informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71
19 a Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) "However, a curtailed, enigmatic, or unstable project description draws a
20 red herring across the path of public input." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of
21 Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655.)

22 222. CEQA requires an EIR to analyze a project's reasonably foreseeable impacts,
23 including those of future improvements required to accommodate a project.
24 223. Without an accurate and complete project description, decisionmakers and the
25 public cannot fully understand a project's likely impacts on the environment.

26 224. The project description fails to include the full scope of the Project, contains
27 misleading statements, and is impermissibly vague. Accordingly, it fails to "adequately apprise
28 all interested parties of the true scope of the project," and approval of the Project was a

Printed on Recycled Paper 29 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

prejudicial abuse of discretion that violates CEQA. (City of Santee v. County of Sawn Diego

2 (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454-55.)
225. The Centennial Project's project description is insufficient in several respects,

4 including, but not limited to:

5 226. The EIR claims that widening of State Route 138, which bisects the Project site, is

6 not part of the Project, but would "anticipate[] and complement" the planned improvements.

7 However, the draft environmental review documents for proposed State Route 138

8 improvements are clear that State Route 138 would not need to be widened if not for the Project.

9 Thus, the widening of State Route 138 is a reasonably foreseeable impact of the Project and

10 should have been analyzed in the EIR.

11 227. The EIR claims that the Centennial Project is merely the implementation of the

12 Antelope Valley Area Plan (AVAP), adopted in 2015. However, the AVAP was clear that "any

13 master-planned community within the West EOA would require further planning activities."

14 Impacts of the Project cannot be ignored in reliance on past AVAP planning processes.
15 228. The EIR purports to analyze the environmental impacts of 19,333 dwelling units,
16 although accessory dwelling units (ADUs) will be permitted, potentially doubling the number of
17 units constructed in the Project. The EIR's failure to analyze the impacts of additional dwelling
18 units and a larger population based on a claim of "variations in household occupancy"
19 dramatically understates the Project's potential environmental impacts during both construction

20 and operation and violates CEQA.

21 229. The project description is unclear regarding whether grazing will be permitted in

22 areas designated as "open space." Grazing can adversely impact water courses and water

23 quality, as well as biological resources.

24 230. Importantly, the EIR does not clearly lay out when the Project's various

25 construction phases will occur. Instead, the EIR states that phases would be timed depending on
26 market demand, infrastructure timing, and the state of the economy.

27 231. As a result, the Project's calculations and commitments regarding traffic, air
28 pollution, and greenhouse gases are wholly speculative. For example, if phases of the Project

Printed on Recycled Paper 30 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that would provide commercial or industrial jobs are delayed, Project residents would be

2 required to continue 50-mile-long commutes, resulting in a dramatic understatement of the

3 Project's traffic and greenhouse gas emissions, and the failure to adequately mitigate those

4 significant environmental impacts.
232. The EIR contains unstable descriptions for land uses within the specific plan. For

6 example, "any rejected school site shall revert to residential land use." If land uses throughout

7 the Project are unstable, so are the EIR's projections for the environmental impacts attributable

8 to those land uses.

9 233. The EIR's Project description is also inconsistent with the Project described in and
10 permitted by the Development Agreement.
11 The EIR Improperly Segments/Piecemeals Analysis.

12 234. CEQA requires an EIR to analyze "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
13 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonable foreseeable
14 indirect physical change in the environment." (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible
15 Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222.)

16 235. The EIR claims that widening of State Route 138, which bisects the Project site, is

17 not part of the Project, but would "anticipate[] and complement" planned improvements to the
18 highway. Accordingly, the EIR fails to analyze the impacts of State Route 138 widening and
19 realignment. Yet, environmental review documents for proposed State Route 138 improvements
20 are clear that State Route 138 would not need to be widened if not for the Project.
21 236. This is impermissible segmentation in violation of CEQA.

22 The Alternatives Analysis Is Inadequate.

23 237. CEQA imposes upon the County a clear duty to consider a reasonable range of
24 alternatives that may satisfy most project objectives, including any feasible alternative which
25 could substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of the Project. Despite this
26 duty, the EIR rejects feasible alternatives and fails to consider potentially feasible alternatives
27 in detail.

28 238. The objectives governing the alternatives analysis include to "Implement the

Printed on Recycled Paper 31 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Antelope Valley Area Plan," which is unduly narrow and improperly constrains the
2 consideration of Project alternatives.

3 239. The EIR impermissibly rejected the No Project Alternative based on inconsistency
with the Antelope Valley Area Plan as if the Plan somehow mandates development.
240. The EIR rejects the Public Input Alternative, which would design wildlife

6 reserve and set aside the property as open space, for failing to include onsite natural open space.

7 This reasoning is nonsensical.

8 241. The EIR rejects Alternative B based on it being larger than the Project when it is

9 actually smaller.

10 242. The EIR rejects the Additional Drainage Avoidance Alternative, despite admitting

11 it would have fewer environmental impacts than the Project and meet the Project goals.

12 243. Similarly, the EIR fails to explain why the Density Clustering/East of Aqueduct

13 Alternative was not considered the preferred alternative because it also has fewer environmental
14 impacts than the Project and would meet project goals.

15 244. Under CEQA, "the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating
16 that, notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the

17 proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures."

18 (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.) This

19 did not happen here.

20 245. The EIR failed to analyze an alternative accommodating new development in

21 disturbed areas.

22 246. CEQA requires an alternatives analysis to formulate alternatives to a Project that

23 would substantially lessen or avoid a Project's significant impacts. One of the Project's

24 greatest impacts is the conversion of wild open space to residential development. However, the

25 EIR failed to consider alternatives with a significantly smaller footprint than the Project.

26 247. The Project cannot be approved if an alternative to the Project will reduce the
27 Project's significant impacts, and that alternative is feasible.

28 248. The EIR provides no evidence that a smaller project a would not be feasible.

Printed on Recycled Paper 32 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

249. Whether a project is economically infeasible "is not measured by the increased

2 cost or lost profit, but upon whether the effect of the proposed mitigation is such that the project
3 is rendered impractical." (Uphold Our Heritage v. Town of Woodside (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th

4 587, 600.)
250. The County's rejection of and its refusal to even consider feasible alternatives

6 render the EIR inadequate.

7 Inadequate Response to Comments Were Provided.

8 251. Under CEQA, the lead agency must provide written responses to comments

9 submitted during the EIR comment period. (Public Resources Code § 21092.5.) Responses

10 require good faith, reasoned analysis. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c).)

11 252. Objections to the lead agency's position must be "addressed in detail giving
12 reasons why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted." (CEQA Guidelines §
13 15088(c).

14 253. Instead of providing good faith responses, as required by CEQA, many of the
15 responses to comments were off-point and non-responsive.

16 254. Despite receiving thousands of comments, many of them providing alternatives
17 and suggesting mitigation for the environmental impacts of the Project, the FEIR included very

18 limited modifications.

19 The County Failed to Recirculate the EIR in Light of Significant New Information.

20 255. CEQA requires an EIR to be recirculated when significant new information

21 becomes available before certification.

22 256. Significant new information became available prior to the close of the
23 administrative process that was not included in the EIR, including, but not limited to: (1) the
24 news that the Conservancy is losing half its staff; (2) the court's requirement that approvals for
25 the Grapevine development be rescinded; (3) new information about threats to Southern

26 California mountain lions outlined in the December 2018 Gustafson study; and (4) the County's
27 acknowledgement in December 2018 of the "new normal" of destructive wildfires due in part to

28 "residential housing growth at the urban wild land interface which poses greater danger to

Printed on Recycled Paper 33 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 firefighters and to the residents who live in these extremely high fire severity zones."

3 257. This new information results in newly identified, significant environmental

4 impacts and an increase in the severity of already-identified significant environmental impacts
that required disclosure, analysis, and mitigation in the EIR before the Project could be lawfully
5 approved.

6

7 The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported by
Substantial Evidence.

8

9 258. CEQA permits project with significant adverse environmental impacts to be
approved if the lead agency makes findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the
10 project's benefits will outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation
11 measures or less damaging alternatives available.

12

13 259. The EIR admits the Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on air

14 quality, biological resources, climate change, conversion of agricultural land, noise, public

15 services, growth-inducement, traffic, visual resources, and water supply.

16 260. First, the County improperly rejected feasible alternatives, including alternatives

17 that would meet Project objectives, to reduce its many, many adverse impacts. Thus, this
finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
18

19 261. The County also rejected feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's
adverse impacts.

20

21 262. Second, the County's claims of Project benefits lack support. For example the

22 Statement of Overriding Considerations claims the Project will benefit the County by providing
orderly development in close proximity to jobs, but there is no guarantee that jobs will
23 materialize for the Project's estimated 57,000 residents who will commute 35-65 miles to
24

25 existing jobs in Los Angeles, the Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita, and Bakersfield. These

26 residents may also continue commuting to their existing jobs even if jobs are created at the
Project.

27

28 263. The Statement of Overriding Considerations is also based on the Project's
protection of natural resources and habitats for sensitive species. However, the Project will

Printed on Recycled Paper 34 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 convert thousands of acres of habitat currently available to sensitive species to residential uses
and expose thousands of additional acres to edge effects, noise, light, and invasive species.
3 Additionally, the lands "conserved" by the Project have already been conserved by past actions

4

5 and/or rely on funding and stewardship of the Tejon Ranch Conservancy, which is currently

6 understaffed and underfunded. The protection claimed in the Statement may not occur.

7 264. The Statement of Overriding Considerations touts net zero carbon electricity and

8 the promotion of renewable energy, but the Project's programs for achieving these goals are
vague, deferred, or voluntary.

9

10 265. Thus, the Statement of Overriding Considerations lacks substantial evidence, in
violation of CEQA.

11

12 The County Failed to Use its Independent Judgment in Approving the Project.

13 266. Prior to approving a project the lead agency shall certify that "[t]he final EIR

14 reflects the lead agency's independent judgment and analysis." (CEQA Guidelines § 15090
(a)(3).)
15

16 267. A lead agency "must use its independent judgment to consider the impacts of the

17 proposed project on the environment and on the public weal . . . . Although the decision of the

18 [lead agency] affects the project proponent, the preparation of the EIR may not be prepared

19 with that concern in mind." (Mission Oaks v. County of Santa Barbara (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th
713, 725.)

20

21 268. While the County Board of Supervisors has the authority to approve projects that

22 are in the best interest of County residents even when they may result in significant

23 environmental impacts, California law requires that such decisionmaking is the result of an

24 informed, unbiased, and transparent process. (See Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

25 Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)
269. Moreover, the Department is prohibited from having an interest "in producing
26 a[n][environmental impact report] that supports the applicant's proposal." (See Citizens for
27 Ceres v. Superior Court (2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 889, 918.)

28 270. In contrast, Real Party has an overridingand conflicting-interest "in having

Printed on Recycled Paper 35 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the agency produce a favorable EIR that will pass legal muster." (See id.) Here, the EIR for

2 Centennial was clearly designed to support the Proposed Project, as each and every
3 "alternative" analyzed in the EIR contains at least 19,000 dwelling units and a similarly

4 massive development footprint of at least 6,000 acres.

5 271. Likewise, the EIR and supporting materials contain clearly erroneous claims

6 promoted by the developer or its attorneys designed to downplay the Centennial Project's

7 enormous environmental impacts. For instance, the EIR's supporting materials erroneously

8 claim that the state's "cap-and-trade" will "cover" 96 percent of the Project's greenhouse gas

9 emissions.

10 272. Accordingly, in adopting Real Party's clearly erroneous positions and their

11 preferred alternatives, the County failed to exercise its independent judgment over the approval

12 of the Project.

13

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW)

16 (Government Code §65300 et. seq.)

17 273. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

18 274. A County's general plan is the "constitution' for future development" located at
19 the top of "the hierarchy of local government law regulating land use." (DeVita v. County of
20 Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773.) All land use approvals in the County must be consistent with

21 the General Plan.

22 275. Any project that obstructs implementation of the general plan's goals and policies

23 is inconsistent with the general plan and may not be lawfully approved. (Napa Citizens for

24 Honest Gov't v. County of Napa (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378; Families Unafraid to Uphold
25 Rural EL Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336.)

26 276. Land use decisions must be consistent with all applicable land use policies,

27 including the Los Angeles County General Plan and all of its elements. (Pfeiffer v. City of
28 Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1562-63.)

Printed on Recycled Paper 36 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

277. The County violated state planning and zoning law when it approved the Project

2 because the Project is incompatible with the General Plan and related development ordinances

3 because it does not meet their development standards and goals, examples of which are

4 described in the following paragraphs.

5 278. General Plan Policy LU 3 provides that development patterns in the County should

6 discourage suburban sprawl.

7 279. The Los Angeles County General Plan provides, "Jobs-housing balance is reached

8 by working toward increasing opportunities for people to work and live in close proximity, and
9 reduce long commutes that are costly both economically and environmentally."
10 280. Instead, the Project would site thousands of people dozens of miles from
11 employment opportunities.

12 281. The General Plan also discourages suburban sprawl because it contributes to

13 "traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions." The Project will
14 disproportionately add to all of these harms, rendering it inconsistent with General Plan LU 3.
15 282. The Antelope Valley Area Plan (AVAP), adopted in June 2015, governs land use
16 in the Project area.

17 283. The Project is inconsistent with various portions of the adopted AVAP's Land Use
18 Element, including, but not limited to:

19 284. Goal LU 2 requires land use patterns that protect environmental resources.
20 However, the Project will be built on land that was, until recently, designated by the County as
21 a significant ecological area.

22 285. The Project site is sited in an area prone to natural hazards and is, therefore,
23 inconsistent with Goal LU 3 and Policies LU 3.1 and 3.5.

24 286. The Project is inconsistent with Goal LU 5, which requires that land use patterns
25 decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will disproportionately add to the region's
26 greenhouse gas emissions by siting residents far from existing employment, schools, and city
27 centers.

28 287. Policy LU 5.1 requires consistency with the Sustainable Communities Strategy

Printed on Recycled Paper 37 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

required by SB 375. However, the Project would exceed the Southern California Association of

2 Government's population projections in the 2016-2040 Regional Transportation

3 Plan/Sustainable Communities Strategy. The Project's location far from employment centers is

4 also the antithesis of any sustainable community.
288. By not assuredly providing local employment opportunities, the Project is
6 inconsistent with Policies LU 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4

7 289. Policy LU 5.3 requires preservation of open space areas, but the Project will

8 reduce existing open space by approximately 6,000 acres.
290. Since the Project will not require any land use patterns that promote alternatives to
10 the automobile, the Project is inconsistent with the AVAP Mobility element, in particular, Goal

11 M1, Policy M1.1, goal M2, Policy M2.2, Policy M2.3, and Policy M2.4

12 291. The Project fails to identify sustainable water resources, and is therefore

13 inconsistent with the AVAP's water resources policies and Policies COS1.1 and COS 2.1 of the

14 AVAP Conservation Element.

15 292. By requiring long commutes for early residents, the Project would further impair

16 air quality in already-degraded air basins, placing the Project in conflict with AVAP Air
17 9 Quality Goal COS 9 and Policies COS9.1, 9.2, and 9.3

18 293. The Project will not adequately protect residents from very high fire danger or

19 seismic hazards inherent in developing a new city at the intersection of two active faults, and

20 will therefore be inconsistent with the AVAP Public Safety, Services, and Facilities Element.

21

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent has violated its duties under law,

24 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters

25 complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the certification of the

26 EIR and the approval of the Project must be set aside.

27 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

28 1. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondent:

Re: Challenge to the approval of the EIR for the Tejon Ranch
