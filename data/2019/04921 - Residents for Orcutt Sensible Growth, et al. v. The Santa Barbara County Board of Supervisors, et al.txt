20 THE MINSON COMPANY,

21 Real Party in Interest.

22

23 Petitioners, Residents for Orcutt Sensible Growth, and Gina Lord-Garland (collectively "Petitioners"), alleges as follows:
24

25 1. This action challenges the November 19, 2019 decision of the Santa Barbara

26 County Board of Supervisors (the "Board of Supervisors"), which evaluated the recommendation

27 by the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission (the "Planning Commission," collectively,

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

1 with the Board of Supervisors, "Respondents"), to approve a request by The Minson Company,

2 the project owner, for approval of a Tentative Parcel Map, a Development Plan, two (2)

3 Conditional Use Permits and an Overall Sign Plan (the "Project Approvals") for the development

4 of a new retail commercial center (the "Orcutt Gateway Retail Commercial Center"), located on

5 a 5.95 gross acre portion of land commonly known as key site 2 ("Key Site 2") in the Orcutt

6 Community Plan ("OCP") area. The Board of Supervisors approved the request by The Minson
Company also based upon a previously certified Final Environmental Impact Report (*Final 7 EIR") which was certified on July 22, 1997, a 22-year old document, and an Addendum to the
8 Final EIR, dated July 15, 2019. Further details on Key Site 2 are provided hereinbelow.
9

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 2. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

12 ("CCP") §§ 1087, 526, 1085, and 1094.5, and California Public Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21168

13 and 21168.5. This Court also has the authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the Board of

14 Supervisors to vacate and set aside the Project Approvals for the Project under the CCP §§ 1085

15 and 1094.5. Venue for this action properly lies in the Santa Barbara County Superior Court,
because Respondents and the Project are located in Santa Barbara County.
16 3. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of residents who rent and own property
17 and around Orcutt, who are adversely affected by this Project approval, and who are beneficially
18 interested in the quality of life in Orcutt through responsible construction project planning and
19 development.

20 4. Petitioner is beneficially and directly interested in the actions of the Board of

21 Supervisors and the Planning Commission in approving the Project, which would directly,

22 adversely and irreparably affect Petitioner, the environment, and the larger community of Orcutt,

23 as described herein.

THE PARTIES 24

25 5. Petitioner is an unincorporated association of individuals who will be adversely
26 affected by the traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other impacts
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

- 2

generated by the Project. Petitioner includes individuals and their families, who live and work in

2 the community of Orcutt. Because they are local residents, the individual members of Petitioner

3 would be directly affected by the traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise, and

4 other environmental impacts created by the Project. In addition, individual members may also

5 work on the Project itself. As such, they would be first in line to be exposed to any health and
safety hazards that exist on the Project site. 6
6. Individual Petitioner, Gina Lord-Garland lives and works in the immediate Orcutt
7 community and will be adversely affected by the traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water
8 quality, noise and other impacts generated by the Project.
7. Respondents, the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors, are each a
10 local government agency and a political subdivision of the State of California, charged with
11 the authority to regulate and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all

12 times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws,

13 including the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and Public Resources Code

14 ("PRC") § 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 of the California Code of

15 Regulations, § 15000, et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). The Planning Commission is the Lead
Agency under CEQA for the preparation of required environmental review of the Project. The 16 Board of Supervisors is the legislative body for the County of Santa Barbara, and, thus, has the
17 authority to legislate land use and policy, including changes thereto, within its jurisdiction. As
18 the legislative body for the County of Santa Barbara, the Board of Supervisors is ultimately
19 responsible for the approval of the Project.

20 8. Real party in interest, The Minson Company ("Applicant," "Developer," or "Real

21 Party") is the applicant for the entitlements that constitute the Project. Based on the

22 Applicant's status as the sole identified applicant and developer of the Project, and on

23 Petitioner's information and belief, Applicant adequately represents the interests of any and all

24 other non-joined parties in the Project.

25 9. Asa result of the objections posed by its constituent members, and others
Petitioner has exhausted, or is excused from exhausting, all of its administrative remedies, and
26 now seeks the assistance of the Court to resolve the issues set forth herein pursuant to PRC
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

1 21177(a).

2 10. Moreover, as a result of the actions of Respondents as hereinbefore alleged,

3 Petitioner has been compelled to engage attorneys to challenge the ultra vires actions of

4 Respondents and to advance costs in connection therewith. Petitioner will accordingly seek the

5 recovery of attorneys' fees and costs upon the successful conclusion of this case.

6 STATEMENT OF FACTS

7 Proiect Background: Environmental Review and Approval

8
11. Prior to the adoption of the OCP, the County prepared, considered, and certified the
9 OCP Final Environmental Impact Report (entitled OCP EIR, 95-EIR-01), which had been
10 certified on July 22, 1997 (the antiquated "Final EIR"). The future development of
11 approximately 283,500 sq. ft. of commercial development across Key Site 1, Key Site 2 and Key
12 Site 3 (as each are defined in the OCP) was reviewed under CEQA as part of the antiquated Final

13 EIR. The antiquated Final EIR provided site specific analysis of the Project's land use and

14 zoning designation, as well as a cumulative impact analysis of build-out of the OCP. The

15 County prepared, considered and certified an Addendum to the Final EIR, dated July 15, 2019.

16 12. The improvements planned for the Project at Key Site 2 are the subject of this

17 litigation because Key Site 1 and Key Site 3 have neither been approved nor reviewed
environmentally in the last 2 decades. Access to the Key Site 2 would be provided from three (3) 18 new driveways from Clark Avenue. Improvements to Clark Avenue would include a new
19 signalized intersection at Clark Avenue to align with the future access road into the very
20 extensive Key Site-1 to the north. The existing roadway into Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park,
21 which is situated directly behind Key Site 2, and which would be the most heavily affected area

22 by the development of Key Site 2, would be retained and limited to right-turns in/out only. The

23 Project includes 184 parking spaces (including 10 handicap accessible spaces), and 10 parking

24 spaces for bicycles. A public multipurpose trail located within the 35-foot wide landscaped

25 buffer is proposed along Clark Avenue. The Project includes approximately 65,085 sq. ft. of new

26 landscaping including perimeter landscaping, landscaped medians, and a 35-ft. wide landscaped
buffer averaged along Clark Avenue. The Project also includes the installation of an 8-ft. tall 27

1 block wall along the rear property line abutting the Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park. The Project

2 land is currently vacant, but grading is occurring on the property in preparation for construction

3 of the Project, despite Petitioner's oral and written objections, and despite this Petition.

4 13. The Owner's Project Approval requests are embodied within the following Planning

5 Commission Case Numbers (collectively, the "Cases"):
a) Case No. 16TPM-00000-00001 (application filed on August 12, 2016) for 6
approval of a Tentative Parcel Map in compliance with County Code Chapter 21 to subdivide 7 5.95 gross acres into 4 lots of 2.27 gross acres (proposed parcel 1), 0.79 gross acres (proposed
8 parcel 2), 1.47 gross acres (proposed parcel 3), and 1.42 gross acres (proposed parcel 4);
9 b) Case No. 16DVP-00000-00009 (application filed on August 12, 2016) for
10 approval of a Final Development Plan in compliance with Section 35.82.080 of the County Land
11 Use and Development Code (LUDC), on property zoned C-2, to develop a new retail commercial

12 center of 42,921 square feet;

13 c Case No. 16CUP-00000-000017 (application filed on August 12, 2016) for a

14 Conditional Use Permit to allow for a drive-through fast food restaurant on proposed parcel 2 in

15 compliance with Section 35.82.060 of the LUDC, on property zoned C-2;
d) Case No. 16CUP-00000-00018 (application filed on August 12, 2016) for a Minon 16 Conditional Use Permit to allow for a mechanical carwash on proposed parcel 4 in compliance
17 with Section 35.82.060 of the LUDC, on property zoned C-2;
18 e Case No. 160SP-00000-00002 (application filed on August 12, 2016) for
19 approval of an Overall Sign Plan in compliance with Section 35.82.150 of the LUDC, on

20 property zoned C-2; and

21 f) to accept the addendum to the antiquated Final EIR (*Addendum").

22 14. After considering the Addendum together with the Final EIR, the Board of

23 Supervisors determined that no subsequent EIR would be prepared for this Project. The Board of

24 Supervisors then issued the Project Approvals, which in turn approved the development of Key
Site 2.
25 15. The Final EIR identified significant effects on the environment in the following
26

27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

5

I categories: Geology/Soils/Flooding, Water Resources, Traffic/Circulation, Noise, Air Quality,

2 Wastewater, Fire Protection, Solid Waste. and Visual Resources/Open Space. At the November

3 19th hearing, the Board of Supervisors found there were no new significant environmental

4 impacts as a result of this Project. The decision of the Board of Supervisors presumes to allow

5 the developer to construct the Project on Key Site 2, and operates in stark contravention of
CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
6
16. The significant impacts the Project would cause include traffic, air quality, soil 7 quality, ground water quality, and noise effects on the environment. The impacts, which
8 Respondents have seemingly ignored, would effect a terrible nuisance for the surrounding
9 residential neighborhoods, resulting in serious health, safety and other issues. Importantly, the
10 Project overlooks the 101 freeway. Any construction of a commercial development, including

11 12-pump gas station, along the 101 freeway will necessarily increase traffic in the local area. The

12 influx of commercial traffic at the planned commercial development and accompanying gas

13 station will sharply clash with the residential neighborhoods that are in very close proximity to

14 the Project.

15 17. Moreover, the cumulative impacts that the Project creates, and that will be increased
by the further development of Key Site 1 and Key Site 3, 1 will drastically and adversely affect the 16 quality of life for existing residents. The Project Approvals dismissed the Project's impacts on
17 traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other issues in a cursory fashion
18 based upon flawed and grossly outdated information that was not supported by substantial
19 evidence. Petitioners request that this Court vacate and set aside the Project Approvals and

20 compel Respondents to undertake a reasonably appropriate environmental review that they

21 should have been done under CEQA.

22

23 18. The Planning Commission prepared an agenda report for the City Manager in

24 advance of the regularly scheduled August 14, 2019 Planning Commission meeting wherein the
Planning Commission recommended approval of the Project Approvals (the "Report"). The 25 Report failed reasonably and/or adequately to consider the impact of the traffic, air quality, soil
26 quality, ground water quality, noise and other impacts to the community, both during
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (S 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

1 construction, and after the Project is built. The failure to consider these environmental issues

2 renders the Report ineffective as an adequate informational environmental document. The traffic,

3 air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise, and other environmental impacts foreseeably

4 to be caused by the Project are significant and unavoidable. The Report, accordingly, lacks

5 substantial evidence to support its conclusions and fails to properly mitigate the Project's
significant environmental impacts. 6
19. In addition to the issues presented above, Petitioners noted in their Public Comments,
7 the Report does not properly assess the significance of Project-level greenhouse gas ("GHG")
8 impacts under CEQA and does not adequately address how specific mitigation strategies might
9 be implemented at the Project level. Respondents' adoption of the Report was arbitrary and was
10 not supported by substantial evidence.

11 20. On October 14, 2019, and, separately, on October 15, 2019, Petitioner submitted

12 written comments on the Report which pointed to the Report's inadequate analysis of the

13 Project's traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and other environmental

14 impacts and charged that the Respondents failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce

15 these construction and Project related environmental impacts. The proximity of the Project to
residential neighborhoods, the planned construction of a 12-pump gasoline fueling station with 16 canopy and related equipment (i.e., the installation of several underground storage tanks) all 17 combine to create negative impacts on the community that must be fully analyzed.
18 21. Moreover, irregularities occurred at the Board of Supervisors' public hearing to
19 consider the Project. Firstly, the hearing was held at 9:00 a.m., on Tuesday, November 19th - right
20 at the start of a workday. For this reason, many of the members of Petitioner, who wanted to

21 attend the hearing and speak about the Project, could not attend. The effect was that concerned

22 citizens, including members of Petitioner, were unable to be heard. Furthermore, the meeting was

23 held at a satellite office, in Santa Maria, rather than the main office of the Board of Supervisors,

24 in Santa Barbara, a fact that was noticed to the public a scant few days before the hearing.
Fortunately, Santa Barbara's government has video conference capability such that Counsel for 25 Petitioner was able to attend the hearing while being physically present at the Board of
26

27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

I Supervisors, in Santa Barbara. After the public hearing, the Board of Supervisors implemented

2 the Project Approvals by a 5 to 0 vote.

3 22. Petitioner has served on Respondents and the Real Party of Interest a Notice of

4 Petitioner's Intent to file this CEQA Petition. Proof of Service of this notification, with the

5 notification, is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and is made a part hereof.
23. Petitioner has requested that the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors each 6
prepare their respective portion of the record of proceedings in the above-captioned proceeding
7 and that they employ alternative methods of record preparation as appropriate pursuant to PRC
8 21167.6(b)(2) in order to save costs. A true and correct copy of Petitioner's request is attached
9 hereto as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this reference.
10

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Respondents Did Not Consider All Feasible Mitigation

13 Measures)

14 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
15 25. Under CEQA, the Board of Supervisors cannot approve the Project as proposed

16 because there are feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen one or

17 more of the Project's significant environmental effects. PRC § 21002. For example, on

18 information and belief, the Developer failed to consider alternative sites that might be better

19 suited for the development. There are any number of alternative sites that might have been

20 chosen, none of which would pose the detrimental impacts to the surrounding residential
communities as are posed by the current chosen site. The Respondents must consider reasonable 21 mitigation measures to address the environmental impacts clearly identified herein in an
22 environmental review that should be directed by this Court. See CEQA Guidelines $15088.
23 26. The antiquated Final EIR, as amended by the Addendum, fails to adequately
24 consider several types of significant adverse environmental impacts to local residents, including

25 traffic and circulation, air quality and GHG emissions as well as noise and safety issues.

26 Petitioner commissioned a traffic report by KOA that studied the potential effects of the planned

27 construction at Key Site 1, Key Site 2 and Key Site 3, respectively (*Traffic Report"), and

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (S 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE $ 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

8

1 submitted that Traffic Report to the Board of Supervisors as part of its comments on the Project.

2 As noted, above, the three (3) Key Sites represent an enormous amount of development being

3 contemplated over time. However, only Key Site 2 has been currently approved. This

4 augmented, piecemeal approval of the Key Sites, expressly disfavored by CEQA, will create

5 cumulative negative impacts on the environment, including GHG emissions, traffic, air quality,
soil quality, ground water quality, and noise effects on the environment. These negative impacts 6
a will have a significant effect upon the surrounding residential community, which will increase
7 over time if the Project Approvals are not set aside, and if Key Site 1 and Key Site 3 are
8 subsequently approved as planned.
9 27. Further to Petitioner's impending traffic woes, the morning, afternoon and other
10 peak-hour commute times will be permanently greatly increased throughout the area if the
11 Project is developed as currently approved (particularly if the densely packed Key Site 1 is

12 eventually approved). As noted earlier, Key Site 2 is located directly adjacent to the Sunny Hills

13 Mobile Home Park, which will be seriously negatively impacted by the development in several

14 ways. Firstly, prior to construction, during construction, and for an unknown period of time

15 thereafter, Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park residents will be forced to make right turns only out
of their mobile home park to and from Clark Avenue. This will make ingress and egress to and 16 from the property onerous by creating situation where residents who are coming from the
17 direction of the 101 freeway will be forced to drive several blocks out of their way to make a U-
18 turn to get back to Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park. The need to make a U-turn in traffic
19 increases the risk that a major traffic accident will occur. The more often residents make that U-

20 turn, the greater the probability that major accident will occur.

21 28. There is no indication that any precautions have been made by the Developer to

22 protect area residents from property damage and injury that may result from this unwelcome

23 change to their ingress and egress, and during general travel throughout the area, because of the

24 extended presence of large construction vehicles in the area that are moving massive amounts of
earth and rock. As previously stated, there is no indication of when this change to the residents' 25 ingress, egress and general travel access will be made. More importantly, as noted above, there is
26 no indication of how long this situation will persist.
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE 6 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

29. Petitioner noted earlier that Key Site 2 is located across Clark Avenue from Key Site

2 1. The two sites are eventually supposed to be connected via a private driveway. However, at this

3 time, the two site plans show the driveways not matching up. Residents in the area are being told

4 to just "trust" that the situation will be rectified without causing even further congestion and

5 uncertainty in the area. Indeed, the Developer of Key Site 2 is only responsible for making

6 improvements to the yellow line in the center of Clark Avenue. The developer of Key Site
(whoever that may eventually be) will be responsible for making the improvements from the 7 yellow line in the center of Clark Avenue to the edge of Key Site 1. There is no indication that
8 Clark Avenue will be safe and fully navigable during the span of these two developments, or that
9 a dangerous situation will not occur due to the staggered improvement schedule along Clark
10 Avenue.

11 30. The plans for Key Site 1 adversely impact Petitioner and the public because this

12 multi-use complex is slated to include a very densely packed residential area. Key Site 1 is in 1

13 early phases of public review and hasn't been presented to the public for comments yet. This

14 planned use will create the most densely packed residential/commercial area of Orcutt.

15 Traffic patterns and commute times in the area will be dramatically negatively impacted.
31. The fact that Key Site 1 and Key Site 2 are in such different stages of entitlement 16 approval adversely impacts Petitioner and the public. The permitting process has been rushed
17 and segmented. The public's concerns regarding the planning and entitlements process has not
18 been properly taken into account.
19 32. As noted, above, Key Site 2 is located directly adjacent to the Sunny Hills Mobile

20 Home Park. Many of the residents there are older and/or are otherwise considered to be sensitivel

21 receptors. The dust, soot, exhaust, fumes and other particulate matter that will necessarily

22 increase due to large construction vehicles, and further due to permanently increased traffic in

23 the area, will create negative health impacts on the residents of Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park,

24 and other area residents, who are sensitive receptors.
33. Additionally, while it is admirable that the County and the Developer sought to 25 reduce noise and traffic from the loading dock of the building to be erected, the choice to
26 approve a 15-foot reduction of the required 25-foot rear yard setback to just 10 feet is not
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

- 10

1 justified. Several problems are created by this reduction in space.

2 34. The presence of a building that is taller than the homes in Sunny Hills Mobile Home

3 Park will block sunlight and airflow, which may increase the residents' cost of utilities and will

4 potentially worsen the effects on them of the increased pollution in the area.

5 35. The area's air quality is certain to be adversely impacted by the planned
construction, which between Key Site 2, and the later construction of Key Site 1 and Key Site 3, 6
will create adverse impacts for area residents for an unknown period of time (of at least 2 to 3
7 years given the size of the development projects). Sensitive receptors may experience prolonged
8 and significant impacts to their health.
9 36. These negative health effects on area residents will be exacerbated by the
10 construction of a 12-pump gas station as part of Key Site 2. Not only will this increase poor air
11 quality and soil contamination during construction, but nearby residents will be permanently

12 adversely impacted by known carcinogens that will be pumped into underground tanks, as well

13 as exhaust and fumes created by cars (many of which will belong to non-residents of Orcutt)

14 using the gas station. This may adversely affect the water table in addition to the health of nearby
residents.
15 37. Additionally, detergents, waxes and other chemicals used by the car wash will be 16 rinsed away, and may flow into the ground, eventually reaching the water table. This will have
17 deleterious effects on nearby residents.
18 38. Although the findings of the Santa Barbara County Planning Commission stated that
19 no cars will be able to drive behind the building to be erected adjacent to the Sunny Hills Mobile

20 Home Park, of Key Site 2, no provisions have been made to ensure that no one can walk back

21 there undetected. This creates an opportunity for a homeless enclave to develop, and additional

22 opportunities for criminal activities, like drug use, prostitution, gang violence and other nefarious

23 activities to occur.

24 39. The proximity of homes just over the fence in the Sunny Hills Mobile Home Park
presents an opportunity for criminals to victimize these residents under cover of a building that 25 shields such criminals from the eyes of security and the police.
26 40. The significant issues raised, above, and the failure of the Santa Barbara County
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

- 11

Planning Commission (Planning Commission) to comprehensively consider the issues presented

2 by Key Site 1 and Key Site 2, and public concerns in relation to these issues, require the Santa

3 Barbara County Board of Supervisors to set aside the Project Approvals and to reopen the matter

4 for further environmental review.

5 41. As demonstrated above, the Report fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate

6 the Project's environmental impacts, resulting in a legally deficient environmental review. The
Respondents must prepare new a full EIR, that addresses these inadequacies and must circulate
7 the EIR for public review to consider these critical issues.
8

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Project Fails to Conform to State and Regional Air Quality,
11 Transportation and Traffic, and Anti-Urban Sprawl Laws and Regulations

12
42. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
13 43. Local construction projects have regional impacts, and cumulative regional impacts
14 affect the entire State of California. Since the County of Santa Barbara adopted and certified the
15 Antiquated Final EIR, the State of California and the Santa Barbara County Association of
16 Governments ("SBCAG"') have enacted legislation and policies that require local governments to

17 dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adopt a forecasted development pattern for

18 the region which integrates transportation networks and other transportation measures and

19 policies in order to achieve these emission reductions. Furthermore, the State of California and

20 SBCAG have adopted policies to reduce urban sprawl and create walkable communities through

21 their planning authorities.
44. The Project, which is situated within one of California's last pristine coastal
22 communities, does not enhance the Orcutt community in the manner of making Orcutt walkable
23 or reducing GHGs. Indeed, as noted earlier, this community is situated along the 101 Freeway.
24 Developing a dense commercial retail center on this site will necessarily impact the local
25 community's traffic patterns, air quality and noise levels. It is a well-known fact that 101

26 freeway is currently being expanded in the area of Santa Barbara. Some Santa Barbara residents

27 feel the expansion is creating more harm than good to the local community. Commute times, air

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

. 12

1 pollution, and noise have all increased dramatically in recent years, with no end in sight. If the

2 Project Approvals are allowed to stand, and if Key Site 2 is allowed to be developed as planned,

3 Orcutt will be the next local Santa Barbara County community to crowd out its own residents

4 and inundate them with negative environmental impacts.

5 45. SBCAG is one of a number of regional government agencies that analyzed the
regional usage of automobiles. Specifically, they analyze where residents start their commute, 6 their destination and their purpose in traveling. The goal is to reduce the amount of automotive 7 usage. Despite the fact that the studies are conducted regionally, this is a statewide effort. By
8 implementing the Project Approvals, Orcutt is not contributing to the GHG reduction, or traffic
9 commute reduction as California's cities are required to do in contravention to the goals of the
10 SBCAG.

11 46. Respondents' Project Approvals are based on the 22-year-old Final EIR, are which is

12 highly problematic. When the Final EIR was generated in the 1990s, the GHG emission review

13 requirement simply didn't exist. The Addendum to the Final EIR didn't sufficiently deal with

14 new GHG and renewable energy requirements that have been set by the State of California, and
that have increased in
15 recent years. Petitioner's Traffic Report speaks to these issues. The Board
of Supervisors summarily dismissed the Traffic Report, without sufficiently reviewing it, and set 16 forth the Project Approvals.
17 47. If the Project Approvals are allowed to stand, and if the other Key Sites are then
18 approved, the cumulative impact of these approvals will adversely effect Orcutt, and its
19 residents. These approvals do not accomplish what the State wants, nor do they accomplish the

20 goals of the SBCAG, namely, to end the era of urban sprawl and to create walkable communities

21 in heart of California's central coast.

22 48. The CEQA Guidelines provide insight into the use of EIRs that were crafted before

23 laws are changed in a local area. CA PRC § 21083.3 provides that "if a parcel has been zoned to

24 accommodate a particular density of development or has been designated in a community plan to

25 accommodate a particular density of development and an [EIR] was certified for that zoning or
planning action, the application of [CEQA] to the approval of any subdivision map or other
26 project that is consistent with the zoning or community plan shall be limited to effects upon the
27

. 13

environment which are peculiar to the parcel or to the project and which were not addressed as

2 significant effects in the prior [EIR], or which substantial new information shows will be more

3 significant than described in the prior [EIR]."

4 49. The inclusion of a 12-pump gasoline fueling station at Key Site

5 2 is peculiar to the Project and this impact was not adequately addressed as significant effects in

6 the Final EIR, or in the Addendum. Moreover, Petitioners' traffic study inter alia constitutes new
information that demonstrates the effects created by the development of Key Site 2 will be more 7 significant than described in the Final EIR.
8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
9
(CEQA VIOLATION; Findings Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence 10

11 50. On or about August 14, 2019, the Planning Commission issued a report ("Report")

12 wherein they served and filed certain findings, in Attachment A to the Report, that previous
environmental document can be used § per CEQA § 15162 as the environmental review for the
13 Project (the "Findings").
14 51. The Findings are deficient in that they are not supported by substantial evidence. For
15 example, the Planning Commission found that the Project changes described in the Addendum
16 are only minor technical changes or additions. Due to the Finding of a lack of changes to the

17 Project, the Planning Commission found, and the Project Approvals definitively forestall major

18 revisions to the Final EIR as required by CEQA Guidelines § 15162(a)(1),(2),(3), which states as

19 follows:

20 52. CEQA Guidelines § 15162(a)(3)(A) mandates further environmental

21 review of Key Site 2 because the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken
have significantly changed since the Final EIR was drafted. New information of
22 substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the
23 exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the Final EIR was certified as complete,
24 and as amended by the Addendum, shows the Project will have one (1) or more
25 significant effects not discussed in the Final EIR, as amended by the Addendum.

26 53. Specifically, as noted, above, California's greenhouse gas emissions

27 reduction laws did not exist when the antiquated Final EIR was drafted. Neither the

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

- 14

Final EIR nor the later adopted Addendum consider either the greenhouse gas

2 emissions reduction laws or the goals of the SBCAG to end the era of urban sprawl and

3 to create walkable communities in heart of California's Central Coast. The Final EIR is

4 an old document that does not consider current issues in Orcutt, California's central

5 coast, or the State of California, and for this reason, these documents are inadequate as

6 an environmental review. Additionally, the Addendum to the Antiquated Final EIR,
dated July 15, 2019, did not adequately update the Final EIR, nor adequately address 7 these issues either. This Court must set aside the Project Approvals and order
8 Respondents to conduct a fulsome environmental review that includes public input to
the process.

10 54. For example, Petitioner's Traffic Report speaks directly to many of
11 these issues, but the Traffic Report was dismissed out of hand by the Board of

12 Supervisors in favor of the Project Approvals. This lack of consideration for, and

13 compliance with, State and regional planning goals, oversight and regulations is serious

14 and renders the Final EIR, and its Addendum, inadequate as an environmental review

15 for the Project. Thus, the Respondents' reliance on CEQA Guidelines § 15162(a) in
determining that no further environmental review is necessary was in error. Petitioner
16 asserts that the Project must be considered in light of California's, and the central
17 coast's, visions for our future as required by the State's greenhouse gas emissions
18 reductions laws, and SBCAG's policies to eliminate urban sprawl, and that a fulsome
19 environmental review be conducted on the Project that considers these important issues.

20 55. The Planning Commission's Findings state that, "except to the extent

21 that site-specific impacts are analyzed for the Key Sites in Volume II of the [Final]

22 EIR, the environmental review performed on the [OCP] was done at a program level [in

23 that it analyzed environmental impacts potentially generated by the future development

24 of 45 Key Sites] and is not intended to suffice for project-specific review," including a
review of Key Site 2. Thus, Respondents' reliance on the Final EIR, as amended by the
25 Addendum in determining that no further environmental review shall be undertaken, is
26 problematic at best.
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

15

56. Furthermore, by the Planning Commission's own admission in the

2 Addendum, the programmatic antiquated Final EIR is an insufficient environmental
document to determine the Key Site-specific adverse impacts at Key Site 2. Instead, the

4 Addendum provides a blanket statement, on Page 3, that, "There have been no

5 substantial unanticipated changes to the proposed [P]roject, the [P]roject site, or

6 circumstances surrounding the [P]roject that would require further environmental
analysis." Petitioner asserts that (as set forth, above) such is not the case, and, for this 7 reason, Respondents erred in relying on the antiquated Final EIR, as amended by the
8 Addendum, in determining that no further environmental review is necessary.
57. The Planning Commission's Findings state, on Page 2, that the Board of
10 Supervisors found the adverse impacts identified in the antiquated Final EIR as
11 significant have been "mitigated to the maximum extent feasible, and to the extent

12 these impacts remain significant and unavoidable after implementation of mitigation

13 measures, such impacts are acceptable when weighed against the overriding social,

14 economic and other considerations set forth in the Statement of Overriding

15 Considerations as adopted by the Board of Supervisors for the Orcutt Community
Plan.3
16 58. In determining that no substantial changes have occurred with respect to
17 the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken, the Report found there is no
18 new information of substantial importance. As noted above, Petitioner strongly
19 disagrees.

20 59. Further to the deficiencies relied upon by Respondents, the Statement of

21 Overriding Considerations, drafted by the Planning Commission as of July 22, 1997, is

22 deficient in the following particulars. Firstly, this document was also drafted prior to

23 the creation of California's greenhouse gas emissions reduction laws and SBCAG's

24 anti-urban sprawl policies. For this reason, the Respondents' reliance on the Statement
of Overriding Considerations constitutes an insufficient environmental review of the
25 Project. Secondly, the Statement of Overriding Considerations expressly admits that
26 Orcutt has competing interests, involving numerous, and sometimes competing, social,
27

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CCP § 1094.5 (§ 1085); PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE § 21000 ET SEQ. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

16

1 land use, public service, and environmental factors. The Orcutt Community Plan has

2 been developed in consideration of the community's circumstances, needs, and desires,

3 including, but not limited to, competing factors regarding "providing for population

4 growth, providing housing for all residents, encouraging economic development and

5 provision of jobs, ensuring availability of public services, providing environmental

6 resource and open space protection, and mitigating environmental impacts as identified
in [the Final EIR]." While these are important factors for a community's development,
7 Petitioner posits that the Respondents improperly issued the Project Approvals at the
8 expense of providing environmental resource, open space protection, and mitigating
9 impacts as identified in the Final EIR. Finally, the components of an EIR have changed
10 since 1997, nullifying the usefulness of the Final EIR which was erroneously relied

11 upon in adopting the Findings.

12

13 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Inadequate Response to Comments)

15 60. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
above.
16
61. Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments submitted by Petitioner,
17 and by other members of the public. Instead, the responses given to numerous comments
18 regarding the Project's impacts to, traffic, air quality, soil quality, ground water quality, noise and
19 other issues regarding the adequacy of the Report's treatment of mitigation measures and
20 alternatives are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-responsive and contrary to the

21 requirements of CEQA.

22 62. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed

23 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover,

24 Respondents' finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by
substantial evidence.
