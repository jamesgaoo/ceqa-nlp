2 11. The Project at issue is described by the City as follows: "Demolition of two

3 single-family dwellings, and the construction, use and maintenance of a three-story, 4,816
square-foot, four-unit, residential building within Subarea A (Neighborhood Conservation) of the

5 Vermont/Western Station Neighborhood Area Plan (*SNAP').

6 12. The Letter of Determination issued by the City states the following: "The subject

7 property consists of a rectangular lot with a 50-foot frontage along the northerly side of Russell
8 Avenue between Rodney Drive and Hillhurst Avenue, and a uniform depth of approximately 135

9 feet for a total lot size of 6,749.9 square feet. The project site is located within the Hollywood

18 unit within private garages and one uncovered guest parking space located in the rear. A new six-
19 foot tall gate is proposed along the southerly and westerly side of the lot."
20 14. In order to facilitate the Project, the developer sought Project Permit
21 Compliance Review pursuant to LAMS Section 11.5.7 C and the Vermont/Western Station
22 Neighborhood Area Specific Plan.
23 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

24 15. The Planning Director issued a Planning Director's Determination and approved a
25 Project Permit Compliance Review for the Project on September 18, 2018. The Planning
26 Director also determined that the project was exempt from CEQA. Appeals were timely filed and
27

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

an appeal hearing was held before the City Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") on
2 November 27, 2018. Despite testimony in support of the appeal, the Planning Commission
3 denied the appeal and a Letter of Determination was issued on December 12, 2018. The

4 Planning Commission also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA. Petitioner filed

5 a CEQA appeal to the City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c) which

6 was denied on June 18, 2019.

7 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

8 16. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
9 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
10 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
11
Channel Law Group, LLP 41706 0 LSNPIE L  SI A G E SIl!H ÁueAeS decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
12 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
13 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
14 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
15 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
16 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
17 17. If a project will not result in potentially significant effects on the environment, the
18 government agency may prepare a negative declaration. Mitigated negative declarations are
19 prepared when a project applicant revises a project to eliminate or avoid all significant impacts
20| by incorporating mitigation measures into the project. A proposed mitigated negative
21 declaration circulated for review and comment must describe the project as modified to
22 incorporate mitigation measures. Mitigation measures cannot be improperly deferred and must
23 eliminate or avoid all significant environmental impacts of the project. An agency adopting a
24 mitigated negative declaration must provide members of the public, as well as responsible
25 agencies and trustee agencies with notice of its intention to adopt the mitigated negative
26 declaration. An agency adopting a mitigated negative declaration must also adopt a mitigation
27

28 5

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

a

1 monitoring or reporting program for the mitigation measures incorporated into the negative

2 declaration.

3 18. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a

5 result of approval and implementation of a project CEQA requires preparation of an

6 environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary function of the EIR is to discuss the

7 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
8  provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
9 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. A lead agency is required to
10 consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR shall be prepared. Responsible

2 11 agencies are public agencies which propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 # TP EI SIM  SSE uesea 12 agency is preparing or has prepared an EIR or negative declaration.
13 19. Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondent, are required to prepare a
14 complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a
15 significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately
16 analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead
17 agencies, such as Respondent, to consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project,
18 adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed
19 mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the project's
20 significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
21 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
22 unavoidable. Lead agencies, such as Respondent, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
23 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.
24 20. When a government agency adopts a negative declaration, mitigated negative
25 declaration or an EIR, it must exercise its independent judgment and analysis.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Project Does Not Comply with CEQA)

22. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

23. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental clearance
10 document that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide
11 for public review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. The Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 12 City's environmental clearance document must provide sufficient environmental analysis such
13 8 OGL BUNS "PAE EIJYSIIM €888 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on
'SILH Áueneg 14 proposed projects.
15 24. Respondents violated CEQA by determining that the Project was exempt from
16 CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
17 a. Failed to analyze potential carcinogenic contaminants from the adjacent dry cleaners to
18 the project site.

20 adjacent to the project site.
21 C. Failed to analyze the impacts associated with construction near a fault line running down
22 Franklin Avenue.
23 25. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
24 by failing to conduct any environmental review for the Project Accordingly, Respondent's
25 exemption determination must be set aside.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Authorizing Demolition Prior to Acting on Appeal)

3 26. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

27. Public Resources Code Section 21151(c) provides the right to appeal any
environmental clearance document such as a Notice of Exemption to a public agency's elected
7 decision-making body. Petitioner filed a CEQA Appeal pursuant to Public Resources Code 6

8 Section 21151(c) on or about February 25, 2019.
9 28. Despite this fact and prior to rendering a determination on Petitioner's CEQA
10 Appeal, the City allowed the developer to proceed with construction of the proposed Project. The
11 City issued demolition permits to facilitate the project and the developer destroyed the existing 8 d11 'dnoJ5 MET |auueyo LIZ06 euns "pAjg SJJYSI!M £8E8 12 structure(s) despite the fact that the CEQA Appeal was still pending before City Council.
allowing project to proceed prior to rendering a final 13 29. Respondent's actions 8
SIl!H AueAeg 14 environmental determination - violated the California Environmental Quality Act. The law is
15 clear that a City cannot defer environmental review until after a decision is made on a project -
16 this applies to any approval. CEQA Guidelines, section 15004(a), entitled "Time of Preparation,"
17 states as follows: "Before granting any approval of a project subject to CEQA, every Lead
18 Agency or Responsible Agency shall consider a final EIR or Negative Declaration or another
19 document authorized by these Guidelines to be used in the place of an EIR or Negative
20 Declaration." This was long ago established by the California Supreme when it stated "If
21 postapproval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing more than
22 post hoc rationalizations to support action already taken." Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.
23 Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 394. A City has no discretion to define approval
24 so as to make its commitment to project precede the required preparation of an environmental
25 clearance document. Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116, 132.
26 30. As a result, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF STATE PLANNING AND ZONING LAW AND LOCAL LAW)

3 31. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 32. The City's determination that the Project was consistent with the SNAP was in

6 error and not supported by substantial evidence. Section 7.D of the Vermont/Western Specific
7 Plan states that the maximum height of any new building within Subarea A shall not exceed a
8 height that is within 15 feet of the height of the shortest adjacent building on any adjacent lot
within the same Subarea. However, in no circumstance can the project exceed the 30- foot height
10 limit of the underlying R2-1XL Zone. The Specific Plan further stipulates that roofs and roof
11
LIZ06 0A 6PPIE E  I A  B ñ Beverly structures for the purposes specified in the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) Section MET lauueYO Group, d77 12 12.21.1 B.3 of the Code and architectural rooftop features may be erected up to 10 feet above the
13 transitional height limit, if the structures and features are set a back a minimum of 10 feet from the
14 roof perimeter and screened from view at street level. The adjacent property to the east is located
15 within Subarea B and therefore was not considered by the City. Rather the City considered the
16 height of the adjacent residential building to the west, which was approximately 23 feet in
17 height, thereby allowing a maximum transitional height limit of 38 feet on the subject property.
18 33. The City erred in using the adjacent building to the west because it was not the
19 shortest adjacent building. Rather, the "shortest adjacent building" is 4515 1/2 West Russell
20 Avenue • the guest house in back of 4515 West Russell Avenue which is original to 4515 West
21 Russell Avenue. The SNAP specifically used the term "shortest adjacent building" because it's
22 not just the street view that is important to the SNAP especially in an R2 neighborhood where
23 there are whole families living in guest houses. The SNAP was written to take sunlight/shadow
24 and privacy into consideration. The grant of Project Plan Compliance Review was therefore in
25 error and not supported by substantial evidence.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(DECLARATORY RELIEF)

3 34. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
5 35. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' determination that the

6 Project was exempt from CEQA failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA.

7 36. Petitioner seeks a declaration that a Respondents' determination that the Project was

8 consistent with the Vermont/Western Transit Oriented District Specific Plan was in error.

37. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' authorizing approval of
10 the Project (and demolition of the existing structures) prior to acting on Petitioner's CEQA
11 Appeal was in error. 0S48 12 38. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and other legal 'dnoug Me] |euueuo LLZ06 Hills, 1AR TPINS MSIM  SSO Beverly 13 requirements applicable to the Project.
14 39. Petitioner has the right to enforce these mandatory duties.
15 40. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, and will suffer
16 irreparable injury unless it receives the relief requested in this Petition.
17 41. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents as to whether
18 the actions and conduct of Respondents alleged in this Petition have violated CEQA and other

19 laws as identified herein. This controversy implicates the legality of the manner in which

20 Respondents have proceeded in giving the Project Approvals, the validity of the Respondents'
21 actions with respect thereto and, consequently, the legal ability of Respondents to take further
22 actions to develop the Project based upon the Project Approvals. The Petitioner contends that
23 each and all such actions and conduct have violated and will violate these laws. Petitioner is
24| informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute these contentions. A
25 judicial resolution of that controversy is now required pursuant to California Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 1060.

3 Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that

4 Petitioner and Respondents may ascertain their rights and duties.
