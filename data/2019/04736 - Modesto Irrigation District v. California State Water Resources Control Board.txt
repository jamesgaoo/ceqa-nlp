- I. INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 Petitioner and Plaintiff, Modesto Irrigation District ("MID" or "Petitioner")

4 seeks from this Court a writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure sections

5 1085 and 1094.5 directing Respondent and Defendant California State Water Resources
Control Board ("Respondent," "State Water Board," or "Board") to vacate and set aside its
6 December 12, 2018 adoption of Resolution No. 2018-0059, adopting the amendments ("Plan

7 Amendments" or the "Project") to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco
8 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary ("Bay-Delta Plan") and approving and adopting the

9 related Substitute Environmental Document ("SED" or "Final SED") for the Plan
10 Amendments.

11 2.

12 In adopting the Plan Amendments, and throughout the administrative process,

13 the State Water Board failed to comply with the U.S. and California Constitutions, the

14 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and CEQA Guidelines, and the State Water

15 Board's own certified regulatory program implementing CEQA.

3. Petitioner MID is the second oldest irrigation district in the state, formed and
16 existing pursuant to Water Code sections 20500 et seq., and its water rights to the Tuolumne
17

18 River are among the oldest in California. Over the last 130-plus years, MID has exercised

19 those senior water rights to serve and sustain thriving municipal and agricultural communities

20 in the Central Valley. Specifically, MID supplies the City of Modesto with close to half of its

21 drinking water pursuant to a treatment and delivery agreement--prior to which the City of

22 Modesto was entirely dependent upon groundwater from an overdrafted basin. Further, the

23 New Don Pedro Dam and powerhouse, co-owned and operated by and between MID and

24 Turlock Irrigation District, facilitates deliveries by MID of irrigation water for more than 2,300
agricultural customer accounts and electric service to more than 121,000 homes and businesses.
25 The New Don Pedro Dam also provides instream flows to support fish and wildlife in the
26 Tuolumne River ecosystem, storage capacity for flood control, a reservoir for recreational
27

-

2 activity, and water supply reliability in dry, critically dry, and sequentially dry years such as the
most recent drought from 2011-2017 in California.

3 4. The Plan Amendments, which were adopted without adequate environmental
4 review and do not achieve their purported purpose, will oblige MID to sacrifice one-third of its

5

6 annual surface water supply in dry and critically dry years. The Plan Amendments will

7 frustrate MID's ability to carry out its mission to provide services to the City of Modesto and

8 the surrounding region. Any reductions in MID surface water deliveries caused by the Plan

9 Amendments will be borne by the City of Modesto water users and MID's agricultural

10 customers in equal proportions, due to a parity clause in the treatment and delivery agreement

11 between MID and the City of Modesto. All MID customers, therefore, will be adversely

affected.

12 5.

13 Petitioner thus seeks judicial review to prevent irreparable injury to MID from

14 the State Water Board's adoption and implementation of the Plan Amendments. Petitioner asks

15 this Court to issue (I) a stay, or in the alternative, a preliminary or permanent injunction

16 enjoining the State Water Board from implementing or enforcing the Plan Amendments, and

17 (2) a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its approval and adoption of
the SED and its adoption of the Plan Amendments.
18 6.

19 Pursuant to its authority under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act

20 (Water Code, §§ 13000, et seq.), the State Water Board established the Bay-Delta Plan, which

21 (1) describes beneficial uses of water in the Bay-Delta, (2) sets forth water quality objectives to

22 protect those beneficial uses, and (3) creates a program of implementation to achieve the water

23

24 MID diverts an average of 315,912 acre-feet of surface water from the Tuolumne River each

25 year for consumptive use According to the SED, surface diversions from the Tuolumne under the SED will be reduced 27% in dry years and 38% in critically dry years, for an average of 32.5% across both year-types. The SED calculates that, on average, across all water year types, 26 MID will be forced under the Project to reduce surface water diversions by 14%, or about

27 44,000 acre feet, per year. 44,000 acre feet is enough water to supply 88,000 average

28 California family households for one year, and is equivalent to the amount of water MID supplies to the City of Modesto over the course of eleven months.

1 quality objectives. (Water Code, § 13050, subd. (j); § 13170.) The Board must review and

2 update the Plan every three years.

3 7. In 2009, the State Water Board determined it would update the Bay-Delta Plan

4 in separate phases. In Phase I. the Board partitioned the three eastside tributaries to the San

5 Joaquin River-Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers ("Three Tributaries")--from the rest
6 of the Bay-Delta river system to update San Joaquin River flows and Southern Delta Water

7 Quality Objectives.2

8 8. The Plan Amendments impose minimum flow requirements on the Three

0 Tributaries. This has never been done before by the State Water Board. Specifically, the Three
10 Tributaries must maintain 40% unimpaired flow February through June with an adaptive range
11 of 30% - 50% unimpaired flow, through to the San Joaquin River at Vernalis, with compliance
12 points below New Don Pedro Dam on the Tuolumne River, below New Melones Dam on the
13 Stanislaus River, and below New Exchequer Dam on the Merced River (referred to as the rim

14 dams).

15 9. The purported purpose of the new minimum flow requirements is to support the
16 Delta-wide migration of the Central Valley fall-run Chinook Salmon-a fish that is not listed as

17 threatened or endangered under either the California or federal Endangered Species Act. The
18 minimum flow requirements do not achieve their intended purpose (protection of fish), nor are
19 they supported by substantial evidence.
20 10. The Final Plan Amendments also include year-round flow management that the
21 State Water Board may impose in order to mitigate adverse temperature impacts at the other
22

23 In Phase II, the State Water Board is considering updates to Delta outflows, and Sacramento
24 River and tributary flow objectives. Until the release of the Final SED in 2018, all prior drafts
25 described four phases of the Bay-Delta Plan updates. The Final SED deleted references to Phases III and IV without explanation. Initially in the SED drafts, the implementation of Phase
26 and II was to occur in Phase III through a water rights proceeding, while in Phase IV, the

27 State Water Board was to develop flow objectives for the priority tributaries in the Sacramento Watershed. As set forth in the Final SED, the water rights proceeding will follow Phase II, but
28 the Final SED no longer describes this proceeding as "Phase III."

AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

- times of the year caused by substantial drawdown of dam reservoir levels resulting in warmer

2 waters behind Don Pedro Dam. This additional requirement was not in any prior draft of the

3 Plan Amendments, and was never specifically analyzed in the SED, and therefore the public

4 did not have the opportunity to review and comment on it prior to the release of the Final Plan
5 Amendments.

6 11. The Plan Amendments further impose a separate minimum base flow

7 requirement of 1000 cubic feet per second (*cfs") that must be met at Vernalis at all times by

8 the Three Tributaries. Vernalis is located on the San Joaquin River mainstem, downstream

O from the confluence of the Stanislaus River and the San Joaquin River. The Stanislaus River is
10 the last of the Three Tributaries to meet the San Joaquin River mainstem; therefore, San

11 Joaquin River flow measurements at Vernalis take into account flows from the Three

12 Tributaries.

13 12. Additionally, the SED identifies-but does not analyze-a series of additional
14 regulations, such as reservoir carryover storage and refill requirements, that will be imposed on
15 MID and the other rim dam operators to provide for water temperature control and to prevent
16 complete reservoir drawdown during drought periods in an effort to avoid and mitigate adverse
17 impacts caused by the Project. The environmental impacts of the Project without these

18 requirements imposed on dam operators were not evaluated in the SED and thus not disclosed
19 to the public. Moreover, the environmental impacts of these requirements themselves were
20 never evaluated in the SED.

21 13. Despite the alleged purpose of the Project, the Plan Amendments will have

22 negligible benefits on salmon populations. According to the State Water Board, the State's
23 own Salmon Simulation ("SalSim") modeling program is a "state-of-the-art simulation model"

24 and "the best scientific tool available." However, when the Project's 40% unimpaired flow
25 requirement was tested using the SalSim modeling program, it revealed a mere increase of
26 1,103 Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon to the entire Project area after 17 years of
27 imposing the flow requirements on the Three Tributaries. To put this in perspective, 1,103
28
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

- Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon represents less than one-quarter of one percent

2 (<0.25%) of the recent annual average of such salmon returns in the State.3

3 14. Moreover, the SalSim model showed declining salmon populations at higher

4 unimpaired flow requirements (i.e., 50% and 60% unimpaired flow), which contradicts the very

5 premise of the Project, that increased tributary flows alone will result in more salmon. When

6 the proposed flow requirements did not produce the State Water Board's intended results

7 (which was a "surprise" to staff), the Board jettisoned the SalSim model and went blindly

8 forward with the Project in the absence of any direct scientific support.4

9 15. By focusing Phase regulation solely on the Three Tributaries with compliance

10 points below the rim dams on each of the three rivers, the Plan Amendments target only six of
11 the most senior water rights holders-MID, Turlock Irrigation District, South San Joaquin
12 Irrigation District, Oakdale Irrigation District, Merced Irrigation District and the City and
13 County of San Franciscoand exempt from regulation exactly 4,500 similarly-situated junior
14 water rights holders throughout the San Joaquin River Basin. Imposing the regulation on just
15 the six senior rights holders, while exempting all other junior rights holders in the Project area,
16 may be convenient for the State Water Board staff who will be administering the program, but
17 it constitutes a clear violation of California's most fundamental water rights law, the Rule of
18 Priority.

19 16. Further, by focusing only on the six most senior water rights holders in the
20 Basin, adoption of the Plan Amendments constitutes a de facto adjudication of those six water
21 users' water rights, in violation of the due process protections guaranteed by the California and

22 federal Constitutions. Due process requires directed notice and an opportunity to be heard,
23 including the opportunity to present and rebut evidence before the modification of water rights.

27 4 Indeed, State Water Board staff confirmed at the November 7, 2018 hearing that they did not
28 rely on SalSim (or any other modeling) in their conclusions regarding the Project.

-

2 This violation of due process cannot be undone. The Court must therefore direct the State
Water Board to vacate the Project and SED approval and adoption.

3 17.

4 The Plan Amendments will cause severe water shortages and drastic cutbacks in

5 surface water diversions to the detriment of consumptive water users served by irrigation

6 districts and the City and County of San Francisco ("San Francisco"), such as residents,

7 businesses, and farmers, and it will have far-reaching consequences to the environment, the

8 health and well-being of residents, and the region's overall economy.
18.

9 Local government agencies, irrigation districts, and farm groups intimately

10 familiar with vast reductions in water deliveries during drought periods, estimate that the

11 impact of the Plan Amendments will be anywhere from $150 million to $2 billion in
agricultural output losses per year, given that the region supported by the Three Tributaries is
12 rife with high-value crops. The Project could also idle as many as 240,000 acres of farmland.
13

14 The State Water Board itself estimates that the Project will reduce agricultural production by
$69 million per year.
15 19. The drastic reduction in surface water deliveries is projected to affect more than
16 one million acres of agricultural land in the San Joaquin Valley, 65% of which is designated as
17

18 Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland, or Farmland of Statewide Importance.5 The majority of

19 farms within that one million acres is comprised of small farms, less than 100 acres in size.

20 Most of the farms within the jurisdiction of MID are small family farms less than 20 acres in

size.

21

22 Prime Farmland is "[f]armland with the best combination of physical and chemical features

23 able to sustain long term agricultural production. This land has the soil quality, growing season, and moisture supply needed to produce sustained high yields."

24 Unique Farmland is "[f]armland of lesser quality soils used for the production of the state's

25 leading agricultural crops. This land is usually irrigated, but may include nonirrigated orchards or vineyards as found in some climatic zones in California."

26 Farmland of Statewide Importance is "[f]armland similar to Prime Farmland but with minor shortcomings, such as greater slopes or less ability to store soil moisture." Cal. Dept. of 27| Conservation, "Important Farmland Categories" (2017) available at

28 http://www.conservation.ca.gov/dlrp/fmmp/Pages/mccu/map_categories.aspx.

20. Although the Plan Amendments are not projected to provide measurable benefit

2 to fish, they will benefit some junior water rights holders directly at the unjustifiable expense of
3 senior rights holders like MID. Specifically, the SED admits that the Plan Amendments will

4 make an additional 76,000 acre feet of water available for export from the Delta by the State
5 Water Project ("SWP") and the Central Valley Project ("CVP"), which both divert water from

6 the Delta system pursuant to junior appropriative water rights. Moreover, the Plan

7 Amendments will provide additional flows and salinity control to mitigate for the forthcoming

8 impacts of the WaterFix, which is the State's plan to construct diversion tunnels under the

9 Delta and move the SWP and CVP diversion points from the South Delta to north of the Delta
10 directly from the Sacramento River. Moving the SWP and CVP diversion points to the
11 Sacramento River will result in diminished flows from the Sacramento River, to and through
12 the Delta.

13 21. - In its determination to push the Project forward, the State Water Board violated
14 its obligations under CEQA in myriad of ways that render the Board's adoption of the Plan
15 Amendments and approval and adoption of the SED invalid. The Board's failures under

16 CEQA include, but are not limited to, the following:

17 a. Unlawful segmentation of the Bay-Delta Plan Amendments. The phased
18 approach taken by the Board improperly segments the Project, hides its true
19 cumulative impacts, and disguises the real purpose of the Project-to reduce
20 diversions from senior water rights holders on the Three Tributaries and increase
R8 diversions by junior rights holders, including the United States Bureau of
Reclamation ("Reclamation") and the California Department of Water
23 Resources ("DWR"). In addition, this improper piecemealing is contrary to the
24 State Water Board's own science, which calls for a comprehensive, holistic

25 approach to improving the Delta ecosystem.
26 b. Inadequate impacts analysis. The SED's analysis of environmental impacts
27 is also wholly inadequate. Among other flaws, the SED fails to analyze
28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

impacts caused by the Vernalis base flow requirement, fails to analyze
2 impacts in dry and critically dry years, fails to properly analyze impacts to
0 + 40 agricultural resources, fails to evaluate impacts for the Project in light of
climate change, fails to analyze impacts to the San Joaquin River National
Wildlife Refuge, fails to adequately analyze foreseeable impacts to water

6 temperature, fails to analyze impacts caused by restrictions on the rim dams

7 located on the Three Tributaries, fails to properly evaluate impacts to

8 groundwater, fails to properly evaluate impacts to private domestic wells,
9 and fails to consider the significant impacts to the City of Modesto's water
10 supply.

11 C. Inadequate cumulative impacts analysis. The SED's cumulative impacts
12 analysis is similarly legally deficient. Among other things, the SED fails to
13 disclose and evaluate cumulative impacts to groundwater, disadvantaged
14 communities in and surrounding the City of Modesto, and agriculture, resulting
15 from the Project itself. It fails to adequately evaluate cumulative impacts with
16 existing and foreseeable groundwater projects, fails to analyze Project impacts
17 with Lower San Joaquin River total maximum daily load ("TMDL") for
18 temperature, fails to properly evaluate cumulative impacts with the Sustainable

19 Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA"), and fails to adequately consider the
20 cumulative impacts of the WaterFix. The State Water Board's failure to
21 properly evaluate cumulative impacts with SGMA is particularly egregious
22 because the State is simultaneously cutting back surface water deliveries as a

23 result of the Project, on the one hand, and restricting access to groundwater as a
24 result of SGMA, on the other hand. This dual attack on the region's available
25 water supply will be devastating to the local environment, farmers, businesses,
26 and residents.

27

28
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

d. Failure to consider a reasonable range of alternatives. In addition, the SED is
fundamentally flawed because it fails to consider a reasonable range of
alternatives. Examples of such failures include, failure to consider a reduced-
exports alternative, failure to consider a basin-wide alternative, including an

5 alternative that considers requiring flows from the Upper San Joaquin River and

6 the Friant Dam, and failure to consider non-flow alternatives. All of these

7 alternatives would have reduced impacts to environmental resources in the area

8 of the Three Tributaries, but were not even considered by the State Water Board.

q e. Inadequate mitigation measures. The SED is also deficient in that it contains

10 inadequate mitigation measures. Specifically, the SED contains inadequate
11 mitigation for impacts to municipal drinking water supplies, no mitigation for
12 impacts to private domestic wells, and improperly developed mitigation for
13 temperature impacts. The SED further contains improper dismissal of feasible
14 flow mitigation and dry-year relief, improper reliance on groundwater as

15 mitigation, and improper reliance on unformulated groundwater management
16 plans.

17 22. MID has actively participated throughout the administrative process and has
18 repeatedly identified these fatal flaws of the Project and the SED to the State Water Board at

19 every opportunity.

20 23. The State Water Board's adoption of the Plan Amendments and approval and
21 adoption of the SED constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion. The State Water Board failed

22 to proceed in a manner required by law, and its actions are not supported by substantial
23 evidence. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21168.5.) Each of the deficiencies alleged below provides a
24 separate and independent reason to direct the State Water Board to vacate its adoption of the
25 Plan Amendments and its approval and adoption of the SED. The SED falls short as an
26 informational document, does not comply with CEQA, and cannot be relied upon to implement
27| the Project.

II. PARTIES

2 Petitioner and Plaintiff

3 24. Petitioner and Plaintiff Modesto Irrigation District is an independent, not-for-
4 profit, community-owned California irrigation district formed and existing pursuant to Water

5 Code §§ 20500 et seq. MID' holds senior water rights on the Tuolumne River, and utilizes

6 surface water from the Tuolumne to provide electricity, irrigation water, and wholesale high

7 quality treated surface water to the region. MID (along with the Turlock Irrigation District)
8 holds the FERC license to New Don Pedro Dam, which is currently in the process of FERC

9 relicensing,5 and which has been targeted by the State Water Board as a vehicle for
10 implementing the Project's flow objectives. MID also co-owns and operates the La Grange
11 Diversion Dam with the Turlock Irrigation District.

12 25. MID will be directly, indirectly, substantially, and irreparably harmed by the
13 State Water Board's actions. The Plan Amendments, if implemented, will result in
14 considerable reductions in water supply available to MID and its customers, causing MID to

15 suffer direct and concrete injury. MID thus has a beneficial interest in preventing the social,
16 economic, environmental, and procedural harm that State Water Board's actions will inflict.

17 26. MID also has strong interest in enforcing the public duty of the State Water
18 Board to comply with CEQA. Every customer class and community group in the Project area

19 would be affected by the Project, and many Project-area residents, business owners, farmers,
20 and others who are beneficially interested in this action would have difficulty vindicating their
21 own rights.

22 27. There is no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law to redress the actual,
23 concrete, specific, imminent, and irreparable harm to MID and the region caused by the State
24 Water Board's actions.

B. Respondent and Defendant

2 28. Respondent and Defendant7 California State Water Resources Control Board is

3 an agency of the State of California subject to all California laws. The State Water Board is the

4 lead agency for the Project with responsibility for complying with CEQA.

5 29. -MID is not currently aware of the true names or capacities, whether individual,

6 corporate, or otherwise, of Respondents/Defendants Does 1 through 100, inclusive, and

7 therefore Petitioner and Plaintiff sues them by such fictitious names. MID is informed and
8 believes, and on that basis alleges, that Does 1 through 100 have been or will be responsible in

Q some manner for actions alleged in this Petition. Leave of court will be asked to amend this
10 Petition to show the true names and capacities of Does 1 through 100 and the precise nature of
11 their relationship to the actions at issue herein when the same have been ascertained.

13 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 30: This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085
15 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

16 -31.- Venue for this action is proper in Sacramento County because Code of Civil

18 thereof may be commenced and tried in the County of Sacramento.

19

20 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

21 32. MID has exhausted all administrative remedies by actively participating in and
22 throughout the administrative process and by timely submitting comments raising substantive
23 and procedural objections to the Plan Amendments and SED during public comment periods.

24 33. MID participated and objected at several points in the administrative process

25 V. IRREPARABLE HARM

26 39. MID realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
27 I herein.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

40. MID is directly, adversely, and irreparably affected, and will continue to be

2 prejudiced by the adoption of the Plan Amendments and the SED, and by the failure of the
3 State Water Board to comply with CEQA, unless or until this Court provides the relief prayed

4 for in this Petition.

5 41.- Without such relief, MID will suffer harms due to the State Water Board's

6 implementation of the Project. The Plan Amendments will obligate MID to sacrifice on

7 average over 100,000 acre-feet, or one-third, of its annual surface water supply in dry and

8 critically dry years, causing a severe water shortage for municipal and agricultural water users

9 and thwarting MID's ability to carry out its mission to provide reliable, low-cost electric and
10 irrigation water throughout its service area, and to fulfill its contractual obligations to provide
11 wholesale drinking water to the City of Modesto.

12 42. Specific harms caused by reduced surface water diversions under the Project
13 include, but are not limited to, the following:

14 (a) Harm to agriculture in the form of water supply cutbacks and rationing;
15 shortened irrigation seasons; thousands of acres of farmland being put out of production; loss of
16 arable land; and loss of permanent high-value crops, that cannot survive without water year to

17 year;

18 (b) Economic harm in the form of lower property values; thousands of lost jobs in
19 the agriculture and related food sector; hundreds of millions of dollars in lost agricultural
20 revenues; increased water costs; reduced competitive market in the food and agriculture sector;
21 diminished ability to operate dams as designed; and in an inability to attain property and
22 operating loans, which are often contingent on water availability;
23 (c) Groundwater impacts that include increased groundwater pumping in a part of
24 the State where groundwater basins are a already in a state of overdraft or critical overdraft;
25 threat of overdraft in areas of the Modesto Groundwater Subbasin where decades of dedicated

26 management efforts have achieved stable groundwater levels; migration of inferior quality
27 groundwater into uncontaminated groundwater supplies; increased groundwater degradation;

28
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 increased groundwater treatment costs; dried up domestic wells primarily in disadvantaged

2 communities comprised mainly of minority and low-income citizens; and a permanently

3 lowered water table; and

4 (d) Violation of due process and Rule of Priority protections by altering MID's

5 senior water rights without a hearing.

6 43. MID will likely succeed on the merits at trial. MID will suffer greater interim

7 harm if Respondent implements the Plan Amendments than Respondent will suffer if the Court

8 grants a stay, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction.

q 44. A grant of a stay or injunctive relief will also protect the public interest in a safe,
10 reliable, sustainable, and affordable water supply, a stable local economy, and a stable
11 agriculture and food sector, which otherwise would be immediately threatened upon

12 implementation of the Plan Amendments. Denial of a stay, on the other hand, would not be in
13 the public interest where the SED itself concludes that the Project will have unavoidable
14 significant adverse impacts to the public interest, with minimal or no benefit to fish resources.
15

16 VI. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

17 45. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general to enforce important
18 public rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will

19 confer significant benefits on Project-area residents as well as residents of California, generally.
20 Litigation brought to enforce CEQA has been found to confer significant benefits on the public.
21 (San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Inc. v. Cnty. Of San Bernardino (1984) 155
22 Cal.App.3d 738, 754.) Therefore, Petitioner will seek an award of reasonable attorneys' fees
23 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

1 Modesto Irrigation District

2 47. MID was formed on July 23, 1887 as a publicly owned California irrigation
3 district under the Wright Act, and it is authorized to manage surface and groundwater resources

4 for the benefit of the District's landowners. It is the second oldest irrigation district in the State

5 and its water rights to the Tuolumne River are among the oldest in California.

6 48. For more than 130 years, MID has exercised those senior water rights to serve

7 and sustain thriving agricultural communities in the Central Valley. MID's founding
8 community transformed the area into one of the nation's most productive regions; MID's long

9 history of careful attention to agricultural water needs has made Stanislaus County one of the

10 world's foremost agricultural areas and has yielded substantial economic benefit to California.

11 49. MID is located in eastern Stanislaus County. The District is bounded on the

12 north by the Stanislaus River, on the south by the Tuolumne River, on the west by the San
13 Joaquin River, and on the east by the Sierra Nevada Mountains. MID's irrigation service area
14 covers an area of approximately 162 square miles (103,733 acres) in the Tuolumne River
15 watershed. Most of the farms served by MID are small family farms, averaging only 20 acres
16 in size.

17 50. ..-. MID's first project as a public entity was the construction of the La Grange
18 Diversion Dam on the Tuolumne River, completed on December 13, 1893. Both MID and

19 Turlock Irrigation District ("TID") (also referred to collectively as the "Districts") funded the
20 construction of the La Grange Diversion Dam at a total cost of $550,000. The purpose of the

21 project was to raise the level of the Tuolumne River so water could be diverted into MID's and

22 TID's gravity-fed canal systems for local farmers. At the time of completion, the La Grange
23 •Diversion Dam was the highest overflow dam in the United States. MID and TID initially split
24 the cost of construction of the La Grange Diversion Dam on a 50-50 basis, but 20 years later

25 divided the costs and benefits in proportion to the respective acreage in the two districts, one-

26

27

28
16

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 third for MID and two-thirds for TID. Today, the La Grange Diversion Dam is among the

2 oldest still operating in California.8

3 51. Once in operation, the La Grange Diversion Dam and the Districts' related

4 irrigation conveyance system boosted property values, encouraged subdivided lands, and

5 transformed unproductive lands into productive agricultural land consisting of both annual and

6 permanent crops.

7 52. By the 1920s, however, MID and TID needed more water storage to support the
8 growing agricultural community. The Districts again teamed up and constructed the original

9 Don Pedro Dam and powerhouse on the Tuolumne River and the Modesto Reservoir. At the

10 time of completion, the Don Pedro Dam was the highest dam in the world. The Dam allowed

11 MID to bring nearly 60,000 additional acres into irrigation to grow almonds, walnuts, peaches,

12 grapes, and other high-value crops.
13 53. The Don Pedro Dam also facilitated MID's path to provide power, which by
14 1923 was a reality with the installation of the first electrical pole in the Modesto area.
15 Construction of the original Don Pedro Dam and powerhouse, which cost just under $5 million,
16 was privately funded from the proceeds of a bond issuance.

17 54. Ultimately, the original Don Pedro Dam's storage capacity was barely sufficient
18 to meet the irrigation needs of a single growing season, and thus could not ensure water supply
19 reliability for the region. Accordingly, in 1967, MID and TID began construction of a new,

20 much larger Don Pedro Project to ensure a stable water supply through consecutive dry years.
21 The New Don Pedro Dam was completed in 1971 at a cost of $105 million, and like the

22 previous dam, MID's contribution was funded from proceeds of a bond issuance.

23 55. When the reservoir behind the Dam is full, New Don Pedro has a capacity of
24 2,030,000 acre feet, making it the sixth largest water body in California. The reservoir has

25 12,960 acres of water surface, extends roughly 26 miles upstream and has approximately 160
26 miles of shoreline. The reservoir provides 1,381,000 acre feet of active storage space for water
27

1 supplies and 340,000 acre feet of space to regulate flood flows of the river. The minimum pool

2 contains 309,000 acre feet which is 19,000 acre feet more than the original Don Pedro Project

3 held when it was full. Reservoir outlet consists of three radial spillway gates and bypasses, as

4 well as diversion tunnels with a designed outlet capacity of 9,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs").

5 56. The reservoir provides recreational opportunities in excess of an average of
6 407,000 visitor days per year. Local area residents and visitors from nearby counties and the

7 Bay Area enjoy jet-skiing, fishing, swimming, hiking, boating, and camping on and around the

8 reservoir.

9 57. The Dam provides for hydroelectric power generation and operates under FERC
10 License No. 2299. Today, MID transmits electricity over more than 1,800 miles of power lines
11 throughout 560 square miles of electrical service area.

12 58. Further, the New Don Pedro Dam provides added stability and flexibility for the
13 City and County of San Francisco's ("San Francisco") water system. San Francisco's
14 relationship to the Districts is that of an upstream junior water rights holder. San Francisco
15 contributed just over half of the funds needed to construct the New Don Pedro Dam in

16 exchange for the right to "bank" up to 740,000 acre feet of water credits' in the reservoir
17 behind the Dam by bypassing or releasing water upstream that San Francisco otherwise could
18 have diverted. Under the exchange agreement, diversions to the San Francisco water system
19 are not made physically from the "banked" water behind New Don Pedro. Instead, San

20 Francisco's exchange storage space in the reservoir is operated to store water that is credited to
21 San Francisco, and San Francisco is allowed to make additional diversions upstream equivalent
22 to its credits in the reservoir, at times when it otherwise would be required to release water for
23 the benefit of the Districts.

24
25 9This includes San Francisco's right to 570,000 acre feet of storage in New Don Pedro called "exchange storage,' and a seasonal encroachment right to up to half of the reservoir's 340,000 26 acre-foot reserve capacity for flood control. (In re The Matter of Turlock Irrigation District
27 and Modesto Irrigation District Project No. 2299 (1963) 31 F.P.C. 535.)

28
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

59. San Francisco draws approximately 230,000 acre feet of its "banked" water

2 from the Tuolumne River each year to serve 2.6 million water customers. However, it does not

3 own any portion of the Don Pedro Project or water in the reservoir. A contract known as the

4 Fourth Agreement currently governs the relationship between San Francisco, MID and TID,

5 and calls for shared responsibility for any flow requirements imposed by FERC.

6 60. The FERC license is conditioned to require specified releases from New Don

7 Pedro Dam to protect Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon spawning below the La Grange

8 Diversion Dam (which is down-river from the Don Pedro Project). These minimum fishery

0 flows below the La Grange Diversion Dam are maintained per a 1995 settlement agreement
10 between MID, TID, San Francisco, the Department of Fish and Game, the U.S. Fish and

11 Wildlife Service, FERC staff, Bay Area Water Users Association, and several NGOs. Base
12 flows, which were established through the settlement and evaluated for environmental effects

13 through the Environmental Impact Study process, range from 50 cfs to 300 cfs, depending on

14 the time of the year and water type. Pulse flows are also required for the benefit of fishery
15 resources in the Tuolumne River.

16 61. Pursuant to FERC licensing, MID, TID, and San Francisco have conducted

17 several studies and monitoring programs on the existence and viability of several fish species
18 (including the Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon) to evaluate rate and frequency of flows

19 needed from the New Don Pedro Dam to protect fish and wildlife. In the event that FERC
20 conditions change to require more water to be released, the Fourth Agreement establishes that
21 the burden is allocated to San Francisco at 51.7121 percent and to the two water districts
22 together at 48.2879 percent.

23 62. In addition to its other functions, the New Don Pedro Dam provides flood
24 control under the direction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers ("Army Corps").
25 Joint efforts to enhance flood control on the Tuolumne River date back to the 1930s, ultimately
26 resulting in an agreement between the Army Corps and the Districts in 1944. This agreement
27 provides that the Army Corps would abandon its efforts to build a flood control dam at
28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 Jacksonville if the Districts would build New Don Pedro and design it to provide the same

2 amount of flood control space as the Army Corps planned for its Jacksonville reservoir. Thus,

3 the Army Corps contributed $3 million to the construction of the Don Pedro Project in

4 exchange for the 340,000 acre feet of flood control storage from October 7 to April 27 of each

5 year. The agreement reached with Army Corps was incorporated into the Flood Control Act of

6 1944 passed by Congress.

7 63. Today, more than 130 years after its inception, MID delivers irrigation water for
8 over 2,300 agricultural customer accounts and is thus the backbone of the region's agricultural

0 economy. Stanislaus County's agriculture sector and related services contributes well over $3

10 billion annually, and ranks seventh in the nation based on market value of agricultural products
11 sold. MID also provides electric service to more than 121,000 homes and businesses;

12 wholesale drinking water sufficient to meet nearly half of the City of Modesto's needs; and
13 with TID, environmental water releases to support fish and wildlife in the Tuolumne River

14 ecosystem, and storage capacity for flood control and to ensure that the City of Modesto and
15 San Francisco have a stable and sufficient municipal water supply.
16 B. City of Modesto's and MID's Partnership for Water Supply Sustainability and

17 Reliability

18 64. The City of Modesto, with a population of over 200,000 people, is within and
19 surrounded by MID's irrigation service area. Of the 103,733 acres within MID's irrigation
20 boundary, over 40,000 acres have been developed into City of Modesto residential, commercial

21 and industrial centers. According to the Modesto Irrigation District Agricultural Water
22 Management Plan Update for 2015, the trend toward greater urbanization within the District's

23 boundaries is expected to continue at the rate of about 600 acres per year.10

24

25

26 10 However, the projected rate has not fully materialized to date in response to a period of slowed economic growth, and reduced access to secured water supplies (which are necessary
27 for the approval of development projects) could further slow the pace of anticipated growth. In
28 any event, the Modesto area continues to experience steady growth.
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

65....Prior to 1994, the City of Modesto relied solely on groundwater to meet its

2 municipal and industrial water supply needs. Drought conditions combined with growing

3 demand for water in the City of Modesto and the surrounding area contributed to a reduction in

4 groundwater levels which created a cone of depression beneath the City.

5 66. • The cone of depression coupled with increasingly stringent federal and state

6 water quality requirements prompted a 1983 study of the groundwater supply. The study

7 recommended a conjunctive water use program to supplement the City of Modesto's

8 groundwater supply with water from the Tuolumne River. Following the recommendations of

9 the 1983 study, MID and the City of Modesto signed an agreement in 1986 to pursue the
10 construction of a surface water treatment plant to provide treated water from the Tuolumne

11 River to the City of Modesto.

12 67. The partnership between MID and the City of Modesto is set forth in an

13 Amended and Restated Treatment and Delivery Agreement (*ARTDA"), wherein MID

:14 promises and agrees to treat MID's agricultural customers and the City of Modesto on a parity
15 basis. Accordingly, if MID is required to reduce deliveries, it will cut back its deliveries to its
16 agricultural customers and to the City of Modesto in equal proportions. Further, MID's
17 commitments to its agricultural customers and to the City of Modesto shall be met before any

18 subsequent water transfers for delivery of water outside MID's boundaries.

19 68. In 1994, MID and the City of Modesto completed Phase One of the Modesto
20 Regional Water Treatment Plant, a 30-million gallon per day (36,600 acre-foot/year) domestic

21 water project that provides safe, reliable drinking water to the City of Modesto. To date, MID
22 has provided 230 billion gallons-or more than 800,000 acre feet--of high quality treated

23 surface water from the Tuolumne River to the City of Modesto, significantly reducing the

24 City's reliance on groundwater and improving water quality for more than 200,000 area
25 residents and 6,000 businesses. Moreover, absent this cooperative local agreement, that
26 volume of water would have come from the Modesto Subbasin groundwater, which is the only
27 other source of water available to the City.
28
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

69. The City of Modesto still supplies almost half of its water from City-owned and

2 operated wells (and 68% in drought times), but as intended, the delivery of high quality treated

3 surface water from the Tuolumne River has contributed to the significant recovery of
groundwater levels within the Modesto Subbasin. Since 1994, groundwater levels beneath the

5 City of Modesto have rebounded by as much as 40 feet as a result of progressive management

6 efforts.

7 70. -. As a result of MID's and the City of Modesto's determined efforts at sustainable
8 groundwater management through conjunctive use over the past 25 years, groundwater levels

9 are generally stable in the Modesto Groundwater Subbasin (with the exception of some

10 localized areas).

71. Due to these efforts, the Modesto Subbasin as a wholealthough designated by
12 the State as being in overdraft due to localized areas-is one of only two subbasins in the
13 Project area that was identified by the DWR in 2016 not to be in a condition of critical

14 overdraft.

15 72. The City of Modesto continues to aggressively pursue an environmentally
16 friendly conjunctive reliable water supply. The City and MID have completed a $200 million
17 "Phase Two" surface water treatment plant, which, when combined with Phase One, can

18 produce up to 67,204.2 acre feet to the City of Modesto.

19 C. Current Groundwater Supply Challenges
20 1. Groundwater Quality and Contaminated Wells

21 73. The City of Modesto's groundwater pumping capacity has been reduced due to

22 wells containing arsenic, uranium, perchloroethylene (*PCE"), trichloroethylene ("TCE"),
23 dibromochloropropane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane ("TCP") and nitrate exceeding drinking water

24 regulatory maximum contaminant levels. In fact, the United States Environmental Protection

25 Agency listed the City of Modesto's groundwater that was contaminated with PCE and TCE as

26 a federal Superfund Site. To date, the City of Modesto has taken 16 wells out of service due to
27 declining water quality (combined with stricter state and federal standards). It currently takes
28
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

an average of 2 to 3 wells out of service each year. Groundwater quality problems and the cost

2 and availability of well-head treatment technologies impose significant constraints on the City

3 of Modesto's future groundwater production, which will be further compounded by SGMA.

4 74. The City of Modesto's 2015 Urban Water Management Plan projects a 50%

5 population increase in its contigious and outlying service areas by 2050 (compared to 2015)-
6 growth for which Phase Two of the surface water treatment plant has helped the City prepare.

7 The City of Modesto's limited groundwater supply and contamination issues already present
8 significant challenges for meeting future water supply demands-and these challenges will be

9 compounded should the City be forced to rely more heavily on groundwater if surface water
10 becomes less available as a result of the Project.

11 75. Alternatively, it is foreseeable that the Project would have the effect of
12 constraining anticipated population and economic growth in the Modesto area by reducing
13 development that can only occur with a proven water supply, and by reducing employment and
14 economic opportunity--all of which also would reduce the City's resources for tackling
15 groundwater contamination issues.

16 2. Disadvantaged Communities

17 76. Disadvantaged Communities ("DACs") and Severely Disadvantaged

18 Communities ("SDACs") make up a significant portion of the Modesto Subbasin. Of the total

19 population of 355,793 within the Subbasin, 88% lives within a DAC, with 56% of the
20 Subbasin's total area consisting of DACs. The City of Modesto itself is designated a DAC.
21 77. DACs within rural and urban areas face ongoing issues related to groundwater

22 supply and quality but do not have resources to adequately respond to them. Many rural DACs
23 rely entirely on private domestic wells for their water supply. Private domestic wells tend to be
24 shallower than municipal and agricultural wells and are therefore especially susceptible to

25 degraded water quality, contamination, failure, and drying up in times of drought.

26 78. Today, some residents whose wells dried up during the last drought period still
27 rely on Stanislaus County to provide water through the County's tank program and have water
28
23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

delivered every 2 weeks to fill their temporary tanks. Also, the County created an emergency

-2 domestic water well financial assistance program, which provides financial assistance to rural
homeowners with dry wells, who can meet the County's needs test. Many residents cannot

4 afford the fees or payment terms, even for the low-interest loans provided by local programs to

5 deepen wells or to connect to municipal water systems in response to the drought.
79. Additionally, like municipal wells, domestic wells are at risk of contamination.

7 Identified contaminants within the Modesto Subbasin groundwater include salinity, nitrate,

8 arsenic, PCE, pesticides, iron, manganese, radionucleotides, bacteria, and petroleum
hydrocarbons; DACsparticularly those relying on domestic wells--are much more likely to
10 be exposed to these contaminants through their drinking water.
11 3. Reduced Recharge Due to Agricultural Water Use Efficiency

12 80. With regard to groundwater, MID's central concern is with maintaining :
13 sustainable balance between use and recharge. Municipal and industrial water demand is

14 projected to grow with population growth. Concurrent with the increased demand, some

15 important pathways for groundwater recharge are expected to decline.
16 81. Most of the recharge in the Project area comes from surface application of water
17 to crops. However, many farmers who now employ surface irrigation are converting to
18 managed techniques that reduce deep percolation, such as drip irrigation. Agricultural water

19 efficiencies, generally, adversely affect recharge; although they may reduce the total amount of
20 water applied to agriculture, the efficiencies will not have a net positive effect on groundwater

21 because less deep percolation will occur. Additionally, as recharge is reduced, water quality
22 further degrades because salts and other contaminants become more highly concentrated in the
23 groundwater.

24 4. Conservation and Sustainability Efforts

25 82. For decades, MID has been engaged in conservation and sustainability efforts.
26 In addition to partnering with the City of Modesto to develop a reliable conjunctive use

27 program, MID's actions also include, but are not limited to: (1) providing matching funds to
28
24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

landowners for qualifying conservation projects; (2) implementing fee structures to encourage
2 conservation; (3) assisting farmers who switch to permanent crops that utilize drip irrigation
and less water; (4) funding hydrological studies and mapping of the basin to better manage
runoff and storage; (5) working through its involvement with the Stanislaus and Tuolumne

5 Rivers Groundwater Basin Association to contract with the United States Geological Survey to

6 conduct a basin groundwater study; and (6) partnering with TID, San Francisco, the

7 Department of Water Resources to develop a Precipitation Runoff Modeling System.

8 83. Additionally, during sequential dry years, MID has decreased and capped water
allocations while providing workshops to farmers on how to conserve water. It also has

10 shortened the irrigation season, facilitated farmer-to-farmer water transfers, and offered

11 buybacks for unused allocations.

12 84. The City of Modesto likewise has been involved in ongoing efforts to reduce
13 water demand through the implementation of water conservation rebate programs, public
14 education, and plumbing retrofits. The City of Modesto offers house-calls to perform water
15 audits on homes, and has implemented watering restrictions and watering schedules. Its
16 conjunctive system allows the City of Modesto to offset groundwater use with surface water,
17 and thus do in-lieu groundwater banking to maintain groundwater pumping capacity as a means
18 of making up supply shortfalls during dry years. The City of Modesto also was involved in a
19. $100 million recycled water project to produce 35,000 acre feet of recycled water per year for
20 agricultural use.

21 Procedural History

22 85. The State Water Board is charged with developing, modifying, and
23 implementing the Bay-Delta Plan (or "Plan"), which (1) describes beneficial uses of water in
24| the Bay Delta, (2) sets forth water quality objectives to protect those beneficial uses, and (3)
25 creates a program of implementation to achieve the water quality objectives.
26 86. In 2008, the State Water Board initiated its periodic review of the existing 2006
27 Bay-Delta Plan, and on February 13, 2009, the State Water Board released a Notice of
28
25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

Preparation ("NOP") to commence the CEQA process required to amend the Plan's flow

2 objectives in Phase I of the Bay-Delta Plan amendments. The 2009 NOP did not provide notice

3 of a project that would create entirely new numeric flow objectives on the Three Tributaries.

4 Additionally, although the Three Tributaries had never previously been included within the

5 regulatory boundaries of the Bay-Delta Plan, the NOP did not state that the Board planned to

6 review or otherwise regulate waters outside the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan.

7 87. On April 1, 2011, the State Water Board issued a revised NOP, seeking

8 comments on potential additional changes to water rights and water quality regulation in the

9 Plan. Once again, the 2011 NOP failed to indicate the Board was reviewing or amending the
10 geographic scope of the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan or notice that it would be regulating waters not
11 already included in the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan. These omissions are significant, as the Plan

12 Amendments regulate the San Joaquin River system from its confluence with the Merced River

13 to Vernalis, including the Three Tributaries. Thus, the geographic scope and regulated waters
14 are completely different than the noticed geographic scope and waters.

15 88. The 2011 NOP further failed to mention consideration of flow objectives on the
16 Three Tributaries. In fact, the 2011 NOP expressly stated that the State Water Board was not
17 considering any other changes to the Bay-Delta Plan or any specific changes to water rights or
18 other requirements when implementing the Bay-Delta Plan. The Board did assure the public it

19 would provide additional notice regarding review of other aspects of the Bay-Delta plan and its
20 implementation in the future. Unfortunately, the State Water Board did not keep its word in

21 either case.

22 89. The State Water Board released an initial Draft SED in December 2012 (*2012

23 Draft SED"). In September 2016, it released a recirculated Draft SED ("2016 Draft SED")
24 purporting to contain changes in response to written and oral comments, information learned
25 from California's 2011-2014 drought, the State's 2014 adoption of a policy for sustainable
26 groundwater management (Water Code, § 113), and passage of the Sustainable Groundwater
27 Management Act (Water Code, §§ 10720 et seq.).

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

90.  Between the February 2009 release of the NOP and the July 6, 2018 release of

2 the Final SED, the Board conducted two scoping meetings and held several public staff

3 workshops and public hearings on the Draft SEDs.

4 91. In response to the 2016 Draft SED, the State Water Board received

5 approximately 3,100 letters from the public, stakeholders, agencies, and elected officials
6 containing 10,500 unique written comments.

7 92. The Final SED, when released on July 6, 2018, did not contain any substantive

8 changes in response to the issues raised during the comment period. In its Master Response to

0 Comments, the State Water Board addressed the thousands of unique public comments in a

10 mere 22 responses. The July 6, 2018 Final Plan Amendments, however, did contain several

11 substantive changes, which are described in detail in paragraphs 101-102 and 271-275 below.
12 93. The State Water Board heard additional oral comments responding to the Final
13 SED and Plan Amendments at August 21 and 22, and November 7, 2018 Board meetings.

14 During these meetings, the Board prohibited stakeholders from submitting written comments in
15 conjunction with their oral comments on the basis that the written comment period was closed.

16 94. The State Water Board planned to consider adoption and approval of the final
17 documents on November 7, 2018, but delayed the vote until the following Board meeting to

18 permit the California Department of Fish & Wildlife ("DFW") and DWR to advance

19 negotiations with water users who would be regulated under the Final Plan Amendments. With
20 the additional time, the agencies hoped to develop a framework for voluntary agreements to

21 present to the Board. Throughout the administrative process for the Bay-Delta Plan review and

22 updates, the State Water Board purported to encourage water users to negotiate voluntary

23 agreements, which-if approved by the Board-would be integrated into the Plan Amendments

24 and define the water users' obligations under the amended Bay-Delta Plan.

25 95. On December 12, 2018, DFW and DWR jointly presented a framework for
26 voluntary agreements ("Framework"), not just in the Phase I plan area, but throughout the San
27 Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. In response, the Board proposed, and
28
27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 then rejected a resolution to include the Framework in a non-phased, comprehensive update to

2 the Bay-Delta Plan, and a comprehensive SED that would fold Phase and Phase II into a

3 single basin-wide proceeding.

4 96. After voting down the resolution, the State Water Board's Phase Plan review

5 culminated in the December 12, 2018 approval and adoption of the Plan Amendments and SED

6 through Resolution 2018-0059, which also included a statement acknowledging the Framework

7 and suggesting the potential for voluntary agreements to be incorporated as alternatives into

8 future Bay-Delta Plan updates with further development and CEQA review.

9 E. Plan Amendments

10 97. The Plan Amendments include a narrative objective, three numeric objectives,
11 and a revised Program of Implementation. The Plan Amendments also include a host of
12 specific regulatory requirements to be imposed on dam operations, but which the SED contends
13 are not part of a plan of implementation and therefore does not analyze.

14 98. First, with regard to the narrative objective, where the previous objective in the
15- 2006 Bay-Delta Plan called for the doubling of the salmon population, the amended narrative
16 | objective calls to maintain inflow conditions from the San Joaquin River Watershed to the

17 Delta at Vernalis, sufficient to support and maintain the natural production of viable native San
18 Joaquin Watershed fish populations migrating through the Delta.

19 99. Second, the Plan Amendments establish new numeric flow objectives on the

20 Lower San Joaquin River ("LSJR") and the Three Tributaries for the protection of fish and

21 wildlife beneficial uses ("LSJR Flow Objectives*)."1 The revised LSJR Flow Objectives
22 require a starting point of 40% unimpaired flow February through June with an adaptive range
23

24

25

26 The LSJR is that portion of the San Joaquin River between its confluence with the Merced River and downstream to Vernalis, and its three eastside tributaries the Stanislaus, Tuolumne,
27 and Merced Rivers.

28
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

of 30% to 50% unimpaired flowl2 for the Three Tributaries, through to the San Joaquin River at

2 Vernalis.

100. However, although the Plan Amendments purport to establish a February
through June unimpaired flow requirement, this is not in fact how the Project will be

5 implemented because strict adherence to the LSJR Flow Objectives for this time period will
cause significant adverse impacts to water temperature at other times of the year.

101. When the Final Plan Amendments were released, they contained for the first

8 time a year-round requirement to mitigate these temperature impacts, which was not disclosed
or analyzed in prior drafts. Specifically, they required that flows provided to meet the numeric
10 objectives shall be managed in a manner to avoid causing significant adverse impacts to fish
11 and wildlife beneficial uses at other times of the year.
12 102. Pursuant to the year-round requirement--and in contradiction to the 40%

13 unimpaired flow objective some of the water needed to meet the 40% unimpaired flow
14 obligation instead could be released at other times of the year (referred to as "flow shifting").
15 The year-round requirement in effect nullifies the unimpaired flow objectives and instead treats
16 reduced surface water diversions as a block of water to be managed and controlled throughout
17 the year.

18 103. The Plan Amendments set the compliance points for the LSJR Flow Objectives
19 below New Don Pedro Dam on the Tuolumne River, below New Melones Dam on the
20 Stanislaus River, and below New Exchequer Dam on the Merced River.
21 104. Importantly, by limiting the compliance points to below the rim dams on each of
22 the Three Tributaries, the LSJR Flow Objectives can be enforced only against water users who
23 divert upstream from those compliance points on the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers.
24

25 12 According to the SED, unimpaired flow represents the water production of a river basin, 26 unaltered by upstream diversions, storage, or by export or import of water to or from other watersheds. The SED explains that unimpaired flow differs from natural flow because 27  unimpaired flow is the flow that occurs at a specific location under the current configuration of
28 channels, levees, floodplain, wetlands, deforestation and urbanization.
29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

The effect is that a select group of six senior water rights holders are subject to the regulation

2 and bear the full burden of meeting the unimpaired flow objectives. By design, the LSJR Flow

3 Objectives target only MID, TID, South San Joaquin Irrigation District, Oakdale Irrigation

4 District, Merced Irrigation District and San Francisco to meet the flow requirements, while

5 exempting from regulation thousands of similarly-situated junior water rights holders

6 throughout the San Joaquin River Basin.

7 105. Third, in addition to the percentage unimpaired flow requirement, the Plan

8 Amendments further mandate a minimum base flow requirement on the mainstem of the LSJR

0 between its confluence with the Merced River and downstream to Vernalis to be met by the
10 Three Tributaries, notwithstanding the minimum unimpaired flow requirements. The Project
11 requires a minimum base flow of 1,000 cfs, based on a minimum 7-day running average, at
12 Vernalis at all times ("Vernalis Flow Objective").

13 106. When the percentage of unimpaired flow required by the new LSJR Flow

14 Objectives is insufficient to meet the Vernalis Flow Objective, the Project further requires that
.15 the Stanislaus River shall provide 29 percent, the Tuolumne River 47 percent and the Merced

16 River 24 percent of the additional total outflow needed to achieve and maintain the required
17 base flow at Vernalis. Again, by requiring contributions from only the Three Tributaries, the

18 Vernalis Flow Objective, too, isolates the select group of six water users for regulation.
19 107. Thus, even if the six senior rights holders meet the LSJR Flow Objectives, they
20 may still be called on to provide even more water to meet the Vernalis Flow Objective,

21 particularly in dry years when overall flow is lower, and the 40% unimpaired flow may not
22 provide a sufficient volume of water to meet the Vernalis Flow Objective.

23 108. Fourth, the Plan Amendments include a relaxed numeric southern Delta salinity
24 objective that is asserted to be sufficiently protective of agricultural beneficial uses. The

25 amendment eliminates the seasonal element of the existing objective by changing the objective
26 to a higher salinity level (1.0 deciSiemens per meter [dS/m] year-round), from the current 0.7

27 dS/m April through August and 1.0 dS/m September through March.

AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

109. Fifth, the Program of Implementation set forth in the SED establishes the
2 intended broad geographical reach of the flow objectives, despite the narrow scope of the

3 compliance points. The SED states that although the lowest downstream compliance location

4 for the LSJR Flow Objectives is at Vernalis, the objectives are intended to protect migratory

5 LSJR fish in a larger area, including within the Delta, where fish that migrate to or from the

6 LSJR watershed depend on adequate flows from the LSJR and its salmon-bearing tributaries.

7 110. Sixth, the SED reveals a host of specific regulatory restrictions that will be

8 imposed throughout the year on dams located on the Three Tributaries-restrictions which the

0 SED states are. necessary to make the LSJR alternatives feasible and to meet project objectives.

10 111. The State Water Board utilized a Water Supply Effects ("WSE") model to
11 determine the effects of the LSJR Flow Objectives on reservoir operations, water supply, and

r,. 12 river temperature and flow. In order to ensure storage capacity for flood control, reservoir

13 storage for temperature control, and sufficient storage for dry years, the WSE model contains

14 the following reservoir control inputs: (1) carryover storage requirements; (2) refill criteria; (3)
15- flow shifting; and (4) maximum diversions by irrigation districts. According to the State Water
16 Board, reservoir control targets were determined by an iterative process, where the regulation
17 inputs were tweaked until adverse temperature impacts caused by the Project were minimized
18 in months of the year outside of the February through June period.

19 112. The SED's impacts analysis and disclosures are informed by the WSE model,
20 and therefore also necessarily assume that the New Don Pedro Dam (and the other rim dams)

21 operations will abide by the specific regulatory constraints embedded in the model.

22 113.-However, the SED downplays these reservoir controls as mere "*operational

23 constraints" that do not constitute a program of implementation, and therefore never analyzed

24 or disclosed their impacts.

25 114. Yet, the Plan Amendments unequivocally state the Project will include
26 minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to help ensure that
27 providing flows to meet the flow objectives will not have significant adverse temperature or
28
31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 other impacts on fish and wildlife. The SED also explains that the Project must have refill

2 constraints in place to ensure the feasibility for the 82-year simulation so that the reservoirs are

3 not drained entirely in the worst droughts of record, and it must have carryover storage
guidelines to minimize impacts on instream temperature that would be caused by lower

5 reservoir levels. In fact, the State Water Board conducted its feasibility analysis based on a
6 specified New Don Pedro carryover target of at least 800,000 acre feet.

7 F. SalSim Model

8 115. According to the State Water Board, the volume of water directed at fish was the

0 "key issue" in dispute during public review of the Draft SEDs. In particular, many comments
10 focused on the lack of scientific support for the 30% - 50% unimpaired flow requirement-i.e.,

11 lack of evidence that the instream flow requirements would achieve Project objectives.
12 116. -When the State Water Board used a salmon modeling program, called SalSim, to
13 test the efficacy of imposing unimpaired flow requirements only on the Three Tributaries, the

14 model showed that the instream flow requirements would result in a mere increase in the a

15 Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon population of 1,103 fish-or less than one-quarter of
16 one percent of the recent annual average fish returns. 13

17 117. According to the SED, the SalSim model is a life-history population model for
18 Central Valley fall-run Chinook Salmon originating from the San Joaquin River and the Three
19 Tributaries that was developed over the course of a decade by DFW, AD Consultants, and a
20 variety of other modeling and fisheries experts. The SED explains that available empirical data
21 combined with expert opinion and use of industry accepted (i.e. well established and proved)
22 mathematical and statistical procedures and formulations coupled with formal peer review were
23 used to build a state-of-the-art simulation model.

24 118. According to the SED, SalSim predicts salmon population response given a suite

25

26 13 See, supra, n. 3. (The Nature Conservancy, "California Salmon Snapshots" (June 30, 2016) 27 available at

28 http://www.casalmon.org/PDFs/Chinookprod_CompleteDraft2015Reports6.30.16.pdf.)
32

AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

of physical (abiotic) and biological (biotic) factors to visualize what would occur on average in

2 the future if, and only if, the past were perfectly replicated in the future absent those changes

3 the model user chooses to make. The model does not predict what is expected to occur in the

4 future, but instead backcasts how salmon populations may have been different in the past if

5 water management was different in the Three Tributaries.

6 119.- The SED notes that, despite certain model use precautions, SalSim developers

7 are confident that the results arising from model runs represent on average what is most likely

8 to happen if the defined environmental conditions that the model user chose had actually

O occurred. The SED calls SalSim the best scientific tool available, and use of SalSim is
10. substantially more reliable than making uninformed (i.e. uneducated) guesses about what
11 would be expected to happen on average if the physical environment were changed from that
12 which existed historically.

13 120. To test the proposed unimpaired flow requirements, the Board ran SalSim for a

14 period of 17 years, from 1994 through 2010, to analyze a variety of flow scenarios to assess the
15  response of Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon production on the Three Tributaries if the
16 requirements were implemented in the past. Les Grober, State Water Board Assistant Deputy
17 Director, testified in a November 29, 2016 public hearing that the State Water Board was

18 surprised that the unimpaired flow proposals did not yield the intended results, even when they

19 caused improved temperature and habitat conditions:

20 The 1,100 fish, that was the result when we run the SalSim Model, which
21 has been under development by the California Department of Fish and
Wildlife for think about a decade with improvements…In running the
22 model we were surprised to see that it didn'1 produce a lot of fish, so that
23 •was an initially surprising result. And in particular, we saw that it didn't produce fish at times when we were greatly improving temperature, greatly
24 improving habitat, different things where we would expect to see some signal at all. And we didn't see any signal .. .
25

26 (Nov. 29, 2016 Tr., p. 270, In. 24 to p. 271, In. 13 [emphasis added].)

27

33

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

121. And the SalSim model showed even lower average annual fish production when

2 unimpaired flow was higher, at 50% and 60%. For example, by increasing flow from 40%

3 unimpaired flow to 50% unimpaired flow, there were actually fewer salmon in the river-thus

4 completely contradicting the underlying premise of the Project. In the face of these results,

5 rather than reevaluate the Project (as the SalSim results should have prompted it to do), the

6 State Water Board instead discredited the model as inaccurate, abandoned any reliance on it,

7 and pressed forward with the Project without any proven scientific basis for doing so.

8 122.A six-month public comment period followed the release of the 2016 Draft SED

0 and ended March 17, 2017. During that time, stakeholders-including Petitioner-raised

10 concerns about the tradeoff between (a) the paltry benefit to salmon indicated by the SalSim

11 model and (b) the impacts caused by drastically reduced surface water deliveries and increased
12 groundwater pumping in dry and critically dry years to meet consumptive demands.

13 123.-. When the State Board formally responded to public comments on the SalSim

14 model, it declared that it did not rely on the model for its conclusions regarding fish benefits,
15. but also manipulated its presentation of the SalSim model data so that it looked selectively at
16 only seven of the seventeen years the model was run in order to make the results appear more
17 fruitful. By ignoring the least productive ten years of SalSim data and cherry-picking the years
18 with the highest fish returns, the Board now claimed that the flow regime would generate an

19 annual increase in Chinook salmon of 2,059 to 7,637 fish, rather than the 1,103 averaged across
20 all seventeen years. Importantly, there is no substantial evidence to support the State Water

21 Board's revised interpretation of the model data.

22 124. Unfortunately, the State Water Board was immovable, thus calling into question

23 its commitment to its duty to engage in a responsive, flexible public comment process.

24 Especially in light of the State Water Board's response to the SalSim results, it appeared that
25 the minimum flow requirements were a foregone conclusion, and the public hearings to discuss
26 this fixed outcome were for show.

27

28
34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

125. Two notable public hearings took place in Merced and Modesto, communities

2 that stand to be most affected by the Project. The State Water Board scheduled these key

3 hearings just days before Christmas 2016, by all appearances in an effort to minimize
attendance. Still, thousands of citizens sacrificed holiday time with family to attend the

5 hearings and express opposition to the Project.

6 126. With respect to the substance of the public hearings, California Assemblyman
7 Adam C. Gray wrote a letter on December 28, 2017 to State Water Board Chair Felicia Marcus

8 to express concern that "there was no in-depth discussion of issues permitted at those
meetings." Refuting Chair Marcus' claim that the process was transparent and included
10 "expansive outreach," Assemblyman Gray admonished the State Water Board for its failure to

11 fulfill its obligation to interact with and listen to local stakeholders: "The groundwater and
12 drinking water of almost one million Californians are significantly impacted by your proposal.
13 Their health could be directly threatened…we can find no such evidence [of extensive work
14 with stakeholders] or modeling that you did with those responsible for groundwater and
15 drinking water."

16 127. Rather than engage with the legitimate and supportable concerns raised by
17 stakeholders, scientists, the public, and elected officials, the State Water Board Chair demeaned

18 those providing commentary, dismissing public input as hyperbole and accusing commenters of
19 unjustifiably attacking the Board-even characterizing meetings with stakeholders as a
20 "shooting gallery." Intended or not, such improper statements had the effect of suppressing or
21 discouraging public input on the Plan Amendments, and they evidence the State Water Board's

22 unwillingness to meaningfully consider input that challenges the Board's chosen course of

23 action.

24 G. Joint-Agency Proposal for a Comprehensive Alternative
25 128. As discussed above, at the State Water Board meeting on December 12, 2018,
26 DFW and DWR jointly presented the Framework to the State Water Board for voluntary
27

28
35
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

agreements with the regulated water users, not just on the Three Tributaries, but throughout the

2 San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, as an alternative to the Project.
3 129. The Framework was the result of two years of negotiations between DFW,

4 DWR, California Natural Resources Agency, Reclamation, municipal and agricultural water

5 suppliers, and other stakeholders to develop an agreement for a more comprehensive approach

6 to support fish populations than the one-dimensional flow approach advanced by the State

7 Water Board.

8 130. Geographically, it covered the entire watershed. The Framework included
separate proposed terms for-among others--the Tuolumne River, the Friant Dam / Friant

10 Division on the Upper San Joaquin River, the various Sacramento River tributaries, and the

11 Sacramento River mainstem. MID was among the parties negotiating in good faith, and
12 coming to agreement, on terms for the Tuolumne River.

13 131.- By contrast to the Plan Amendments' flow-only regime, the DFW/DWR

14 proposal contained multi-dimensional measures to improve water quality and habitat,
15 including: system-wide governance across the entire watershed; integrated management of flow
16 and non-flow measures; use of tidal energy and pulse flows; habitat restoration and
17 development; predation control of non-native species, predation barriers, and hatchery
18 productivity components; a comprehensive science and monitoring program to inform
19 implementation; dry-year relief for water users; connections of actions in tributaries with

20 actions in the estuary; and funding mechanisms. The SED had acknowledged many of these
21 measures as necessary for fish migration and survival, but had declined to analyze or consider
22 them.

23 132. DFW and DWR further proposed to participate as CEQA responsible agencies
24 in coordination with the State Water Board as the lead agency to develop a comprehensive
25 SED, which would include a comparative assessment of the existing Phase I and Phase II
26 alternatives and the proposed agreement Framework. According to the Framework, the

27 voluntary agreements would be in place for a term of 15 years.
28
36
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

133.- In response to the DFW/DWR Framework, the State Water Board proposed its

2 own resolution to include the Framework in a non-phased, comprehensive update to the Bay-

3 Delta Plan and comprehensive SED that would fold Phase I and Phase II into a single

4 watershed-wide proceeding.

5 134. The discussion that ensued between Board members acknowledged the merits of

6 de-segregating Phase I and Phase II of the Bay-Delta Plan updates, and confirmed that basin-

7 wide approach made sense. The State Water Board further admitted that the comprehensive
8 I| Framework, which included non-flow measures, dry-year relief, and habitat restoration, could
be a "viable alternative" to.a flow-only regime, and should be evaluated as an alternative and

10 compared to the flow-only alternatives evaluated in the Phase I SED.

11 135. Nevertheless, the State Water Board voted down the resolution--not because
12. the comprehensive approach lacked scientific defensibility or the Phased approach was
13 superior, but because the Framework and voluntary agreements were not sufficiently developed
14 yet to be enforceable (although the same could be said for the Plan Amendments), and the

15 Board wanted to demonstrate. "a commitment to moving forward" and to "build momentum" by
16 adopting the Phase I Plan Amendments.

17 136.-. The Board then approved the Phase I Plan Amendments and SED through
18 Resolution 2018-0059, which included a statement that acknowledged the Framework proposal
19 and encouraged further analysis. The Resolution further specifically identified the voluntary
20 agreement for the Tuolumne River parties as one that could potentially implement the Plan
21 Amendments as to those parties; but the Resolution also stated that the Tuolumne River

22 agreement would need further development and CEQA review, which would be conducted in a

23 "future, comprehensive Bay-Delta Plan update."

24 137. This promise to analyze the Framework (including non-flow and geographic
25 components that should have been analyzed against the unimpaired flow requirements during
26 the SED process) post hoc does not abrogate the State Water Board's duty to conduct the
27

28
37
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

analysis prior to adoption. If anything, it is an admission by the Board that it should have

2 evaluated an alternative like the Tuolumne River voluntary agreement in the first instance.

3 138... Nonetheless, by passing Resolution 2018-0059, the Board cemented that the
4 current Bay-Delta Plan update would proceed in phases, and the Phase flow objectives would

5 be the regulatory backdrop on the Tuolumne River without ever having developed a
6 comprehensive SED to evaluate the tenets of the Framework against the Phase I flow regime.14

7 H. Friant Dam / Friant Division

8 139. The Friant Dam, which is operated by Reclamation, has had a more significant
9 adverse effect on salmon populations migrating along the San Joaquin River than any of the
10 rim dams on the Three Tributaries that will be regulated under the Plan Amendments. The
Friant Dam is located on the Upper San Joaquin River, upstream of the confluences of the

12 Three Tributaries with the San Joaquin River.

13 140. Within a few years after the Friant Dam was completed in the 1940s, its
14 operations began drying up approximately 60 miles of the Upper San Joaquin River. The
15 salmon run on the Upper San Joaquin River declined from 56,000 to zero in just four years.

16 141. Pursuant to a 2006 settlement agreement ("Friant Settlement") that ended a 1988
17 lawsuit filed by Natural Resources Defense Council, Friant Dam is now restoring flows to

18 support salmon migration. The Friant Settlement requires releases from the Dam to provide

19 flows on the San Joaquin River to the confluence of the Merced River, and it establishes the it
20 San Joaquin River Restoration Project ("SJRRP") to carry out the settlement obligations.

21 142. Recent flow data for the San Joaquin River shows that in wet years, storage

22 capacity behind the Friant Dam can be insufficient to handle the greater flows, and some

23 volume of bypass flows does make it to Vernalis, supplementing the flows from the Three

24

25 14 State Water Board adoption of the Plan Amendments and SED notwithstanding, MID 26 continues to negotiate in good faith with the State to adopt a voluntary agreement that focuses on salmon habitat restoration and integrated management of flow and non-flow measures, with
27 an aim to have the State Water Board abandon the unimpaired flow regime and replace it with
28 an approach that will be more beneficial to fish and less harmful to water users.
38
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

Tributaries. However, the flow data also shows that in critically dry years, no flow from Friant
2 Dam reaches Vernalis, and Friant contractors are under no obligation to ensure that they do.

3 This is because the Friant Settlement permits dry-year relief, relaxing flow requirements during

4 drought and critically dry periods to protect beneficial uses dependent upon surface water

5 deliveries. In fact, in 2014 and 2015, the Friant Dam/Division was permitted to withhold flows

6 to the point that the San Joaquin River from the Friant Dam to the confluence with Merced

7 went dry again.

8 143. Nothing in the Friant Settlement prevents the State Water Board from imposing
inflow requirements on Friant contractors and other junior water rights holders on the Upper
10. San Joaquin River to ensure sufficient flows past the confluence of the Merced River to

11 Vernalis.

12 144. While the State Water Board did not consider regulating the Friant
13 Dam/Division in these Bay-Delta Plan updates, there is precedent for regulating Friant Dam
14 flows under the Bay-Delta Plan. In crafting 1995 updates to the Bay-Delta Plan, the State

15 Water Board reviewed "all of the factors that have contributed to the decline of fish and
16 wildlife resources in the Bay-Delta Estuary" and considered objectives "for the factors that
17 have both contributed to the decline of fish and wildlife uses…within the regulatory control of
18 the SWRCB." With these factors in mind, the State Water Board evaluated a flow alternative

-19 in the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that included contributions from junior water
20 users who divert at Friant Dam, along with MID, TID, and Merced Irrigation District.

21 145. The EIR described 5 Alternative 5 as follows: "This alternative specifically
22 identifies releases from Friant Dam as a source of water to meet the Vernalis flow and Delta

23 outflow objectives." In other words, the State Water Board then understood Friant

24 Dam/Division and other junior water users on the Upper San Joaquin River to be properly
25 within the regulatory reach of the Bay-Delta Plan, and understood that these users contributed
26 to the decline of fish and wildlife resources in the Project area.

146. Now, by contrast, the State Water Board has inexplicably exempted Friant
2 Dam/Division and the Upper San Joaquin River from consideration as a source of instream
flows for the Project. In fact, in complete contradiction to the goals of the Plan Amendments,

4 the State Water Board approved Reclamation water rights change petitions to recapture Upper
San Joaquin River restoration flows for transfer out of the San Joaquin Basin. Concurrent with

6 the public review of the 2012 Draft SED, the State Water Board in 2013 approved the change
petitions. -That approval was challenged by several groupsincluding stakeholders in the

8 current Bay-Delta Plan update proceedingsbut on March 23, 2016, the State. Water Board

9 upheld its initial decision, just as it was beginning its public review of the 2016 SED. The
10 approved change petitions permit water rights holders junior to MID to recapture SJRRP
restoration flows released at Friant Dam before they reach the confluence of the San Joaquin
12 River and the Merced River.

13 11 -147. In other words, the State Water Board, directly facilitated the recapture of Upper
14 San Joaquin River restoration flows, at the same time it declined to consider the Friant Dam or
15 Upper San Joaquin River as a source of instream flow for the Project in its 2012 and 2016 Draft
16 SEDs, and at the same time it formulated Plan Amendments requiring senior rights holders to
17 reduce in-basin diversions.

18 California WaterFix

19 148. The administrative proceeding for the Plan Amendments did not take place in
20 isolation and must be examined in the greater regulatory context in the Bay-Delta in order to

21 understand the full set of interests in implementing the Plan Amendments and declining to

22 include more comprehensive alternatives such as those reflected in the Framework presented by
23 DWR and DFW.

24 149. In tandem with the Bay-Delta Plan Amendments, the State of California has also
25 been pursuing the WaterFix. This multi-billion dollar plan proposed by Governor Jerry Brown
26 and DWR calls for the construction of two tunnels (now one) under the Sacramento-San
27

AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

Joaquin Delta to carry fresh Sacramento River water to new intake stations for export south of

2 the Delta (to Southern California) via the SWP and the CVP.

3 150. Planning for the WaterFix has been in process since 2006. In 2013, DWR and

4 Reclamation jointly drafted and released a Draft EIR and Draft Environmental Impact

5 Statement ("EIS"). A partially revised Draft EIR/Supplemental Draft EIS was recirculated in

6 2015, and the Final WaterFix EIR/EIS was released on December 22, 2016. On July 21, 2017,
DWR approved the Final EIR and signed the associated Notice of Determination.

8 151.- Concurrently, on August 26, 2015, DWR and Reclamation submitted a joint
petition for change in water right permit conditions to the State Water Board for the SWP and

10 the CVP to add points of diversion of water on the Sacramento River associated with the

11 WaterFix ("Change Petition"). The Delta Reform Act prohibits any construction of the

12 WaterFix to begin until the State Water Board makes a decision on the Change Petition.
13 152. On September 24, 2015, DWR submitted an application for water quality
14 certification under section 401 of the Clean Water Act to the State Water Board for the

15 WaterFix ("Section 401 application").
16 153. On October 30, 2015, the State Water Board issued a combined public notice for
17 the Change Petition and an evidentiary hearing on the Change Petition, and a separate public

18 notice for the Section 401 application. As of the date of this Petition, the hearing is ongoing,
19 with the stated purposes of receiving evidence relevant to determining whether the Board
20 should approve the Change Petition, and of informing consideration of the Section 401

21 application.

22 154. Any decision by the State Water Board to approve the Change Petition must
23 include Delta flow criteria protective of the Delta ecosystem; such flow criteria would not be

24 implemented until the new diversion facilities are constructed and used.

25 155. Significantly, the SED does not discuss how the WaterFix flow criteria and the
26 Bay-Delta Plan' Amendments' unimpaired flow requirements will interact with one another or

27

28
41
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

cumulatively affect the surrounding environment and resources-although they will clearly do
so, given that flow criteria for both projects are intended to affect the same ecosystem.

3 156. Once operational, the WaterFix will reduce essential fresh water flows through

4 the Delta to Suisun Bay and San Francisco Bay by diverting clean water from the Sacramento

5 River before it ever reaches the Delta.15 According to the WaterFix EIR/EIS, these reduced

6 flows will result in worsened water quality throughout the Delta, including higher contaminant
7 concentrations, increased algal blooms, and increased salinity-adversely affecting water for

8 wildlife, habitat, residents and farmers.

1457 157. The SED for the Bay-Delta Plan update admits that the imposition of the 40%
10 unimpaired flow requirement on the Three Tributaries under the Bay-Delta Plan
11 Amendments-which will be in place prior to the construction of the WaterFix-will result in
12 an estimated additional 76 thousand acre feet of water per year to the CVP and SWP export
13 service areas. In other words, the Bay-Delta Plan Amendments function to make more water

14 available to the CVP and SWP for export while mitigating for the WaterFix impacts to instream

15 flow resulting from the increased exports.

16 158. -Likewise, the State Water Board will have the flexibility under the Bay-Delta
17 Plan Amendments to impose the upper range of 50% unimpaired flow on the select group of six
18 water rights holders in order to make sure the WaterFix flow criteria are met without impacting

19 exports-all to the further detriment of Project-area municipal water supplies, agriculture, and
20 groundwater.

21

22 15 The objectives of the WaterFix are to (1) increase water supply reliability by the SWP and CVP such that contract rights for Metropolitan Water District and other service providers may
23 be realized; (2) guard the SWP and CVP water diversion points from natural disaster disruption such as earthquake and salt intrusion resulting from climate change-induced sea level rise; and
24 (3) allow for more natural flows in the south Delta to benefit salmon and smelt. With regard to
25 the first and last points, when the current SWP and CVP pumps are in operation, they create reverse flows that pull the water toward the pumps rather than allowing it to flow toward San
26 Francisco Bay, affecting fish migration patterns and subjecting fish to entrainment. To mitigate for this effect, regulators have restricted exports during fish migration periods. The WaterFix 27 would reinstate a more natural river flow (albeit a diminished flow) and permit uninterrupted
28 exports out of the Delta.
42
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

159. It is also significant that the CVP and SWP historically have been responsible

2 for maintaining salinity levels protective of beneficial uses in the Delta. "One of the major

3 purposes of the [CVP] was containment of maximum salinity intrusion into the Delta. By

4 storing waters during periods of heavy flow and releasing water during times of low flow, the

5 freshwater barrier could be maintained at a constant level." (U.S. v. State Water Res. Control

6 Bd. (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82, 107 [hereinafter, "Racanelli"].)
160.: Indeed, the implementing legislation of the CVP explicitly stated that one of the
8 objectives of the CVP was to control saltwater intrusion in the Delta. When President Franklin

9 D. Roosevelt authorized $20 million of emergency relief funds for the CVP, he declared, "The

10 purpose [of the CVP] is to store and conserve flood and waste waters of the Sacramento and

11 San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries so that the entire flow can be used for flood control,
12: improvement of navigation, irrigation, the development of hydroelectric power, and the
13 protection of the delta lands at the junction of the two rivers against injury from salt." (Id. at p.
14 136 [citing Exec. Order (Sept. 10, 1935)] [emphasis added].)

15 161. Similarly, when the SWP was authorized in 1959, the State Legislature also
16 enacted the Delta Protection Act, which recognized that salinity intrusion was a particular

17 problem in the Delta that required special legislation prohibiting water exports from the Delta

18 necessary for salinity control. (Water Code, §§ 12202, 12203, 12204.)

19 162. The WaterFix guts the responsibility of the CVP and SWP to control salinity.
20 Once the Sacramento river flow is routed under the Delta to the South Delta pumps, that water
21 will no longer be available to control salinity. The Bay-Delta Plan Amendments specifically
22 permit higher salinity levels in the Delta, and allow for adaptive management to require higher
23 flows if necessary, both of which have the effect of mitigating for increased salinity levels
24 resulting from the WaterFix. Indeed, the Final Plan Amendments for the Bay-Delta Plan
25 updates specifically permit the State Water Board to reassign responsibility for salinity control
26 in the Delta.

163. Remarkably, even the voluntary agreements proposed by DWR/DFW were

2 designed to ensure that such mitigation for the WaterFix would be available when it was finally
needed. Construction of the WaterFix is projected to take approximately 16 years, while the

4 voluntary agreements would have expired at 15 years, at which time the State Water Board

5 could return to its demand for reduced diversions on the Three Tributaries and other Bay-Delta

6 watershed rivers.

164.- The State Water Board failed in the Bay-Delta Plan Amendment proceedings

-8 and SED to acknowledge that the WaterFix and the Project are interrelated in this way so that it

9 could avoid disclosing the extent of potential cumulative impacts of the WaterFix and the

10 Project together.

11 165.-When members of the public attempted to raise the connection between the
12- Project and the WaterFix at the Bay-Delta Plan Amendment hearings prior to the release of the
13 Final SED, the State Water Board affirmatively obstructed members of the public from entering
14 their comments into the record, on the erroneous grounds that that the WaterFix proceeding
15 was adjudicative and therefore subject to the prohibition on ex parte communication. In the
16 Board's assessment, any discussion of the WaterFix during the Bay-Delta Plan proceeding
17 constituted ex parte communication. The Board, therefore, cut off all citizens wishing to
18 comment on the relationship between the Bay-Delta Plan Amendments and the WaterFix,

19 causing them to stop talking or change their testimony.

20 166. However, the prohibition on ex parte communication did not apply to public
21 comment in the Bay-Delta Plan proceeding regarding the interrelationship between the Bay-
22 Delta Plan Amendment and the WaterFix. The State Water Board's Bay-Delta Plan review
23 was not an adjudicative proceeding subject to the same ex parte communication limitations as

24 those imposed in the WaterFix proceeding. Moreover, the State Water Board, itself, has made
25 clear in the SED the very real connection between the WaterFix and Plan Amendments as they
26 relate to the volume of water moving throughout the Delta.
27

167. Furthermore, stakeholder comments related to the purpose of the SED, which

2 they observed was in part to provide additional water to mitigate for the WaterFix impacts. In

3 other words, public comments were not directed at the WaterFix or intended to influence

4 WaterFix proceedings; they were directed at the connection between the Bay-Delta Plan

5 Amendments and the WaterFix revealed in the Bay-Delta SED.

6 168. - Mindful of limitations on communications in the WaterFix proceedings, the
7 Board could have declined to comment on public input directed at the WaterFix proceedings;

8 but its refusal to hear testimony on the relationship between the WaterFix and the Bay-Delta
Plan Amendments blocked important stakeholder input from entering the record and precluded
10  the information from the State Water Board's ultimate decision making on the Plan

11 / Amendments. **

13 VIII. CAUSES OF ACTION

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.
16

17 Unlawful Segmentation
169. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
18 herein.
19 170... The State Water Board decision to conduct a phased environmental review of
20 the Bay-Delta Plan constitutes a clear violation of CEQA. CEQA Guidelines section 15165
21 provides, "Where...a phased project is[] to be undertaken and where the total undertaking 22 comprises a project with significant environmental effect, the lead agency shall prepare a 23 single program [SED] for the ultimate project" (emphasis added). Here, the State Water Board
24

25 divided the ultimate project of updating the Bay-Delta Plan into phases, but did not prepare a
single program SED to evaluate the overall impacts of the ultimate project--plain and simple.
26 171. The Board's decision to segment the Bay-Delta Plan updates, itself, constitutes
27 an abuse of discretion. By isolating the San Joaquin River (Phase I), and Sacramento River 28
45
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

inflows, Sacramento River Basin tributaries, and Delta outflows (Phase II) from one another,

2 the State Water Board ignores the interconnectedness of the Project area water system in

3 contradiction to its own science, and to its own admissions at the December 12, 2018 hearing

4 validating the comprehensive Framework and voluntary agreement for the Tuolumne River

5 presented by DFW and DWR.
172. This segmentation impermissibly limits alternatives and mitigation measures to

7 reduce Project impacts that would otherwise be available across the ultimate Project area (many

8 of which are reflected in the Framework and voluntary agreement for the Tuolumne River), and
which would diffuse adverse impacts that are concentrated on MID and the other five senior

10 water rights holders under the current Project. Segmentation also masks cumulative impacts

11 caused by the Phases together, and hinders meaningful evaluation of Project efficacy as it

12 relates to the stated goal of the Project, which is to maintain flow conditions sufficient to

13 support fish populations migrating through the Delta. By segmenting the review, the State

14 Water Board unlawfully avoids disclosure and analysis of the fate of the San Joaquin River
15 flow entering the Delta.

16 173. - Separately, the segmented Project violates the State Water Board's most

17 fundamental water rights law, the Rule of Priority. It is no accident that Phase I segregates six

18 of the most senior rights holders in the state, unlawfully forcing them to reduce diversions

19 ahead of junior rights holders. Phasing the Project is nothing other than a tactical maneuver on a
20 the part of the State Water Board to evade the proper processes for curtailing MID's water

21 rights, and to avoid disclosing that such curtailment was done for the benefit of junior rights
22 holders, like the CVP and SWP, who will have more water available for diversions in a

23 subsequent Phase. Adoption of the Project must be vacated for the independent reason that the

24 very act of adopting an illegal project is itself unlawful and an abuse of discretion.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.
3 Failure to Disclose and Evaluate Project Impacts
174 .. ..Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
5 herein.
6
175: CEQA Guidelines section 15126.2 requires that "[d]irect and indirect significant
effects of the project on the environment shall be clearly identified and described [in the SED],
8 giving due consideration-to both the short-term and long-term effects." The SED methodically
9 omits or downplays significant impacts, resulting in an anemic and misleading impacts
10 assessment that conceals the true extent of the Project's environmental effects, and therefore

H : 11

12 does not and cannot comply with CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15151 [requiring an SED
c to reflect a good faith effort at full disclosure].) The SED's failures with respect to impacts
13 analysis include, but are not limited to, the following:
14
A. Failure to Analyze Impacts Caused by Vernalis Base Flow Requirement
15 176. The Project requires a minimum base flow of 1,000 cfs, based on a minimum
16

17 7-day average, at Vernalis, at all times. When LSJR Flow Objectives are insufficient to meet
the Vernalis Flow Objective, the Project further requires that the Stanislaus River shall provide
18 29%, the Tuolumne River 47% and the Merced River 24% of the additional total outflow
19 needed to achieve and maintain the required base flow at Vernalis.
20 177.
21 The SED fails to conduct any analysis whatsoever regarding the impacts caused

22 by the Vernalis Flow Objective, or how it will interact with the LSJR Flow Objectives and
operational constraints put on dams. In particular, the SED contains no disclosures regarding
23

24 the impacts to MID (and the consumptive users who depend on MID's surface water deliveries)
when, in dry years, the Districts must operate Don Pedro Dam to meet refill and carryover
25 requirements, meet the LSJR Flow Objectives, and contribute 47% of additional outflow to
26 meet the Vernalis Flow Objective all at once.
27

28
47
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

178. The SED is also void of any disclosures regarding how the allocation to each

2 river for when the LSJR Flow Objectives are insufficient to meet the Vernalis Flow Objective

3 was determined; this should have been the subject of public review and comment, but was not.

4 B. Failure to Analyze Impacts to the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge
179. The SED fails to analyze the impacts of the Project to the San Joaquin River

6 National Wildlife Refuge (*Refuge") and the terrestrial protected species that inhabit it.
Critical water supplies to the Refuge will unavoidably decline as part of the implementation of

8 the Project. Failure to analyze the impacts to the water supply of this vital Refuge renders the

9 SED and Plan Amendments legally deficient.
10 180.....Currently, there are at least twelve federally-listed endangered species that
11 occur, or that could potentially occur, on the Refuge. The SED lists the Aleutian Canada goose
12 (among other animals present at the Refuge) as a special status animal species with potential to

13 occur or known to occur within the area of potential effects. However, the SED performed no
14 impacts analysis regarding the effect on these species of the diminished water supply to the
15 terrestrial biological resources provided by the Refuge. Failure to consider these impacts
16 renders the SED legally deficient.

17 C. Failure to Disclose Impacts Prior to Mitigation

18 181. The State Water Board impermissibly compresses impacts analysis and
19 mitigation measures into single issue throughout the SED, independently violating CEQA on
20 two fronts: (1) it misleads the public and decisionmakers about the true impacts of the Project,
21 in contradiction with CEQA's central disclosure function, and (2) it establishes and relies on
22- unenforceable mitigation measures that have not been adequately adopted pursuant to CEQA
23. requirements. (See CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, subd. (e); 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(A), (a)(2).)
24 CEQA requires that mitigation is developed only after the Project impacts are analyzed and
25 understood.

26

27

28
48
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

182.  The SED obscures a multitude of significant environmental impacts caused by

2 the Project by failing to disclose such impacts prior to assuming mitigation, including, but not

3 limited to the following resources:

4 (a) The SED evaluates impacts to agricultural resources only after assuming
increased groundwater pumping will compensate for reduced surface water deliveries.

6 (b) The SED draws conclusions regarding impacts to groundwater only after

7 assuming SGMA will mitigate for otherwise unsustainable pumping.

8 (c) The SED makes no effort to analyze effects on municipal water supplies and

9 instead simply concludes that impacts to municipal supplies is a function of the ability to find
10 alternative sources. The conclusion is legally problematic because it assumes impacts analysis

11 after the City of Modesto and other service providers mitigate for the Project by finding
12 alternative supplies.

13 (d) The WSE model assumes groundwater pumping and development of new
14 drinking water resources will result in full municipal water deliveries and thus erroneously

15 concludes the Project will have zero impact on municipal and industrial users of surface water.

16 (e) The SED identifies impacts related to reservoir storage behind Don Pedro and
17 other dams only after integrating specific refill criteria, carryover storage requirements, and
18 flow shifting to mitigate for higher temperature of water in the lowered reservoir due to the

19 Project. The State Water Board's Mitigation Plan confirms that carryover storage is indeed
20 | mitigation but the SED never modeled or disclosed Project impacts without this mitigation

21 assumed in the analysis.

22 D. Failure to Adequately Analyze Impacts to Water Temperature™

23 183. The February through June 40% unimpaired flow requirement will cause
24 substantial drawdown of dam reservoir water levels, resulting in warmer waters behind Don

25 Pedro Dam, that, when released as flows to the Tuolumne River during the other months of the

26 year, could have significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife. The SED never analyzes this

27 perverse effect.

28
49
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

184. Instead, the WSE employs operational constraints on Don Pedro Dam and flow
2 shifting assumptions to provide for temperature control, to reduce likelihood of negative
effects, and to increase the overall potential benefit. In other words, mitigation is embedded
into the WSE, so the model never reveals the adverse temperature impacts directly caused by

5 the Project.

6 185. Indeed, when modeling is run from February through June without a carryover
7 storage target, reservoir refill criteria, and flow shifting, many of the purported temperature

8 benefits of the Project are lost, and water temperatures are worse than under baseline
conditions.

10 186. However, the State Water Board does not assess Project impacts without
mitigation embedded in the WSE model, and therefore does not disclose Project effects on
12 year-round water temperature. This is a fundamental omission to which the State Water Board
13 admits.- Board Staff Supervisor Erin Foresman stated at the August 21, 2018 hearing, "There is
14 a concern that we would have much higher impacts in those fall months, but we don't have that
15 information in the SED. We didn't model it without [operational constraints]." (Aug. 21, 2018
16 Tr., p. 100, In. 1-6.)
17 E. Failure to Analyze Impacts Caused by Dam Restrictions

18 187. The SED does not analyze the effects of the panoply of restrictions imposed on
19 Don Pedro Dam and the other rim dams located on the Three Tributaries. Minimum carryover
20- storage requirements, restricted storage release parameters, and drought period refill

21 requirements are required to achieve Project objectives, but they are not explicitly disclosed
22 and evaluated. Likewise, the SED is completely void of analysis regarding the new narrative
23 objective added to the Final SED imposing year-round regulation of Don Pedro Dam

24 operations.

25 188. For example, the SED should have disclosed that the drought refill requirements
26 will have significant impacts to agricultural resources that rely on MID's surface water
27 deliveries; surface water that would otherwise be used to bring crops back into production and
28
50
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

help farmers recover from a drought will be allocated instead to refilling the reservoir behind

2 Don Pedro Dam to mitigate for Project-induced temperature impacts. As another example, the
SED should have disclosed that the 40% unimpaired flow requirement may preclude Don

4 Pedro Dam from operating as designed; except in wet years, there likely will be little or no
carryover storage available. MID and TID, as well as other dam operators, provided written

6 comments regarding dam operations to inform and encourage the State Water Board's analysis
of these issues---but the State Water Board's Master Response to Comments dismissed the
8 concerns outright.

9 F. Failure to Analyze Impacts to Domestic Wells

10 189. By the State Water Board's own estimation, the Project threatens the health and
11 safety of 133,000 primarily disadvantaged residents who rely on private wells for drinking
12 water and other domestic uses. The State Water Board knows that the Project will cause many
13: domestic wells to dry up or become contaminated due to increased groundwater pumping by
14 municipal and agricultural users in response to surface water reductions caused by the Project.
15 But the Board dismisses any obligation to analyze these impacts or to propose feasible
16 mitigation, in violation of CEQA, and in violation of the State Water Board's mandate to
17- consider the human right to water when crafting regulations. (Water Code, § 106.3, subd. (b).)
18 G. Failure to Properly Evaluate Impacts to Municipal Water Supplies

19 190. The State Water Board failed to quantify the extent to which municipalities will
20  be required to meet the Project's unimpaired flow requirements, and the resulting effects of the

21 Project on municipal water supplies, even though it has the information to do so. This
22 constitutes an abuse of discretion. (Kings Cnty. Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221
23 Cal.App.3d 692, 733-734 [failure to quantify and provide analysis based on readily available
24 information constituted an abuse of discretion].)
25 191. The Board obscures impacts to municipal water supplies by relying on a WSE
26 model that ignores existing contractual constraints, such as the Fourth Agreement and the
27 ARTDA, and wrongly assumes reduced surface water supplies under the Project will result in
28
51
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

no reduced deliveries to municipal users like San Francisco and the City of Modesto. The SED
also failed to disclose impacts to municipal water supplies for sequentially dry years.

3 192. Further, the SED assumes that municipal suppliers will build new facilities to
4  replace surface water supplies, but fails to discuss impacts occurring during the interim period

: 5 between the initiation of the unimpaired flow requirements and when these new facilities would

6 go online. Conversely, the SED fails to analyze the likelihood that existing water supply assets,
such as the Modesto Regional Water Treatment Plant, will be underutilized or abandoned.

8 H. -Flawed Analysis of Impacts to City of Modesto's Municipal Water Supplies

9 *9 193._ Not only does the SED fail to adequately analyze impacts to municipal water
10 supplies, the analysis it does conduct with respect to the City of Modesto's water supply is
11 particularly flawed.

12 194. The SED does not accurately model or disclose the water supply impacts to the
13- City of Modesto because it: (1) ignores the conditions imposed by the ARTDA; (2) wrongly
14 assumes the City of Modesto will receive full surface water deliveries from MID after the

15 Project is implemented, when there is no substantial evidence to support this assumption; (3)
16 relies on outdated information that underestimates the City of Modesto's future water demand;
17 (4) fails to assess groundwater pumping as a feasible alternative to surface water deliveries

18 under SGMA; (5) ignores the potential for the City of Modesto to experience water shortages;

19 (6) ignores the Project's incremental contribution to the cumulative impacts to the City of

.': 20| Modesto's water supply; (7) fails to acknowledge that the Project threatens to undo the progress
21 made with MID toward sustainability through conjunctive use and threatens to create cones of

22 depression like that already experienced by Modesto; and (8) does not assess the likelihood and

23 impacts of stranded assets or unused capacity with respect to the surface water treatment plant

24 the City of Modesto built with MID.

25 195. Moreover, the State Water Board failed to undertake the required analysis of the

26 economic devastation and resulting urban decay that foreseeably could befall the City of
27 Modesto (and other urbanized areas of the Central Valley) as a result of the Project.

(Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal. App. 4th 1184,

2 1205 [CEQA requires analysis of physical impacts related to urban decay]; see also CEQA

3 Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (e).)
Flawed Impacts Analysis Regarding Agricultural Resources
.196.-_ CEQA requires that significant impacts to agricultural resources be evaluated.
(Pub. Res. Code, § 21100, subd. (b)(1); CEQA Guidelines, § 15382.) The SED misstates and
obscures impacts to agricultural resources in MID's irrigation service area as a result of

8 multiple flawed analytical methods, including but not limited to: (1) limiting analysis to a

-9 single year when any reduced deliveries by MID and other irrigation districts will impact
10 agriculture over sequential dry years; (2) relying on averages, which masks dry-year impacts;
11 (3) assuming uninhibited mitigation in the form of groundwater pumping without accounting
12 for restrictions to be imposed by SGMA; (4) failing to disclose impacts of the Project absent

13 such mitigation; and (5) failing to evaluate Project impacts for each water-year type separately.
14 J. Flawed Analysis of Impacts to Williamson Act Contracts

15 197. CEQA requires the State Water Board to assess impacts to Williamson Act

16 contracts as part of its agricultural resources analysis. (See CEQA Env'l Checklist Form, p.
17 247.) Without any meaningful analysis, the SED determined that the Project would not conflict

18 with the existing Williamson Act contracts in the Project area and that impacts to those

19 contracts would be less than significant.

20 198.= -The determination is grounded in flawed reasoning and a disregard for facts

21 because it is based only on the likelihood of whether or not farmers would cancel Williamson

22 Act contracts. The SED overlooks the fact that the Project will likely lead to nonrenewals of

23 Williamson Act contracts, which is the most common method for termination of Williamson

24 Act contracts, opening the door for conversion of agricultural land for uses inconsistent with

25 the Williamson Act. Stanislaus County, which in recent history has been frequently among the
26 top ten counties in the State with the greatest amount of nonrenewal initiations, is particularly
27

28
53
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

susceptible to this adverse impact. The SED is legally inadequate for its failure to disclose and
2 analyze these effects.

3 K. Inadequate Climate Change Analysis

4 199.. The State Water Board identifies climate change as an issue, but unlawfully

5 dismisses its effects (such as warming air and water temperatures) as insignificant and wholly
6 manageable by the State Water Board. The SED's handling of climate change does not reflect
1 a good faith effort at full disclosure and fails to provide the public and decisionmakers with
8 information needed to evaluate impacts, in violation of CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, §

9 15151.)

10 200. Under warmer conditions, it is foreseeable that the upper range of 50%
11 unimpaired flow may be necessary to maintain cold temperatures to meet the State's
-12 temperature targets in the Three Tributaries. It is also foreseeable that more restrictive
13 operational constraints on Don Pedro Dam could be necessary to mitigate for temperature

14 effects behind the Dam caused by the increased flow requirements. Accordingly, the SED
15- should have focused its analysis on impacts incurred under this foreseeably higher regulatory
16 demand. The failure to do so renders the SED inadequate because the SED understates the
17 potential environmental impacts of the Project.

18 201. The SED also contains no disclosure regarding the issue of futility as it relates to

19 climate change. The SED recognizes that expected changes in seasonal inflows due to climate
20 change are likely to affect the Central Valley fall-run Chinook salmon by causing significant
21 impacts on several life stages. Ultimately, the fish may not be able to survive higher water
22 temperatures -including ocean water temperatures irrespective of the Project. The potential
23 futility of the Project should have been disclosed to and discussed with the public.

24 L. Improper Reliance on Averages to Avoid Dry-Year Impact Analysis

25 202. The SED systematically fails to analyze the impacts of the Project based on
26 water-year types and instead calculates average impacts that do not reflect the widely variable
27 potential impacts of the Project that could occur in dry, critically dry and sequentially dry years
28
54
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

versus in wet years. Misleading calculations include, but are not limited to: average annual net

change in MID and other irrigation districts' groundwater balance associated with the LSJR

3 alternatives; average cropped acreage and acreage reduction of alternative compared to
baseline; average annual baseline water supply and changes in surface water diversions for

5 each alternative; averages related to crop production and revenues; and estimated effect of

6 LSJR alternatives on average annual groundwater pumping.
203._ The result is that the most devastating and permanent Project impacts-which
8 will only be felt in dry, critically dry, and sequentially dry yearsare masked, if not
eliminated, for the purposes of disclosure and impact analysis. (Tull v. Yuba Cnty., No.
10 C068607, 2013 WL 137106 at *14 (Cal. Ct. App. Jan. 11, 2013), as modified on denial of reh'g
(Feb. 7, 2013) ["The selection of an average that tends to disguise [the full impact of a project
12 on the environment] means that the [SED] conveys an inaccurate description of the
13 environmental consequences."].)

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.
16

17 Failure to Evaluate Cumulative Impacts

18 -204. -Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.
19 205.- The State Water Board did not proceed in a manner required by law and abused
20 its discretion by failing to meaningfully consider cumulative impacts, including, but not limited 21 to, the manners set forth below. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15130 and 15355.)
22 206. "Cumulative impacts" refers to two or more individual effects which, when
23 considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental
24

25 impacts. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.) Importantly, "[t]he individual effects may be changes
resulting from a a single project or a number of separate projects." (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 26

27 15355, subd. (a); 15378 [defining "project"].) "The cumulative impact from several projects is

28 the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project when

55
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future
projects." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355, subd. (b).) Additionally, "a cumulative impact

3 consists of an impact which is created as a result of the combination of the project evaluated in

4. the [SED] together with other projects causing related impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15130,

5 subd. (a)(1).)

6 Failure to Disclose and Evaluate Cumulative Impacts to Groundwater Resulting
7 from the Project, Itself

8 207. The Project causes two simultaneous, adverse impacts to groundwater which the
SED fails to analyze as cumulative: (1) the Project reduces groundwater recharge by restricting
L0-- the amount of surface water available for agricultural application to land, and (2) the Project

11 increases groundwater pumping by agricultural users and the City of Modesto to replace the
12 reduced surface water deliveries.

-3 208. ----The SED also improperly limits specific disclosures related to these adverse
14: effects to a period of one year, and therefore fails to disclose the magnitude of the impacts,
15 rendering the cumulative impacts analysis legally deficient. To accurately disclose the
16 magnitude of Project impacts to groundwater, the State Water Board must look at cumulative
-17 impacts over the life of the Project, or at least a for a meaningful period such as ten, to fifteen, or
18 twenty years.

19 B. Failure to Disclose and Evaluate Cumulative Impacts to Disadvantaged
20 Communities Resulting from the Project, Itself

21 209. When analyzing the Project's impact on the environment, the State Water Board
22 must consider "adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly." (Pub. Res.
23. Code, §21083(b)(3).) Public Resources Code §15064(b) emphasizes that the significance of an
24 activity may vary with the setting. Specifically, §15064(b) notes that "an activity which may
25 not be significant in an urban area may be significant in a rural area." Though a the SED briefly
26  identifies the setting of the impacted area, it fails to adequately analyze the effects of the setting
27 with the cumulative effects of the various Project impacts. The State Water Board must
28
56
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

explicitly consider that the Project area is primarily disadvantaged, because disadvantaged
communities often feel the cumulative effects of reduced surface water more severely than non-
3 disadvantaged communities.

4 210. The SED does not sufficiently analyze the settings of the impacted area,

5 including the minority and low-income populations, or the cumulative impacts of the Project on
6 DACs due in large part to the reliance that the affected DACs place on farming, and the already.
7. strained drinking water situation. The SED considers impacts to drinking water, groundwater,

8 and the economy of the impacted area. However, the document fails to consider these impacts

9 cumulatively. Individually these impacts will be harmful to the DACs within the SED territory.
10 When combined, the impacts will have severe, unavoidable consequences on a community
11- largely made up of minority and low income populations, which should have been disclosed.

12 C. Failure to Disclose and Evaluate Cumulative Impacts to Agriculture Resulting
13 from the Project, Itself

14 211. The SED downplays impacts to agriculture by limiting analysis to a single year
15 snapshot. At the-August 21, 2018 hearing on the Final SED, the Board admitted that the model
16 it used to evaluate Project effects on agriculture, known as the Statewide Agricultural
17- Production ("SWAP") model, did not consider multiple year impacts of water-supply
18 reductions. Such analysis is crucial when, for example, the Project's reservoir refill

19 requirements on Don Pedro Dam following drought-year will extend restricted deliveries to
20 farmers within MID's irrigation service area for sequential years. The SWAP model must
21 necessarily run for sequential years in order to consider the full scope of the Project (i.e.

22 carryover storage and refill requirements) on agriculture.
23 212. The cumulative, long-term effects of the Project, and the effects of the Project in
24 sequential dry years, on crop production and viability are simply- and unlawfully-ignored.

Failure to Adequately Evaluate Cumulative Impacts of the Project with Existing
and Foreseeable Probable Future Groundwater Projects

3 213.The SED is deficient because it fails entirely to identify the Discretionary Well

4 Permitting and Management Program that Stanislaus County is implementing pursuant to its

5 Groundwater Ordinance, Chapter 9.37 of the Stanislaus County Code ("Well Permitting

6 a Program"), as a project requiring cumulative impacts analysis, which will cause potentially

7 significant impacts to the very groundwater resources and land uses that depend on those

8 resources that are affected by the Plan Amendments.
214. Further, the SED does not adequately evaluate the cumulative impacts of the
10 Project when considered together with closely related past, present and future groundwater-

11 pumping projects in the Project area that also result in related impacts to groundwater. (See

12 CEQA Guidelines, § 15355, subd. (b) [agency must review "individually minor but collectively
13:  significant projects taking place over a period of time."].) Instead, the SED improperly
14 presents its impacts analysis related to groundwater in isolation from existing declining
15 groundwater conditions.

16 L. Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts of Project with Lower San Joaquin River
17 Temperature TMDLs

18 215. The State Water Board has listed the lower reaches of the Three Tributaries and

19 three segments of the San Joaquin River as impaired for temperature under the federal Clean
20 Water Act.1° (33 U.S.C. § 1313(d)(1)(A).) For each impaired water the State must establish a

21 TMDL for the specified pollutant-in this case, temperature. "A TMDL forms the basis for
22 further administrative actions that may require or prohibit conduct with respect to particularized
23 pollutant discharges and waterbodies." (City of Arcadia v. State Water Res. Control Bd. (2006)

24

25 16 With respect to the Three Tributaries, the State Water Board listed as temperature impaired
26 the Lower Merced from McSwain Reservoir to the San Joaquin River, the Lower Stanislaus, and the Lower Tuolumne from Don Pedro Dam to the San Joaquin River. On the San Joaquin
27 River, the Board listed the following reaches as temperature impaired: Stanislaus River to Delta

28 Boundary; Tuolumne River to Stanislaus River; and Merced River to Tuolumne River.
58
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

135 Cal.App.4th 1392, 1415 [quotation marks omitted].) The expected TMDL date for the
impaired reaches of the Three Tributaries and the three reaches of the San Joaquin River is

3 2021.

216.... The temperature TMDLs for the three lower San Joaquin River reaches are

5 future projects that will exacerbate the environmental effects of the Project flow objectives

6 because they, too, will require more water in the San Joaquin River to keep the water body in
compliance. In particular the temperature TMDLs for the Lower Tuolumne from Don Pedro
Dam to the San Joaquin River, and for the reach of the San Joaquin River from the Tuolumne

9 River to the Stanislaus River will frustrate MID's ability to meet temperature obligations

10 imposed by the Project. The TMDLs will reduce the amount of water available to MID to
divert for agriculture and drinking water. And as a result, the TMDLs will lead to increased

12 groundwater reliance, and therefore further lower groundwater levels, dry up wells, and
13 otherwise worsen the effects of the Project. The SED is legally inadequate for its failure to
14 identify the TMDLs as a related project, which, when considered with the Project, has
15 cumulative adverse impacts on the very same resources in the Project area.
16 F Inadequate Analysis of Cumulative Impacts with the San Joaquin River
17 Restoration Project

18 217. The SED does not analyze cumulative impacts of the Project with the San
19 Joaquin River Restoration Project, and instead improperly considers the Project as mitigation
20. for the SJRRP--a federal CVP project. The SED discloses that SJRRP surface water

21 diversions may cause increased San Joaquin River temperatures downstream of the Merced
22 River, but disregards this adverse effect based on the unsupported assertion that the adaptive

23 implementation element of the Project allows the timing of flows to be optimized, reducing or
24 eliminating any possible temperature effect.

25 218. The analysis is deficient because it fails to discuss how Project impacts to
26 temperature interact cumulatively with the SJRRP temperature impacts. The Project itself will
27 have adverse temperature impacts on the Tuolumne River, for example, during the months of
28
59
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

the year when the Project results in drawdown of water behind the Don Pedro Dam, which

-2 increases the temperature of flows coming from Dam releases. The SED does not disclose that

3 adverse temperature impacts from the SJRRP may frustrate Project purposes related to

4 temperature or compound temperature effects caused by the Project.

5 G. Failure to Properly Evaluate Cumulative Impacts with the Sustainable

6 Groundwater Management Act
219.- The SED wrongly concludes that SGMA (Water Code §§ 10720 et seq.) is not

8 expected to result in a cumulative impact on service providers, and therefore fails to analyze
foreseeable cumulative adverse impacts of SGMA with the Project. The Project will have the
10 cumulative effect of expediting existing groundwater depletion, leading to the need for drastic
11 restrictions on groundwater use under SGMA, while at the same time making it difficult if not
12 impossible for local groundwater sustainability agencies to meet their statutory imperative to
13 achieve sustainability.

14 220. It further overlooks cumulative impacts of the Project and SGMA to agriculture
15 and municipal users, whose surface water supplies will be diminished at the same time
16 groundwater use will be limited for the long term to correct the overdraft caused by current
17 practices.

18 H. Inadequate Cumulative Impacts Analysis Regarding the WaterFix

19 221. It is foreseeable that when the WaterFix has been constructed and becomes

20 operational, and the SWP and CVP start diverting water directly from the Sacramento River

21 north of the Delta, there will be significantly less water in the Delta. Thus, the State may
22 require even more unimpaired flow from the Three Tributaries to support salmon migration
23 throughout the Delta or to keep salinity at bay.

24 222. The State Water Board therefore may have to impose the upper range of 50%
25 unimpaired flow requirement to mitigate for the impacts of the WaterFix, to the further
26 detriment of agriculture, groundwater, and service providers. The SED's cumulative impacts
27

28
60
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

analysis is deficient, as it fails to discuss this inevitability once the WaterFix becomes

2 operational.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.

Failure to Consider a Reasonable Range of Alternatives
223. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
7 herein.
8 224. The SED must "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to
9 the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the
10 project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the
11 project.even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project
12 objectives, or would be more costly." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6.) Here, the SED 13 considers a set of alternatives that are too narrow to meet CEQA's standard.
14
225. The SED purports to evaluate four project alternatives when it in fact only offers
15 varying degrees of the same flow-only alternative, which are as follows: (1) a No Project
16 Alternative, which would leave in place flow requirements in the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan; (2) 17 Alternative 2, which would impose an unimpaired flow requirement range of 20-30%, with
18 20% as the starting requirement; (3) Alternative 3, which imposes an unimpaired flow
19

20 requirement range of 30-50%, with 40% as the starting requirement; and (4) Alternative 4,
which imposes an unimpaired flow requirement range of 50-60%, with 60% as the starting
21 requirement. The singular focus on unimpaired flow from the Three Tributaries and six senior
22

23 water users is fundamentally inadequate because none of the proposed alternatives will achieve
the central Project objective, which is to revive salmon populations.
24 226. Moreover, by statute, the State Water Board "should not approve [the Project] as
25 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which would
26 substantially lessen the environmental effects of [the Project]." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21002; Cal. 27 Code Regs., tit. § 23, § 3780.) Here, the State Water Board's sister agencies, DFW and DWR,
28
61
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

jointly proposed feasible basin-wide alternative, which included flows from the Friant Dam,

2 and which included non-flow measures and dry-year relief--all of which would lessen the
environmental effects of the Project. In the face of the DFW/DWR alternative, the State Water

4 Board a has a statutory duty to decline to approve the Plan Amendments, and at the very least,

5 evaluate the components of the Framework against the Phase I flow-based alternatives prior to

6 adoption.
227...Here, because the Board failed to consider-let alone adopt-feasible,

8 reasonable alternatives that would lessen environmental impacts of the Project while better
achieving Project objectives, the Board's approval of the Plan Amendments and certification of
10 the SED constitutes an abuse of discretion.

•A. Failure to Consider a Reduced-Exports Alternative

12 228. Given the Project's objective of increasing flows in the Delta to support fish
13  migration, the State Water Board should have considered the obvious alternative of reducing
14 surface water exports out of the Delta via the SWP and CVP, much of which is destined for

15 urban use in Southern California.

16 229. SWP and CVP exports are necessarily facilitated by taking water from other
17 beneficial users in the San Joaquin Basin. However, the State Water Board never even

18 contemplated imposing constraints on CVP and SWP exports and allocations in order to reduce

19 the environmental effects of redirecting surface water from these other beneficial users-
20 namely, the select group of six senior water holders on the Three Tributaries.

21 B. Failure to Consider a Basin-Wide Alternative

22 230- The SED should, but did not, evaluate an alternative that considered all 4,500

23 water rights holders in the San Joaquin Basin, as opposed to just a select group of six senior
24 water right holders on the Three Tributaries. This is an obvious alternative that would avoid or

25 lessen significant impacts, which under the current Project are concentrated on resources
26 surrounding the select group of six senior water right holders. It would distribute responsibility
27 for contributions throughout the basin and minimize the effects on any one water rights holder.
28
62
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

231...The State Water Board unlawfully exempted from consideration all junior water

2 rights holders throughout the basin, and it did so by artificially segmenting the Project into

3 phases, so the State Water Board could proceed in Phase I as if the junior rights holders did not

4 exist. The fact that the State Water Board's segmentation of the Project foreclosed the logical

5 basin-wide alternative (an alternative that the Board, itself, acknowledged as viable and

6 beneficial when it considered the DFW/DWR Framework) proves that such piecemealing
caused inadequate, unduly narrow project alternatives in violation of CEQA.
Failure to Consider an Alternative that Included the Upper San Joaquin River and

9 the Friant Dam/Division

10 232. In particular, as part of the development of a basin-wide alternative, the State
11 Water Board should have evaluated an alternative that included the Friant Dam/Division. Since

12 flows from the Upper San Joaquin at Friant Dam could directly contribute to meeting flow
13 objectives at Vernalis and to supporting fish migration through the Delta, this is an obvious
14 alternative that broadens the scope of water users beyond the select six. The failure to consider
15 this source of instream flow is a fundamental deficiency in the SED and an inexcusable
16 shortcoming with regard to CEQA-required disclosures.

17. 233. By impermissibly segmenting the Bay-Delta Plan updates geographically, the
18 State Water Board artificially separated the Upper San Joaquin River from the Lower San
19 Joaquin River to exclude the Friant Dam/Division from consideration. The State Water
20 Board's approach in Phase I comports neither with nature nor with logic, and it certainly
21 violates CEQA. The SED must consider a reasonable range of potentially feasible alternatives
22 that will foster informed decision-making and public participation. (CEQA Guidelines, §
wr 23 15126.6 (a).) Here, the omission of such a conspicuous alternative such as the Friant

24 Dam/Division demonstrates that it did not.

25 D. Failure to Consider Non-Flow Alternatives

26 234. As evidenced by the DFW/DWR Framework and Tuolumne River voluntary
27 agreement, the SED should have considered non-flow alternatives, which are likely more
28
63
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 effective in reviving fish populations, and which materially lessen or altogether avoid the

2 impacts to agricultural resources, service providers, domestic well users, groundwater, and
Williamson Act contracts caused by the current flow-only Alternatives.
235. However, the State Water Board dismisses the non-flow measures such as

5 predation control and habitat restoration as "beyond its regulatory authority to undertake," and
leaves it to affected entities to undertake the measures voluntarily. Rather than hide behind a
lack of authority, the State Water Board should have considered a joint-agency alternative with

8 DEW, which has the authority to impose non-flow measures for the protection of fish. In fact,
DFW (along with DWR) offered to be a responsible agency and work in partnership with the

10 State Water Board to implement its proposed comprehensive Framework.
11 236.  Where, as here, "there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures" that can
12 substantially lessen or avoid the significant environmental effects of the Project, CEQA
13 requires the State Water Board to decline to approve the Project. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)
14 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Inadequate Mitigation Measures
237. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth 18
herein.
19
238. CEQA requires that public agencies "shall mitigate or avoid the significant 20 effects on the environment of projects .. whenever it is feasible to do so." (Pub. Res. Code, §
21

22 21002.1, subd. (b).) "CEQA does not require analysis of every imaginable alternative or
mitigation measure; its concern is with feasible means of reducing environmental effects. . .. 23 'Feasible'-is defined as capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a
24 reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and
25 technological factors." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21061.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15364.)
26 239. The SED must therefore include analysis of "reasonably foreseeable feasible
27 mitigation measures." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777, subd. (b)(4)(D); Pub. Res. Code, § 28
64
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

21159, subd. (a)(2).) "Mitigation" includes: avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a

2 certain action or parts of an action; and minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or

3 magnitude of the action and its implementation. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15370.) The SED is

4 deficient because (1) it proposes mitigation that is neither foreseeable nor feasible, and (2) it

5 does not mitigate for each significant adverse impact it identifies. (CEQA Guidelines, §

6 15126.4; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3777, subd. (b)(3).) The SED's specific deficiencies with

7 respect to mitigation include, but are not limited to, the following:

8 Inadequate Mitigation for Impacts to Municipal Water Supplies
240.*: The SED proposes various mitigation measures for impacts caused by reduced
10 drinking water deliveries to municipal users, such as conservation, recovery and recycling,

11 aquifer storage and water banking, water transfers, and construction of new facilities-but it
12 does no analysis to determine whether those measures would in fact be feasible. The State

13 Water Board had an obligation to determine the availability of alternative water supplies
14 (especially for the City of Modesto, as the most populous city in the Plan area) so that it could
15 disclose-the likelihood that municipal suppliers would be able to meet the demands of

16 consumptive users under the Project, but failed to do so.
17 241: Ignoring existing overdraft in the Project area, the SED further assumes service
18 providers will turn to groundwater to make up for reduced surface water deliveries, but does no

19 quantitative analysis to determine whether groundwater is a viable option, or how SGMA
20 would affect this assumption.

21 B. Unrealistic and Unlawful Proposed Mitigation for Impacts to San Francisco
22 242.: With respect to San Francisco, specifically, the SED suggests that San Francisco

23 could effectuate large-scale water transfers from MID and TID to mitigate impacts of water

24 shortages to its consumers caused by the Project. This proposition is neither feasible nor
25 foreseeable, and therefore does not constitute proper mitigation.

AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

C. Failure to Mitigate for Impacts to Private Domestic Wells

2 243.- The State Water Board has the power to mitigate impacts to private drinking
water wells and prevent a public health crisis, and the SED identifies potential mitigation the

4 State Water Board could pursue. However, the SED does not commit to specific mitigation for

5 significant impacts to domestic well owners. The SED merely states that the State Water Board

6 will take actions as necessary to ensure that the implementation of flow objectives does not
7 impact supplies of drinking water for minimum health and safety needs.

8 244. Postponing the formulation of mitigation in this way violates CEQA's
proscription against deferred mitigation measures, especially in light of the foreseeable threats
10 to domestic water supply and quality during dry and critically dry years. (CEQA Guidelines, §
11 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(B) ['"Formulation of mitigation measures should not be deferred until

12 some future time."].)

13 D. Failure to Properly Develop Mitigation for Temperature Impacts
14 245. The SED obscured temperature impacts of the Project by building mitigating
15 constraints, such as flow shifting and carryover storage requirements on Don Pedro Dam, into
16 the Project and WSE modeling. In violation of CEQA, the State Water Board did not disclose
17 Project impacts to temperature prior to such mitigation. Because the SED failed to disclose
18 actual Project impacts to temperature, it also failed to properly develop mitigation for such
19 impacts.

•20 E. Improper Dismissal of Feasible Flow Mitigation

21 246. To mitigate Project impacts, the SED did not consider feasible flow measures,

22 such as pulse flows, variable flow regimes, and flow regimes based on water-year type that
23 could have been imposed on Don Pedro and other dams. In particular, because Project impacts
24 are most significant in dry, critically dry, and sequentially dry years, the SED should have
25 proposed mitigation, such as relaxed flow requirements, aimed at providing dry-year and
26 sequential dry-year relief.
27

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

247. A more lenient flow regime in dry, critically dry and sequential dry and critical
years is a feasible, reasonable and obvious means of reducing or eliminating environmental
effects of the Project. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15370 [Mitigation includes minimizing

4 impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action].)

5 F. Improper Reliance on Groundwater as Mitigation
248.- Reliance on groundwater as the primary means of mitigating Project impacts is

7 shortsighted, unrealistic, and unsustainable, and therefore does not constitute actual mitigation.

8 249. Subbasins within the Project area are already in a chronic state of overdraft, and

9 groundwater recharge depends on surface water diversions applied to land, which are cut back
10 under the Project. For the Modesto Subbasin, increased dependence on groundwater a is a step
11 backwards that threatens to undo the progress made toward sustainability through conjunctive
12 use. Over time, reduced surface water supplies will make sustainability increasingly difficult to
13 -achieve, and local agencies foreseeably will exercise their authority under SGMA to severely
14 restrict groundwater pumping as compared to existing levels.
15 G. Improper Reliance on Unformulated Groundwater Management Plans
16 250. SGMA Groundwater Sustainability Plans ("GSPs") do not yet exist, sO the
17 reliance on SGMA to mitigate Project impacts is a fatal flaw that infects impacts analysis
18 throughout the SED. (Water Code, §§ 10720.7, 10735.2.) The state-imposed deadline for
-19 completion and adoption of GSPs is January 31, 2022, with actual implementation to follow.
20 Even the Modesto Groundwater Subbasin GSP submittal-which is ahead of the required
21 deadline-is not expected until October 2021. In fact, the SED calls local agency action under
22 SGMA "inherent[ly] uncertain[]." (SED, p. 9-69.)

23 251: --Because it relies on unformulated groundwater management plans, the SED is
24 irreparably inadequate. (Preserve Wild Santee v. City of Santee (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260,
25 281 [The SED "is inadequate if success or failure of mitigation efforts may largely depend
26 upon management plans that have not yet been formulated, and have not yet been subject to
27 analysis and review within the [SED]."].)

4 Inadequate Mitigation and Monitoring Plan
252.- Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.

253.CEQA requires the State Water Board to adopt a program for monitoring or
reporting on mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091, subd. (d); 15097, subd. (a)
8 [the public agency shall adopt a program for monitoring or reporting on the revisions and/or
it measures it has imposed to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects to ensure that the
10

11 measures or project revisions are implemented].) "The reporting or monitoring program shall
be designed to ensure compliance during project implementation" (Pub. Res. Code, § 21081.6), 12 and the mitigation measures must be "fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, 13 or other measures." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21081.6, subd. (b); CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. 14
(d).)
15 254. The State Water Board's Draft Mitigation and Monitoring Plan is wholly 16 inadequate. It substitutes implementable mitigation and concrete program for monitoring 17 such mitigation measures, as required by law, with a single general promise to "ensure that
18 reservoir levels upstream of the rim dams do not cause significant impacts," and only in
19 connection with imposing carryover storage on Don Pedro and other dams.
20 255. Such deferred mitigation, which is "nonexclusive, undefined, untested and of
21 unknown efficacy" does not satisfy CEQA's requirements, which require analysis of impacts
22 and the "formulat[ion] [of] mitigation measures to minimize or avoid those impacts…during 23 the [SED] process, before the Project was brought to the [State Water Board] for final 24 approval." (Communities for a Better Env't v. City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 25 93-96 [emphasis in original]; see also Federation of Hillside and Canyon Ass'ns v. City of Los
26 Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1262 [finding mitigation inadequate where city did not 27 make a binding commitment to implement the mitigation measures, and the mitigation 28

measures were not "incorporated into the project or required as a condition of project approval
•in a manner that [would] ensure their implementation." [emphasis added].)
256.. The State Water Board's purported mitigation is merely a generalized goal that

4 places the onus of mitigation to a future plan and leaves the public in the dark about what

5 management steps will be taken or what specific criteria or performance standard will be met.
257. The State Water Board should have deferred approval of the Project until
proposed mitigation measures were fully developed, clearly defined, and made available to the

8 public for review and comment.

12 Inadequate Project Description
258.
13 "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

14 informative and legally sufficient [SED]." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71

15 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) Additionally, the entire project being proposed must be described in the

16 SED, and the project description must not minimize project impacts. (City of Santee v. County

17 of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1450.) A project description must include all

18 relevant aspects of the project, including reasonably foreseeable future activities that are part of

19 the project. (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of the University of California

20 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376.) Without an accurate description of the project or its environmental

21 setting, the SED cannot achieve the foremost objective of CEQA, that is, the disclosure and

22 analysis of project related impacts on the environment.

23 259.. Here, the SED has been unstable, and therefore unlawful. For most of the

24 administrative process leading up to the Final Plan Amendments and Final SED, the project

25 description included a brief statement that the proposed project would create a new Lower San

26 Joaquin River Flow Objective for the protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses and an

27 associated program of implementation. However, the project description impermissibly

28 omitted key Project components that were embedded in the program of implementation, such as
69

carryover storage requirements, minimum reservoir storage levels, and flow shifting all of

:2 which the State Water Board asserts are necessary to achieve Project objectives. And, indeed,

3 the State Water Board affirmatively denied that operational controls on Don Pedro and other

4 dams were part of the Project until the Board released the Final Plan Amendments and Final

5 SED.

6 260. Inconsistency in project descriptions confuses the public and the commenting
agencies, thus vitiating the usefulness of the process "as a vehicle for intelligent public a

8 participation." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 197-198.)
Because the SED does not include a sufficient project description, the State Water Board failed
10 to proceed in a manner required by law.

14 Unlawful Notice of Preparation
261.
15 Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.
16
262.
17 CEQA mandates the Board send a "notice of preparation" ("NOP") to the Office

18 of Planning and Research and to each responsible and trustee agency, stating that an EIR or

19 SED will be prepared. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15082, subd. (a).) The Notice, at a minimum,

20 must include a description of the project, the location of the project, and the probable

21 environmental effects of the project in order to put the public and regulated community on

22 notice about the Board's intended action. (CEQ Guidelines, § 15082, subd. (a)(1).)
263.
23 The State Water Board's 2009 NOP and 2011 NOP both failed to indicate that

24 the Board was reviewing or amending the geographic reach of the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan to

25 include the San Joaquin River system from its confluence with the Merced River to Vernalis,

26 including the Three Tributaries. The 2009 NOP and 2011 NOP were further deficient for their

27 failure to mention consideration of flow objectives on the Three Tributaries.

264. A crucial component of a properly prepared NOP is an accurate project
description. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15082, subd. (a)(1).) Had a proper notice been circulated,

3 other consulted agencies have 30 days to provide the State Water Board with a response that

4 identifies significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigations measures,

5 that those agencies "will need to have explored in the draft EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15082,
6 subd. (b)(1)(a).) The regulations recognize that this dialogue may result in a draft document
that "need[s] to be revised or expanded to conform to [those] responses . . ."(CEQA

8 Guidelines, § 15082, subd. (a)(4).) In this case, the illegal NOP prohibited other agencies from
providing fulsome responses on the ultimate project prior to and/or during the preparation of
10 the SED. This lack of communication resulted in a fatally flawed impact analysis, an
11 insufficient alternatives analysis, and a legally and scientifically insufficient document.

15 Failure to Respond to Comments

16 265. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.
17
266.
18 Pursuant to the State Water Board's regulatory program for implementing

19 CEQA, "The board shall prepare written responses to the significant environmental issues

20 raised in the comments received during the written comment period, including written

21 comments, and oral comments received at the public hearing if the public hearing is held prior

22 to the close of the written comment period." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, § 3779, subd. (d).)

23 267.  Here, the State Water Board did not meet its regulatory obligations because it

24 improperly foreclosed public comments on the WaterFix at the five public hearings preceding

25 the release of the Final SED, thereby precluding any response to or consideration of such

26 stakeholder comments on the topic. Any willingness on the part of the Board to hear comments

27 on the WaterFix after the Final SED had been released, is too little too late and does not mend

28 the legal error committed up to that point.
71
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND

268. The State Water Board should have received and responded to comment on the

3 WaterFix prior to the Final SED because the SED contains an explicit discussion of the
cumulative effects of the proposed WaterFix and the Project. The State Water Board itself,
4 therefore, invited comment on the topic, but refused input, which also had the effect of

5

6 blocking certain public's and stakeholders' efforts to exhaust administrative remedies and
submit information to the record.

8 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15000 et seq.)

10

• 0•. Failure to Recirculate the SED and Plan Amendments

11 269. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth

12 herein.

13 270. CEQA mandates recirculation of the SED following significant changes to the

14 Project. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) The final amended Water

15 Quality Control Plan released on July 6, 2018 contains at least three significant changes that

16 have not undergone public review.

17 271. First, the Final Plan Amendments establish year-round flow and operational :

18 requirements on Don Pedro and other dams. Specifically, they require that flows provided to

19 meet the numeric objectives shall be managed in a manner to avoid causing significant adverse

20 impacts to fish and wildlife beneficial uses at other times of the year.

0 272. Second, the Final Plan Amendments provide for the imposition of water

22 temperature targets to meet biological goals, which also would be necessarily borne by dam

23 operators through carryover storage and refill requirements to control for the temperature of

24 releases.

25 273. The impacts of these two additional requirementsor of any regulation of dam

26 operations, for that matter-were not analyzed by the State Water Board or reviewed by the

27 public and stakeholders prior to final adoption of the Plan Amendments.

28
72
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

274. Third, the Final Plan Amendments explicitly set the stage for reassigning

2 responsibility for salinity control in the Delta. They state that the State Water Board will

3 amend DWR's and USBR's water rights to require the implementation of the interior southern

4 Delta salinity water quality objectives consistent with the Bay-Delta Plan. The State Water

5 Board may also consider the responsibility of others for implementing the interior southern

6 Delta salinity objective based on implementation or completion of the Comprehensive

7 Operations Plan.

8 275. Such a drastic change to the longstanding allocation of responsibility for salinity
control (and to the Plan Amendments) demands recirculation of the SED for public and
10 stakeholder vetting.

11 276. A failure to recirculate the SED to evaluate these significant new regulations on
12 dam operations and water rights holders amounts to a procedural injury to MID that cannot be
13 undone. These new obligations will have significant impacts to environmental resources and

14 beneficial uses in the Project area which must be analyzed and properly disclosed under CEQA.
15 (Memphis Light, Gas & Water Div. V. Craft (1978) 436 U.S. 1.)

16 277. The only remedy is to set aside the SED with instructions to produce for public
17 comment a legally adequate draft.

20 Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
21 278. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
22 herein.
23 279. CEQA prohibits the State Water Board from approving the Project where the
24 SED identifies one or more significant environmental effects of the Project unless the State
25 Water Board makes written findings for each of the significant effects, accompanied by a
26 rationale for each finding. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.) The findings must be supported by
27 substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.)

1 280. When the State Water Board approves a project which will result in the

2 occurrence of significant effects that are identified in the final SED, but which are not avoided

3 or substantially lessened, the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its

4 action based on the final SED and/or other information in the record. The statement of

5 overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA

6 Guidelines, § 15093.)

7 281. Here, the Statement of Overriding Considerations is defective because there is

8 not substantial evidence in the record to support the State Water Board's claim that the Project

9 will in fact create specific benefits to fish or the Bay-Delta ecosystem, or that the Project will
10 result in temperature benefits for Salmon when the Project itself causes adverse temperature
11 impacts in salmon migration paths. (Sierra Club v. Contra Costa Cnty. (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th
12 1212, 1223-1224.) Indeed, the Findings highlight that the Project will result in increases in
13 water temperature and reductions in overall available habitat, causing significant cumulative
14 impacts on biological resources in the extended Plan Area.

15 282. Even assuming the benefits could be realized by Project implementation (which
16 they cannot), the Statement of Overriding Considerations merely lists the benefits without ever
17 engaging in the weighing required by the CEQA Guidelines to rationalize the decision to go

18 forward with the Project despite significant adverse impacts.

19 283. The Findings state that significant impacts to agricultural resources and
20 groundwater resources are unavoidable. These conclusions are not supported by substantial

21 evidence because they do not consider alternatives or mitigation (such as that proposed by the
22 Framework and Tuolumne River voluntary agreement) that would require less flow, or that
23 would disperse impacts by regulating more than six senior water rights holders.
24 284. The stated Project benefits in the Statement of Overriding Considerations and
25 accompanying Findings are not supported by substantial evidence, and therefore the Board's

26 reliance on them to conclude that the Project benefits outweigh its adverse impacts is arbitrary
27 and capricious.

6 A person may not be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of

7 law. (Cal. Const. Art. 1, § 7; U.S. Const. 14th Amend., § 1.)

8 287. It is a fundamental principle of water law that one may not withdraw water from

9 its source without first acquiring "water rights." (Water Code, §§ 102, 1052; Racanelli, supra,

10 182 Cal.App.3d, at p. 100.)

11 288. Once rights to use water are acquired, they become vested property rights.

12 (Racanelli, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d, at p. 101.) Accordingly, one's water rights cannot be

13 infringed by others or taken by governmental action without due process of law. (Racanelli,

14 supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at p. 101.)

15 289. The water rights held by MID include pre-1914 appropriative water rights,17 and

16 are vested property rights that cannot be infringed or otherwise taken by government action

17 without due process of law, including notice and the opportunity to be heard.

18 290. Because water rights are vested property rights, the State Water Board's

19 amendment of water rights is an adjudicatory function. (Racanelli, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d, at

20 p. 113 ("[I]n undertaking to allocate water rights, the Board performs an adjudicatory

21 function.").

22 291. The State Water Board's adoption of Plan Amendments, and specifically the

23 LSJR Flow Objectives and Vernalis Flow Objectives, violated the due process rights of MID

24 because the flow objectives are framed so narrowly that they amount to an adjudication of

25 17 California recognizes two types of appropriative water rights: pre-1914 and post-1914. 26 Commencing December 19, 1914, the California Legislature created a statutory scheme which

27 provides a procedure for obtaining appropriative water rights, requiring that permits be

28 obtained. Prior to that date, the acquisition of appropriative water rights did not involve any State regulatory agency.
75

MID's water rights. Specifically, as described further above (see, e.g., paragraphs 103-104),

2 the Plan Amendments can only be implemented by reducing or otherwise constraining the
3 water rights of MID, and requiring MID to sacrifice significant amounts of water on an annual

4 basis.

5 292. In fact, the State Water Board admits in the Bay-Delta Plan that it construes the
6 establishment of objectives for flow and operations to be an exercise of the Board's allocation

7 authority under section 101(g) of the Clean Water Act.18

8 293. Moreover, the State Water Board's year-round wholesale regulation of dam

9 operations under the Project amounts to unlawful State control of the Districts' Don Pedro Dam

10 and reservoir, and outright appropriation without compensation for Don Pedro storage capacity

11 and other related property rights.

12 294. In adopting the Plan Amendments, the State Water Board subverted numerous

13 due process protections, including the requirement of directed notice, the opportunity to be
14 heard, the ability to present and rebut evidence, and the right to cross examine. (Cal. Code
15 Regs., tit. 23, § 648, subd. (b); Gov. Code, § 11425.10, subd. (a)(1); Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5,
16 subd. (b).) Due process requires MID to have an opportunity for a hearing prior to the
17 deprivation of these significant property interests.
18 295. In adopting the Plan Amendments, the State Water Board also violated MID's
19 due process right to an impartial hearing in an adjudicative proceeding, and Code of Civil
20 Procedure section 1094.5 fair hearing standards. Because the flow objectives can only be met
21 by six senior water rights holders, the flow objectives, as designed, evidence the State Water

22 Board's unlawful prejudgment and bias with regard to the outcome of the forthcoming water

24 18 It is the policy of Congress that the authority of each State to allocate quantities of water

10 THIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Violation of the Rule of Priority

12 296. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
13 herein.

14 297. The Plan Amendments partition the Three Tributaries for regulation and identify
15 compliance points below the rim dams on each Tributary, which has the effect of isolating only
16 six of the most senior water rights holders in the State, including MID, to contribute water to
17 instream flows and temperature targets, while exempting all other junior rights holders in the

18 Project area. This is a clear violation of California's most fundamental water rights law, the
19 Rule of Priority. 19 Moreover, MID possesses pre-1914 water rights, and the State Water Board
20 has no jurisdiction to regulate pre-1914 water rights. (Young v. State Water Resources Control
21 Board (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 397, 404; Water Code, § 1831, subd. (6).)

22

23 19 "California operates under a 'dual' or hybrid system of water rights which recognizes both doctrines of riparian rights and appropriative rights." (Racanelli, supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at 24 p.101.) "[A]ppropriation rights are subordinate to riparian rights so that in times of shortage
25 riparians are entitled to fulfill their needs before appropriators are entitled to any use of the water." (Id. at pp. 101-102.) Between appropriators, "the rule of priority is first in time, first
26 in right' [where] [t]he senior appropriator is entitled to fulfill his [or her] needs before a junior appropriator is entitled to use any water." (Id. at p. 102.) "Every effort... must be made to 27 respect and enforce the rule of priority." (El Dorado Irr. Dist. v. State Water Res. Control Bd.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 298. The Plan Amendments' flow objectives violate the Rule of Priority as it applies

2 across the Bay-Delta watershed, and as it applies across the Three Tributaries. With regard to

3 users across the Bay-Delta Watershed, the State Water Board adopted the LSJR Flow Objective

4 for the purported purpose of protecting fish and wildlife throughout the entire San Francisco
5 Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, and therefore should have considered the

6 thousands of junior water users across the same geographic region when determining water

7 right priority. Junior water rights holders, including on the west side of the San Joaquin River,

8 the Upper San Joaquin River, other tributaries to the San Joaquin River, South Delta diverters,

9 and the SWP and CVP operators were unlawfully excluded from consideration.
10 299. The SED recognized that Delta exports would increase by an average of 76,000
11 acre feet annually under 40% unimpaired flow. However, expert analysis demonstrates that the
12 increase could be significantly higher than the number reported in the SED when the WSE

13 modeling constraints used by State Water Board-such as carryover storage, refill criteria and
14 flow shiftingare eliminated.

15 300. Reclamation and DWR, as operators of the CVP and SWP, are some of the most
16 junior water rights holders in the entire Bay-Delta system. It is a violation of water right
17 priority to require senior water rights holders on the Three Tributaries to reduce diversions for

18 the supposed benefit of fish migrating through the Delta, while simultaneously creating a
19 situation that allows for additional diversions by the junior CVP and SWP operators in the
20 Delta.

21 301. This particular violation of the Rule of Priority is magnified by the Project's
22 reassignment of responsibility for salinity control from Reclamation and DWR to the MID and

23 the other select senior rights holders. (See, supra, paragraphs 274-275.) The Plan
24 Amendments implement salinity objectives through the Lower San Joaquin River flow

25 objectives, which will increase inflow of low salinity water into the southern Delta during

26 February through June and thereafter under adaptive implementation to prevent adverse effects

to fisheries. This directly subverts MID's water rights, calling upon MID before junior rights

2 holders to provide the water sufficient for salinity control.

3 302. With regard to water users across the Three Tributaries, the State Water Board's

4 requirement of contribution percentages from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers

5 when flows are insufficient to meet the Vernalis Flow Objective itself violates the Rule of

6 Priority. The percentages were established without considering the fact that water users on

7 each of the Three Tributaries have different priority levels. The Board cannot require
8 contributions in accordance with these percentages because they are not based on water right

9 priority.

10 303. Petitioner requests that this Court issue a Writ of Mandate to the State Water

11 Board directing the Board to commence further proceedings to eliminate the LSJR Flow
12 Objectives, or to amend the Bay-Delta Plan's flow objectives to comply with the Rule of
13 Priority.

14 FOURTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Cal. Const. Art. 1, § 19; U.S. Const. 5th Amend.)

16 Inverse Condemnation / Physical Taking

17 304. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.
18
305.
19 The California and United States Constitutions guarantee property owners "just

20 compensation" when their private property is taken for a public use. (Jefferson Street Ventures,

21 LLC v. City of Indio (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 1175, 1192; see Mt. San Jacinto Community

22 College Dist. v. Superior Court (2007) 40 Cal.4th 648, 653 [addressing the California

23 Constitution].) The California Constitution provides: "Private property may be taken or

24 damaged for a public use and only when just compensation.has first been paid to…the

25 owner." (Cal. Const., art. I, § 19.) The federal Constitution provides that private property shall

26 not "be taken for public use without just compensation." (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) By

27 including damage to property as well as its taking, California "protects a somewhat broader

28 range of property values' than does the corresponding federal provision." (San Remo Hotel v.
79
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 City and County of San Francisco (2002) 27 Cal.4th 643, 664; Herzberg v. County of

2 Plumas (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1, 13.) However, "the takings clause in the California

3 Constitution is 'construed congruently with the federal clause.'* (San Remo Hotel, supra, 27

4 Cal.4th, at p. 664.)

5 306. The Plan Amendments constitute physical taking of MID's property, without
6 just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States and Article I,

7 Section 19 of the California Constitution.

8 307. In particular, the Plan Amendments alter and diminish MID's water rights, and

9 permit the State to take MID's water, in which MID has a vested property right, for public use
10 without just compensation. It is well established that water rights are real property rights,
11 which enjoy Constitutional protections. (San v. Bernardino v. Riverside (1921) 186 Cal.7, 13;
12 San Francisco v. Alameda County (1936) 5 Cal.2d 243, 245-247; Wright v. Best (1942) 19
13 Cal.2d 368, 382 [An appropriative right is an interest in real property.]; Racanelli, supra, 182

14 Cal.App.3d, at p. 101.)

15 308. In addition, the Plan Amendments' restrictions on dam operations, such as

16 carryover storage and refill requirements, result in permanent inundation and thus a permanent
17 physical invasion of the reservoir capacity behind Don Pedro Dam, thereby interfering with and
18 substantially disrupting MID's property interest in the Dam and reservoir storage space.
19 309. The State Water Board, purportedly acting under the authority of the Water
20 Code, did appropriate, allocate, and take the property of MID and its water users for the
21 purpose of dedicating it to a public use, namely to increase instream river flows and decrease

22 water temperatures for the Central Valley fall-run Chinook Salmon. The State Water Board

23 has failed and refused to pay MID just compensation for the taking of their property, in
24 violation of the California and federal Constitutions.

25 310. MID exhausted all of its administrative remedies prior to filing this action.

26 311. As a direct and proximate result of the acts and omissions of the State Water
27 Board, MID has been damaged in at least the amount of the fair market value of lost water

28
80
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 diversions, the lost operational value and reservoir storage capacity of Don Pedro Dam, and the

2 loss in value of MID's water rights, the precise amounts of which have not yet been
3 ascertained.

4 312. As a direct and proximate cause of the taking of their property without just

5 compensation, MID has been required to and have retained the services of counsel to prosecute

6 this action and have and will incur attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and costs and expenses

7 of litigation in an amount as yet unascertained.

8 FIFTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Cal. Const. Art. 1, § 19; U.S. Const. 5th Amend.)

10 Inverse Condemnation / Regulatory Taking

11 313. Petitioner realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
herein.
12
314.
13 The Plan Amendments constitute a regulatory taking of MID's property, without

14 I just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States and Article I,
Section 19 of the California Constitution. 15
315. 16 "[GJovernment regulation of private property may, in some instances, be SO

17 onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster-and ... such

18 'regulatory takings' may be compensable under the Fifth Amendment." (Lingle v. Chevron

19 U.S.A. Inc. (2005) 544 U.S. 528, 537.)

316.
20 The Plan Amendments invade MID's property rights, as they have the effect of

21 prohibiting MID from diverting water for agricultural and municipal purposes pursuant to its

22 vested rights, causing a direct and proximate injury to MID in the form of decreased revenues

23 and decreased value of the water right, and to landowners and consumptive users within MID's

24 service area caused by the loss of water and effects of that loss.

317.
25 The operational constraints on Don Pedro Dam also amount to a denial of and

26 interference with the highest and best use and enjoyment of such private property; further, they

27 are akin to damage to the Don Pedro Dam in that the operational constraints preclude the Dam

28
81
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

1 from operating as designed. As a result, they permanently lower economic value and

2 investment backed expectations in the Dam and its operations.

3 318. The State Water Board, purportedly acting under the authority of the Water

4 Code, did appropriate, allocate, and take the property of MID and its water users for the

5 purpose of dedicating it to a public use, namely to increase instream river flows and decrease

6 water temperatures for the Central Valley fall-run Chinook Salmon. The State Water Board

7 has failed and refused to pay MID just compensation for the taking of their property, in

8 violation of the California and federal Constitutions.

9 319. The Plan Amendments further interfere with investment-backed expectations
10 created by and reflected in surface water delivery and reservoir storage agreements, such as the

11 ARTDA and the Fourth Agreement.

12 320. MID exhausted all of its administrative remedies prior to filing this action.
13 321. As a direct and proximate result of the acts and omissions of the State Water

14 Board, MID has been damaged in at least the amount of the fair market value of lost water

15 diversions, the lost operational value and reservoir storage capacity of Don Pedro Dam, and the

16 loss in value of MID's water rights, the precise amounts of which have not yet been
17 ascertained.

18 322. As a direct and proximate cause of the taking of their property without just
19 compensation, MID has been required to and have retained the services of counsel to prosecute
20 this action and have and will incur attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and costs and expenses
21 of litigation in an amount as yet unascertained.

22 SIXTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Declaratory Relief

24 323. MID realleges and incorporates all previous allegations as if fully set forth
25 herein.

26 324. MID is without a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

27 law to compel Respondent to comply with the legal requirements described herein.

28
82
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,
AND APPLICATION FOR STAY

I 325. MID has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury unless and until

2 this Court enjoins the State Water Board from adopting, implementing, and enforcing the Plan
3 Amendments.

4 326. An actual controversy has arisen between Petitioner and Respondent.

5 327. A judicial declaration is necessary sO that the parties may ascertain their rights

6 in this controversy.

IX. PRAYER
O WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief:
-. l. For a stay, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction enjoining the State
11 Water Board's adoption, implementation, and enforcement of the Plan Amendments;
12 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, directing Respondent State Water
13 Board to:

14 a. Vacate and set aside its December 12, 2018 adoption of Resolution No. 2018-
15 0059, approving and adopting amendments to the 2006 Water Quality Control

19 the physical environment, including but not limited to imposing conditions on
20 15885 Petitioner's FERC license via the Clean Water Act section 401 process to
implement Plan Amendments, until Respondent has complied with all
requirements of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21168.9;

C. Comply with the U.S. and California Constitutions, CEQA and CEQA
Guidelines, the State Water Board's certified regulatory program implementing
25 CEQA, and all other applicable laws and regulations as they pertain to this
