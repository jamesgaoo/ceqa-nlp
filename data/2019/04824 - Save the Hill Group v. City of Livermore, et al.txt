5 complained of without the support of substantial evidence.

6 THEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

7 H. To set aside and vacate Respondent City of Livermore's certification of the EIR

8 for the Residential Housing Development known as Lafferty Communities at
9 Garaventa Hills and its approval of the 2018 Revised Project, the Findings, and the

14 Project.

15 J. To prepare a legally adequate EIR;

23 Petition for Writ of Mandate

I. Inadequate Compensatory, Deferred Mitigation

2 117. According to the EIR, the Project will result in the permanent loss of 31.78 acres

3 of upland, grassland habitat, vernal pools, seasonal wetlands, knolls, and saline sink. To mitigate

4 these impacts, the EIR directs Lafferty to obtain offsite compensatory habitat at a 9:1, 10:1, or

5 11:11 mitigation ratio (acres preserved: acres disturbed), depending on the location of the

6 mitigation site, as recommended in the East Alameda County Conservation Strategy. "Final

7 replacement ratios shall be based on the assessed functions and values of an agency approved

8 mitigation site."

9 118. At 85 acres, the Bluebell Site is much smaller than the 286.02 to 349.58

10 compensatory acres required by the EIR.

11 119. Mitigation measures must be enforceable and definite and not speculative or

12 deferred. The City's failure to fully compensate for the loss of critical habitat in the EIR by

13 identifying specific habitat available for conservation requires additional consideration by the

14 agency.

15 120. The Bluebell Site is not adequate to provide compensatory mitigation for the

16 Project Site because it is located downstream of the Project Site. Thus, water carrying carry

17 pollution from the Project Site will flow downstream into the Bluebell Site during and after
18 construction of the Project.

19 121. The Bluebell Site is not adequate to mitigate the significant impact to the Vernal

20 Pool Fairy Shrimp because the BlueBell Site is also part of the federal designation of critical

21 habitat for this federally-listed threatened species and is therefore already protected and not

22 additive. Destroying the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp's critical habitat and then mitigating that

23 permanent loss by preserving land that is already protected under the Federal Endangered Species

24 Act does not constitute compensatory mitigation, as the land is already protected.

25 122. The Bluebell Site is not suitable for development, rendering it inadequate

26 compensatory habitat, because according to the Garaventa family in their public comments to the

27 City, "We can't build on [the Bluebell Site] due to an in danger [sic] plant aka "Bird's Beak."

28 123. Compensatory mitigation land should be land conserved under threat of

22 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 has secured compensatory mitigation land at the Bluebell Site and will obtain additional

2 compensatory land at some unknown time in the future.

3 108. The EIR fails to analyze the significant environmental impacts of this mitigation

4 measure on biological resources and instead impermissibly evaluates the mitigation measure as a

5 part of reducing the significant environmental impact to the Project Site.

6 H. Failure to Adequately Mitigate Loss of Critical Habitat with Unenforceable, Inadequate Mitigation Measures
7
109. Under CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(a)(2), "[m]itigation measures must be
8 fully enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally-binding instruments."

110. The Project Site is designated as critical habitat for the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp,
10 a species listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act.
11
111. The Project Site also supports several additional species listed as threatened,
12 endangered, or special status under the California or Federal Endangered Species Acts.
13
112. The EIR inadequately mitigates the Project's significant environmental impacts on
14 the watershed, threatened and endangered species, and Altamont Creek during construction by
15 requiring the imposition of Best Management Practices and compliance with a Storm Water
16 Pollution Prevention Plan. Compliance with basic regulatory requirements for stormwater control
17 is insufficient mitigation for the permanent loss of critical habitat.
18
113. The EIR inadequately mitigates the Project's permanent alteration of the Project
19 Site by requiring Lafferty to obtain an incidental take permit from the appropriate wildlife agency.
20
114. Incidental take permits authorize : permittee to kill a threatened or endangered
21 species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful
22
activity.
23
115. Because destruction of federally-designated critical habitat and the take of
24 endangered species is the purpose of the Project, Lafferty may never be able to obtain the
25 necessary incidental take permit to comply with this mitigation measure.
26
116. The City failed to adequately investigate and consider alternatives to compensatory
27 mitigation for the permanent loss of this habitat.
28

21 Petition for Writ of Mandate

103. The City's responses to public comments failed on numerous accounts, including,

2 but in no way limited to failing to address and simply dismissing concerns from the public and
3 public agencies concerns regarding the new pedestrian bridge that was never analyzed as part of

4 the EIR process. (Comments C-5, C-6, C-8, E-1, J-E-10, O-7, O-12, E-2, E-4, E-5, E-7, and

5 associated Community Comments listed on page 27-2 of the Re-Issued EIR).

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Failure to Mitigate Significant Environmental Impacts)

8 G. Failure to Evaluate Significant Environmental Impacts of Mitigation Measure
104.
9 CEQA Guidelines section 15370 provides that "Mitigation" includes:

10 a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.

11 b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation. 12 c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the impacted
13 environment.

14 d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.
15 e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or
16 environments, including through permanent protection of such resources in the form of conservation easements.
17
105. CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(a)(1)(D) states "if a mitigation measure would 18 cause one or more significant effects in addition to those that would be caused by the project as 19 proposed, the effects of the mitigation measure shall be discussed." (Stevens v. City of 20 Glendale(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 986; Lotus v. Dept. of Trans. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645.) 21
106. As mitigation for the permanent loss of the Project Site, the EIR requires that 22 Lafferty place an 85-acre property in the Springtown Alkali Sink, also owned by the Garaventa
23 family, under a permanent conservation easement with an endowment for restoration and
24 management in perpetuity. The mitigation parcel is located north of Scenic Avenue between
25 Bluebell Avenue and Broadmoor Avenue (the "Bluebell Site").
26
107. In the EIR, the City authorizes Lafferty to permanently destroy critical habitat for 27 the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp and other listed threatened and endangered species because Lafferty 28

20
Petition for Writ of Mandate

96. The EIR fails to adequately investigate and evaluate the impacts of placing the

2 Project Site under the protection of a permanent conservation easement through expenditures of

3 the Dougherty Valley Settlement Fund.

4 E. Failure to Adequately Consider Alternative Locations

5 97. Under CEQA Guideline section 15126.6(f)(2)(A), the "key question and first step

6 in analysis is whether any of the significant effects of the project would be avoided or substan-

7 tially lessened by putting the project in another location. Only locations that would avoid or

8 substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project need be considered for inclusion in

9 the EIR."

10 98. If the lead agency concludes that no feasible alternative locations exist, "it must

11 disclose the reasons for this conclusion, and should include the reasons in the EIR. For example,

12 in some cases there may be no feasible alternative locations for a geothermal plant or mining

13 project which must be in close proximity to natural resources at a given location." (Cal. Code

14 Regs., titl 14, § 15126.6(f)(2)(B).)

15 99. The EIR fails to adequately investigate and consider alternative locations for the

16 Project and fails to disclose the reasons for its failure to consider alternative locations.

17 F. Failure to Respond to Comments

18 100. CEQA requires the County to respond to comments received on the draft EIR.

19 Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15088, "The lead agency shall evaluate comments on

20 environmental issues received from persons who reviewed the draft EIR and shall prepare a

21 written response. The lead agency shall respond to comments received during the noticed

22 comment period and any extensions and may respond to late comments."

23 101. CEQA requires a lead agency to respond to comments received on the draft EIR

24 with good faith, reasoned analysis, to ensure "that stubborn problems or serious criticism are not

25 swept under the rug." (Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment v. County of Los

26 Angeles (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 715, 732.)

27 102. Failure to respond to a single comment is sufficient to invalidate approval of a

28 final EIR. (Flanders Foundation v. City of Carmel-By-the-Sea (2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 603.)

19
Petition for Writ of Mandate

Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553; see also Save Our Residential
2 Environment v. City of West Hollywood (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1745, 1753, fn. 1).)

3 89. In addition, if disapproval of a project "would result in predictable actions by

4 others, such as the proposal of some other project, this 'no project' consequence should be

5 discussed." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6(e)(3)(B).)

6 90. Petitioner, in written and oral public comment, requested that the City investigate

7 and evaluate the effects of changes to the Project Site under the No-Project Alternative, including

8 and not limited to the use of identifiable conservation funds to protect the Garaventa Hills in

9 perpetuity in a permanent conservation easement.

10 91. Funds are available to the City to purchase, in fee, the Garaventa Hills from the

11 owner in order to place the Project Site in permanent conservation status through the Dougherty
12 Valley Settlement Fund. Funds collection pursuant to the Settlement Fund "shall be used for
13 acquisitions, including permanent trails, open space, or agricultural preservation easements," in
14 "areas north of Interstate 580 and east of Collier Canyon Road in Alameda County." When
15 considering acquisitions of real property to preserve, "priority shall be given to purchases in areas
16 containing unique vegetation and/or endangered species habitat."

17 92. The City has used the Dougherty Valley Settlement Funds to purchase habitat

18 similar to the Project Site in the past and is aware of the Fund, its purpose, and its obligation to
19° investigate properties that are candidates for conservation pursuant to the Fund.
20 93. The Garaventa Hills are located in the area north of Interstate 580 and east of

21 Collier Canyon Road in Alameda County in the area designated for protection in the Dougherty
22 Valley Settlement Agreement.

23 94. Despite the availability of conservation funds for the purpose of conserving in
24 perpetuity the Project Site, the City failed to investigate and evaluate this aspect of the No-Project

25 Alternative.

26 95. In discussing the "No-Project" alternative, the EIR simply concludes, "[T]he No-
27 Project, No Development Alternative, has no impacts as it does not propose any changes to the
28 site."

7 man-made structures (i.e. culverts, livestock troughs, spring-boxes, abandoned

8 sheds).

9 G. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, California Red-legged Frogs are

10 currently threatened by loss of habitat from the growth of cities and suburbs,

11 mining, overgrazing by cattle, invasion of nonnative plants, impoundments, water

12 diversions, degraded water quality, and introduced predators, such as bullfrogs.

13 The fragmentation of existing habitat and the continued colonization of existing

14 habitat by nonnative species may represent the most significant current threats to

15 California Red-legged Frogs.

16 86. The EIR fails to evaluate the environmental effects of the permanent loss of this

17 irreplaceable habitat according to the CEQA criteria for thresholds of signficance.

18 D. Failure to Adequately Investigate and Evaluate the No-Project Alternative

19 87. CEQA Guideline section 15126.6(e)(1) requires that the specific alternative of "no

20 project" "shall also be evaluated along with its impact." The purpose of describing and analyzing

21 a no-project alternative is to allow decision makers compare the impacts of approving the

22 proposed project with the impacts of not approving the proposed project.

23 88. Among the factors that may be taken into account when addressing the feasibility

24 of alternatives are "site suitability, economic viability, availability of infrastructure, general plan

25 consistency, other plans or regulatory limitations, jurisdictional boundaries (projects with a

26 regionally significant impact should consider the regional context), and whether the proponent

27 can reasonably acquire, control or otherwise have access to the alternative site (or the site is

28 already owned by the proponent).' (Cal. Code Regs., titl 14 § 15126.6(f)(1); see Citizens of

17 Petition for Writ of Mandate

2 species at any one time. Different pools within or between complexes may provide

3 habitat for the fairy shrimp in alternative years, as climatic conditions vary.

4 B. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the number of Vernal Pool Fairy

5 Shrimp populations have declined primarily because of destruction or degradation

a of vernal pools through development of urban, suburban, and agricultural projects.

7 In addition to direct habitat loss, vernal pool fairy shrimp populations have

8 declined from of a variety of activities that degrade existing vernal pools by

9 altering pool hydrology (water regime). Vernal pool hydrology can be altered by a

10 variety of activities, including the construction of roads, trails, ditches, or canals

11 that can block the flow of water into, or drain water away from, the vernal pool
complex.

12

13 C. The California Tiger Salamander (Ambystoma californiense) is an amphibian in

14 the family Ambystomatidae. This is a large, stocky salamander, with a broad,

15 rounded snout. Its small eyes, with black irises, protrude from its head. The species

16 is restricted to grasslands and low foothills with pools or ponds that are necessary

17 for breeding. Natural breeding areas, mostly vernal pools (a seasonal body of

18 standing water), are being destroyed in the name of development.

19 D. The California Tiger Salamander spends most of its life on land. Actually, "in the

20 land" it lives underground, using burrows made by squirrels and other burrowing

mammals.

21

22 E. According to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the primary cause of the decline of

23 California Tiger Salamander populations is the loss and fragmentation of habitat
from urban development and farming. This includes the encroachment of

24

25 nonnative predators such as bullfrogs, which kill larvae and nonnative salamanders

26 that have been imported for use as fish bait and may out-compete the California
Tiger Salamanders.

States. It ranges in size from 1.5 to 5 inches long (4 to 13 cm). The California Red-

- C. The EIR Fails to Adequately Assess the Threshold of Significance of Environmental Effects to Biological Resources
2 83. The Project Site and development footprint contain unique natural resources,
including federally designated critical habitat for the federally listed Vernal Pool Fairy
4 Shrimp. The Project would permanently destroy 31.78 acres of this habitat. The EIR concludes
5 this impact is insignificant by adopting an impermissibly lenient significance threshold standard
6 that focuses on compensatory mitigation instead of the "substantial effect" threshold contained in
7 the CEQA Guidelines and the cases interpreting CEQA. The CEQA Guidelines provide a project
8 would have a significant effect on the environment if:
9

10 (1) The project has the potential to substantially degrade the quality of the environment; substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or 11 wildlife species; cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below
12 self-sustaining levels; threaten to eliminate a plant or animal
community; substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of
13 an endangered, rare or threatened species; or eliminate important examples of the major periods of California history or prehistory. 14

15 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15065, emphasis added.)

16 84. The permanent destruction of 31.78 acres of upland, grassland hills that support

17 and serve several threatened and endangered species, as described above, will result in substantial

18 reduction in the habitat of several fish and wildlife species, as identified herein, may cause the

19 Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp to drop below self-sustaining levels, threatens to eliminate a Vernal

20 Pool Fairy Shrimp community, and will "restrict the range" of the threatened and endangered

21 animal and plant species identified herein. But neither the EIR nor the assessment of impacts even

22 addresses these criteria.

85. 23 For example, the EIR fails to assess and consider foreseeable impacts to the range

24 of the following federally listed species:

25 A. Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp occur primarily in vernal pools, seasonal wetlands that

26 fill with water during fall and winter rains and dry up in spring and summer.

27 Typically the majority of pools in any vernal pool complex are not inhabited by the

28

15 Petition for Writ of Mandate

cumulative impacts that will result from the permanent loss of the Project Site to the Project Site

2 and the hydrologically connected northern parcel of pristine habitat and the adjacent Garaventa

3 Wetlands Preserve.

4 78. The EIR fails to adequately consider the significant and cumulative environmental

5 impacts to population stability and resiliency for threatened and endangered species living in the

6 Garaventa Hills and instead relies on a time-limited assessment of anticipated environmental

7 impacts during construction activities.

8 79. The EIR's failure to consider the cumulative impacts to population stability and

9 resiliency for these protected species is fatal to the adequacy of the EIR.

10 80. The EIR fails to adequately consider the significant and cumulative environmental
11 impacts to regulated waters that are reasonably foreseeable as a result of the conversion of the

12 Project Site from upland, grassland habitat to a human influenced subdivision. For example, the
13 EIR fails to fully evaluate the cumulative impact increased noise, sewage, wastewater discharges,
14 and other water contaminants such as microplastics will have on the sensitive hydrological and
15 geological area as well as the biological resources in the area.

16 81. The EIR also erroneously finds that "[n]o significant and unavoidable impacts
17 were identified under the Project." The permanent loss of federally designated, critical habitat for
18 the Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp a is a significant unavoidable impact of the selected alternative. The
19 loss of this habitat will permanently and irreversibly injure the population of Vernal Pool Fairy
20 Shrimp.

21 82. The EIR fails to adequately investigate, evaluate, and consider significant

22 environmental and cumulative impacts to biological resources as a result of the permanent loss of

23 a wildlife corridor that runs through the Project Site. By suggesting wildlife can simply reorient
24 themselves around the Project Site, the EIR ignores substantial evidence regarding the effects of

25 habitat fragmentation on wildlife's learned, intergenerational behavior and instincts.

26

27

28

14 Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 capricious, rendering the EIR wholly inadequate.

2 72. In addition to its reliance on untimely data and evidence, the EIR fails to

3 adequately describe the existing environmental conditions at the site by ignoring substantial

4 evidence of the observed presence of several specially protected biological resources, such as the

5 California Red-Legged Frog, Burrowing Owls, Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp, San Joaquin Kit Fox

6 and instead evaluates these species as "potentially" supported by the existing habitat.

7 73. The EIR fails to accurately characterize the baseline for the 2018 Revised Project

8 because the Project as originally conceived in the Draft EIR has changed significantly multiple

9 times, both formally and informally, during the eight years since it was originally conceived. The

10 unstable project description has caused confusion among the public and staff and constitutes a

11 violation of CEQA.

12 74. The EIR fails to adequately characterize the baseline for the 2018 Revised Project

13 because it did not include accurate visual simulations of the aesthetic impacts of the Project. The

14 City exclusively evaluated visual simulations from the perspective of future residential homes

15 planned as part of the Project. Visual simulations from the perspective of neighboring

16 communities were requested but never considered as part of the EIR's evaluation of aesthetic

17 impacts.

18 B. Failure to Evaluate Significant and/or Cumulative Impacts to Specially Protected Species, Habitat, and Regulated Waters
19
75. Under CEQA, an environmental impact is significant if it has a "substantial, or a
20 potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions within the area affected
21 by the project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, ambient noise, and objects of
22 historic or aesthetic significance." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15382.)
23
76. Under CEQA, a significant, "cumulative impact" refers to two or more individual
24 effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other
25 environmental impacts. The individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a
26

27 number of separate projects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15355.)

77. The EIR fails to adequately consider the serious significant environmental and

2 observed at the foot of the Garaventa Hills. Recirculation of the EIR is necessary in order to

3 evaluate this new information after the City has evaluated and mitigated for any significant
environmental impacts in a new or supplemental EIR.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Failure to Consider Environmental Impacts)

6 66.

7 Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

67.

8 CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

9 making any formal decisions regarding projects subject to CEQA. (Cal. Code Reg., tit. 14, §

10 15004.) CEQA requires full disclosure of a project's significant environmental effects so that

11 decision-makers and the public are informed of these consequences before the project is

12 approved, to ensure that government officials are held accountable for these consequences.

13 (Laurel Heights Improve. Ass'n of San Francisco v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., (1988) 47
Cal.3d 376, 392.)
14 68.

15 CEQA imposes upon the City a clear, present, and mandatory duty to certify an

16 EIR only if the EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that may

occur.

17 69.

:18 The EIR for the Project fails to comply with these requirements in numerous
respects, including but not limited to, the following:
19 A.

20 Failure to Adequately Evaluate Baseline Conditions
70.

21 Under CEQA section 15125(a), an EIR must include a description of the physical

22 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of

23 preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time environmental

24 analysis is commenced, from both a local and regional perspective.

71.

25 The EIR relies on field reconnaissance investigations in November 2010 and

26 February 2011 to conclude that several threatened and endangered species have the potential to

27 live on the Project Site and the surrounding area. The Draft EIR was issued in November 2012.

28 The City's decision to rely on these nearly decades-old environmental evaluations is arbitrary and

12 Petition for Writ of Mandate

F proponents have declined to implement.

2 58. Long after the circulation of the Draft EIR (nearly seven years), a new alternative

3 to the Project- the 2018 Revised Project-was proposed. The EIR should be recirculated with

4 supporting data regarding this alternative, data which is not included in the staff report packet for

5 the public hearing on the Project.

6 59. For example, in the Draft EIR, the City evaluated a vehicular connector bridge

7 over Altamont Creek, which would have required mitigation measures, a permit from the Army

8 Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, creek realignment, and a Lake and

9 Streambed Alteration Agreement with the Regional Water Resources Control Board.

10 60. The City eliminated the vehicular connector bridge when it issued the Final EIR

11 five years ago, declaring that several mitigation measures would no longer be necessary.

12 61. But then the City added a pedestrian/Emergency Vehicle Access bridge back into

13 the Project when it approved the Re-Issued the Final EIR on April 22, 2019. The City never

14 evaluated the significant environmental impacts of a pedestrian/Emergency Vehicle Access

15 bridge, including increased bicycle and pedestrian traffic in this hydrologically sensitive area.

16 62. In addition, the Re-Issued EIR admits that the pedestrian/EVA bridge "may"

17 require realignment of Altamont Creek but requires no mitigation measures for significant

18 impacts from water quality that will result from potential streambed alteration or runoff.

19 63. The City attempted to cure its failure to recirculate the Draft EIR by holding a

20 "neighborhood meeting" to disclose the changes in the "2018 Revised Project," but such a

21 meeting is inadequate under CEQA.

22 64. The City's decision to NOT require mitigation for the new bridge over Altamont

23 Creek is significant new information requiring recirculation under CEQA Guideline section

24 15088.5.

25 65. In addition, the California Fish & Wildlife Commission finalized its decision to list

26 the a Livermore Tarplant as a threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act after

27 the Draft EIR was issued but before the Re-Issued Final EIR was issued. The City failed to

28 evaluate and consider significant environmental impacts to this endangered plant, which has been

public comments during each public hearing.

2 51. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

3 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate. In the absence of such remedies, the

4 City's approval of the Project will form the basis for a development project that will proceed in

5 violation of state law.

6 52. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
8 Exhibit A.

9 53. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing

10 the City with notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is attached as
11 Exhibit B.

12 54. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
13 attached as Exhibit C.

14 55. Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code give this
15 Court authority to review, set aside, void, or annul a determination, finding, or decision of a
16 public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with the provisions of CEQA.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (Failure to Recirculate Draft EIR)

19 56. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
20 57. According to CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5, a lead agency is required to
21 recirculate an EIR when significant new information is added to the EIR after public notice is
22 given of the availability of the draft EIR for public review but before certification. As used in this
23 section, the term "information" can include changes in the project or environmental setting as
24 well as additional data or other information. New information added to an EIR is not "significant"
25 unless the EIR is changed in a way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to
26 comment upon a substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to
27 mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the project's

45. On August 25, 2018, the City Re-Issued the Final EIR, which evaluated the 2018

2 Revised Project. The Re-Issued Final EIR added the bridge over Altamont Creek back into the

3 Project.

4 46. The City did not recirculate the Re-Issued Final EIR for further written public

5 comment.

6 47. On December 4, 2018, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing to

7 consider the Re-Issued Final EIR and voted unanimously to recommend that City Council

8 approve the Re-Issued Final EIR with the following changes:

9 Reduced the number of units from 47 to 44,
10 Reduced the average size of the units,
Lowered the building pad elevations,
11 Altered the roof forms to provide view corridors,

12 Complied with the standards of the underlying zoning district, Narrowed the road widths,
13 Reduced the height of retaining walls,

14 Provided an emergency vehicle access, pedestrian, and bicycle connector bridge, Provided additional diversity in the proposed housing stock in terms of
15 architecture, colors, and materials, and
Provided new and updated visual simulations of the Project in context with the
16 surrounding developed and natural environments.

17 48. The City Council held a public hearing on April 22, 2019, to consider the Re-
18 Issued Final EIR. After hearing public comment, the City voted to adopt a Resolution approving
19 and adopting the Re-Issued Final EIR, the Findings, and the Mitigation Monitoring Reporting
20 Program. The City certified the Re-Issued Final EIR and approved Lafferty's application to
21 develop the Project that same day.
22 49. On April 23, 2019, the City filed its Notice of Determination with the Alameda
23 County Recorder/Assessor, identifying "Lafferty Communities" as the project applicant.

compatibility with the adjacent Garaventa Wetlands Preserve.

2 39. On June 3, 2015, Lafferty submitted an amended project proposal that included
3 changes to the Project designed to address the Planning Commission's concerns, and on August

4 18, 2015, the Planning Commission voted to recommend that the City Council approve the

5 Project with the following revisions:

6 Replacing a portion of roadway with an Emergency Vehicle Access in order to
7 reduce grading,
Eliminating new landscaping between the Project Site and the Garaventa Wetlands
8 Preserve to preserve the natural grassland condition,

9 Providing a drain system to collect all runoff from the residential lots and convey it to the treatment basin to protect the soil chemistry in the Garaventa Wetlands
10 Preserve,
Constructing a pedestrian/bicycle path that connects to the existing trail south of
11 Bear Creek Drive to link the Project to Altamont Creek Park, and

12 Providing visual simulations of the Project in context with the surrounding developed natural environments.
13
40. In its public remarks, the Planning Commission commended Petitioner for its 14
efforts to preserve the on-site knolls and rock outcrop, and the Planning Commission opened 15

16 these features formally for use by the public.

41. The Planning Commission's recommendations were not incorporated or evaluated 17

18 in the Final EIR, including construction of a pedestrian/bicycle connector bridge over Altamont
Creek.
19
42. On September 14, 2015, the City Council considered the Planning Commission's 20
recommendation to approve Final EIR and adopted Resolution 2015-127 recommending the 21
applicant return to the Planning Commission with a project a that is physically and aesthetically 22

23 more subordinate to the natural landforms/knolls and reduces overall grading and provides

24 secondary emergency vehicle and pedestrian access.

43. The City took no further action on the Final EIR for three years. 25
44.
26 On August 23, 2018, the City held a neighborhood meeting to present more

27 changes to the Project and answer questions. The City characterized the 2018 revisions to the

28 Project as the 2018 Revised Project.

Environmental Impact Report (Draft EIR), which included notice to interested groups and

2 individuals for a 45-day public comment period.

3 32. The Draft EIR included two alternatives to the original proposal: Alternative A:

4 No Project, No Development Alternative (No-Project Alternative); and Alternative B: Reduced

5 Density, Current General Plan Allowance Alternative. The No-Project Alternative assumed no

6 development of the Project Site. Alternative B assumed reduced development of the Project Site

7 in accordance with the current general plan and municipal zoning designation. The proposed

8 Project would have required an amendment to the general plan and zoning designation to allow
for more density than permitted under existing law.

10 33. On December 4, 2012, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing to

11 receive comments on a Draft EIR.

12 34. On December 26, 2012, the public comment period on the Draft EIR was closed.

13 35. In response to direction from City staff, public comments received during the

14 December 4, 2012, Planning Commission public hearing, and written public comments, Lafferty

15 made the following changes to the Project proposal:

16 Reduction in the number of units from 76 to 47,
17 Elimination of the new bridge over Altamont Creek, Preservation of the rock outcrop in the northwest corner of the Project Site, and
18 Provision of an additional one-story floor plan and a one and a one-half story floor

19 plan.

20 36. On June 11, 2014, the City distributed its Final EIR, along with copies of all

21 written and oral comments, responses to those comments, and an appendix containing minor

22 corrections to the Draft EIR.

23 37. The Final EIR eliminated the vehicular connector bridge over Altamont Street and

24 abandoned accompanying Mitigation Measure Traf-3 because it was "no longer applicable" to the

25 Project.

26 38. On July 1, 2014, the Planning Commission recommended that the City Council not

27 approve the Final EIR out of concern for the Project's extensive grading, unknown aesthetic, and

1 a rock outcrop in the northwest corner.

2 26. On January 13 and February 9, 2011, Olberding Environmental, Inc. conducted a

3 jurisdictional delineation to determine the extent of regulated waters of the United States and

4 State of California on the Project Site. Based on this delineation, Olberding found that the Project

5 Site contains .0004-acre of seasonal wetland, 0.484-acre of seasonal swales, 0.025-acre of vernal

6 pools, and 0.36-acre of "other waters" in the form of 1,590 linear feet of Altamont Creek, a "blue

7 line" water feature on the United States Geologic Survey's topographic map for Altamont.2

8 Therefore, the total jurisdictional acreage on the Project Site is 0.873-acre. These features are
regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Regional Water Quality Control Board, and
10 California Department of Fish & Game.

11 27. The regulated waters of the United States and State of California on the Project
12 Site are hydrologically connected to the Garaventa Hills, making them susceptible to runoff from

13 not only construction activities but also future human influences that would result from the

14 routine use of the Project Site as a subdivision.

15 28. Currently, the Project Site is utilized as public open space with a few informal

16 hiking trails and vista points.

17 B. Administrative Approval Timeline

18 29. On November 18, 2011, the City of Livermore issued a Notice of Preparation to

19 solicit comments from public agencies and the public regarding the scope of the EIR for the

20 Project, which then consisted of a proposal to construct seventy-six luxury homes, a new public

21 road, and a vehicular connector bridge at the Project Site.

22 30. On December 7, 2011, the City held a public scoping meeting for public agencies,

23 organizations, and members of the public to review the proposed project and provide comments

24 on the scope of the environmental review process.

25 31. On November 8, 2012, the City published a Notice of Availability of a Draft

2 with hydrologic connection to the adjacent twenty-four-acre Garaventa Wetlands Preserve. The

3 Garaventa Wetlands Preserve is owned and managed by the Livermore Area Recreation and Park

4 District.

5 19. For the past four generations, the Project Site was owned by the Garaventa Family

6 and is commonly referred to as the Garaventa Hills.

7 20. Along with undeveloped land to the north of the Project Site, Garaventa Hills and

1 4. The EIR wholly fails to mitigate the impact of the permanent loss of critical habitat

2 by failing to adequately investigate and evaluate a no-project alternative, when monies were

3 readily available to the City to purchase the upland parcel for placement in permanent

5 qualify for mitigation under CEQA.

6 5. In approving the Project, the City violated CEQA's clear directive to choose no-

7 project as the preferred alternative when mitigation of critical habitat is deemed necessary.

11 7. The EIR fails to adequately consider the permanent loss of a wildlife corridor.

12 8. The EIR fails to adequately consider the long-term, cumulative environmental

13 impact of the permanent loss of seasonal wetland habitat, which the EIR characterizes as a

14 "potentially significant impact."

15 9. The EIR incorrectly determined that "no significant and unavoidable impacts"

16 would occur as a result of the Project because the impact to critical habitat cannot beas the City

17 claims-reduced through implementation of the proposed mitigation measures, which rely on

18 self-reporting and monitoring by the developer instead of providing fully enforceable measures as

19 required by CEQA.

20 10. Petitioner Save the Hill Group brings this action to scek review of Respondent City

21 of Livermore's April 22, 2019, approval of the Project, without fully complying with CEQA.

22 JURISDICTION

23 11. This Court has jurisdiction over this writ of mandate under sections 1085 and

24 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources

25 Code.

Petition for Writ of Mandate

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action involves the City of Livermore's failure to adequately analyze and

3 mitigate anticipated environmental impacts to sensitive habitat for threatened and endangered

4 plants and animals as a result of its approval of entitlements and certification of an Environmental

5 Impact Report (EIR) for the residential housing development known as "Lafferty Communities at

6 Garaventa Hills."1 This residential housing development will be referred to as the "Project"

7 throughout this Petition. In approving the Project, the City has violated the California

8 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code, section 2100, et seq.

9 2. Through its approval of the Project, the City has authorized the construction of

10 forty-four luxury residences, new roads, and a new bridge connection in sensitive, biologically

11 diverse habitat, which will result in the permanent removal of 31.78 acres of upland grasslands.

12 An additional 1.18 acres of this habitat will be temporarily disturbed for construction of a bridge

13 and access road. This upland grassland habitat is hydrologically connected to sensitive alkali

14 wetlands and vernal pools, including the Garaventa Wetlands Preserve, which together provide

15 habitat for many "special status" species under the California Endangered Species Act and

16 Federal Endangered Species Act, including the California Red-legged Frog, California Tiger

17 Salamander, Burrowing Owl, San Joaquin Kit Fox, Western Spadefoot Toad, the Livermore

18 Tarplant, and the Congdon's tarplant. In addition, this parcel of land is designated as critical

19 habitat for the federally-listed threatened Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp.

20 3. The EIR fails to adequately consider existing conditions in the Garaventa Hills and

21 therefore fails to provide an accurate assessment of the Project's impact compared to baseline
22 conditions for "special status" species.

23

24 1 On May 22, 2019, Petitioner's members observed dirt moving and construction equipment in operation at the Project Site. On information and belief, the Project applicant and Real Party in Interest has not had sufficient time
25 to complete required mitigation measures imposed as a condition of the City's approval and certification of the EIR, including conducting necessary pre-construction surveys for the presence of threatened and endangered species and
26 procuring necessary incidental take permits from the state or federal government prior to the destruction of critical habitat or killing of protected species. If this unauthorized construction work continues, Petitioner will seek
27 emergency redress from the Court.
