2 INTRODUCTION

1. On March 26, 2019, the Board of Supervisors for the County of San Luis

4 Obispo ("County") approved an application of Jim McAllister and Laura Gardner for a Minor
Use Permit (DRC2018-00053) for indoor cannabis cultivation of up to 22,000 square feet of

6 mature cannabis canopy; construction of seven 3,060-square-foot greenhouses supporting

7 mature cannabis canopy; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building supporting mature
cannabis canopy and curing and drying; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building
supporting nursey canopy and office space, storage space, curing and drying, and bathrooms;

10 use of two temporary business offices to be used during construction; modification of parking

11 requirements set forth under Section 22.18.050.C.1. of the County's Land Use Ordinance to

12 reduce the required number of parking spaces from 72 to twelve (12); and modification of

13 Section 22.40.050 D.6 of the County's Land Use Ordinance to allow the use of deer fencing

14 and landscaping instead of solid fencing materials to surround the proposed indoor grow area

15 and cannabis activities. The Board of Supervisors' approval was done after a hearing on an

16 appeal of the Project originally approved by a planning department hearing officer. The Board

17 of Supervisors upheld the appeal in part, resulting in some modifications to the Project that do

18 not cure the legal infirmities alleged infra.

19 2. The Project site is located at 6480 York Mountain Road in Templeton, San Luis

20 Obispo County, approximately 0.7 miles north of California State Highway 46 and 7.0 miles

21 west of downtown Templeton in the Adelaida Sub Area of the North County Planning Area.

22 3. The County determined that the Project is not subject to the California
23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"--Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) claiming that the

24 Project is categorically exempt from CEQA under Sections 15303 "New Construction or

25 Conversion of Small Structures" and 15304 "Minor Alterations to Land" of the CEQA

26 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.).

27 4. Petitioners Save York Mountain and Stephanie Shakofsky (*Petitioners")

28 challenge the approval of the Project and adoption of the Categorial Exemptions under CEQA

3 Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125; Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) v. 18 Cal.3d 190,

4 205.

5 5. On March 27, 2019, the County filed a Notice of Exemption, and, pursuant to
6 Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 35 days thereof.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

4 set forth herein.

5 18. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Save

6 York Mountain. Petitioner Save York Mountain has strong interest in the preservation of the
environment. Members of Petitioner Save York Mountain reside in the County of San Luis

8 Obispo, and include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely

11 members. Petitioner Save York Mountain was formed subsequent to Project approval. Its

12 members have expressed their concerns and commented on the Project during the
13 administrative proceedings wherein the Project was considered. Therefore, Petitioner Save

14 York Mountain has exhausted its administrative remedies and has standing pursuant to Public
15 Resources Code Section 21177(c). Accordingly, Petitioner Save York Mountain is an

16 "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177. The claims

26 CEQA compliance and has participated at public hearings. Accordingly, Petitioner Stephanie

27 Shakofsky is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section

28 21177.

1 20. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

2 Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code § 21167; CEQA Guidelines
3 § 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

4 other applicable laws and regulations.

5 IV

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

8 set forth herein.

9 22. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition
10 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

16 V

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]
19 24. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully
20 set forth herein.
21 25. Respondents' determination that the Project is categorically exempt from CEQA 22 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to act in a manner
23 required by law when they determined the Project to be exempt from environmental review 24 under the Class 3, "New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures," and Class 4, "Minor
25 Alterations to Land," CEQA categorical exemptions. The Project, which includes the
26

27 construction of over 30,000 square feet of nine (9) new, large agricultural and office buildings
does not fall within the scope of the categorical exemptions relied upon by Respondents. The
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

F interpretation of the exemption presents a question of law for the Court's independent review.

2 Moreover, Respondents' factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.

3 Therefore, environmental review is required.

4 VI

5 ATTORNEYS' FEES

6 26. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully

7 set forth herein.

8 27. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the

9 People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and

11 Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

VII 12

13 INJUNCTION

14 28. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 27 as if fully

15 set forth herein.

16 29. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

17 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

18 30. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

19 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

20 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

21 31. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

22 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

23 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

24 their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

25 32. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

26 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

27 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

28 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

1 33. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
2 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,
3 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of San Luis Obispo and the State
4 of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions

5 described herein are not set aside.

6 34. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

7 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.
8 35. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
9 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
10 Project and determination of exemption from environmental review.

11

12 PRAYER

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

14 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

16 approval of a Minor Use Permit for cannabis cultivation of up to 22,000 square feet of mature

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On March 26, 2019, the Board of Supervisors for the County of San Luis

4 Obispo ("County") approved an application of Jim McAllister and Laura Gardner for a Minor

5 Use Permit (DRC2018-00053) for indoor cannabis cultivation of up to 22,000 square feet of

6 mature cannabis canopy; construction of seven 3,060-square-foot greenhouses supporting

7 mature cannabis canopy; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building supporting mature

8 cannabis canopy and curing and drying; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building
9 supporting nursey canopy and office space, storage space, curing and drying, and bathrooms;

10 use of two temporary business offices to be used during construction; modification of parking

11 requirements set forth under Section 22.18.050.C.1. of the County's Land Use Ordinance to

12 reduce the required number of parking spaces from 72 to twelve (12); and modification of

13 Section 22.40.050 D.6 of the County's Land Use Ordinance to allow the use of deer fencing

14 and landscaping instead of solid fencing materials to surround the proposed indoor grow area

15 and cannabis activities. The Board of Supervisors' approval was done after a hearing on an

16 appeal of the Project originally approved by a planning department hearing officer. The Board

17 of Supervisors upheld the appeal in part, resulting in some modifications to the Project that do

18 not cure the legal infirmities alleged infra.

19 2. The Project site is located at 6480 York Mountain Road in Templeton, San Luis

20 Obispo County, approximately 0.7 miles north of California State Highway 46 and 7.0 miles

21 west of downtown Templeton in the Adelaida Sub Area of the North County Planning Area.

22 3. The County determined that the Project is not subject to the California

23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA" -Pub. Resources Code 21000 et seq.) claiming that the

24 Project is categorically exempt from CEQA under Sections 15303 "New Construction or

25 Conversion of Small Structures" and 15304 "Minor Alterations to Land" of the CEQA

26 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.).

27 4. Petitioners Save York Mountain and Stephanie Shakofsky (*Petitioners")

28 challenge the approval of the Project and adoption of the Categorial Exemptions under CEQA

3 Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125; Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190,

4 205.

5 5. On March 27, 2019, the County filed a Notice of Exemption, and, pursuant to
6 Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 35 days thereof.

19 the environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and

20 land use policy and decision making. Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky is a resident of the

21 County of San Luis Obispo and is affected by the Project, and whose interests in preservation

22 of the ecological integrity of the County will be adversely affected by the lack of
23 environmental review under CEQA and approval of the Project. Petitioner Stephanie

24 Shakofsky participated at public hearings and submitted comments on the Project.

25 9. Respondent County of San Luis Obispo, through Respondent Board of

26 Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo (collectively, "Respondents"), is a political

27 subdivision of the State of California and has determined the Project to be categorically exempt

28 from CEQA. On March 26, 2019, Respondents approved the Project and determined the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Project to be categorically exempt from the provisions of CEQA.

2 10. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of

3 Does 1-15 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious
4 names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when their identities have been ascertained.

5 11. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

6 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and

7 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency

8 and employment.
9 12. Real Party in Interest, Frank Ricigliano, is an individual and properly named as

2 STANDING

3 17. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 16 as if fully

4 set forth herein.

5 18. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Save

6 York Mountain. Petitioner Save York Mountain has a strong interest in the preservation of the

7 environment. Members of Petitioner Save York Mountain reside in the County of San Luis

8 Obispo, and include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely
9 affected by the violations of CEQA. Approval of the Project and adoption of an exemption

10 from CEQA will adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Save York Mountain and its

11 members. Petitioner Save York Mountain was formed subsequent to Project approval: Its

12 members have expressed their concerns and commented on the Project during the
13 administrative proceedings wherein the Project was considered. Therefore, Petitioner Save

14 York Mountain has exhausted its administrative remedies and has standing pursuant to Public

15 Resources Code Section 21177(c). Accordingly, Petitioner Save York Mountain is an

16 "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177. The claims

17 asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in the litigation by

18 individual members is not required.

19 19. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner

20 Stephanie Shakofsky. Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky is a resident and taxpayer of San Luis

21 Obispo County who is dedicated to preserving the environment of the County of San Luis

22 Obispo as set forth, supra, and is concerned about maintaining the environmental integrity of

23 the County of San Luis Obispo. Approval of the Project and adoption of an exemption from

24 environmental review will adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky.

25 Petitioner Stephanie Shakofsky has submitted comments on and objections to the lack of

26 CEQA compliance and has participated at public hearings. Accordingly, Petitioner Stephanie

27 Shakofsky is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section

28 21177.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

20. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code § 21167; CEQA Guidelines
§ 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

4 other applicable laws and regulations.

5 IV

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 21. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

8 set forth herein.

22. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

10 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

11 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

12 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

13 23. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code co.

14 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on April 30, 2019. (Letter and Proof of Service are

15 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

16 V

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
[Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.]
19 24. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully
20 set forth herein.
21 25. Respondents' determination that the Project is categorically exempt from CEQA
22 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to act in a manner
23 required by law when they determined the Project to be exempt from environmental review
24 under the Class 3, "New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures," and Class 4, "Minor
25 Alterations to Land," CEQA categorical exemptions. The Project, which includes the
26 construction of over 30,000 square feet of nine (9) new, large agricultural and office buildings
27 does not fall within the scope of the categorical exemptions relied upon by Respondents. The
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

1 interpretation of the exemption presents a question of law for the Court's independent review.

2 Moreover, Respondents' factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.
Therefore, environmental review is required.

4 VI

5 ATTORNEYS' FEES

6 26. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully

7 set forth herein.

8 27. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the
People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and

10 Real Parties in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of

11 Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

12 VII

13 INJUNCTION

14 28. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 27 as if fully

15 set forth herein.

16 29. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

17 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

18 30. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

19 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

20 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

21 31. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

22 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

23 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

24 their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

25 32. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
26 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

27 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

28 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

1 33. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
2 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

3 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of San Luis Obispo and the State

4 of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions

5 described herein are not set aside.

6 34. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

7 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

8 35. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
9 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
10 Project and determination of exemption from environmental review.

11

12 PRAYER

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

14 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

15 aside Resolution No. 2019-078 and any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to,

16 approval of a Minor Use Permit for cannabis cultivation of up to 22,000 square feet of mature

17 cannabis canopy; construction of seven 3,060-square-foot greenhouses supporting mature

18 cannabis canopy; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building supporting mature
19 cannabis canopy and curing and drying; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building

20 supporting nursey canopy and office space, storage space, curing and drying, and bathrooms;

21 use of two temporary business offices to be used during construction; modification of parking

25 and landscaping instead of solid fencing materials to surround the proposed indoor grow area

26 and cannabis activities.

27 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in

28 any activity pursuant to the Project until Respondents perform environmental review and the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

4 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Save York Mountain and Stephanie Shakofsky will commence litigation against the County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in approving the Gardener Cannabis Cultivation/Minor Use Permit (Project No. DRC2018-00053), including but not limited to, approval of indoor cannabis cultivation of up to 22,000 square feet of mature cannabis canopy; construction of seven 3,060-square-foot greenhouses supporting mature cannabis canopy; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building supporting mature cannabis canopy and curing and drying; construction of a 4,800-square-foot metal building supporting nursey canopy and office space, storage space, curing and drying, and bathrooms; use of two temporary business offices to be used during construction; modification of parking requirements set forth under Section 22.18.050.C.1. of the County's Land Use Ordinance to reduce the required number of parking spaces from 72 to twelve (12); modification of Section 22.40.050 D.6 of the County's Land Use Ordinance to allow the use of deer fencing and landscaping instead of solid fencing materials to surround the proposed indoor grow area and cannabis activities; and claiming that that the Project is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act.
This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
