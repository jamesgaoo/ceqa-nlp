Respondents

20

21

22 Petitioners Newtown Preservation Society and Wanda Nagel (*Petitioners") petition this
Court for a Writ of Mandate, directed to
23 Respondents El Dorado County and the El Dorado

24 County Board of Supervisors ("Respondents"). Petitioner challenges Respondents' December

25 17, 2018, adoption of the Initial Study Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the

26 Newtown Road at South Fork Weber Creek Bridge Replacement Project, CIP 77122/36105030

27 ("Project"). The Project involves construction of a new bridge to replace the existing

28 Newtown Road bridge over Weber Creek. Petitioner contends that Respondents' approvals for

-

OUAW the Project violate the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section
21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). Petitioners allege as follows:

1. PARTIES

Petitioner Wanda Nagel ("Nagel") is an individual who lives in EI Dorado
a County, California, on a property adjacent to the proposed Project. Nagel's personal, aesthetic,
and property interests will be severely injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside

8 pending full compliance with CEQA and all other environmental laws. Nagel utilizes and

o enjoys the County's and State's natural resources. Nagel brings this petition on behalf of all

10 others similarly situated who are too numerous to be named and brought before this court as

11 petitioners. Nagel is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by,

12 the acts of Respondents as alleged below. Nagel participated in the administrative processes

13 herein, and exhausted its remedies. Accordingly, Nagel has standing to sue.
2.

14 The Newtown Preservation Society ("Society") is an unincorporated association.

15 Its members include, but are not limited to, citizens with interests that will be directly affected

16 and prejudiced by the Project, and has standing to sue. On behalf of its members and other

17 residents of El Dorado County, Petitioner challenges the County's approval of the Project.

18 Society is an organization formed after Project approval to maintain an action against

19 Respondents under CEQA. Petitioner was formed on January 13, 2019.
3.

20 Respondent El Dorado County is a political subdivision of the State of California

21 and a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. El Dorado County is the

22 Project proponent and also the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the

23 Project, El Dorado County is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that

24 describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or

25 alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. The County also has

26 principal responsibility for determining whether projects within its jurisdiction are consistent

27 with applicable land use ordinances and other

4. applicable laws.

28 Respondent El Dorado County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly
authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

2 behalf of the County of El Dorado. Respondent El Dorado County Board of Supervisors is

ooNaAW responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County including, but not limited
to, implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14
California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines"), applicable
land use ordinances and other laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the County,
the Board of Supervisors establishes overall County priorities and sets policy. The Board of
Supervisors is the governing body of the County and is ultimately responsible for reviewing
and approving or denying the Project.

5.

10 Petitioners are unaware of the true names and identities of DOES 1 through 20,

11 and sue such unnamed Respondents by their fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and

12 believe, and based thereon allege, that fictitiously named Respondents also are responsible for
all acts and omissions described above. When the true identities

13 have been determined, Petitioners will, with leave of Court if and capacities of Respondents

14 include such identities and capacities. necessary, amend this Petition to

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 6.

17 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

18 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the
alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant

19 Public Resources Code section 21168. to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and

20 7.

21 Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California

22 in and for the County of El Dorado pursuant to sections 393, 394 and 395 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.

23 BACKGROUND FACTS

24 8.

25 The Project would replace the existing Newtown Road Bridge over South Fork
Weber Creek, in El Dorado County. The

26 acquisition of private property replacement bridge would require significant

27 on either end of the structure. The property that will be

28 acquired or taken by the County currently belongs to Nagel and to the Janice Eppinger Trust
(*Trust"). The Project will also encroach upon conservation easements held by the Wopumnes
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

2 Nisenan-Mewuk Tribe of El Dorado County (*Tribe"). The conservations easements serve to
protect sacred
ooaUAu sites identified on both the Nagel and Trust properties, and allow the Tribe to
conduct Tribal ceremonies, maintenance and site surveys and study.
9. County asserts in the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration
("IS/MND") that the existing bridge is "functionally obsolete," that the bridge does not provide
adequate flood protection, and that the approach to the bridge is "substandard," but the record
does not support any of these conclusions.
10. Throughout the administrative process, Respondents received comment letters

10 and objections to the Project based upon the lack of need for the Project, and raising various
issues relating to the inadequacy of the IS/MND.

11 11.

12 The County was also provided with information from contractors, including a

13 contractor who has completed projects for the County in the past, showing that much smaller

14 new bridge would meet all current design standards but also avoid taking such a significant

15 amount of private property. Despite this information, the County approved the over-sized
Project as proposed. The figures in the IS/MND failed to

16 even identify Nagel's residence,

17 completely overlooking the fact that the massive new bridge would be built immediately
adjacent to her home.

18 12.

19 The IS/MND includes a section on "Utilities and ROW" and completely fails to
disclose that the Project will require permanent easements and
20 that private property will either

21 be acquired or taken by eminent domain for the Project. Section 3.5.2 states that only

22 temporary easements will be necessary, and goes on to say that "[p]ermanent easements may

23 be required for relocating existing utility poles and raising overhead lines." Not a single word

24 is included in the IS/MND about the significant portions of the Nagel and Trust properties that
will have to be acquired by the County for the Project.

25 13. Petitioners and others submitted comments

26 objecting to the Project, and raising

27 concerns about many aspects of the Project including archeological resources, the lack of need
for

28 the project, hydrology, public services, and safety impacts resulting from construction of an

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

2 unnecessary bridge in an extremely sensitive archeological area, and increased risks in the
event of a fire.

ooOA0 14. On December 18, 2018, over Petitioners' objections, the El Dorado County Board
of Supervisors adopted the IS/MND and approved the Project.
15. On December 19,2018, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the
County Clerk of EI Dorado County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

16. Petitioners have performed any and

10 all conditions precedent to filing the instant

11 action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required
by law.

12 17.

13 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code,

14 section 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this

15 written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of

Mandate.

16 18.

17 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

18 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative
proceedings relating to this action.

19 19.

20 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

21 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside

22 their approval of the Project and adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. In the

23 absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of State
law.

24 20.

25 This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

26 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

STANDING -

2 21. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because
09 f 100 00 Petitioners' aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected
by Respondents' adoption of the IS/MND and approval of the Project.
ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

22. Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code
section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to
as the decisions here in overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such

9 question.

- 7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Abuse of Discretion

12 Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.

13 23. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

14 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 22.

15 24. Respondents have bused their discretion and failed to act in the manner required

16 under CEQA with respect to the Project because they have failed to adequately analyze the

17 Project's environmental impacts and failed to identify necessary and feasible mitigation

18 measures. Moreover, substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair

19 argument" that the Respondents' approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to

20 the environment.

21 A Full Environmental Impact Report is Required for the Project

22 25. Substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that

23 the Respondents' approval of the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment,

24 and a full EIR is required. In each of the following areas of impact analysis, the IS/MND and

25 fails to comply with CEQA:

26 A. Impacts to safety:

27 26. The record reveals that the Project will result in residents in the area of the Project

28 being trapped in the event of a wildfire during construction. In response to comments,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 6

. Respondents claimed that evacuation routes had been adequately addressed, but the Record
Nm tnOr a does not support this conclusion.

27. There is not substantial evidence in the Record to support a conclusion that the
installation of a temporary crossing is even feasible, much less that it would provide an
adequate evacuation route in the event of a wildfire. The "shelter in place" notions referred to
in the response to comments provides little comfort after a similar community in Northern
California suffered loss of thousands of homes and many human lives in the last fire season.
Deferral of analysis and adoption of an adequate plan for evacuation violates CEQA and
endangers the lives of citizens in the area.
10 28. The record shows that there is substantial evidence of to support a fair argument

11 that the Project will have significant safety impacts.

12 B. Impacts to archeological resources:

13 29. The record reveals that the Project may have significant impacts to archeological

14 resources. Respondents'own archeological survey (prepared by Tremaine & Associates) shows

15 that the area around the Project is an extremely sensitive archeological area and that the Project

16 "has the potential to affect both historic and prehistoric cultural resources, including historic

17 properties within the APE [area of potential effects]."

18 30. Respondents received comments from the Tribe and Tremaine & Associates

19 consulted with Native Americans, and the information received shows that there will

20 undoubtedly be a significant impact to archeological resources.

21 31. In response to comments, the County asserts that it will "avoid" the areas, but

22 there is not evidence in the Record to show that the Project construction will actually avoid the

23 sensitive areas, nor is that even possible.

24 32. By claiming that the archeological resources will be "avoided" Respondents

25 inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary investigations, studies or inquiry with

26 respect to the development of mitigation measures and provided no performance standards,

27 criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies used to develop mitigation measures.

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

N ntv 33. The IS/MND fails to provide substantial evidence to support Respondents'
conclusions that the Project will not have a significant effect on the archeological resources.
Further, Respondents did not even bother to address the impacts related to the conservation
easements held by the Tribe.

34. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed according to law in that
they failed to require the preparation of an EIR for the project, despite the existence of a "fair
A0a argument" based on substantial evidence in the record, that the project may have a significant
effect on archeological resources.

35. As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by

10 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering

11 Respondents to set aside its environmental findings and the related decision, and directing

12 Respondents to comply with the procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

13 before acting on any development proposal under the Project.

14 II. Other CEQA violations:

15 36. Respondents failed to provide an adequate project description by omitting

16 information about the permanent easements that will be necessary for the Project and failing to

17 fully disclose the safety risks associated with wildfire during construction.

18 37. Respondents provided a misleading Project description by characterizing the

19 bridge replacement as "necessary" under existing regulations where evidence in the Record to

20 the contrary. In fact, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that an over-sized new

21 bridge is needed in this location.

22 38. Respondents also failed to disclose the safety risks that will result from icing on

23 the bridge, despite substantial evidence in the Record showing that the icing will be a hazard.

24 39. Respondents failed to disclose aesthetic impacts that will result from the removal

25 of a significant number of trees along with construction of "wing walls" that will reduce the

26 rural creek setting to something akin to an urban drainage ditch.

27 40. Respondents failed to analyze the potential for the changes in the creek alignment

28 to impact hydrology downstream.
8 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. Respondents inappropriately deferred the performance of necessary
Nm tn0D investigations, studies or inquiry with respect to the development of mitigation measures and
provided no performance standards, criteria or specific guidance with respect to future studies
used to develop mitigation measures.

42. The IS/MND fails to provide substantial evidence to support Respondents'
conclusions that the Project will not have a significant effect on the environment.

43. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed according to law in that
they failed to require the preparation of an EIR for the project, despite the existence of a "fair
argument" based on substantial evidence in the record, that the project may have a significant

10 effect on the environment.

11 44. As a result of Respondents' failure to comply with the procedures required by

12 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a preemptory writ of mandate must issue ordering

13 Respondents to set aside its environmental findings and the related decision, and directing

14 Respondents to comply with the procedures mandated by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines

15 before acting on any development proposal under the Project.

PRAYER 16

17 Wherefore, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

18 follows:

19 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate

20 and set aside the approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Project

21 and to withdraw the Notice of Determination for the Project;

22 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County to comply

23 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by Public Resources

24 Code section 21168.9 or as otherwise required by law;

25 3. For a stay and preliminary and permanent injunction restraining County and its

26 agents, employees, officers and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the

27 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;
