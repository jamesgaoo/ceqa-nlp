- TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that on April 25, 2019, Petitioner/Plaintiff Greater Los Angeles
3 Communities Alliance (GreatLACA) filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive
4 relief alleging causes of action under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources
5 Code, § 21000 et seq.) and the State CEQA Guidelines (Guidelines; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et
6 seq.) against the City of El Monte (City) and the City Council of the City of El Monte (City Council) as
7 Respondents/Defendants; and against GreenPro Enterprise, Inc., Flourish Plant Science, BIA Properties,
8 LLC, BIA Property, LLC, Sky Visions LLC, Jason Chen, Brian Li, and Keith Thai as Real Parties in
9 Interest/Defendants (collectively Real Parties).
10 This lawsuit challenges actions taken by the City (as lead agency) of March 19, 2019 and April
11 2, 2019. By those actions, the City approved conditional use permits, development agreements, and
12 notices of exemption from CEQA (NOEs) for two projects of Real Parties: (1) a project consisting of a
13 39,798-square-foot factory on a 1.76-acre site at 4377 Baldwin Avenue in El Monte; and (2) a project
§ 14 consisting of a 50,300-square-foot factory on a 1.99-acre site at 4411 Rowland Avenue in El Monte
15 (collectively Projects). The City found that the projects are categorically exempt from CEQA as "in-fill
Me7 jabuy S0+06 VD 'ejuow eques auns "paja yued ue3Do T09Z 16 development" under Class 32 of the categorical exemptions. (Guidelines § 15332.)
17 We provide this notice because our pleading includes causes of action averring that the City
18 prejudicially abused its discretion under CEQA and the Guidelines: No substantial evidence, in light of
19 the whole record, supports the City's determinations that the Projects may not have a significant effect
20 on the environment. No substantial evidence supports the circumstances or any findings legally required
21 to support the City's use of the Class 32 categorical exemptions, i.e., that the Projects are consistent with
22 applicable general plan policies; that development associated with similar, co-located factories in
23 northwest El Monte will occur on no more than five acres; that the Projects would not result in
24 significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, and water quality; that the sites of the Projects
25 will not be adequately served by utilities and public services; that the cumulative impact of successive
26 projects of the same type in the same place, over time is not significant; that there is no reasonable
27 possibility that the Projects' activities will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
28 circumstances; and that the Projects will not cause substantial adverse effects on human beings. In fact,
29 substantial evidence in the record only supports findings to the contrary. Because substantial evidence
30 shows that the Projects will have cumulatively considerable effects and related, substantial adverse
31 effects on human beings, the City had a public duty to prepare an environmental impact report. By
32 failing to do so, the City prejudicially abused its discretion under CEQA and the Guidelines.

SUMMARY OF PLEADING H

2 1. Petitioner/Plaintiff Greater Los Angeles Communities Alliance (GreatLACA) challenges

3 the legal validity under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code,

4 con 21000 et seq.), the State CEQA Guidelines (Guidelines; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.), and
5 the Controlled Substances Act (CSA; 21 U.S.C. § 801 et seq.) of adjudicatory development entitlement

6 decisions made on March 19 and April 2, 2019 by Respondent/Defendant City Council of the City of El
7 Monte (City Council), on behalf of Respondent/Defendant City of El Monte (El Monte or City;

8 collectively sometimes Respondents). Respondents' decisions are memorialized in (1) Resolution No.

9 9953, approving (a) conditional use permits (CUPs) Nos. 10-18, 11-18 and 12-18 applied for by Real
10 Party in Interest/Defendant GreenPro Enterprise, Inc., and (b) a notice of exemption from CEQA
11 (NOE), for a project proposing the development of a 39,798-square-foot medicinal marijuana factory on
12 a 1.76-acre site at 4377 Baldwin Avenue in El Monte (Baldwin Ave. Factory); (2) Resolution No.
13 9954, approving (a) CUPs Nos. 01-19, 02-19 and 03-19 applied for by Real Party in Interest/Defendant
: 14 Flourish Plant Science, and (b) an NOE, for a project proposing the development of a separate and
15 additional 50,300-square-foot medicinal marijuana factory on a 1.99-acre site at 4411 Rowland Avenue
MeT jabuy S0+06 VD 'ebjuow qques auins "pajg ›ued ueado TO9Z 16 in El Monte (Rowland Ave. Factory); (3) Ordinance No. 2945, approving Development Agreement No.
17 05-18 with GreenPro Enterprise, Inc. and Real Party in Interest/Defendant BIA Properties, LLC for the
18 Baldwin Ave. Factory; and (4) Ordinance No. 2946, approving Development Agreement No. 01-19 with
19 Flourish Plant Science and Real Party in Interest/Defendant Sky Visions LLC for the Rowland Ave.
20 Factory. Both projects (the Marijuana Factories) are located on opposite sides of Baldwin Avenue in
21 El Monte, in close proximity to each other. El Monte purports to identify the Projects proposed by these
22 Real Parties in Interest/Defendants (collectively, Marijuana Growers/Producers/Distributors or Real
23 Parties) in NOEs filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk on March 21, 2019 (Nos. 2019073509 [for
24 the Baldwin Ave. Factory] and 2019073521 [for the Rowland Ave. Factory]).
25 2. Since December 2018, Marijuana factory projects have been passing through El Monte's
26 City Council chambers on a fast-moving conveyor belt, with almost no weighing by the members of the
27 City Council of their merits vel non. The Baldwin Ave. Factory and the Rowland Ave. Factory are the
28 third and fourth in a series of at least eight proposed industrial-scale marijuana factories that are
29 proposed in small, two-block area in the northwest corner of El Monte bounded by Temple City
30 Boulevard and Ellis Lane to the west, Lower Azusa Road to the north, Baldwin Avenue to the east, and
31 a Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way to the south. A residential neighborhood in the City of Temple
32 City adjoins this two-block area on the opposite side of Temple City Boulevard, Ellis Lane, and Lower
33 Azusa Road. A series of maps showing the Marijuana Factories' locations is attached to this pleading as
34 Exhibit 1. Two more marijuana factories are proposed at a location in east El Monte near the

-2-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

intersection of Garvey Avenue and Valley Boulevard.
2 3. El Monte approved the first two of the co-located marijuana factories in quick succession,
3 shortly before it approved the Marijuana Factories challenged in this case. On December 18, 2018, the
4 City Council approved an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) and CUPs (Nos. 07-
5 18, 08-18 and 09-18), and introduced for first reading an uncodified ordinance (Ordinance No. 2939) to
6 approve Development Agreement No. 02-18 for a proposed 71,658-square-foot medicinal marijuana
7 factory located on a 4.4-acre site at 4400 Temple City Boulevard in El Monte (4400 Temple City Blvd.
8 Marijuana Factory). On January 8, 2019, the City Council approved the second reading of Ordinance
9 No. 2939. The site of the 4400 Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory is located approximately 300 feet
10 from the site of the Rowland Ave. Factory and approximately 600 feet from the site of the Baldwin Ave.
11 Factory.
12 4. On February 19, 2019, the City Council approved a separate IS/MND and CUPs (Nos.
13 13-18, 14-18, 15-18, 16-18, 17-18 and 18-18), and introduced for first reading two uncodified
§ 14
S0P06 VD 'eojuow qques ordinances (Ordinance No. 2943 and Ordinance No. 2944) to approve Development Agreement Nos. Suite 15 03-18 and 04-18 for proposed 132,908-square-foot medicinal marijuana factory on a 4.9-acre site at
Me] jebuy 2601 Ocean parx ElVd: 16 the western terminus of Gidley Street in El Monte (Gidley St. Marijuana Factory). On March 5, 2019,
17 the City Council approved the second reading of Ordinance No. 2943 and Ordinance No. 2944. The site
18 of the Gidley St. Marijuana Factory is located approximately 600 feet from the site of the Rowland Ave.
19 Factory and the Baldwin Ave. Factory. A map showing the relative locations of the 4400 Temple City
20 Blvd. Factory, the Gidley St. Marijuana Factory, the Rowland Ave. Factory, and the Baldwin Ave.
21 Factory is attached to this pleading as Exhibit 2.
22 5. Despite their close geographic proximity, nearly contemporaneous approvals, and
23 significant cumulative, including cross-(City) border, environmental effects, El Monte prepared separate
24 CEQA reviews for each marijuana factory, never looking at the whole picture of the council's actions. It
25 prepared separate IS/MNDs for the 4400 Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory and the Gidley St.
26 Marijuana Factory, For the Baldwin Ave. and the Rowland Ave. Factories it now prepared separate
27 NOEs, no longer even bothering to adopt MNDs holding the Projects subject to CEQA. Ignoring CEQA
28 mandatory findings of significance (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083, subd. (a)(2)-(3); Guidelines,
29 § 15065, subd. (b)(3)-(4)), the City's manner of proceeding (project approvals based on IS/MNDs and
30 NOEs) omits review of the co-located factories' significant cumulative impacts on the environment and
31 the substantial adverse effects these impacts will inflict on human beings. Due to this omission and the
32 failure to prepare an environmental impact report (EIR), the City also fails to consider feasible
33 mitigation measures and alternatives to the projects.
34 6. El Monte's rapid, piecemeal approval of these marijuana factories has led to an

-3-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

outpouring of public opposition. During administrative proceedings, two neighboring cities and
2 community organizations submitted extensive comment letters and substantial evidence alerting City

3 officials to the projects' conflicts with CEQA, the Guidelines, and the CSA. El Monte's actions since
4 December 2018 have led to the filing of already four lawsuits:

5 On January 18, 2019, Temple City and the City of Rosemead (Rosemead) filed a

6 petition for writ of mandate under CEQA challenging the City Council's decisions
7 approving the 4400 Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory. (Case No. 19STCP00254;
8 assigned for all purposes to Department 32 [Hon. Daniel S. Murphy, Judge Presiding).
9 Temple City and Rosemead aver that El Monte "failed to ensure that the [4400 Temple
10 City Blvd. Factory's IS/MND] disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many
11 foresecable public health and environmental impacts as required by [CEQA]" and "failed
12 to acknowledge any other foreseeable/related projects or undertake any cumulative
13 impacts whatsoever." (Temple City & Rosemead Pet. for Writ of Mandate, pp. 1:13-15,
5 14 12:13-15.) Temple City and Rosemead therefore request that El Monte prepare an EIR,

MeT jebuy S0+06 VO 'eojuow eques 2601 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 15 as required by CEQA, including, in particular, CEQA's mandatory findings of
16 significance. (Id. at 16:11-14.)
17 On March 21, 2019, the Greater SGV Community Foundation, Kewei Zhao, Irma
18 Zamorano, and Jonathan Hawes (collectively, the Foundation) filed a petition for writ
19 of mandate challenging the City Council's decisions approving the Gidley St. Marijuana
20 Factory. (Case No. 19STCP00896; assigned for all purposes to Department 32 as well).
21 In its first cause of action, the Foundation avers that El Monte failed to proceed in the
22 manner required by CEQA and the Guidelines by preparing an IS/MND that fails to
23 mention the cumulative effect of other nearby factories, including the 4400 Temple City
24 Blvd. Marijuana Factory, and fails to provide an adequate project description and
25 description of the project's environmental setting. (Foundation Pet. For Writ of Mandate,
26 pp. 7:11-13; 12:16-14:2.) The Foundation avers that the City had a public duty to
27 prepare an EIR for the project, and that by failing to do so, the City prejudicially abused
28 its discretion under CEQA. (Id. at 12:11-12.)
29 On March 25, 2019, GreatLACA, too, filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint
30 for injunctive relief challenging the City Council's decisions approving the Gidley St.
31 Marijuana Factory. (Case No.19STCP00917; not assigned yet.) GreatLACA's pleading
32 includes a first cause of action averring that El Monte prejudicially abused its discretion

33 under CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Gidley Street Marijuana Factory. This
34 cause of action, based on the combined impacts of the other closely related projects in

-4-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

00NO -N0T the vicinity, avers that the IS/MND for the Gidley Street Marijuana Factory fails to
account for substantial evidence of the significant direct, indirect, and cumulative
environmental impacts this project may or will carry on air quality, water quality and
water supply, traffic and transportation, existing noise conditions, public services, public
utilities, fire hazards, and land use and planning, as well as related effects on the public
health, safety, and welfare, including risks caused by the use, transport, and disposal of
hazardous materials and waste; and that no substantial evidence in the record proves that
the project would not have any significant effect on the environment or any related,
substantially adverse effect on human beings, directly or indirectly. (GreatLACA Pet.
10 For Writ of Mandate, p. 4:1-30.) GreatLACA also pleads a second cause of action
11 averring that El Monte prejudicially abused its discretion under CEQA by proceeding
12 with an IS/MSD that is itself substantially defective as an information disclosure
13 document; a third cause of action averring that El Monte filed substantially defective
§ 14 notices of determination for its approval of the Gidley St. Marijuana Factory; and a

Law Angel S0+06 VD 'epjuow qques aqns "paja yued ueado t09Z 15 fourth cause of action averring that El Monte violated the CSA in approving the Gidley
16 St. Marijuana Factory. (GreatLACA Pet. For Writ of Mandate, pp. 4:31-5:7; 22:29-
17 24:19; 24:20-25:26.)
18 On April 16, 2019, the Foundation filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the
19 City Council's decisions approving the Baldwin Ave. Factory and the Rowland Ave.
20 Factory. (Case No. 19STCP00896; assigned for all purposes to Department 32 as well).
21 In its first cause of action, the Foundation avers that El Monte failed to proceed in the
22 manner required by CEQA and the Guidelines by exempting the Marijuana Factories
23 from CEQA. The Foundation avers that the Marijuana Factories do not qualify for Class
24 32 categorical exemptions under Guidelines section 15332 because (1) the cumulative
25 impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant;
26 (2) there is a reasonable possibility that the Marijuana Factories' activities will have
27 significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances; (3) the Marijuana
28 Factories will have significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, and water
29 quality; and (4) the sites of the Marijuana Factories will not be adequately served by
30 utilities and public services. (Foundation Pet. For Writ of Mandate, pp. 10:18-14:11.)
31 7. In approving NOEs for the most recently approved Marijuana Factories, El Monte failed
32 to proceed in the manner required by CEQA. No substantial evidence, in light of the whole record,
33 supports El Monte's determinations that the Marijuana Factories may not have a significant effect on the
34 environment. No substantial evidence supports the circumstances or any findings legally required to

-5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

support the City's use of the Class 32 categorical exemptions, i.e., that the Marijuana Factories are

2 consistent with applicable general plan policies; that the development associated with the co-located
marijuana factories in northwest El Monte will occur on no more than five acres; that the Marijuana

4 Factories would not result in significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, and water quality;
5 that the sites of the Marijuana Factories will not be adequately served by utilities and public services;

6 that the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is not
7 significant; that there is no reasonable possibility that the Marijuana Factories' activities will have a
8 significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances; and that the Marijuana Factories
will not cause substantial adverse effects on human beings. (Guidelines, §§ 15300.2, 15332.) In fact,
10 substantial evidence in the record only supports findings to the contrary. GreatLACA and other
11 members of the public provided substantial evidence showing that the Marijuana Factories will have
12 cumulatively considerable effects and related, substantial adverse effects on human beings.
13 Consequently, El Monte had public duty to prepare an EIR for the Marijuana Factories. (See Pub.
14 Resources Code, §§ 21080, subd. (d), 21083, subd. (a)(2)-(3); Guidelines, §§ 15063, subd. (b)(1),
15 15064, subd. (a)(1), (f)(1), (h)(1), 15065, subd. (b)(3)-(4).)
Me7 e6uy S0+06 VD 'epjuow qques Jeado T097 Park Blvd., Suite 205 16 8. El Monte also failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving Projects that
17 clearly violate the CSA, and the members of the City Council who granted the Project applicants permits
18 and development deals themselves acted in violation of the CSA. The CSA prohibits the manufacture
19 and distribution of marijuana. (21 U.S.C. §§ 812, 841(a)(1), 844.) There is no exception for medical
20 marijuana. (United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative (2001) 532 U.S. 483, 490 [149
21 L.Ed.2d 722, 121 S.Ct. 1711].)

22 9. By entering into reciprocal development deals with the Marijuana
23 Growers/Producers/Distributors to enable and facilitate their manufacture and wholesale distribution of
24 marijuana, the City Council (that is, the majority of the council members who voted for Development
25 Agreements Nos. 05-18 and 01-19), conspired with the Marijuana Growers/Producers/Distributors to
26 violate the CSA. (21 U.S.C. § 846.) Therefore, the City Council's actions of March 19, 2019 and April
27 2, 2019 constitute a failure to proceed in the manner required by law. (Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 1085,
28 1094.5, subd. (b).)
29 10. El Monte also failed to proceed in the manner required by the El Monte Municipal Code
30 (EMMC) by approving the CUPs for the Marijuana Factories despite the factories' substantial adverse
31 public health and safety effects and the legally mandated CUP finding that the CUPs for the projects
32 "will not be detrimental to the public health or welfare" (EMMC, § 17.24.050 (A)), and those effects'
33 direct relevance to CEQA review. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(3); Guidelines, § 15065,
34 subd. (a)(4).)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

11. GreatLACA requests relief in the form of a peremptory writ of mandate ordering
2 Respondents to set aside and void the NOEs and all Project entitlements approved on March 19, 2019
and April 2, 2019; to prepare an EIR; and to scrupulously carry out their public duties under CEQA, the
4 Guidelines, the CSA and all other applicable laws, before taking any further action concerning any
5 development on the Baldwin Ave. Factory or Rowland Ave. Factory sites. Finally, GreatLACA prays
6 for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to protect the status quo and avoid prejudice to
7 reasonable, legally feasible, and environmentally more advantageous Project alternatives.
PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING 8

9 12. Petitioner/Plaintiff Greater Los Angeles Communities Alliance is nonprofit association
10 dedicated to preserving and enhancing resident quality of life in the San Gabriel Valley and greater Los
11 Angeles by advocating for responsible community development that promotes sustainability, public
12 safety, and environmental justice. To achieve these goals, GreatLACA is committed to uniting and
13 educating residents to ensure they remain informed about decisions made by local elected and appointed
5 14 officials, including decisions greenlighting industrial-scale marijuana factories with potentially
15 significant adverse impacts on the environment and human beings. GreatLACA's members and
Me7 Angel S0+06 VD 'ebjuow qques eIns "pajg yued ueado T09Z 16 supporters include residents, taxpayers, and electors of the City and neighboring communities aggrieved
17 by the Marijuana Factories and by EI Monte's fast-tracking and serial approvals of additional, closely
18 related marijuana factories.
19 13. In written comments to the City Council, GreatLACA specifically objected to the
20 inadequacy of the environmental review for the Marijuana Factories, including EI Monte's failure to
21 identify the other proposed co-located, industrial-scale marijuana factories, their cumulatively
22 considerable effects, and their substantial adverse effects on human beings.
23 14. GreatLACA brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of all other similarly-
24 situated individuals, including all residents, electors, and taxpayers of El Monte interested in full, fair,
25 correct and independent enforcement of CEQA, the Guidelines, and the CSA. GreatLACA and the
26 members of the public benefiting from this action have substantial, beneficial interest in the relief they
27 seek, and have a present interest, as citizens, in the enforcement of the El Monte's public duties under
28 CEQA, the Guidelines, and the CSA.
29 15. Respondent/Defendant City of El Monte is a California general law city located in the
30 County of Los Angeles, with quasi-legislative and adjudicatory powers over land uses in its incorporated
31 territory. El Monte is the lead agency for the Marijuana Factories, within the meaning of CEQA. (Pub.
32 Resources Code, § 21067; Guidelines, § 15367.) El Monte has a legally enforceable public duty to
33 strictly comply with CEQA, the Guidelines, and the CSA.
34 16. Respondent/Defendant City Council is the elected decisionmaking and legislative body of

-7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

El Monte. The City Council has final administrative responsibility to determine whether the Marijuana
2 Factories are exempt from CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21151, subd. (c); Guidelines, § 15061, subd.
(e).) The City Council has a legally enforceable public duty to strictly comply with CEQA, the
4 Guidelines, and the CSA. Mayor Andre Quintero, Mayor Pro Tem Jerry Velasco, and City
5 Councilmembers Victoria Martinez-Muela and Maria Morales voted for the development agreements

6 and related approvals challenged in this action. Councilmember Jessica Ancona voted against.
7 17. GreatLACA is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest/Defendant GreenPro

8 Enterprise, Inc. is a California corporation. According to the statement of information that GreenPro

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 9

10 26. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Constitution article VI,
11 section 10, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21167.1, 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.7. This

12 Court has personal jurisdiction over Respondents and Real Parties because they are present or transact
13 business within Los Angeles County's jurisdictional limits.
3 14 27. Venue properly lies in this Court because an action against a city may be tried in the
15 superior court of the county in which the city is situated (Code Civ. Proc., § 394, subd. (a)), or where
Law je6uy S0+06 VO 'epjuow qques aqns "paja yued ueado tO9Z 16 some or all defendants reside at the commencement of the action. (Id., § 395, subd. (a).) Furthermore,
17 venue is appropriate in this Court because many of the adverse impacts on the environment alleged in
18 this pleading occur in Los Angeles County. (See California State Parks Foundation v. Superior Court
19 (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826, 834, fn.2 ["when plaintiffs are challenging an official act, the cause of
20 action arises where the effects of that act are felt"]; People v. Selby Smelting & Lead Co. (1912) 163
21 Cal. 84, 88-91 [nuisance action to restrain air pollution originating with processes of smelting ores
22 properly commenced in county in which the public health and environment were adversely affected].)
23 28. This action is properly filed in the Central District of this Court because it includes
24 causes of action under CEQA, and because it is in the nature of a special proceeding seeking writ of
25 mandate and declaratory relief. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, Local Rules, rule 3.232 (b); id., rules
26 2.3(a)(1)(A), 2.7(b)(1)(G)(iii).) Special proceedings seeking a writ of mandate and declaratory relief
27 must be filed in this Court's Central District. (Id.)

28 FACTUAL, PROCEDURAL, AND LEGAL BACKGROUND

29 29. On November 8, 2017, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. 2924, which allowed
30 industrial-scale marijuana operations in certain zones in El Monte. By the end of 2018, numerous
31 companies had applied to cultivate, produce, and distribute marijuana in El Monte. In response to a

32 request made by Temple City under the California Public Records Act (CPRA; Gov. Code, § 6250 et
33 seq.), El Monte Director of Community & Economic Development, Betty Donavanik, earlier this year,
34 provided the following list, dated November 16, 2018, titled "List of El Monte Medicinal Commercial

25 30. On October 4, 2018, GreenPro Enterprise, Inc. filed an application for Development
26 Agreement No. 05-18 and CUPs (Nos. 10-18, 11-18 and 12-18) to operate the Baldwin Ave. Factory.
27 On January 17, 2019, Flourish Plant Science filed an application for Development Agreement No. 01-19
28 and CUPs (Nos. 01-19, 02-19 and 03-19) to operate the Rowland Ave. Factory.
29 31. The Baldwin Ave. Factory site consists of an existing 39,798-square foot warehouse on a
30 1.76-acre site at 4377 Baldwin Avenue in El Monte. The Marijuana Growers/Producers/Distributors
31 propose to remodel the warehouse to accommodate cultivation, manufacturing and distribution
32 activities. Of the total 39,798 square-foot warehouse, 28,765 square-feet will be used for cultivation,
33 2,509 square-feet will be used for manufacturing, 6,775 square-feet will be used for distribution, and
34 1,749 square-feet will serve as general common area including office space.

P 32. The Rowland Ave. Factory site consists of an existing 50,300-square-foot medicinal
2 marijuana factory a on a 1.99-acre site at 4411 Rowland Avenue in El Monte. The Marijuana
3 Growers/Producers/Distributors propose to remodel the warehouse to accommodate cultivation,
4 manufacturing and distribution activities. Of the total 50,300 square-foot warehouse, 24,264 square-feet
5 will be used for cultivation, 2,909 square feet will be used for manufacturing, and 2,133 square feet will
6 be used for distribution.

7 33. Although El Monte prepared NOEs for the Marijuana Factories, attached thereto are
8 unadopted initial studies (titled "Environmental Analysis and Checklist"). The NOEs were prepared by
9 Blodgett Baylosis Environmental Planning, the same environmental consulting firm that prepared the
10 IS/MNDs for the 4400 Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory and the Gidley St. Marijuana Factory.
11 34. The El Monte Planning Commission (Planning Commission) held a hearing on the
12 Marijuana Factories at its regularly scheduled meeting of February 26, 2019. Despite overwhelming
13 public opposition, the Planning Commission voted to approve Planning Commission Resolutions Nos.
§ 14 3538 and 3539, recommending approval of the CUPs, development agreements, and NOEs for the
Marijuana Factories.
ME7 je6uy Santa Monica, S0+06 VO 2601 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 15

16 35. On March 19, 2019, the City Council held a hearing on the Marijuana Factories. The
17 hearing was well-attended, with most attendees objecting to the Projects. Earlier, Temple City's Acting
18 City Attorney, Gregory M. Murphy, submitted objections showing that the Marijuana Factories were not
19 exempt from CEQA. (Letter dated March 7, 2019.) Still, the City Council voted 4-1 to adopt Resolution
20 No. 9953 and Resolution No. 9954, approving the CUPs and NOEs for the Projects; and to introduce for
21 first reading Ordinance Nos. 2945 and 2946 to approve Development Agreement Nos. 05-18 and 01-19.
22 36. On March 21, El Monte filed NOEs for the Projects with the Los Angeles County Clerk
23 (Nos. 2019073509 [for the Baldwin Ave. Factory] and 2019073521 [for the Rowland Ave. Factory]).
24 37. On April 2, 2019, the City Council held another hearing adopting Ordinance Nos. 2945
25 and 2946 for Development Agreement Nos. 05-18 and 01-19. Again, the City Council, by 4-1 vote,
26 approved the development agreements.
27 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
28 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
29 INAPPLICABILITY OF CEQA EXEMPTIONS
30 (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5; Code Civ. Proc.. § 1094.5)
31 By Petitioner Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest
32 38. Petitioners incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 37 of this pleading, as though
33 fully set forth.
34 39. "The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act 'to be

-13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the
2 reasonable scope of the statutory language.' (Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8

3 Cal.3d 247, 259.)" (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47

4 Cal.3d 376, 390.)

5 40. "CEQA review procedures can be viewed as a "three-tiered process."' [Citation.] The

6 first tier requires an agency to conduct a preliminary review to determine whether CEQA applies to a
7 proposed project. [Citation.] If CEQA applies, the agency must proceed to the second tier of the process
8 by conducting an initial study of the project. [Citation.] Among the purposes of the initial study is to
9 help 'to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an environmental impact report (EIR).'
10 [Citation.] If there is "no substantial evidence that the project or any of its aspects may cause a
11 significant effect on the environment,' the agency prepares a negative declaration. (Guidelines, § 15063,
12 subd. (b)(2).) Alternatively, if s "the initial study identifies potentially significant effects on the
13 environment but revisions in the project plans 'would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point
on the environment would occur' and there is no substantial evidence 14 where clearly no significant effect
that the project as revised may have a significant effect on the environment, a mitigated negative
Me7 jebuy SO+06 VD 'ejuOW qques 205 ans "pAlg qued 18300 T09Z 16 declaration may be used." ' [Citation.] Finally, if the initial study uncovers 'substantial evidence that any 15

17 aspect of the project, either individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant effect on the
18 environment' (CEQA Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (b)(1)), the agency must proceed to the third tier of the
19 review process and prepare a full EIR ... [Citation.]" (Save Our Big Trees v. City of Santa Cruz (2015)
20 241 Cal.App.4th 694, 704-705.) CEQA mandates a finding of significant impact, and thus preparation of

22 cumulative effect, or has "effects [that] will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either 21 an EIR, when substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, shows that a project has a significant

23 directly or indirectly." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(2), (3); Guidelines, § 15065, subd.
24 (a)(3), (4).)
25 41. Under the first tier of review, agencies determine whether projects fall within a category
26 of projects that the Legislature has expressly exempted from review (Pub. Resources Code § 21080,
27 subds. (b)(1)-(15)), or whether projects qualify for one of the categorical exemptions (Guidelines §§
28 15300-15333) the California Resources Agency has established for projects it found do not, as a general

29 rule, have a significant effect on the environment. (§ 21084; see Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City
30 of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1092 [Berkeley Hillside].) Categorical exemptions must be
31 construed narrowly "to afford the fullest possible environmental protection." (Save Our Carmel River v.
32 Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.) "'[E]xemption
33 categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory
34 language.' [Citations.] These rules ensure that in all but the clearest cases of categorical exemptions, a

-14-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 project will be subject to some level of environmental review." (Ibid.)
2 42. "Unlike statutorily exempt projects, which are 'absolute' and not subject to exceptions,
3 categorical exemptions are subject to exceptions in the Guidelines." (Save Our Schools v. Barstow
4 Unified School Dist. Bd. of Education (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 128, 140, emphasis added ; see Save the
5 Plastic Bag Coalition v. County of Marin (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 209, 224; see also Banker's Hill,

6 Hillcrest, Park West Community Preservation Group V. City of San Diego (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 249,
7 260.) Guidelines section 15300.2 specifies exceptions to the categorial CEQA exemptions, including:
8 "Cumulative Impact. [Categorical exemptions] are inapplicable when the cumulative
9 impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
10 significant." (Id., subd. (b).)
11 "Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there
12 is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the
13 environment due to unusual circumstances." (Id., subd. (c).)
§ 14 43. If an agency finds that project is categorically exempt from CEQA, reversal of the

Law jebuy Santa Monica, CA 90405 ains "paja ›ued UPaDo T09Z 15 agency's action is appropriate (a) when the agency fails to proceed in the manner required by law or (b)
16 when substantial evidence fails to support that finding. (Berkeley Hillside, supra, 60 Cal.4th at p. 1110.)
17 "In the CEQA context, substantial evidence 'means enough relevant information and reasonable
18 inferences from this information that a fair argument can be a made to support a conclusion, even though
19 other conclusions might also be reached. (Guidelines, § 15384, subd. (a).)" (Keep Our Mountains Quiet
20 v. County of Santa Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714, 730.) "The determination of whether a project
21 may have a significant effect on the environment calls for careful judgment in the part of the public
22 agency involved. . . ." (Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (b).)
23 44. Here, El Monte found the Marijuana Factories are categorically exempt from CEQA as
24 "in-fill development" under Class 32 of the categorical exemptions. By Guidelines section 15332, Class
25 32-exempt projects must meet all five of the following criteria:
26 "(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all
27 applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
28 regulations."
29 "(b) The proposed development occurs within city a limits on a project site of no more than
30 five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses."
31 "(c) The project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species."
32 "(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,
33 noise, air quality, or water quality."
34 "(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services."

-15-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 45. The Class 32 infill exemption's reference to "significant effects relating to traffic, noise,

2 air quality, or water quality" must be applied consistent CEQA and the Guidelines' definition of
3 "effects." Guidelines section 15332 cannot be read to limit the term "effects" to direct or project-specific
4 effects, to the exclusion of cumulative and growth-inducing effects. (See Guidelines, §§ 15355, 15358;

5 compare Pub. Resources Code, § 21065.3.)

6 46. There is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that the Marijuana Factories
7 are exempt from CEQA. To the contrary, substantial, unrefuted evidence in the record shows that the
8 Marijuana Factories do not qualify for categorical exemptions because (T) they do not meet the criteria

9 for Class 32 categorical exemptions; (II) the cumulative impact of successive, co-located marijuana
10 a factories over time is significant; (III) there is a reasonable possibility that each (and both) of the
11 approved Marijuana Factories will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
12 circumstances; and (IV) the Marijuana Factories' cumulatively considerable effects and substantial
13 adverse effects on human beings trigger CEQA's mandatory findings of significant environmental
§ 14 impacts, and therefore require the preparation of an EIR.
Substantial, Unrefuted Evidence in the Record Shows that the Marijuana
Me7 jebuy S0+06 VD 'eojuow qques Je8d0 t09Z Park Blvd., Suite 15 I.

16 Factories Fail to Satisfy the Five Mandatory Criteria for Class 32
17 Exemptions.
18 47. The Marijuana Factories are not consistent with El Monte's general plan: GreatLACA
19 provided Respondents substantial evidence showing that the Marijuana Factories substantially conflict
20 with Goal LU-1 and related policies of the El Monte General Plan.
21 48. Development of the Marijuana Factories and other co-located marijuana factories at
22 the same location will occur on more than five acres: When viewed in combination with the other co-
23 located marijuana factories, the marijuana cultivation, manufacturing, and distribution activities will
24 occur on more than five acres. The Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory and the Gidley St. Marijuana
25 Factory alone occupy more than nine acres. The 71,658-square-foot medicinal marijuana factory at 4400
26 Temple City Boulevard, approved on January 8, 2019, is located on a 4.4-acre site; and the 132,908-
27 square-foot medicinal marijuana factory at the western terminus of Gidley Street, approved on March 5,
28 2019, is located on a 4.9-acre site.
29 49. Approval of the Marijuana Factories will result in significant effects relating to traffic,
30 noise, air quality, or water quality: No substantial evidence supports El Monte's conclusion that
31 approval of the Marijuana Factories would not result in any significant effect relating to traffic, noise, air
32 quality (including but not limited to the effects on air quality during the construction phase and during
33 the operational phase, and concurrent construction phase and operation phase related effects of all
34 related projects), and water quality (including but not limited to the environmental effects of waste

2 generated in the cultivation and manufacturing processes and plastic waste from cannabis packaging and

3 cartridges used for vaping, and concurrent construction phase and operation phase related effects of all

4 related projects), utilities, and public services. (See Guidelines, § 15332, subd. (d).) The record contains

5 no evidence, and El Monte only makes conclusory findings, to the effect that the Marijuana Factories'

6 cumulative, growth-inducing effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, and water quality will be less
than significant.

7 50.

8 The Marijuana Factories cannot be adequately served by all required utilities and

9 public services: No substantial evidence supports El Monte's conclusion that approval of neither of the

11 two Projects challenged in this action would cause any significant effects relating to utilities and public
services. (See Guidelines, § 15332, subd. (e).) Comment letters in the record from planning experts in

12 neighboring cities point to significant burdens on public services for neighboring cities. As regards the

13 first approved factory, Ben Kim, Rosemead Director of Community Development, explained that it

14
90405 alone may place significant burdens on Rosemead's emergency services: "Due to the close proximity of

Me7 ja6uy 8 16 ue8dO TO9Z Park Blvd., Suite soZ the project location to the City of Rosemead, certain significant or backup calls for fire service could be

Santa Monica, responded by the County Fire Department resources serving Rosemead." (Kim 1/28/2091 letter, p. 2.)

17 Mr. Kim showed that the same is true for backup calls for Sheriff's Department services. (Ibid.) Temple

18 City Planning Manager Scott Reimers' January 28, 2019 letter noted the same impacts on Temple City

19 emergency services: "Given the projects' location near the border of Temple City it may also impact

20 Temple City services, most importantly police services provided by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's

21 Department." As for water supply by public utilities, El Monte's findings are contradicted by the

22
23 IS/MND that was prepared for the 4400 Temple City Blvd. Marijuana Factory, which acknowledges that

24 the "City would not have enough supplies to meet projected demand during a single dry-year or multiple
dry year scenario."* A fortiori, the four marijuana operations already approved cannot be adequately

25 served during a single dry-year or multiple dry year scenario. The four approved marijuana factories

26 alone will consume a combined total of more than 4,450,000 gallons of water per year, thus severely.

22 Growth Inducing Impacts: The co-located marijuana factories will significantly
23 increase marijuana supply and distribution, and, as a result may create new marijuana
24 distribution and retail networks in the San Gabriel Valley and beyond (flooding the
25 market for marijuana and marijuana products), and they will depend on other businesses
26 providing supplies, ancillary products and services for their cultivation, manufacturing
27 and distribution operations. They are reasonably likely to spur the opening of new
28 dispensaries and retail shops in El Monte, elsewhere in the San Gabriel Valley, and in
29 east Los Angeles, offering marijuana concentrates and edibles for not only medicinal but
30 also recreational use, especially as competition among the steadily increasing number of
31 city council-approved factories exerts downward pressure on retail prices, and geographic
32 proximity to the marijuana growers and distributors (the council-approved factories)

Monte's designation of the projects as "medicinal" marijuana projects is misleading.
Since June 6, 2018, the state marijuana regulations no longer contain the restrictions
created by the erstwhile adult [i.e., recreational] use ("A") and the medicinal ("M")
license designations. Marijuana businesses are now able to complete one license
application and receive one license allowing them to operate in both the medicinal and
the recreational markets. In earlier emergency regulations adopted in the wake of
Proposition 64, the state licensing authorities had prescribed the requirement that A
designated licensees could only do business with other A designated licensees and M
10 designated licensees could only do business with other M designated licensees. For
11 instance, a cultivator with an M license could only sell to a retailer who also possessed an
12 M license. However, yielding to pressure from the cannabis industry and based on an
13 official advisory committee (the Cannabis Advisory Committee), the state licensing

21 A and M designated cannabis goods is so onerous that continuing to operate under their

Effects on Human Beings Trigger CEQA's Mandatory Findings of
Significant Environmental Impacts, and Therefore Require the Preparation
of an EIR. 5

6 57. Berkeley Hillside confirms that CEQA's procedures for exempting projects do not
7 supersede the fundamental rule that an EIR is required "[i]f there is substantial evidence . . . that the
8 project may have a significant effect on the environment.' " (60 Cal.4th at 1098, citing Pub. Resources
9 Code § 21080, subd. (d).) The plain language of Public Resources Code section 21083 confirms that
10 project is not exempt from CEQA when its effects trigger CEQA's mandatory findings of significance.
11 CEQA and the Guidelines require a lead agency to find that a project may have a significant effect on

13 considerable"; or when "[t]he environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on 12 the environment when "[t]he possible effects of a project are individually limited but cumulatively

17 58. Substantial evidence in the record establishes reasonably foreseeable, cumulatively
18 considerable effects on the environment. Those effects are caused by the projects' direct and cumulative
19 traffic and transportation impacts, associated with the distribution of marijuana and marijuana-related
20 products in the downstream commerce, the use of and transportation of hazardous materials, and related
21 impacts on air quality, water quality, waste generation, water supply and energy consumption. Once
22 operational, the Marijuana Factories will have the direct effect and the incremental effect, when viewed
23 in connection with the effects of past projects (the projects at 4400 Temple City Boulevard and at the
24 western terminus of Gidley Street), and the effect of other current and probable future projects in the
City, of significantly increasing the availability of marijuana concentrates and edibles in the retail
26 environment in ethnically diverse communities in East L.A. and the San Gabriel Valley, many 25

27 underserved when it comes to educational opportunities. This consequence cannot be downplayed as

6 experts who contributed to a Journal of American Medical Association psychiatry investigation,
7 marijuana use in states with medical marijuana laws is higher than in other states, and a large increase in
8 the prevalence of marijuana use disorders from 2001-02 to 2012-13 is the direct result of an increase in

9 the prevalence of marijuana users in the adult U.S. population. (Hasin et al., Prevalence of Marijuana

26 a growing body of evidence of the link between cannabis and psychotic episodes,
27 especially as market share of high-potency cannabis products (with THC

30 Lancet Psychiatry Journal found that "in areas where daily use and use of high-potency
31 cannabis are more prevalent in the general population, there is an excess of cases of
32 psychotic disorder" (Di Forti et al., The Contribution of Cannabis Use to Variation in the

22 61. GreatLACA incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 60 of this pleading, as 1

23 though fully set forth.
24 62. The CSA prohibits the manufacture and distribution of marijuana (21 U.S.C. §§812,
25 841(a)(1), 844), and there is no exception for medical marijuana because it is included on the statute's
26 schedule I of controlled substances. (Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative, supra, 532 U.S. at pp.
27 490-491; 21 U.S.C. § 812.) It is also illegal, under the CSA, to maintain any place for the purpose of
28 manufacturing or distributing marijuana. (21 U.S.C. § 856(a)(1).) Likewise, it is unlawful to "manage or is
29 control any place, whether permanently or temporarily, either as an owner, lessee, agent, employee,

31 use, with or without compensation, the place for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing, storing,
32 distributing, or using a controlled substance.* (21 U.S.C. § 856(a)(2).) The only exception under federal
33 law to these prohibitions is use of marijuana in federally approved research projects. (Oakland Cannabis

2 63. Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in the CSA is
subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object
4 of the attempt or conspiracy. (21 U.S.C. § 846.) "The crime of conspiracy is completed upon an
5 agreement among the conspirators to commit an unlawful offense attended by an overt act by one or

20 65. By approving the entitlements for use for the Marijuana Growers/Producers/Distributors,
21 including the development agreements, the City Council failed to proceed in the manner required by the
