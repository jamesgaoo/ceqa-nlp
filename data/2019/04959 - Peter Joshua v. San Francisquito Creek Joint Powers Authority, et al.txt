2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On September 26, 2019, the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority, by

4 and through its Board of Directors (collectively, "Respondents"), approved the San
5 Francisquito Creek Flood Protection, Ecosystem Restoration, and Recreation Project Upstream

6 of Highway 101 ("Project") along stretch of San Francisquito Creek and certified an

7 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. The proposed Project consists of
8 construction of flood reduction features, including the replacement of Pope-Chaucer Bridge,
9 the widening of the San Francisquito Creek channel, and the replacement of the wooden
10 University Avenue bridge parapet extension. The majority of the Project elements would
11 occur on properties within the jurisdictions of the Cities Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and Menlo
12 Park.

13 2. In approving the Project, Respondents also approved a Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations. However, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") explicitly
15 requires public agencies to make the finding that mitigations or alternatives that reduce or

16 eliminate environmental impacts are infeasible before adopting a Statement of Overriding
17 Considerations. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b), and 21081. Respondents
18 improperly skipped this step in the adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations and
19 instead simply weighed the benefits versus the impacts of the project without considering the
20 feasibility of alternatives or mitigations.

21 3. CEQA also requires an EIR to consider a reasonable range of alternatives to a
22 project which offer substantial environmental advantages over the project proposal and may be
23 feasibly accomplished in a successful manner. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21081(b); 21002.1.
24 The EIR analyzes four alternatives: (1) the No Project Alternative, (2) the Floodwalls
25 Alternative, (3) the Former Nursery Detention Basin Alternative, and (3) the Webb Ranch
26 Detention Basin Alternative. The "No Project Alternative" is required and the remaining three
27 fail to constitute a reasonable range of alternatives as explained infra.

28 4. CEQA requires agencies to analyze "the whole of an action, which has a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

2

1 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

2 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment...* 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15378(a).
3 An EIR must therefore analyze the environmental effects of an entire action, rather than

4 breaking the action into segments. CEQA prohibits piecemeal review or "segmentation"

5 because such review underestimates the environmental impacts of the entire action by

6 analyzing each segment of a project in isolation without due consideration of the other parts of

7 the project. See Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Sonora (2007)

8 155 Cal.App,4th 1214. Here, the EIR improperly segmented the Project by not considering the
Searsville Dam and Reservoir project which is proposed separately for Reach 3, which leads to

10 inadequate disclosure and analysis as to the Project's environmental effects.

11 5. Petitioner Peter Joshua ("Petitioner") challenges the approval of the Project on
12 the grounds that Respondents' certification of the EIR for the Project failed to comply with the
13 mandates set forth under the CEQA because, inter alia, the Project's Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations did not contain required findings, the EIR failed to contain a reasonable range

15 of alternatives, and the EIR improperly engaged in piecemeal review of the Project. Therefore,

16 Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project constitutes an abuse of

17 discretion and must be reversed.

20 PARTIES

21 6. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set
22 forth herein.

23 7. Petitioner is an individual dedicated to the protection of the environment in the
24 City of Menlo Park, and the Counties of Santa Clara and San Mateo by participating in local

25 environmental and land use policy and decision making. Petitioner is a resident and taxpayer
26 of the City of Menlo Park, County of San Mateo and is affected by the Project, and whose
27 interests in preservation of the ecological integrity of the City and County will be adversely

28 affected by the failure to conduct appropriate environmental review under CEQA and approval

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 of the Project. Petitioner participated at public hearings and submitted comments on the

2 Project.

3 8. Respondent San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority is a regional

4 government agency created by the cities of Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and East Palo Alto, the

5 County of San Mateo and the Santa Clara Valley Water District. Respondent San Francisquito

6 Creek Joint Powers Authority plans, designs, and implements projects to address the cities'

7 flooding, environmental, and recreational concerns along the San Francisco Bay.

8 9. Respondent Board of Directors of the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers
9 Authority is the governing body for Respondent San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers

10 Authority and approved the Project, certified the EIR for the Project, and adopted Statement

11 of Overriding Considerations.

12 10. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

13 Does 1 through 15, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sue said Respondents by such

14 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their

15 identities have been ascertained.

16 11. Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Respondents

17 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and
18 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency
19
and employment.

22 III

23 STANDING

24 12. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully

25 set forth herein.

26 13. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner.

27 Petitioner is a resident and taxpayer of the City of Menlo Park, County of San Mateo County

28 is who is dedicated to preserving the environment of the City of Menlo Park and the Counties of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

4

San Mateo and Santa Clara as set forth, supra, and is concerned about maintaining the
environmental integrity of the City of Menlo Park and the Counties of San Mateo and Santa
Clara. Approval of the Project, certification of the EIR, and adoption of a Statement of
4 Overriding Considerations will adversely affect these interests of Petitioner. Petitioner has

5 submitted comments and objections concerning the lack of CEQA compliance and has

6 participated at public hearings. Accordingly, Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the

7 meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21177.

8 14. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code 21167; CEQA Guidelines

10 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

11 other applicable laws and regulations.

CAUSE OF ACTION
2 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
3 [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]

4 18. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully

5 set forth herein.

6 19. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,

7 inter alia, the Project's Statement of Overriding Considerations failed to include necessary

8 findings; the EIR failed to provide a reasonable range of alternatives, and the EIR improperly
engaged in piecemeal review of the Project. The specific violations of CEQA include, but are

10 not limited to, the violations listed below.

11 20. CEQA requires findings that mitigations and alternatives are infeasible prior to

12 an agency adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002,

13 21002.1(b), and 21081. The invalidity of the Statement of Overriding Considerations is a

14 dispositive issue under CEQA because of the failure of Respondents to make the required

15 finding that the alternatives and mitigations are infeasible, a requirement confirmed by the

16 California Supreme Court in City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of California State University

17 (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 341, 368-369. Respondents skipped the question of infeasibility of

18 alternatives that reduce significant and unavoidable impacts of the Project. Instead, the

19 Statement of Overriding Considerations simply weighed the impacts versus the benefits of the

20 Project without considering feasibility. The finding of infeasibility is an explicit prerequisite

21 under CEQA to the adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations. The requirement to

22 adopt feasible alternatives is prominently found in CEQA in three sections. Public Resources

23 Code Section 21002 states:

24 The legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible
25 mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects... .
•26

27 CEQA also states that "[e]ach public agency shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on

28 the environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

6

Pub. Resources Code 21002.1(b). Finally, Public Resources Code Section 21081 mandates

2 as follows:

3 Pursuant to the policy stated in Sections 21002 and 21002.1, no public agency shall
4 approve or carry out a project for which an environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant effects on the environment that would
5 occur if the project is approved or carried out unless both of the following occur:

6 (a) The public agency makes one or more of the following findings with respect to each significant effect:
7 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into,

8 the project which mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the
environment.
(2) Those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have been, or can and should 10 be, adopted by that other agency.
11 (3) Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations, including considerations for the provision of
12 employment opportunities for highly trained workers, make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental
13 impact report.

14 (b) With respect to significant effects which were subject to a finding under
15 paragraph (3) of subdivision (a), the public agency finds that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project
16 outweigh the significant effects on the environment.

17 In short, Respondents must adopt feasible alternatives to project when there are significant
18 and unavoidable impacts unless it is infeasible to do so. Only when mitigations and
19 alternatives are infeasible may Respondents adopt Statement of Overriding Considerations
20 finding that the benefits of the project outweigh the significant effects on the environment.
21 "CEQA does not authorize an agency to proceed with a project that will have significant,
22 unmitigated effects on the environment, based simply on a weighing of those effects against
23 the project's benefits, unless the measures necessary to mitigate those effects are truly
24 infeasible. Such a rule, even were it not wholly inconsistent with the relevant statute (id., §
25 21081, subd. (b)), would tend to displace the fundamental obligation of "[e]ach public agency
26 [to] mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out or
27 approves whenever it is feasible to do so" (id., § 21002.1, subd. (b)). City of Marina v. Board

- of Trustees of California State University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 241, 368-369; see also County of

2 San Diego v. Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community College Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 86, 98,

3 108, fn.18.

4 21. CEQA requires that an EIR consider a reasonable range of alternatives. Pub.

5 Resources Code § 21002. The alternatives analysis serves both the informational and

6 substantive purposes of CEQA. In particular, it is impermissible for Respondents to approve

7 the Project if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that serve to lessen the

8 significant impacts of the Project. Pub. Resources Code § 21002. Failure to adequately
9 evaluate project alternatives violates CEQA. Here, Respondents failed to adequately evaluate

10 a reasonable range of project alternatives that would have reduced or avoided the significant
11 environmental impacts of the Project. The EIR states that Reach 2 and Reach 3 have two

12 separate projects, with Reach 2 including the proposed Project and one alternative. What is

13 clear, however, is that the projects in Reach 3 are not separate alternatives at all. The EIR at

14 page 1-7 states that "this EIR also discusses a project in Reach 3 that complements the

15 preferred alternative by increasing the level of flood protection afforded solely by Reach 2

16 project from 7500 cfs to almost 8,500 cfs." The EIR also states that "a project in the upstream

17 areas of Reach 3 that results in temporary detention of extreme flows is a critical piece of

18 [Respondent San Francisquito Joint Powers Authority's] overall strategy to reduce risk and

19 costs in our communities." (See EIR at page 1-7.) The EIR at page 3.8-10 discusses the
20 Newell Road and Pope-Chaucer Bridges and that "in concert with an upstream detention

21 project that would temporarily remove at least 800 cfs during a 100-year storm, each bridge

22 would not cause flooding during that size event." Finally, the EIR concludes that "[t]he Reach

23 3 alternatives could be implemented following further, more detailed, analysis under CEQA to

24 increase flood protection after one of the Reach 2 alternatives is constructed. With this

25 strategy, implementation of a Reach 2 and a Reach 3 alternative may be considered part of an

26 overall program." (EIR page 4-4.) Given these statements, it is clear that the Reach 2 and

27 Reach 3 projects are intertwined. They are not separate alternatives at all. The EIR does not

28 contain a range of alternatives. Instead, it has chosen only one alternative, other than the No

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

8

1 Project alternative, to analyze in the EIR: the Floodwalls Alternative. Therefore, the EIR is

2 fatally flawed.

3 22. The EIR cast the alternatives as not meeting all the Project Objectives as

4 adequately as the proposed Project. The objectives are so narrowly tailored that viable

5 alternatives are improperly disposed of.

6 The purpose of an EIR is not to identify alleged alternatives that meet few if any of the

7 project's objectives so that these alleged alternatives may be readily eliminated. Since the purpose of an alternatives analysis is to allow the decision maker to determine
8 whether there is an environmentally superior alternative that will meet most of the project's objectives, the key to the selection of the range of alternatives is to identify alternatives that meet most of the project's objectives but have a reduced level of environmental impacts. 10

11 Watsonville Pilots Assn. V. City of Watsonville (2010) 183 Cal.App.4th. 1059, 1089.

12 23. CEQA and relevant caselaw further mandate that Respondents adopt all CEQA

13 findings prior to the approval of the Project. 14 Cal. § Code Regs. § 15091. Crucially,

14 Respondent San Francisquito Joint Powers Authority, as the lead agency according to CEQA,

15 was required to find whether there were any feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that

16 would serve to reduce the significant impacts of the Project on the environment. 14 Cal. Code

17 Regs. § 15091(a)(3). The EIR asserts that once the Project has been implemented,

18 Respondents will draft an Adaptive Management Plan in order to mitigate for sedimentation as

19 a result of erosion impacts associated with increased flows within the Creek. However, the

20 Adaptive Management Plan is nothing more than a monitoring plan conducted after the

21 approval of a project. 'Such a monitoring plan constitutes an improper deferral of mitigation

22 measures. It is "improper to defer the formulation of mitigation measures until after project

23 approval; instead, the determination of whether a project will have significant environmental

24 impacts, and the formulation of measures to mitigate those impacts, must occur before the

25 project is approved." Oakland Heritage Alliance v. City of Oakland (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th

26 884, 906.

27 24. CEQA requires agencies to analyze "the whole of an action, which has potential

28 for resulting in either direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

9

1 indirect physical change in the environment." 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(a). Here, the EIR

2 considers the Searsville Dam and Reservoir project separately in Reach 3. This results in an

3 incomplete analysis of probable environmental impacts and constitutes unlawful piecemeal

4 review and segmentation.

5 25. The FEIR's Responses to Comments related to specific written comments
6 submitted regarding the DEIR failed to provide adequate responses. The responses were

7 incomplete or unresponsive. The evaluation and responses to public comments must contain

8 good faith, reasoned analysis. CEQA Guidelines § 15088(a), (c). Thus, Respondents' failure
to properly respond to comments regarding the EIR further constitutes a failure to proceed in a

10 manner required by CEQA.

11 26. Due to all the above flaws, among others, Respondents' actions in approving the

12 Project and certifying the EIR constitute an abuse of discretion. Respondents must prepare an
13 adequate EIR that conforms with all of the procedural and substantive requirements set forth
14

15 under CEQA, and properly adopt all findings required by law.

16 27. Respondents' actions constitute an abuse of discretion. Respondents must

17 prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the procedural and substantive requirements

18 set forth under CEQA. Approval of the EIR and adoption of the Statement of Overriding

19 Considerations, which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA,

20 constitutes an abuse of discretion.

23 ATTORNEYS' FEES

24 28. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 27 as if fully

VIII

4 INJUNCTION

30. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 29 as if fully

6 set forth herein.

7 31. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

8 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.
32. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

10 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and improperly adopted a

11 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and, thus, have failed to proceed in a manner required
12 by law in approving the Project.

13 33. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
14 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of

15 law. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform its

16 duty to comply with CEQA.

17 34. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

18 are threatening to proceed with commencement of the Project in the near future. Said
19 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

20 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

21 35. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
22 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

23 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Menlo Park, the Counties of San

24 Mateo and Santa Clara, and the State of California. Petitioner will suffer irreparable and

25 permanent injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

26 36. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
27 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

28 37. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

11

1 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

2 Project and certification of the EIR.

3

4 PRAYER

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

6 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

7 aside any and all Project approvals for San Francisquito Creek Flood Protection, Ecosystem
8 Restoration, and Recreation Project Upstream of Highway 101 including, but not limited to,
construction of flood reduction features, including the replacement of Pope-Chaucer Bridge,
10 the widening the Creek channel, and the replacement of the wooden University Avenue bridge
11 parapet extension, and setting aside certification of the EIR for the Project and adoption of a
12 Statement of Overriding Considerations, unless and until Respondents take all necessary steps
13 to bring its actions into compliance with CEQA;

14 2. For an order staying Respondents from engaging in any activity pursuant to the
15 Project until the environmental review and the Project complies with California statutes and
16 regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA;

17 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure

18 section 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

19 4. For costs of suit; and

20 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that Peter Joshua will commence litigation against the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority and the Board of Directors of the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers
Authority ("Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents. Petitioner challenges the approval of the Project on the grounds that the Respondents' certification of the EIR for the Project failed to comply with the mandates set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA- § Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), because, inter alia, the Project's Statement of Overriding Considerations did not contain required findings; the EIR failed to contain a reasonable range of alternatives, and the EIR improperly engaged in piecemeal review of the Project. Therefore,
Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project constitutes an abuse of
discretion and must be reversed.

This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
