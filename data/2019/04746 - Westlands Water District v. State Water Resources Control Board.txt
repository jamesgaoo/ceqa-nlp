PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2

Petitioner and plaintiff Westlands Water District ("Westlands") petitions this Court for a
2 writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or section 1094.5, directed to the
3 State Water Resources Control Board ("State Water Board"), and further requests declaratory and
4 injunctive relief, and alleges as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. Californians have long recognized that water is a precious resource, one that must be
7 carefully managed to serve the beneficial uses necessary to the prosperity and welfare of our state.
8 In 1928, Californians voted to approve what is now Article X, section 2 of the California

9 Constitution. It begins:

10 It is hereby declared that because of the conditions prevailing in this State the general

11 welfare requires that the water resources of the State be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or unreasonable use or

12 unreasonable method of use of water be prevented, and that the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view a to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in

13 the interest of the people and for the public welfare.

14 This is a bedrock principle of California water law and policy that applies to all uses of water within
15 California. Article X, section 2 governs the actions of the State Water Board just as it does water
16 users.

17 2. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (*Porter-Cologne Act") governs the
18 actions of the State Water Board as well. When developing a water quality control plan, the State
19 Water Board must: (1) designate the beneficial uses to be protected, (2) establish limits or levels of
20 water quality constituents or characteristics for the reasonable protection of beneficial uses of water

21 or the prevention of nuisance within a specific area, and (3) include a program of implementation
22 that (a) describes the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the objectives, (b) provides a
23 time schedule for the actions to be taken, and (c) describes surveillance to be undertaken to
24 determine compliance with the limits or levels of water quality constituents or characteristics. (Wat.
25 Code, §§ 13050, subds. (h) & (j), 13242.) The limits or levels of water quality constituents or
26 characteristics necessary for the reasonable protection of beneficial uses or the prevention of
27 nuisance are known as "water quality objectives." (Wat. Code, § 13050(h).) § When setting water
28 quality objectives, the State Water Board must consider a host of factors, including the past, present

1776413.4 2010-089 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3

1 and future beneficial uses of the water, the coordinated control of all factors affecting the water
2 quality in the area, and economic considerations. (Wat. Code, § 13241.)

3 3. Through the Delta Reform Act, California established "coequal goals" of "providing

4 a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta

5 ecosystem" as the water policy priorities for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
6 Estuary. (Wat. Code, § 85054.)

7 4. This proceeding concerns the State Water Board's Water Quality Control Plan for
8 the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (the "Bay-Delta Plan"). On

9 December 12, 2018, the State Water Board adopted amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan (the "Phase
10 Plan Amendments"). In making the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, the State Water Board has not
11 followed the mandates of Article X, section 2, the Porter-Cologne Act, the Delta Reform Act, and
12 other applicable laws. The Court should therefore issue writ to the State Water Board directing it
13 to set aside the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, and grant declaratory and injunctive relief.

14 5. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments include changes to both the water quality objectives
15 and the program of implementation in the Bay-Delta Plan. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments fall into
16 two general categories: (1) amendments intended to protect the quality of water for fish-related
17 beneficial uses, and (2) amendments intended to protect the quality of water for agricultural uses in
18 the south Delta.

19 The LSJR Flow Objective

20 6. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments intended to protect water quality for fish and wildlife
21 beneficial uses include a new water quality objective, referred to as the Lower San Joaquin River
22 Flow Objective ("LSJR Flow Objective"). The parameter used for the LSJR Flow Objective is
23 "unimpaired flow." But unimpaired flow is not a "water quality constituent or characteristic," as is
24 required for a water quality objective under the Porter-Cologne Act. Rather, flow is a rate that
25 defines the total volume of water moving through given cross-section of a channel per unit time.
26 The State Water Board readily concedes it is using unimpaired flow in lieu of parameters for water
27 quality constituents or characteristics, explaining its intent is to set aside a volumewhat it calls a
28 "block" or "budget"-of water to be used for fish and wildlife beneficial uses. This approach is

1776413.4 2010-089 4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4

contrary to the water quality planning process established by the Porter-Cologne Act, and unlawful.

2 7. Compounding the legal defects in its approach, the State Water Board has set aside
this block of water without first deciding what biological goals the water should achieve, and hence
4 the State Water Board does not know if the block is too much, too little, or just enough to provide

5 reasonable value.

6 8. Further, the State Water Board does not know whether dedicating this block of water
7 will provide reasonable value, since many factors other than flow are necessary to restore fish
populations, and those other factors are not being addressed. Requiring the dedication of flow, as
required by the Phase 1 Plan Amendments will certainly cause other existing beneficial uses
10 (including other fish and wildlife uses) to suffer, likely more than necessary and out of reasonable
11 proportion to the perceived benefits for fish and wildlife that may be provided by the percentages
12 of unimpaired flow adopted as supposed water quality objectives.

13 9. Finally, the State Water Board has set its "budget" without an adequate analysis of
14 the full impacts of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments on other, existing beneficial uses. Hence, it has
15 not made an informed assessment of the balance it has struck among beneficial uses, thereby failing

16 to meet one its core duties under the Porter-Cologne Act.

17 10. Given these shortcomings, the State Water Board had no basis to find or conclude
18 that implementing the Phase 1 Plan Amendments will put the water resources of the State to

19 beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable as Article X section 2 directs, or that
20 the Phase 1 Plan Amendments set a reasonable level of protection for beneficial uses taking into

21 account all the beneficial uses of the water involved, as required by the Porter-Cologne Act.
22 11. Many interested commenters, including Westlands, raised significant legal, scientific
23 and political questions to the State Water Board regarding its use of a percentage of unimpaired flow
24 as a supposed water quality objective, as well as other aspects of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.
25 Among other problems, many factors in addition to flow affect fish populations and the benefits
26 from flows will depend on addressing those factors as well. Flow cannot and should not be expected
27 to address the myriad of factors affecting the abundance of fish and wildlife, particularly the native
28 fishes that are experiencing low abundance. The State Water Board has essentially responded that

1776413.4 2010-089 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5

others can figure out the necessary refinements later, through adaptive management and voluntary
2 agreements. Pending such refinements, the Phase 1 Plan Amendments require that a greater volume
3 of water, measured as a percentage of unimpaired flow, go down the rivers regardless. And no matter
what later-developed information shows, the new supposed water quality objectives require that
volume of water going downriver be between 30% and 50% of the unimpaired flow.

6 12. The State Water Board's approach is the opposite of the process established by the
7 law, and results in the waste and unreasonable use of water. To satisfy the Porter-Cologne Act and

8 Article X section 2, the State Water Board should have identified the levels or limits of water quality
constituents or characteristics that are needed to provide reasonable protection for fish and wildlife.

10 To determine a reasonable level of protection, the State Water Board should have considered its
11 biological goals (such as how many additional fish it wants to sustainably support, and feasibly can
12 be sustainably supported), and the habitat requirements to meet various potential goals. Then, the
13 State Water Board could have compared and balanced the cost, and expected benefit, of that level
14 of protection to its impact on other beneficial uses.

15 13. The Porter-Cologne Act and Article X, section 2 demand more of the State Water
16 Board than the a approach it used here, dedicating a block of water for fish and wildlife beneficial
17 uses first, then seeking to incentivize others to figure out later how much water is truly needed.
18 Doing that more demanding work of determining how to best use water for fish and wildlife
19 beneficial uses is essential when allocating, or as in this case reallocating, California's precious
20 water resources. There are too many recent examples of regulatory restrictions that have imposed
21 significant costs on beneficial uses without improving the status of threatened fish species. The State
22 Water Board should not, must not, repeat that mistake when amending the Bay-Delta Plan, by
23 mandating a dedication of water without knowing what is needed or what, if any, significant benefits
24| it will likely provide.

25 14. By dedicating a block of water through amendments to its water quality control plan,
26 a quasi-legislative process, the State Water Board has denied existing users of the water due process.
27 The law is clear. Before the State Water Board alters the water rights of the existing water users it
28 must conduct a quasi-adjudicatory proceeding. Through the Phase - Plan Amendments the State

1776413.4 2010-089 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6

Water Board has reallocated water otherwise available under existing water rights by requiring a
2 dedication of a block of water for fish and wildlife beneficial uses, without conducting a quasi-
adjudicatory proceeding.
The Southern Delta Salinity Objective

15. The second general category of changes to the Bay-Delta Plan adopted in the Phase

6 Plan Amendments relates to agricultural beneficial uses and salinity in the south portion of the
Delta. In the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, the State Water Board revised the southern Delta salinity
objectives to be a mean daily electrical conductivity ("EC") of 1.0 deciSiemens per meter (dS/m)
year-round ("Southern Delta Salinity Objective"). This reflects a change from the prior objectives
10 of 0.7 dS/m during the months from April to August and 1.0 dS/m the balance of the year. The

11 change to the Southern Delta Salinity Objective is supported by scientific data and is legally
12 appropriate. However, in related changes to the program of implementation in the Bay-Delta Plan,
13 the State Water Board unlawfully and prematurely assigned responsibility for achieving the
14 Southern Delta Salinity Objective to the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") and
15 the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"). Among other things, the program of
16 implementation requires the State Water Board to "amend DWR's and [Reclamation's] water rights

17 to continue to require implementation of the interior southern Delta salinity water quality objectives
18 consistent with this plan." For this assignment of sole responsibility to Reclamation and DWR, the

19 State Water Board relied upon decades-old and outdated information gathered for preparation of the
20 1995 Bay-Delta Plan and Water Rights Decision 1641. In addition, the program of implementation
21 requires Reclamation "to maintain a salinity of 0.7 dS/m, April through August at Vernalis" as a
22 condition of its water right to provide assimilative capacity for discharges of salinity within the
23 south Delta.

24 16. The provisions of the program of implementation relating to the Southern Delta
25 Salinity Objective are unlawful and arbitrary. Assigning sole responsibility for meeting the Southern
26 Delta Salinity Objective to Reclamation and DWR is unlawful, as the assignment of responsibility
27 to a water right holder for implementing, even in part, a water quality objective must occur after the
28 State Water Board completes a quasi-adjudicatory water rights proceeding. By specifying

1776413.4 2010-089 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7

responsibility for meeting the Southern Delta Salinity Objective in the program of implementation,
2 the State Water Board has predetermined the outcome of any later water rights proceeding, thereby
3 denying due process. And, the assignment of sole responsibility is arbitrary given the changed
4 conditions and information regarding contributions since the State Water Board last assigned
5 responsibility, and the multiple factors affecting salinity. The State Water Board's prejudgment is

6 prejudicial, particularly given the changes in circumstances since 1995 and the multiple causes of

7 salinity in the south Delta, all of which should be the subject of evidentiary proceedings before any
8 allocation of responsibility.

9 Violations of CEQA

10 17. For numerous reasons, the State Water Board's process and review of the Phase -
11 Plan Amendments, including its Final Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential
12 Changes to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento San Joaquin Delta
13 Estuary ("Final SED"), also adopted on December 12, 2018, failed to meet the requirements of the
14 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). These CEQA failures include not adequately
15 analyzing the impacts of the water quality objectives on water project operations, and segmenting
16 analysis of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and a second set of planned amendments to the Bay-Delta
17 Plan, so-called Phase 2.

18 Failure to Treat Reliable Water Supply as a Coequal Goal

19 18. Finally, the 1 Phase 1 Plan Amendments are contrary to state policy established by the
20 Delta Reform Act. In the Phase 1 Plan Amendments the State Water Board has given priority to
21 protecting, restoring, or enhancing the Delta ecosystem over a more reliable water supply for
22 California. The Phase Plan Amendments will annually reallocate hundreds-of-thousands of acre-

23 feet of water away from existing beneficial uses to instream flow, thereby diminishing reliability of
24 water supplies for the people and economy of the San Joaquin Valley and beyond. The Phase 1 Plan
25 Amendments are contrary to the coequal goal of providing a more reliable water supply for
26 California.

27 Action Required by This Court

28 19. The Court should direct the State Water Board to set aside the Phase Plan

1776413.4 2010-089 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

Amendments and the Final SED. As adopted, the Phase 1 Plan Amendments are contrary to the
2 Porter-Cologne Act because a percentage of unimpaired flow is not a "water quality objective" as
3 defined by the Porter-Cologne Act, and because the State Water Board has not done the analysis
4 necessary to determine whether the water quality objectives provide a reasonable level of protection
5 for all beneficial uses. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments violate constitutional due process
6 requirements by assigning responsibility for meeting water quality objectives to water rights
holders, including for meeting the Southern Delta Salinity Objective. The Phase Plan Amendments
8 violate Article X, section 2 because they will not allow for the use of the waters involved to the
9 fullest extent of which they are capable or with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof
10 in the interest of the people and for the public welfare. And, the State Water Board failed to analyze

11 and account for the significant adverse environmental effects of the Phase 1 Plan 1 Amendments as
12 required by CEQA. Finally, the State Water Board has failed to follow state policy established by
13 the Delta Reform Act, by diminishing rather than promoting water supply reliability, and by failing
14 to treat water supply reliability as a coequal goal with ecosystem restoration.

15 20. The Court should therefore grant the relief requested below, including the issuance
16 of a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Phase 1 Plan
17 Amendments and the Final SED.

18 PARTIES AND STANDING

19 21. Westlands is a California water district formed pursuant to California Water Code
20 sections 34000 et seq. Westlands' main office is in Fresno, California. Westlands' service area is in
21 western Fresno and Kings counties, encompasses some 600,000 acres, and includes some of the
22 most highly productive agricultural lands in the world.

23 22. Westlands primarily serves water to farms that grow food and fiber. Westlands'
24 growers produce an average of more than $1 billion worth of food and fiber annually, generating
25 approximately $3.5 billion in farm-related economic activities in local communities. The economic
26 benefits produced by Westlands' growers result, in part, from the more than sixty high-quality food
27 and fiber crops they produce. Westlands' growers have led the State of California in the production

28 of six of California's top ten valued commodities. These contributions significantly impact local

1776413.4 2010-089 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9

1 and regional communities, the State of California, and the nation.

2 23. Westlands also provides water for municipal and industrial uses incidental to
3 agricultural operations, and to communities including Lemoore Naval Air Station, Huron, Avenal,

4 and Coalinga.

5 24. Most of the water Westlands supplies is provided by the federal Central Valley

6 Project ("CVP"), which conveys water through pumps located at the southern Delta, near the City
7 of Tracy. Westlands holds vested contractual rights to CVP water. In addition, to help compensate
8 for shortages of CVP water, Westlands purchases, and its water users depend upon, water made
9 available from willing sellers, which historically has included water from districts holding
10 Tuolumne River and Stanislaus River water rights. The water supplies available to those districts,

11 and hence the availability of water for purchase, will be substantially diminished as result of the
12 Phase 1 Plan Amendments.

13 25:--- Westlands recognizes the close connection between the health of the Delta ecosystem
14 and the ability to provide crucial water supplies to its growers and the communities it serves. In
15 adopting the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and Final SED, however, the State Water Board did not
16 demonstrate that its action will reasonably protect beneficial uses. Instead, beneficial uses will
17 suffer, including beneficial uses by fish and wildlife, agriculture, and urban communities.

18 26. Westlands brings this action on its own behalf, and behalf of those Westlands serves.
19 The interests of Westlands and those it serves are adversely affected by the State Water Board's (1)
20 actions in approving the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, and (2) inadequate environmental review of the
21 Phase 1 Plan Amendments in the Final SED. Westlands and those it serves have a direct and
22 beneficial interest in the State Water Board's compliance with Article X section 2, the Porter-
23 Cologne Act, the California Administrative Procedure Act, Government Code section 11340 et seq.,
24 and all other applicable laws in formulating, reviewing, approving and implementing the Phase 1
25 Plan Amendments.

26 27. Westlands and those it serves will be directly and substantially affected by the
27 impacts of the State Water Board's actions, which include, but are not limited to, loss of surface
28 water supply and related adverse environmental impacts on agricultural resources, groundwater

1776413.4 2010-089 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

emissions and climate change, and water 1 supplies, air quality, biological resources, greenhouse gas
2 quality. Westlands seeks to protect its access to water supply and to promote and enforce the
3 informational purposes of CEQA in this action, which purposes are defeated by the State Water
4 Board's attempt to make regulatory and water rights decisions as part of the Phase 1 Plan
5 Amendments without sufficient or accurate information. Ascertaining the true facts about the

6 environmental impacts of projects such as the 1 Phase 1 Plan Amendments and disclosing those true
7 facts to decision-makers and the public are purposes that are within the zone of interests CEQA is
8 intended to protect.

9 28. Westlands also brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of
10 Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and any other applicable legal theory to enforce important public
11 rights affecting the public interest.

12 29. Respondent and defendant State Water Board is a five-member board within the
13 California Environmental Protection Agency created by the Legislature in Division 1, Chapter 2,
14 Article 3 (section 174 et seq.) of the Water Code. The State Water Board is responsible for the
15 adjudicatory and regulatory functions of the State in the field of water resources. (Wat. Code, co?
16 174.) Under the Porter-Cologne Act, the State Water Board and the regional boards are the principal
17 state agencies with primary responsibility for the coordination and control of water quality. (Wat.
18 Code, § 13001.) The State Water Board may adopt water quality control plans, in accordance with
19 Water Code sections 13240 to 13244, for waters for which the federal Clean Water Act requires
20 water quality standards. (Wat. Code, § 13170.) The State Water Board purported to exercise this
21 authority when adopting the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.

22 30. Westlands is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through
23 20, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious names. DOES through 20,
24 inclusive, are those persons or entities who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described
25 in this petition, or other persons or entities presently unknown to Westlands who claim some legal
26 or equitable interest in the State Water Board actions that are the subject of this proceeding and
27 action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through
28 20 when such names and capacities become known.

1776413.4 2010-089 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11

JURISDICTION

2 31. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
sections 1060, 1085 and/or 1094.5, Public Resources Code sections 21168 and/or 21168.5, and
4 Government Code sections 11340.5 and 11350.

VENUE

6 32. Venue is proper in Fresno County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 401, because the principal offices of the State. Water Board are located in the

8 County of Sacramento and venue would be proper there, and the Office of the Attorney General
maintains an office in the County of Fresno.

10 PREJUDICIAL ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND ARBITRARY ACTION

11 33. The State Water Board prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the
12 manner required by law in its review and adoption of the Phase Plan Amendments and Final SED.
13 The State Water Board's adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and Final SED was arbitrary,
14 lacking in evidentiary support, and contrary to law, for the reasons alleged herein.
15 LACK OF ADEQUATE LEGAL REMEDY

16 34. Westlands has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
17 Unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the State Water Board to set aside
18 its adoption of the Final SED, and approval of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, the State Water

19 Board's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law.

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND NOTICE

21 35. Westlands has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions
22 precedent to the filing of this action, including compliance with Public Resources Code section
23 21177, and has fully exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting to the State Water Board
24 written and oral comments and testimony on the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, requesting that the State
25 Water Board comply with the Porter-Cologne Act, the California Constitution, CEQA, and the APA.
26 All issues raised in this action were raised before the State Water Board by Westlands, other entities

27 or organizations, or members of the public prior to the State Water Board's adoption of the Final
28 SED and approval of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

36. Westlands has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior
2 service of notice upon the State Water Board indicating its intent to commence this action. The
3 notice and proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

SUMMARY OF FACTS
5 The State Water Board's Amendment of the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan
37. The is State Water Board is required to adopt water quality control plans that attain the
highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all the demands being made or to be made

8 on those waters and the total values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social,

9 tangible and intangible. (Wat. Code, § 13000, et seq.) Each water quality control plan must (1)
10 identify the "beneficial uses" that will be protected by the plan, (2) establish "water quality
11 objectives" that provide for a reasonable level of protection for those beneficial uses considering,
12 among other things, all other beneficial uses to which those waters are put, and (3) create a "program
13 of implementation" needed to achieve those objectives. (Wat. Code, §§ 13050, subd. (j), 13241,
14 13242.) The water quality objectives, which are a regulatory component of the plan, must reflect the
15 State Water Board's balancing of all beneficial uses of water. (Wat. Code, §§ 13000, 13240, 13170.)

16 The 2009 NOP

17 38. On or about February 13, 2009, the State Water Board issued the Notice of
18 Preparation and Scoping Meeting for Environmental Documentation for the Update and
19| Implementation of the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
20| Joaquin Delta Estuary: Southern Delta Salinity and San Joaquin River Flows (*2009 NOP"). This
21 initiated the formal process for review and revision of the Bay-Delta Plan.
22 39. The 2009 NOP provided that the State Water Board would begin preparing the
23 environmental documentation for updating only the "Southern Delta salinity" and "San Joaquin
24 River flow objectives" components of the Bay-Delta Plan. The 2009 NOP further provided that the
25 State Water Board would begin "other portions of the environmental documentation as soon as
26 additional information is available." (2009 NOP, p. 2.)

27 40. The State Water Board later stated that it was pursuing a four-phased approach to
28 revising the Bay-Delta Plan.

1776413.4 2010-089 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13

41. Phase of the process addressed revisions to the objectives and program of
2 implementation for the San Joaquin River flows and southern Delta salinity.

3 42. Phase 2 of the process would address revisions to the remaining objectives and

4 program of implementation of the Bay-Delta Plan, including Delta outflow, Delta inflow, and
5 Sacramento River flows.

6 43. Phase 3, as initially described by the State Water Board, would involve
7- implementation of the amendments adopted in Phases 1 and 2 through water 1 right actions and other
8 activities.

9 44. Phase 4, as described by the State Water Board, would be a process through which
10 the State Water Board would develop and implement flow objectives to address public trust needs

11 pursuant to the Delta Reform Act. (Wat. Code, § 85086.)

12 45. Just as it divided its update to the Bay-Delta Plan, the State Water Board segmented
13 its CEQA review into separate processes.

14 46. Every draft of the SED for the Phase 1 Plan Amendments assumed for purposes of
15 review and analysis of impacts that the remainder of the Bay-Delta Plan would remain unchanged.
16 This assumption was made despite the State Water Board's stated plan and process then underway
17 to consider and adopt Phase 2 amendments.

18 47. Similarly, a report the State Water Board adopted in 2017 for the Phase 2
19 amendments, which attempted to describe the then current scientific information, assumed no Phase
20 Amendments.

21 48._ The State Water Board segmented its analysis of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and

22 the coming Phase 2 amendments despite the State Water Board's acknowledgement in a Fact Sheet

23 for that 2017 science report that "[t]he Bay-Delta watershed is an inextricably linked ecosystem-
24 from streams where native fish spawn through to the ocean." (Fact Sheet for Phase II Update of the
25 Bay-Delta Plan: Inflows to the Sacramento River and Delta and Tributaries, Delta Outflows, Cold

26 Water Habitat and Interior Delta Flows, p. 6.)

27 49. It is currently unclear as to whether and in what form the State Water Board will
28 3 pursue Phases 3 and 4 of the originally outlined four-phase approach.

1776413.4 2010-089 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14

50: Westlands actively participated in the administrative process that followed issuance

2 of the 2009 NOP, including by timely submitting written comments to the State Water Board.

3 The 2012 Draft SED

51. On or about December 31, 2012, the State Water Board released its "Draft Substitute
5 Environmental Document in Support of Potential Changes to the Water Quality Control Plan for the
6 Bay Delta: San Joaquin River Flows and Southern Delta Water Quality" (hereinafter the "2012 Draft
7 SED").

8 52. A substitute environmental document prepared in lieu of an Environmental Impact

9 Report ("EIR") under CEQA is an informational document intended to provide agencies and the
10 public with an understanding of a proposed plan or project sufficient to assess its environmental
11 consequences and is subject to the same substantive provisions of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code,
12 §§ 21002, 21080.5; CEQA Guidelines, § 15250; City of Morgan Hill v. Bay Area Air Quality
13 Management Dist. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 861, 874-75.)

14 53. The State Water Board's 2012 Draft SED purported to analyze the environmental
15 impacts associated with the Phase 1 amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan. (2012 Draft SED, p. 1-1.)
16 The 2012 Draft SED stated that the environmental impacts associated with Phase 2 amendments

17 would be evaluated in a separate environmental document.

18 54. The 2012 Draft SED described revised supposed water quality objectives for the
19 lower San Joaquin River, and new supposed water quality objectives for the Merced, Tuolumne,
20 and Stanislaus Rivers. Contrary to the Porter-Cologne Act, the parameter used for these supposed
21 water quality objectives was flow. These flow objectives included: (a) i numeric objective requiring
22 1,000 cubic feet per second ("cfs") of flow measured at Vernalis on the San Joaquin River during
23 the month of October, and (b) a new narrative objective. (2012 Draft SED, Appx. K, p. 1 of 11.)
24 The program of implementation described in the 2012 Draft SED required "35 percent of
25 unimpaired flow…from February through June from each of the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus
26 Rivers on a 14-day running average...*" (Id. at p. 3 of 11.)
27 55. The plan amendments circulated in 2012 included the Southern Delta Salinity
28 Objective ultimately adopted by the State Water Board. The program of implementation circulated

1776413.4 2010-089 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 15

1 in 2012 stated that Reclamation and DWR would be assigned responsibility for achieving the

2 Southern Delta Salinity Objective, and further that Reclamation's water rights would "be
3 conditioned to require compliance with a salinity level of 0.7 deciSiemens per meter (dS/m) from

4 April through August and 1.0 dS/m from September through March in the San Joaquin River at
5 Airport Way Bridge near Vernalis."

6 56. The State Water Board received more than 4,000 comments on the 2012 Draft SED

7 and the proposed Bay-Delta Plan amendments described therein, including comments from

8 Westlands.

9 57. The State Water Board did not recirculate the 2012 Draft SED for nearly four years
10 after accepting public comments.

11 The 2016 Draft SED

12 58. On or about September 15, 2016, the State Water Board recirculated a revised draft
13 substitute environmental document (*2016 Draft SED"). The 2016 Draft SED described some
14 proposed amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan that were different from those described in the 2012
15 Draft SED. The proposed amendments newly described in the 2016 Draft SED included significant
16 changes to the plan area, the water quality objectives, and the program of implementation.

17 59. These changes included a new numeric objective for the ostensible protection of fish
18 and wildlife, again based on flow despite the Porter-Cologne Act. This objective provided that "[a]
19 percent of unimpaired flow between 30% - 50%, inclusive, from each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne,
20 and Merced Rivers shall be maintained from February through June" based upon a minimum 7-day
21 running average flow rate. (2016 Draft SED, Appx. K, p. 18.) The State Water Board defined
22 unimpaired flow as "the natural water production of river basin, unaltered by upstream diversions,
23 storage, or by export or import of water to or from other watersheds." (Id. at p. 20.) This new numeric
24 objective was later revised by the State Water Board before adoption in the Phase 1 Plan
25 Amendments, as alleged herein.

26 60. The proposed plan amendments described in the 2016 Draft SED also included a new
27 narrative objective for the ostensible protection of fish and wildlife, likewise based on flow. The
28 narrative objective provided: "Maintain inflow conditions from the San Joaquin River watershed to

1776413.4 2010-089 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

the Delta at Vernalis sufficient to support and maintain the natural production of viable native San
2 Joaquin River watershed fish populations migrating through the Delta. Inflow conditions that

3 reasonably contribute toward maintaining viable native migratory San Joaquin River fish
4 populations include, but may not be limited to, flows that more closely mimic the natural
5 hydrographic conditions to which native fish species are adapted, including the relative magnitude,

6 duration, timing, and spatial extent of flows as they would naturally occur. Indicators of viability
include population abundance, spatial extent, distribution, structure, genetic and life history
8 diversity, and productivity.' (2016 Draft SED, Appx. K, p. 18.) This new narrative objective was
9 ultimately adopted without change by the State Water Board in the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.

10 61. Finally, in the 2016 Draft SED, the State Water Board proposed substantial changes
11 to the program of implementation portion of the Bay-Delta Plan. The program of implementation,
12 however, maintained the premature and unlawful assignment of responsibility to DWR and
13 Reclamation for achievement of the Southern Delta Salinity Objective.

14 62. Westlands provided extensive written comments on the State Water Board's 2016
15 Draft SED in March 2017. The State Water Board also received approximately 3,100 letters,
16 amounting to about 10,400 comments, from federal, state and local agencies; elected officials;
17 stakeholders; and members of the public. In total, the State Water Board received approximately
18 19,050 pages of material during the public comment period. The comments covered an extensive
19 range of topics, from the water quality control planning process itself, to the environmental analysis,
20 I to the State Water Board's chosen alternatives, to the modeling (and the assumptions therein), to the
21 results that showed a benefit of 1,103 fish.

22 The Final SED, the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, and the State Water Board's Response to Public Comments
23

24 63. In July 2018, the State Water Board published the Final SED, the Phase 1 Plan
25 Amendments, and its responses to public comments. The State Water Board provided significant
26 new information and analysis in its response to public comments. Despite this new information and
27 analysis, the State Water Board stated it would not accept any further written comments on the Final
28 SED and response to comments.

1776413.4 2010-089 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 17

64. In the Phase 1 Plan Amendments released with the Final SED the State Water Board
2 continued it to use flow as a parameter for supposed water quality objectives, contrary to the Porter-
3 Cologne Act. The State Water Board changed the numeric flow objective for the Merced, Tuolumne,

4 and Stanislaus Rivers from requiring a range between 30% and 50% unimpaired flow to requiring
5 exactly 40% unimpaired flow within an adaptive range between 30% and 50%. The State Water
6 Board also added a new narrative flow objective in Table 3, which requires that the flows provided
7 to meet the 40% unimpaired flow objective from February through June be managed in a manner to
8 avoid causing significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife beneficial uses at other times of the

9 year. The State Water Board added this in an apparent effort to conform the amendments to its
10 modeling of, and premature commitment to, the 40% unimpaired flow objective, modeling in which

11 the State Water Board used an iterative process imposing carryover storage requirements and other
12 operations constraints to find an operational plan under which its unimpaired flow requirements for
13 February to June did not result in harm to fish and wildlife beneficial uses in other months of the
14 year. The State Water Board did not analyze the impacts this provision (which expands the temporal
15 scope of the objectives from February-June to year-round) would have on other beneficial uses of
16 water and/or how those impacts might be mitigated.

17 65. Many of the defects and issues identified in comments made to the State Water Board
18 in response to the 2012 Draft SED and 2016 Draft SED persisted through the State Water Board's
1 19 adoption of the Final SED and Phase 1 Plan Amendments. Westlands provided extensive written
20 comments on the Final SED and Phase Plan Amendments in July 2018, despite the inadequate
21  time allowed by the State Water Board for comment given the substantial new information included
22 in the response to comments portion of the Final SED.

23 The State Water Board's Adoption of the Final SED and the Phase 1 Plan Amendments

24 66. On December 12, 2018, following a 30-day stay requested by the then Governor and
25 Governor-elect, the State Water Board adopted the Final SED, its Findings and Statement of
26 Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation and Monitoring Program. A copy of the State Water
27 Board's Resolution No. 2018-0059 adopting the Final SED and the Phase 1 Plan Amendments is
28 attached hereto as Exhibit B. The State Water Board also adopted the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, in

1776413.4 2010-089 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 18

1 the form set forth in Appendix K to the Final SED. A copy of Appendix K, which shows the changes

2 to the Bay-Delta Plan in underline and strikeout, is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

3 The Phase 1 Plan Amendments and Final SED

4 67. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments include the LSJR Flow Objective, which requires
5 increased flows, with the following elements:

6 a. Narrative and numeric flow objectives with a required percent of unimpaired

7 flow, expressed as 40% of unimpaired flow, for the months of February through June in the
8 Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, and a narrative and minimum numeric flow objective in
9 the San Joaquin River near Vernalis. The State Water Board also included a narrative objective
10 requiring that flows meeting the 40% unimpaired flow objective from February through June be
11 "managed" to avoid causing significant adverse impacts to fish and wildlife beneficial uses at other
12 times of the year.

13 b. A provision for adaptive implementation of unimpaired flows, which allows
14 flows to be shifted in time and shaped in order to provide the greatest benefits to fish and wildlife,
15 and allows for changes in flows between 30% and 50% of unimpaired flow in the Stanislaus,
16 Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers in response to changed information or conditions.

17 C. A provision for a temporary change in the implementation of the flow
-18 requirements in cases of emergency through a water right proceeding, but measures must be taken

19 to reasonably protect the fish and wildlife beneficial use in light of the circumstances of the
20 emergency.

21 d. Recommendations for non-flow measures.
22 (Final SED Executive Summary, ES-4-ES-5 [July 2018].)

23 68. The LSJR Flow Objective is unsupported by sound science and unlikely to provide
24 any meaningful benefits to desirable fish species due to diminished and disrupted habitats in the
25 Bay-Delta watershed such as lost floodplains, the proliferation of invasive species, shift in the food-
26 webs, and increases in pollutants, among other changes. Many of the ecosystem functions necessary

27 for that water to protect or enhance fish abundance are not present, or non-flow factors will interfere
28 with those functions. These missing but necessary ecosystem functions, and the non-flow factors

1776413.4 2010-089 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19

that will interfere with those functions, are either not addressed at all or not adequately addressed
2 by the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.

3 69. Including the month of June in the period during which the unimpaired flows must
4 be maintained is unreasonable and arbitrary. By June of each year, except in wet years, nearly all of
5 the anadromous fish that are supposed to benefit from the flows have already out-migrated.

6 Maintaining the specified unimpaired flows in June will significantly increase the overall water
7 supply cost of maintaining the flows. Hence, including June as a month for the flows provides little

8 benefit, and at a relatively high cost to other beneficial uses. Despite this, the State Water Board
9 declined to end the period for required flows before June for any year types. Including the month of
10| June in the period during which flow must be maintained has the effect of significantly increasing
11 the block of water set aside for fish and wildlife purposes.

12 70. Despite mandating a certain percentage of unimpaired flows in the LSJR Flow
13 Objective, and thereby setting aside as a block of water such flows will require, the State Water
14 Board does not yet know what biological goals it has for the flows. As defined by the State Water
15 Board, biological goals are "outcomes that can be measured to determine the response of salmon
16 and other species to flows and other actions, and include such things as abundance, productivity as
17 measured by population growth rate; genetic and life history diversity; and population spatial extent,
18 distribution, and structure of salmon." (Final SED Executive Summary, ES-10, fn. 7 [July 2018].)
19 The State Water Board expressly deferred setting biological goals until after adoption of the Phase
20 1 Plan Amendments. The program of implementation requires the State Water Board to "consider"

21 adoption of biological goals within 180 days after the date the Office of Administrative Law
22 approves the Phase 1 Plan Amendments. (Final SED,-Appx. K, p. 32.) The program of
23 implementation provides that those future biological goals "should be specific, measurable,
24 achievable, result-focused, and include a time frame for when they will be achieved." (Id. at p. 33.)
25 By deferring a decision upon its biological goals until after its adoption of the Phase 1 Plan
26 Amendments, the State Water Board failed to make an informed judgment of whether the LSJR
27 Flow Objective provides a reasonable level of protection for fish and wildlife, and of whether it has
28 struck the proper balance among all beneficial uses when setting the LSJR Flow Objective.

1776413.4 2010-089 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20

71. -The-Final SED does not analyze the project impacts in relation to an appropriate
2 baseline of existing environmental conditions because its baseline does not accurately account for
3 the existing altered Bay-Delta ecosystem or the potential effects or benefits of the LSJR Flow
4 Objective approach given those alterations to the ecosystem.

72. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments also include the Southern Delta Salinity Objective,
6 which requires a mean daily EC of 1.0 dS/m year-round, instead of 0.7 dS/m from April to August
7 and 1.0 dS/m the balance of the year previously required. The program of implementation expressly
8 requires Reclamation:

9 [T]o maintain a salinity of 0.7 dS/m, April through August at Vernalis, as a condition
10 of their water right, in order to implement and meet the proposed salinity water quality objectives in the interior southern Delta. The southern Delta salinity proposal

11 would also replace the three current fixed points for monitoring southern Delta salinity compliance, and instead identifies three extended channel segments for
12 monitoring conditions and measuring compliance.

13 (Final SED Executive Summary, ES-5 [July 2018]; see also, Final SED, Appx. K, pp. 41-42.) The
14 program of implementation further provides:

15 As part of implementing the salinity water quality objective for the interior southern

16 Delta, the State Water Board will amend DWR's and [Reclamation's] water rights to continue to require implementation of the interior southern Delta salinity water

17 quality objectives consistent with this plan.

18 (Final SED, Appx. K, p. 42.) Through these and other provisions of the program of implementation,
19 the State Water Board has predetermined the outcome of any subsequent water rights proceeding to
20 implement the Southern Delta Salinity Objective, without affording Reclamation and others due
21 process.

22 73. The Phase 1 Plan Amendments require the State. Water Board impose minimum
23 reservoir carryover storage targets or other water rights requirements. (Final SED, Appx. K, p. 28.)
24 By embedding this requirement in the program of implementation, the State Water Board has not
25 properly noticed the proceeding, avoided environmental impacts analysis in violation of CEQA, and
26 deprived Reclamation and others of due process.
27 74. The program of implementation adopts what it calls an "adaptive management"
28 approach, but what is actually a mechanism for others to figure out how to best allocate the block

1776413.4 2010-089 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 21

-] of water set aside for fish and wildlife. This is not science-based or "true" adaptive management,

2 which requires the decision-making to be linked to a rigorous study plan of hypotheses testing and
3 monitoring. Here, the State Water Board has deferred its statutory duties, and failed to establish a
4 process and thresholds or performance measures for determining when a change in the
5 implementation measure is scientifically appropriate, and specifically articulated standards or
6 criteria for determining whether actions have been effective.

7 75. The program of implementation requires the State Water Board to establish a
8 Stanislaus, Tuolumne and Merced Working Group ("STM Working Group") to assist with the
implementation, monitoring and effectiveness assessment of the February through June LSJR Flow
10 Objectives. The program of implementation fails to specify a procedure for implementing the
11 adaptive adjustments, and instead delegates this responsibility to the STM Working Group, or State
12 Water Board staff as necessary. The State Water Board concedes it did not consider procedures for
13 implementing the adaptive adjustments prior to adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments. 1
14 76. Issues specific to the 2012 Draft SED and 2016 Draft SED were not addressed in the
15 Final SED.

16 77. The Final SED project description is incomplete, inaccurate, and unstable because,
17 in part, it does not define through the program of implementation any parameters or describe the
.18 range of possible flow patterns the State Water Board's Executive Director may order in the future.
19 The Final SED does not adequately articulate the biological goals or performance criteria such
20 actions are intended to meet, and it does not analyze or mitigate the reasonably foreseeable direct,
21 indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of implementing those flow patterns.

22 78. The State Water Board prematurely committed to a definite course of action and
23 outlined impermissibly narrow project objectives, resulting in a Final SED that does not consider a
24 reasonable range of alternatives. Instead, the Final SED considered only limited permutations of the
25 same proposal - different percentages of unimpaired flow. As a result of the focus on flow, the Final

26 SED ignores potential alternatives that included other objectives for water quality constituents or
27 characteristics (e.g., temperature and turbidity) related to the protection of water quality for the fish

28 and wildlife beneficial uses, or elements in addition to flow such as floodplain habitat

1776413.4 2010-089 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

improvements. And by not examining alternatives that address other factors that affect fish
2 populations in combination with flow, the Final SED has failed to inform the State Water Board's
3 performance of its duty under Article X, section 2 to put water resources to beneficial use to the
4 fullest extent of which they are capable. A reasonable range of alternatives, including elements in
5 addition to flow, may have led the State Water Board to conclude that less water, in combination

6 with other measures would serve the purposes of the LSJR Flow Objective just as well, thereby

7 freeing up water for other fish and wildlife uses or consumptive uses.

8 79. The Final SED ignores significant impacts, in part, by assuming the impacts of
9 reduced surface water supplies will be offset by groundwater pumping and by ignoring impacts to
10 areas south of the Delta, including those CVP contractors serving CVP water to areas south of the
11 Delta such as Westlands. The Final SED recognizes that the LSJR Flow Objectives will lead to
12  increased reliance on groundwater pumping yet fails to identify environmental impacts associated
13 with that increase such as agricultural land fallowing, water supply and water quality impacts, air
14 quality impacts, and economic hardship not only on agencies that rely on diversions of surface water
15 from the three tributaries, but also on CVP contractors serving areas south of the Delta such as
16 Westlands. The assumption of increased groundwater pumping relied upon in the Final SED is
17  unrealistic and unsupported, and fails to adequately account for implementation of the Sustainable
18 Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA").

19 80. The Final SED does not adequately disclose or mitigate the numerous adverse
20 impacts of the LSJR Flow Objective or the Southern Delta Salinity Objective.

21 81. The State Water Board has discretion when establishing water quality objectives.
22. That discretion, however, has limits. These limits include state policy and mandates established by
23 Article X, section 2, the Porter-Cologne Act, CEQA, and the Delta Reform Act.

24 82. The LSJR Flow Objectives are intended to protect the fish and wildlife uses, but they
25 are unlikely to provide any meaningful benefits to desirable fish species, in part, due to diminished
26 and disrupted habitats in the Bay-Delta watershed such as lost floodplains, the proliferation of
27 invasive species, shifts in the food-webs, and increases in pollutants, among other changes. In
28 exchange for this uncertain and limited benefit for fish species, and contrary to the goal of providing

1776413.4 2010-089 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 23

a more reliable water supply for California, implementing the LSJR Flow Objectives will deprive
2 existing beneficial uses of much needed water, harming the farms, communities, and environment
3 of the San Joaquin Valley, Silicon Valley and beyond. It is unreasonable and contrary to law to
reallocate water resources in a way that will inflict such harm on other beneficial uses, with little or
5 no predictable benefit for fish, on the speculation that the many other elements needed to realize

6 benefits for fish will someday materialize.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (The LSJR Flow Objectives are Unlawful Because the Porter-Cologne Act Does Not

9 Authorize the State Water Board to Use Flow as a Water Quality Objective)

10 83. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,

11 I inclusive.

12 84. The LSJR Flow Objectives establish new requirements for flow in the San Joaquin
13 River at Airport Way Bridge in Vernalis, in the Stanislaus River at Koetitz, in the Tuolumne River
14 at Modesto, and in the Merced River near Stevenson. These new requirements for flow are unlawful
15 because flow is not a proper parameter for a water quality objective under the Porter-Cologne Act.

16 85. "Water quality objectives" are defined in the Porter-Cologne Act as the "limits or
17 levels of water quality constituents or characteristics which are established for the reasonable
18 protection of beneficial uses of water or the prevention of nuisance within a specific area." (Wat.

19 Code, § 13050, subd. (h).) Temperature, pH, dissolved solids, pathogens, dissolved oxygen, and
20 chemical constituents such as pesticides are all examples of "water quality constituents or
21 characteristics." Flow, by contrast, is a rate that defines the total volume of water moving through a
22. given cross-section of the river per unit time (ft3/s or m3/s). Flow is the product of cross-sectional
23 averaged water velocity and the channel's cross-sectional area. While flow may affect water quality
24| (e.g., temperature), as used in the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, flow is not a water quality constituent
25 or is characteristic. Flow is outside the scope of a water quality objective as defined in subdivision (h)
26 of section 13050. Flow is therefore not a proper parameter for a water quality objective.
27 86. There are sound policy and practical reasons for excluding properties such as flow
28 from the scope of water quality objectives that may be established in a water quality control plan.

1776413.4 2010-089 24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 24

The preparation and adoption of water quality control plans is a quasi-legislative process. The

2 determination and modification of water rights, by contrast, is a quasi-adjudicatory process. These
3 processes are subject to differing standards and requirements. The necessary separation of these two

4 processes is breached when water quality objectives are expressed in terms of flow, because that
5. can predetermine whose water rights may be affected and by how much, without the benefit of the
6 due process afforded in an adjudicative proceeding. As alleged herein, just such a breach of the
7 separation between quasi-legislative and quasi-adjudicative processes has occurred with regard to

8 the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, resulting in a denial of due process.

9 87.. The LSJR Flow Objectives are in excess of the State Water Board's authority and
10 contrary. to the Porter-Cologne Act, because they include flow as a water quality objective. The
11 Court should therefore issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its
12 adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and enjoin the State Water Board from implementing
13 them.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief)

16 (In the Alternative, the State Water Board's Construction of the Porter-Cologne Act that

17 "Water Quality Objective" Includes Flow is an Underground Regulation)

18 88. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,

19 inclusive.

20 89. In the alternative to the First Cause of Action, assuming arguendo that water quality
21. objectives as defined by the Porter-Cologne Act may include flow a as a parameter, then the LSJR
22 Flow Objectives are still unlawful because the State Water Board has not complied with the APA
23 regarding its interpretation of "water quality objective" to include flow-based parameters, and the
24 LSJR Flow Objectives are based on that interpretation.

25 90. Under the APA, an agency adopting a regulation "must comply with the procedures
26 for formalizing such regulation, which include public notice and approval by the Office of
27 Administrative Law. . ." (County of Butte v. Emergency Medical Services Authority (2010) 187
28 | Cal.App.4th 1175, 1200 [internal quotations and citations omitted].) A "regulation" within the

1776413.4 2010-089 25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 25

meaning of the APA includes "every rule, regulation, order, or standard of general application or
2 the amendment, supplement, or revision of any rule, regulation, order, or standard adopted by any

3 state agency to implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered by it, or to
4 govern its procedure." (Gov. § Code, § 11342.600). In Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw
5 (1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, 571, the California Supreme Court explained that a regulation is subject to

6 the APA if it has two principal identifying characteristics: (1) "the agency must intend its rule to
7 apply generally, rather than in a specific case;" and (2) "the rule must 'implement, interpret, or make

8 specific the law enforced or administered by [the agency], or . govern [the agency's] procedure."*
9 (Citing former Gov. Code, § 11342, subd. (g), repealed and replaced with Gov. Code, § 11342.600.)
10 An "underground regulation" is "any guideline, criterion, bulletin, manual, instruction, order,
11 standard of general application, or other rule, including a rule governing a state agency procedure,
12 that is a regulation as defined in Section 11342.600 of the Government Code, but has not been
13 adopted as a regulation and filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to the APA and is not subject
14 to an express statutory exemption from adoption pursuant to the APA." (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 1, §
15 250.)

16 91. The State Water Board's interpretation of the term "water quality objective" under
17. the Porter-Cologne Act to include flow, which is demonstrated by its use of flow-based objectives
18 in the LSJR Flow Objectives, is a regulation subject to the requirements of the APA. The State

19 Water Board, however, has not adopted that regulation in accordance with the APA.

20 92. Under the APA, "[n]o state agency shall issue, utilize, enforce, or attempt to enforce
21 any guideline, criterion, bulletin, manual, instruction, order, standard of general application, or other
22 rule, which is a regulation as defined in section 11342.600, unless [it] has been adopted as a
23 regulation and filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to [the APA]." (Gov. Code, § 11340.5(a).)
24 The- LSJR Flow Objectives are based on the State Water Board's underground regulation
25 interpreting "water quality objectives" to include flow-based parameters. The State Water Board's
26 adoption of the LSJR Flow Objectives was therefore in violation of the APA.

27 93. The Court should issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside
28| its adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and enjoin the State Water Board from implementing

1776413.4 2010-089 26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 26

them, based on the State Water Board's violation of the APA.

2 94. Government Code section 11350(a) provides that "[a]ny interested person may
3 obtain a judicial declaration as to the validity of any regulation…by bringing an action for

4 declaratory relief in the superior court in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure."

5 95. Westlands contends that the State Water Board's interpretation of the term "water
6 quality objective" as including flow is a regulation subject to the APA. Westlands is informed and
7 believes, and based thereon alleges, that the State Water Board disagrees that its interpretation of
8 the term "water quality objective" as including flow is a regulation subject to the APA.

9 96. An actual controversy exists between Westlands and the State Water Board
10 concerning whether the State Water Board's interpretation of "water quality objective" as including
11 flow is invalid and unlawful because it has not been adopted in accordance with the APA.
12 97. - A judicial determination, and a declaration as to the validity of the State Water
13 Board's interpretation of "water quality objective" without compliance with the APA, is necessary
14 and appropriate at this time.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Writ of Mandate)

17 (The Phase Plan Amendments are Unlawful Because the Program of Implementation

18 Assigns Responsibility for Meeting Objectives to Specific Water Rights Holders Without Providing Due Process)

19 98. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,
20 inclusive.

21 99. The Phase Plan Amendments modify the water quality objective for salinity in the
22- southern Delta,- as measured by electrical conductivity, through the Southern Delta Salinity
23 Objective. To implement the Southern Delta Salinity Objective through a modification of water
24 rights, the State Water Board must evaluate and determine the water rights conditions, if any, that
25 are needed. That proceeding would respect water rights holders' constitutionally afforded rights to
26 due process. But here, the State Water Board has not afforded the required due process. Instead, the
27 State Water Board has predetermined the outcome of any subsequent water rights proceeding to
28 implement the Southern Delta Salinity Objective through the terms of the program of

1776413.4 2010-089 27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 27

1 implementation adopted in a quasi-legislative process.

2 100. The program of implementation includes provisions assigning responsibility for
3 meeting the Southern Delta Salinity Objective to Reclamation, through its operation of the CVP.

4 For 1 example, as revised by the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, the program of implementation requires
5 Reclamation to ensure salinity of 0.7 dS/m at Vernalis during a portion of the year. The Phase 1

6 Plan Amendments provide:

7 For the San Joaquin River at Airport Way near Vernalis, [Revised Water Right Decision] D-1641 imposes conditions on [Reclamation's] water rights requiring 8 implementation of EC levels of 0.7 mmhos/cm from April through August and 1.0
9 mmhos/cm from September through March (units of mmhos/cm are equal to units of dS/m). As part of implementing the salinity water quality objective for the interior southern Delta, [Reclamation] shall be required to continue to comply with these 10 salinity levels, as a condition of its water rights.
11 (Final SED, Appx. K, p. 42.)

12 101. Additional examples of statements in the program of implementation where the State
13 Water Board has assigned responsibility to Reclamation for meeting the new objectives related to
14 salinity include:

15 [T]he State Water Board will amend DWR's and [Reclamation's] water rights to continue to require implementation of the interior southern Delta salinity water 16 quality objectives consistent with this plan;

17 DWR's and [Reclamation's] water rights shall be conditioned to require

18 development of information that will be used to determine the appropriate locations and methods to assess attainment of the salinity objective in the interior southern Delta; and
19

20 Prior to State Water Board approval of the Monitoring and Reporting Plan,

21 [attainment] compliance of the salinity objective for the interior southern Delta will be assessed at stations C-6, C-8, and P-12, which [Reclamation] and DWR shall be

22 required to continue to operate as a condition of their water rights.

23 (Final SED, Appx. K, pp. 42,43.)

24 102. The State Water Board's assignment of responsibility in the program of
25 implementation predetermines the State Water Board's decision in any subsequent water rights
26 proceeding because of the effect of Water Code section 13247. Water Code section 13247 requires
27 the State Water Board to comply with its adopted water quality control plan. The "guiding principle"
28 in any water rights proceeding commenced to implement a water quality control plan is that the

1776413.4 2010-089 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 28

1 State Water Board's power to act in such a water rights proceeding "is constrained by the terms of
2 the plan it is implementing." (State Water Resources Control Bd. Cases (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th
3 674, 729.) In any subsequent water rights proceeding to implement the Phase 1 Plan Amendments,

4 the State Water Board will be bound to follow its statements that Reclamation's water rights will be
5 conditioned to require it to achieve the salinity objectives and take other related actions.

6 103. By predetermining the outcome of any subsequent water rights proceeding through
7 the terms of its program of implementation, the State Water Board has denied the due process that

8 it must afford before modifying water rights. A right to appropriate water is recognized as a property
9 right and once rights to use water are acquired, they become vested property rights. The United
10 States Constitution prohibits a state from depriving any person of property "without due process of
11 law." (U.S. Const., 14th Amend.) The California Constitution likewise provides that "[a] person
12 may not be deprived of...property without due process of law." (Cal. Const., art. I, § 7.) Thus,
13 appropriative water rights cannot be infringed by others or taken by governmental action without
14 due process and just compensation.

15 104. The State Water Board's adoption of the program of implementation in the Phase
16 Plan Amendments has determined rights without due process, and was therefore unlawful. The
17 Court should issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the
18 Phase 1 Plan Amendments and enjoin the State Water Board from following or applying them.
19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate)

21 (The State Water Board Failed to Comply With Water Code §§ 13240, 13241)

22 105. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,
23 inclusive.

24 106. A water quality control plan must conform to the State policy that the activities and
25 factors which may affect water quality "shall be regulated to attain the highest water quality which

26 is reasonable, considering all demands being made and to be made on those waters and the total
27 values involved, beneficial and detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible." (Wat.
28 Code, §§ 13000, italics added, 13240, 13170.) The State Water Board must "establish such water

1776413.4 2010-089 29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 29

quality objectives in water quality control plans as in its judgment will ensure the reasonable
2 protection of beneficial uses. .. ."(Wat. Code, § 13241, italics added.) In establishing water quality
3 objectives, the State Water Board must consider: the beneficial uses of the water; the environmental
characteristics of the watershed; the water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved
5 through the control of all factors affecting water quality; economic considerations; the need for

6 developing housing within the region; and the need to develop and use recycled water. (Wat. Code,
7 § 13241, subds. (a)-(f).)

8 107: The State Water Board failed to meet its duties under Water Code sections 13240

9 and 13241 to ensure reasonable protection for beneficial uses by balancing among uses, because
10 among other things, it failed to adequately analyze the - effect of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments on
11 all beneficial uses of the waters affected, it failed to define its biological goals for the LSJR Flow
12 Objectives and hence the benefits it is seeking to achieve for fish and wildlife uses, and it adopted

13 and will proceed to implement the LSJR Flow Objectives without provision for the many other
14 factors that affect the abundance and viability of salmonid and other fish species it is seeking to
15  protect.

16 108. The Court should a therefore issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board
17 to set aside its 1 adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and enjoin the State Water Board from
18 implementing them.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate)

21 (The State Water Board Failed to Comply with subdivision (c) of Water Code § 13241)
22 109. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,
23 inclusive.

24 110. Under Water Code section 13241, subdivision (c), when establishing water quality
25 objectives, the State Water Board must consider "[w]ater quality conditions that could reasonably
26 be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors which affect water quality in the area."
27 111. Numerous factors affect the water quality conditions for fish in the waters subject to
28 the Phase 1 Plan Amendments. Yet, in its analyses, the State Water Board focused exclusively on

1776413.4 2010-089 30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 30

alternatives involving varying levels of flow as the means to improve conditions for fish and

2 wildlife. The State Water Board gave no meaningful consideration to alternatives involving the
3  coordinated control of all factors affecting desirable fish species, such as predation and the loss of
4 shallow floodplain habitat. Instead of fulfilling its duty to consider control of all factors affecting

5 water quality, the State Water Board has suggested to other parties that they should develop
6 measures to control such other factors and propose means to control or redress such factors to the
7 State Water Board through voluntary agreements or adaptive management.

8 112. The State Water Board has failed to fulfill its duty under subdivision (c) of Water
9 Code section 13241 to explore coordinated control of all factors affecting fish, not simply
10 unimpaired flows, when setting the LSJR Flow Objectives. The Court should therefore issue a writ

11 of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments
12 and enjoin the State Water Board from implementing them.

13 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Writ of Mandate)

15 (The LSJR Flow Objectives are Unlawful Because Meeting Them Will Be a Waste and

16 Unreasonable Use of Water)

17 113. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,
18 inclusive.

19 114. The California Constitution provides:

20 It is hereby declared that because of the conditions prevailing in this State the general

21 welfare requires that the water resources of the State be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented, and that the conservation of such 22 waters is to be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in

23 the interest of the people and for the public welfare.

24|| (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2.) Water Code section 100 imposes the same prohibition against waste and
25  unreasonable use. Water Code section 275 directs the State Water Board to "take all appropriate
26 proceedings or actions before executive, legislative, or judicial agencies to prevent waste,
27 unreasonable use, unreasonable method of use, or unreasonable method of diversion of water in this
28 state."

1776413.4 2010-089 31
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 31

115._ In setting the LSJR Flow Objectives, the State Water Board did not set biological

2 goals such as how many desirable fish should be produced, and then determine the habitat

3 requirements to produce that number of fish, the functions needed to provide that number of fish,
4 the flows to provide those functions, and hence how much water and habitat were needed. Instead,
5 the State Water Board is mandating that a block of water remain instream, without having analyzed
6 whether that volume of water is necessary or sufficient to achieve a particular goal for increased fish
7 abundance. The State Water Board thus skipped a crucial step in setting the LSJR Flow Objectives.
8 And because the State Water Board did not evaluate alternatives that varied anything but levels of
9 flow, the State Water Board does not know if the amount of water it is requiring be dedicated to fish
10 and wildlife will provide the desired benefit, or how much water could have been saved for other

11 beneficial uses by combining flow with non-flow measures.

12 116. The LSJR Flow Objectives will come at significant cost to water supply. The block-
13 of water dedicated to meet these objectives will deprive other, existing beneficial uses of water
14 dependent on that water.

15 117. If implemented, the LSJR Flow Objectives would be a waste and unreasonable use
16 of water, because they will not allow for the use of the water resources involved to the fullest extent

17 of which they are capable, or with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest
18 of the people and for the public welfare. That result is prohibited by the Article X, section 2 and the

19 Water Code.

20 118. The Court should therefore issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board

21 to set aside its adoption of the Phase 1 Plan Amendments and enjoin the State Water Board from
22 implementing them.

23 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Writ of Mandate - The State Water Board's Environmental Review Violates the California

25 Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

26 119. Westlands realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth above,

27 inclusive.

28 120. In adopting the Final SED and the Phase 1 Plan Amendments, the State Water Board

1776413.4 2010-089 32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 32

1 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

2 121. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the

3 Final SED fails to provide " [a]n accurate, stable and finite project description." (Rio Vista Farm
4 Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 370 [internal quotations omitted];
5 Cal. Code Regs, tit. 23, § 3777(b)(1).) The Final SED project description is not accurate or complete;

6 nor is it stable, but rather is subject to change because, in part, it does not define parameters or
7 describe the range of possible flow patterns the Executive Director may order in the future; it does
8 not adequately articulate the biological goals or performance criteria such actions are intended to
9 meet; and it does not analyze the reasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative
10 environmental impacts of those implementing flow patterns. Further, the description of the project
11 fails to identify proper objectives consistent with CEQA's requirements and demonstrates the State
12 Water Board's premature commitment to a definite course of action without completing the
13 necessary environmental review, including but not limited to meaningful consideration of
14 alternatives. The stated objectives are too narrow and lack any biological goals or other specific
15 water quality objectives, making it impossible to meaningfully compare potential alternatives. The
16 project description further fails to disclose fundamental project components including, among other
17 things, minimum reservoir storage levels, flowing shifting, flow shaping, and reservoir refill criteria.
18 The Final SED improperly defers identification of key elements of the Phase Plan Amendments

19 and necessary for the public and decision-makers to understand the whole of the proposed action
20 and evaluate its likely environmental effects.

21 122..r. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law by unlawfully
22. segmenting analysis of impacts from Phase and Phase 2. The State Water Board acknowledges
23 the relationship of the Phase 1Plan Amendments and Phase 2, yet the environmental impacts
24 analysis for each phase has been or will be performed as if the other were not to occur.

25 123. The "adaptive management" approach in the program of implementation improperly
26 defers critical components of the program of implementation, and consequently, the related
27 environmental impacts analysis and necessary mitigation measures.

28 124. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the

1776413.4 2010-089 33
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 33

- Final SED does not compare the Phase 1 Plan Amendments to an accurate baseline of existing
2 conditions, including, but not limited to, current flow requirements. (CEQA Guidelines, §15125.)

3 125.

4 The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the
Final SED fails to evaluate the significant or potentially significant impacts of the Phase 1 Plan
5 Amendments on water supply and improperly defers evaluation of impacts, including impacts
6 during dry and successive dry years, impacts resulting from later revisions to flow requirements,

7 and the reasonably foreseeable impacts of less water supply for other beneficial uses. (Cal. Code
8 Regs, tit. 23, § 3777(b)(2).) For example, the Final SED does not adequately consider the impacts
9 of carryover storage requirements, or adequately consider the impacts of the LSJR Flow Objectives
10 on water supply. The Final SED unjustifiably assumes that reductions in surface water supply will
11 be offset with groundwater pumping, and ignores impacts to areas south of the Delta resulting from
12 reduced supplies available for release programs, transfers, and exchanges, leaving the analysis in
13 the Final SED unsupported by substantial evidence in violation of CEQA.

14 -126. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the
15 Final SED does not sufficiently analyze cumulative impacts. (Cal. Code Regs, tit. 23, § 3777(b)(2);
•16 CEQA Guidelines, 15130, 15355.) For example, the Final SED fails to analyze the cumulative

17

18 impacts of the project related to groundwater resources, particularly in light of the requirements of

SGMA.

19 127. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the
20 Final SED does not describe or analyze potential mitigation measures to avoid or reduce any
21 significant or potentially significant impacts. (Cal. Code Regs, tit. 23, § 3777(b)(3).) Identification
22 of critical implementation components is deferred, and mitigationof impacts is illusory.
23 Furthermore, mitigation measures such as minimum reservoir carryover storage, reservoir refill
24 requirements, maximum groundwater pumping, and prioritization of municipal supply, among
25 others, were incorporated into the Final SED analysis without being identified and evaluated as
26 mitigation measures, leaving no grounds for comparison of Phase 1 Amendment impacts with and
27 without the measures in violation of CEQA. (See, e.g., Lotus v. Dept. of Transportation (2014) 223
28 Cal.App.4th 645.)

1776413.4 2010-089 34
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 34

128. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because the

2 Final SED does not describe or analyze reasonable alternatives to the Phase 1 Plan Amendments.
3 The Final SED does not consider a reasonable range of alternatives, including but not limited to the
4 "No Project" alternative, as CEQA requires. Instead, the Final SED takes an impermissibly narrow
5 view of its analysis focused on unimpaired flow. The focus on flow resulted in water quality

6 constituents (e.g., temperature and turbidity) and other non-flow stressors being ignored. The range
7 of alternatives considered in the Final SED is manifestly unreasonable and does not allow for
8 informed comparison. The State Water Board's findings reflect the Final SED's failure to evaluate

9 the impacts or effectiveness of the preferred alternative in relation to project objectives, or in relation
10 to other alternatives.

11 129. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because it
12 utilized only programmatio environmental review in the Final SED despite committing to project
13 activities, and having the information necessary to conduct project-level review. (CEQA Guidelines,
14 §§ 15126, 15152, 15165; see, e.g., Final SED Executive Summary, ES-3.) The Final SED states that
15 project-level review will occur in the future, however, use of a programmatic environmental
16 document cannot excuse the failure to sufficiently describe and analyze the project to a degree of

17 specificity consistent with the underlying action being approved. The lack of required elements or
18 sufficient information in the Final SED is not excused by the State Water Board's characterization

19 of the document as "programmatic." "Designating an EIR as a program EIR . .. does not by itself
20 decrease the level of analysis otherwise required in the EIR. All EIR's must cover the same general
21 content. The level of specificity of an EIR is determined by the nature of the project and the rule of
22 reason, rather than any semantic label accorded to the EIR." (Citizens for a Sustainable Treasure
23 Island v. City and County of San Francisco (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1036 [citations omitted].) The
24 generalized discussions and sweeping conclusions in the Final SED concerning the project's
25 environmental impacts, identification and effectiveness of mitigation measures, and range and

26 feasibility of alternatives are inadequate to comply with the informational requirements of CEQA,
27 even at a "program" level, let alone at a project level.

28 130. An analysis of the impacts of future actions should be undertaken when future actions

1776413.4 2010-089 35
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 35

are sufficiently well-defined so that it is feasible to evaluate the potential impacts. (Environmental
2 Protections Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry and Fire Protection (2008) 44

3 Cal.4th 502-04.) The Phase 1 Plan Amendments include many project-level commitments by the

4 State Water Board, including assignments of responsibility for achieving the Southern Delta Salinity
5 Objective in the program of implementation, without the corresponding environmental review. Any
6 activity proposed in the Phase 1 Plan Amendments may not be approved on the basis of the program-
7 level Final SED if its impacts were not evaluated in the Final SED. (See Sierra Club v County v of
8 San Diego (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1164-65.)

9 131. The State Water Board failed to proceed in a manner required by law because it
10 adopted findings, including a statement of overriding considerations, that are unsupported by
11 substantial evidence and lack the requisite balancing of economic, legal, social, technological or
-12 other benefits. (Cal. Code Regs, tit. 23, § 3777(d); CEQA Guidelines, §15093.)

13 -.-132. Ultimately, the Final SED fails to serve its fundamental purpose as an informational
14 document for the decision makers as well as the public because it offers no evaluation of how to get
15 the most good from use of the limited water available in light of -environmental and other
16 considerations.

17 133. The State Water Board's decision to approve the Final SED and adopt the Phase F
18 Plan Amendments constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of

19 the Public Resources Code, and sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Abuse of

20 discretion is established where, as here, the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law
21 and/or the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. The Court therefore
22 should issue a writ of mandate directing the State Water Board to set aside its adoption of the Phase

23 1 Plan Amendments and Final SED and enjoin the State Water Board from implementing them
24  unless and until the State Water Board complies with CEQA.

25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD
RESOLUTION NO. 2018-0059

ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN FOR THE
SAN FRANCISCO BAY/SACRAMENTO-SAN JOAQUIN DELTA ESTUARY AND FINAL
SUBSTITUTE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT

WHEREAS:

1. The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) and the nine regional
water quality control boards administer the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act (Wat. Code, § 13000 et seq.) (Porter-Cologne Act) to achieve an effective water quality control program for the state and are responsible for the regulation of activities and factors that may affect the quality of the waters of the state. (Wat. Code, §§ 13000, 13001.)

2. The State Water Board s authorized to adopt a water quality control plan in accordance
with the provisions of Water Code sections 13240 through 13244, insofar as they are applicable. (Wat. Code, § 13170.)

3. The State Water Board has undertaken a proceeding under its water quality authority to
amend the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Plan), adopted in 1978 and amended in 1991, 1995,
and in 2006. The Bay-Delta Plan establishes water quality objectives for the protection of beneficial uses in the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta) and a program of implementation to achieve the objectives. Diversions of water within and upstream of the Bay-Delta are a driver of water quality in the Bay-Delta.
As a result, much of the implementation for the Bay-Delta Plan relies upon the combined
water rights and water quality authorities of the State Water Board.

4 The 2006 Bay-Delta Plan identified emerging issues requiring additional action by the State Water Board, including San Joaquin River flows and Delta salinity. In the 2008 Strategic Workplan for Activities in the San Francisco Bay/ Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta Estuary, the State Water Board committed to undertake a review of the southern
Delta salinity and San Joaquin River flow objectives and their implementation. The State Water Board further reiterated its commitment in the 2009 Staff Report on the Periodic
Review of the San Francisco Bay/ Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary.
5. Native fish species that migrate through and inhabit the Delta have experienced dramatic population declines in recent years, bringing some species to the brink of extinction. Approximately 70,000 fall-run Chinook salmon adults returned to the
San Joaquin Basin in 1985. The number of returning adults dropped to approximately 40,000 in 2000 and dropped again to 8,000 returning adults in 2013. Returning fall-run adults were estimated to be approximately 10,000 in 2017. This is an 85 percent net loss in returning adult fall-run Chinook salmon from 1985 to 2017. While multiple factors are responsible for the decline, the magnitude of diversions out of the Sacramento, San Joaquin, and other rivers feeding into the Bay-Delta is a major factor in the ecosystem decline. The State Water Board has authority over both water quality and water diversion and use.

44

6. The State Water Board adopted the southern Delta salinity objectives for agriculture in the 1978 Delta Plan. The objectives are based on conditions, crops, and irrigation practices in the southern Delta at the time the objectives were adopted. Recent analysis of southern Delta water quality and crop salinity requirements shows that the existing salinity conditions in the southern Delta are suitable for all crops and that the existing
April through August salinity objective is lower than what is needed to reasonably protect agricultural beneficial uses.

7. The State Water Board commenced the process to amend the Bay-Delta Plan to reasonably protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses in the Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) and its three eastside salmon-bearing tributaries, the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, and agricultural beneficial uses in the southern Delta in 2009 as follows:

a On February 13, 2009, the State Water Board issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP) and of Scoping Meeting for Environmental Documentation for the Update and Implementation of the Bay Delta Plan: Southern Delta Salinity and San Joaquin River Flows. The public had an opportunity to submit written comments and to participate in the scoping meeting held on March 30, 2009. On April 1, 2011, the State Water Board issued a revised NOP and notice of additional scoping meeting, which
provided for a written comment period and a scoping meeting on June 6, a 2011. The
notice included potential draft language for the southern Delta salinity objectives,
San Joaquin River flow objectives, and the program of implementation.
b. On April 22, 2009, the State Water Board staff held a public staff workshop to receive information and conduct detailed discussions regarding potential amendments or revisions to the southern Delta salinity and San Joaquin River flow objectives included in the Bay-Delta Plan and their implementation. It held other workshops including two workshops to receive and respond to public comments on a draft study a report on the salt tolerance of crops in the southern Delta on August 13, 2009, and November 4, 2009, and a workshop on a draft technical report on the scientific basis for alternative San Joaquin River flow and southern Delta salinity objectives on January 6 and 7, 2011.

C. On December 31, 2012, the State Water Board released for public review and comment a draft substitute environmental document (2012 Draft SED) in support of proposed changes to the Bay-Delta Plan to adopt new and revised narrative and
numeric flow water quality objectives for the LSJR, including the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, a revised salinity water quality objective in the southern Delta, and a program of implementation to achieve the objectives (2012 Draft Amendments). On March 20 and 21, 2013, it held a public hearing on
the 2012 Draft SED and 2012 Draft Amendments. The deadline for written
comments was March 29, 2013, and the State Water Board received numerous
comments.

d. On September 15, 2016, the State Water Board recirculated for public review and comment a revised draft substitute environmental document (Recirculated SED) in
support of revisions to the 2012 Draft Amendments (2016 Draft Amendments). The
Recirculated SED and 2016 Draft Amendments made substantial changes to the 2012 Draft SED and 2012 Draft Amendments in consideration of the large number of public comments received concerning those drafts, in light of additional information,

2
45

including information learned from the recent drought, and in response to the in state's adoption in 2014 of a state policy for sustainable groundwater management (Wat. Code, § 113) and passage of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
(Wat. Code, §§ 10720 et seq.), which provide a roadmap and directive for
sustainable local groundwater management.

e. The State Water Board held a five-day public hearing, commencing in November 2016 and concluding in January 2017, on the Recirculated SED and 2016 Draft Amendments. State Water Board staff also held numerous workshops and outreach meetings. The State Water Board provided a six-month written
comment period that closed on March 17, 2017. The State Water Board received
thousands of comments.

f. On July 6, 2018, the State Water Board released the proposed final SED (Final .SED), which includes proposed final amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan (Plan
Amendments) and written responses to comments on the Recirculated SED and the
2016 Draft Amendments. It also provided notice of a public meeting to consider the
adoption of the proposed Plan Amendments and Final SED, and solicited comments
on the changes to the regulatory language in the proposed Plan Amendments. The Final SED, including the Plan Amendments, includes modifications that clarify, amplify, or refine information, primarily in response to comments. These modifications do not result in new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of effects disclosed in the Recirculated SED.

g. At a public meeting on August 21-22, 2018, the State Water Board heard oral comments and considered the adoption of the proposed Plan Amendments and Final SED. The State Water Board continued final action to December 12, 2018. Change
Sheets 1 to were released to the public on August 20, 2018, and October 25, 2018, and include modifications to the Plan Amendments and the SED. Neither those
changes nor the changes made by the State Water Board to this Resolution at the
December 12, 2018, meeting result in new significant environmental effects or a
substantial increase in the severity of effects disclosed in the Final SED.

8. The Plan Amendments' new and revised flow water quality objectives for the LSJR and a revised southern Delta salinity water quality objective are based on sound scientific
rationale and contain sufficient parameters to protect fish and wildlife and agricultural beneficial uses.

9. Pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 57004, the scientific basis of the Plan
Amendments underwent external scientific peer review through an interagency agreement with the University of California. Peer review was solicited on August 12, 2011, and completed on November 21, 2011.

10. In establishing and revising the flow water quality objectives for the LSJR and the salinity water quality objective for the southern Delta, the State Water Board has duly considered the factors set forth in Water Code section 13241. These factors include:
(1) past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water; (2) environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under consideration, including the quality of
water available thereto; (3) water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors that affect water quality in the area;

3
46

(4) economic considerations; (5) the need for developing housing within the region; and (6) the need to develop and use recycled water. The information supporting the State Water Board's consideration of these factors is in the Final SED, including the comments and responses to comments contained therein.
11. The Plan Amendments include a program of implementation for achieving the LSJR flow water quality objectives and the salinity water quality objective for the southern Delta in
accordance with Water Code section 13242. To help ensure transparency and
accountability in evaluating compliance with the water quality objectives, to inform ongoing implementation, and to foster and accommodate the development of scientific
information, the Plan Amendments require monitoring and reporting on annual and
longer-term bases.

12. The water quality control planning program is a regulatory program that has been
certified by the State's Secretary for Resources as exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) to prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) or negative declaration. (Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, § 15251, subd. (g); Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 23, § 3775.) The Final SED is in lieu of an EIR and has been completed in compliance with the requirements applicable to the State Water Board's certified exempt regulatory programs. The State Water Board has evaluated the potential environmental effects of reasonably
foreseeable methods of compliance with the Plan Amendments in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21159 and California Code of Regulations, title 14,
section 15187.

•13. The Final SED comprises Volumes I to III (which includes responses to comments), as amended by change sheets; Comment Summary and Responses released in August 2018 to respond to comments solicited on July 6, 2018, on the changes to the language in the proposed Plan Amendments; Comment Responses released in October 2018 to respond to oral comments at the August 21-22, 2018, public meeting; and this resolution and its attachments, as amended by Change Sheet 1. (Cal. Code
Regs., tit. § 23, § 3779.5, subd. (b).) The Final SED includes sufficient environmental and
technical analysis to satisfy the requirements of CEQA and other applicable laws.

14. In accordance with California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 3779.5, subdivision (c), and California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15091, subdivision (a), Attachment 1 sets forth the CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Prepared for Amendments to the Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary and is incorporated herein. It includes findings for each significant environmental effect that may occur from implementation of the Plan-Amendments and describes measures to reduce significant effects. The State Water Board recognizes that despite mitigation measures described in the Final SED and in Attachment 1, implementation of the Plan Amendments would have significant
and unavoidable effects on the environment. As explained in the statement of overriding considerations in Attachment 1, the specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits, including region-wide or statewide environmental benefits, of the Plan Amendments outweigh the unavoidable significant environmental effects of the Plan Amendments. Attachment 2 is the Mitigation and Monitoring Program that sets forth and ensures implementation of mitigation measures within the State Water Board's authority
and is incorporated herein.

4
47

15. It is the policy of the State of California that every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes. (Wat. Code, § 106.3 and § State Water Board Resolution No. 2016- 0010.) The State Water Board has considered this policy and the Plan Amendments include a statement that the State Water Board "will take actions as necessary to ensure
that the implementation of the flow objectives does not impact supplies of water for
minimum health and safety needs, particularly during drought periods." The State Water Board will continue to consider this policy through the technical and financial assistance programs it administers for at-risk communities, including disadvantaged communities
within the area covered by the Plan Amendments.
16. Adoption of the Plan Amendments is consistent with the state Antidegradation Policy (State Water Board Resolution No. 68-16) and the federal Antidegradation Policy (40 C.F.R. § 131.12).

17. The Bay-Delta Plan, as amended by the Plan Amendments, supplements the other water quality control plans that cover the Bay-Delta Estuary watershed. Together they include all necessary elements of water quality control plans in accordance with the
Porter-Cologne Act and federal requirements. The Bay-Delta Plan supersedes any regional water quality control plans for the same waters to the extent of any conflict. (Wat. Code, § 13170.)

18. The Bay-Delta Plan will be reviewed every three years in compliance with Water Code section 13240 and federal Clean Water Act section 303(c) (33 U.S.C. § 1313(c)).
19. The State Water Board has complied with all notice and hearing requirements and carefully considered all timely oral and written comments, responses to comments, the Final SED, and all of the evidence in the administrative record. The Final SED reflects
the independent judgment and analysis of the State Water Board.
20. The Plan Amendments will be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) and become effective upon OAL approval. The water quality standards, as defined under the federal Clean Water Act, in the plan also will be submitted to the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.). Other portions of the Bay-Delta Plan, such as the program of implementation, are to be submitted to U.S. EPA as part of the continuing planning process, but do not require approval.

21. The State Water Board is aware of ongoing negotiations between interested stakeholders and various other state agencies to achieve voluntary agreements to implement the Plan Amendments. In particular, robust voluntary agreements can help inform and expedite implementation of the LSJR flow objectives and provide durable
solutions in the Bay-Delta watershed while also providing reasonable protections for fish
and wildlife.

a. The State Water Board encourages stakeholders to continue to work together to
reach voluntary agreements that incorporate a mix of flow and non-flow measures that meet or exceed the new and revised water quality objectives and protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses, and to present those voluntary agreements to the State Water Board for its review as soon as feasible.

5
48

Lb. At the December 12, 2018 meeting, the California Department of Water Resources and California Department of Fish and Wildlife presented updated information on voluntary agreements and the contours of a potential Delta watershed-wide agreement. The Delta watershed-wide voluntary agreement is a discrete project encompassing a larger area than the LSJR flow objectives and
within the LSJR project area only includes the Tuolumne River. Additional work
is necessary to develop an enforceable agreement, join additional parties, analyze the agreement and how it interacts with the Bay-Delta Plan, and assess what, if any, changes may be necessary to the Bay-Delta Plan for the agreement to serve as an implementation mechanism to reasonably protect beneficial uses in the Tuolumne River and applicable portions of the Bay-Delta watershed, while providing a suitable regulatory backstop. Final incorporation of a voluntary agreement that requires changes to the Bay-Delta Plan, as contemplated by
Resolved TI 7 below would require additional public process, including
compliance with procedures under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and environmental review under CEQA.

C. Regardless of whether the current negotiations ultimately result in an agreement, the State Water Board will consider voluntary agreements as part of its proceedings to implement the Plan Amendments, consistent with its obligations under applicable law. In evaluating any proposal, the State Water Board will consider whether the agreement will help achieve the water quality objectives, help protect the beneficial use, and be enforceable through Board action.

d. If a voluntary agreement is reached after the adoption of the Plan Amendments,
the State Water Board will consider the voluntary agreement and determine
what, if any, actions are necessary to consider the agreement as a means of implementing the Bay-Delta Plan objectives, including a public process.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

1. The State Water Board hereby approves and adopts the Final SED. including the Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations (Attachment 1), and the Mitigation and Monitoring Program (Attachment 2) and the mitigation measures set forth therein.

2. The State Water Board hereby adopts the Plan Amendments, which are set forth in
Appendix K to the Final SED.

3. The State Water Board authorizes the Executive Director or designee to submit the Plan Amendments and the administrative record to OAL for review and approval.
4. The State Water Board authorizes the Executive Director or designee to make minor, non-substantive modifications to the language of the Plan Amendments or the
supporting documentation, if the State Water Board, State Water Board staff, or OAL determines that such changes are needed for clarity or consistency, and to inform the State Water Board of any such changes.

5. The State Water Board directs staff, upon approval by OAL, to file a Notice of Decision
with the Secretary for Natural Resources and transmit payment of the applicable fee as may be required to the Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to Fish and Game Code section 711.4.

6
49

6. The State Water Board directs the Executive Director or designee to submit the Plan Amendments to the U.S. EPA for approval in accordance with requirements of the federal Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.).
7. The State Water Board directs staff to provide appropriate technical and regulatory information to assist the California Natural Resources Agency in completing a Delta watershed-wide agreement, including potential flow and non-flow measures for the
Tuolumne River, and associated analyses no later than March 1, 2019. State Water Board staff shall incorporate the Delta watershed-wide agreement, including potential amendments to implement agreements related to the Tuolumne River, as an alternative for a future, comprehensive Bay-Delta Plan update that addresses the reasonable protection of beneficial uses across the Delta watershed, with the goal that comprehensive amendments to the Bay-Delta Plan across the Delta watershed may be presented to the State Water Board for consideration as early as possible after December 1, 2019.

8. The Plan Amendments adopted by this resolution are not self-implementing. Subsequent regulatory actions are required to implement the objectives and make them enforceable. The December 1, 2019 date of Resolved 1 7 provides a path for acceptance and approval of a voluntary agreement before regulatory actions to amend the water rights of water users on the Tuolumne River would occur and with sufficient time to complete any additional planning actions well in advance of the date that the LSJR flow objectives will be fully implemented.

Appendix K
Revised Water Quality Control Plan

This appendix shows the State Water Resources Control Board's (State Water Board's) revisions to
proposed changes to the December 13, 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (2006 Bay-Delta Plan). Proposed changes to the plan are shown in underline and strikeeut and revisions to the proposed changes are shown in double
underline and double strikeout. Some headings from the original 2006 Bay-Delta Plan were
originally styled using underlining, and such headings remain underlined in this version.
The 2006 Bay-Delta Plan designates beneficial uses of water within the Bay-Delta, water quality
objectives for the reasonable protection of those beneficial uses, and a program of implementation
for achieving the water quality objectives.
The San Joaquin River and South Delta Water Quality (SJR and SDWQ Bay-Delta plan amendments
would establish the following updates to the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan.
New flow objectives on the Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) and its three eastside tributaries for the protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses.
Revised water quality objectives for the protection of agricultural beneficial uses in the southern
Delta.

A program of implementation to achieve these objectives.
Monitoring and special studies necessary to fill information needs and determine the
effectiveness of, and compliance with, the new objectives.
The new LSJR flow objectives and revised southern Delta water quality (SDWQ) objective and
associated program of implementation would replace the existing San Joaquin River (SJR) flow and
southern Delta salinity objectives and associated program of implementation in the 2006 Bay-Delta
Plan. These objectives are analyzed in the recirculated substitute environmental document (SED) as
the LSJR and SDWQ alternatives.

The Bay-Delta plan is periodically amended. The most recent amendments of the Bay-Delta Plan
were completed in 2006. The 2006 amendments summarized issues requiring further development
in future updates but were not substantive changes. The most recent substantive changes to water
quality objectives, program of implementation, and monitoring and special studies in the Bay-Delta
Plan were completed in 1995.
The SJR and SDWQ Bay-Delta Plan amendments focus on specific sections of the Bay-Delta Plan; other parts of the plan are not affected. The majority of the Bay-Delta Plan was written and organized in 1995 and some non-regulatory text and information have yet to be updated. In a
separate process, the State Water Board is reviewing and considering updates to other elements of
the Bay-Delta Plan, including requirements for flows and cold water habitat in the Sacramento River,
its tributaries, and tributaries to the Delta (the Mokelumne, Cosumnes, and Calaveras Rivers); Delta
outflows; and water project operations in the interior Delta (State Water Board 2017a). Changes
that improve organization, update and streamline information, and provide a consistent format are
likely to occur in that process.

BAY-DELTA PLAN

Water Quality Control Plan for the
San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary

Chapter I. Introduction

A. Background

The San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta Estuary (Bay-Delta Estuary or Estuary) (Figure 1) is important to the natural environment and economy
of California. The watershed of the Bay-Delta Estuary provides drinking water to
two-thirds of the State's population and water for a multitude of other urban uses,
and it supplies some of the State's most productive agricultural areas, both inside and outside of the Estuary. The Bay-Delta Estuary itself is one of the largest ecosystems for fish and wildlife habitat and production in the United States.
Historical and current human activities (e.g., water development, land use, wastewater discharges, introduced species, and harvesting), exaeerbated amplified by variations in natural conditions, have degraded the beneficial uses of the Bay- Delta Estuary, as evidenced by the declines in populations of many biological resources of the Estuary. Most recently, populations of Delta smelt and other
pelagic organisms have exhibited significant declines, leading to investigations as to
the possible causes of the degradation of the health of the Delta.

The State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) has previously adopted water quality control plans and policies to protect the-water quality and te control the water resources that affect the beneficial uses of the Bay-Delta Estuary. These plans and policies were adopted consistent with section 13000 et seq. of the
California Water Code and pursuant to the authority contained in section 13170.
This Water Quality Control Plan covers the Bay-Delta Estuary and tributary
watersheds (Bay-Delta Plan or Plan). This-plan supersedes-the Water Quality Control-Plan-for the San-Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin-Delta Estuary adepted in May 1995 (1995-Bay-Delta-Plan-er 1995 Plan) as well as the-preceding plans-that the 1995 Plan superseded.-The State Water Board periodically will review this Plan pursuant to Water Code section 13240 to ensure that it provides reasonable protection for the designated beneficial uses.1 The State Water Board's measures to implement this Plan will consist of the regulation of existing water
rights, regulatory measures to protect water quality, and recommendations to other entities. Current and previous versions of the Bay-Delta Plan2 and supporting
documents are available at:

1 The federal Clean Water Act, at section 303 (c), also requires a review of federal "standards," as defined in the Act, contained in state water quality control plans. (33 U.S.C. 1313 (c).) The review under section 13240 ordinarily is combined with a review of any federal standards in a state water quality control plan. 2 References herein to the 1995 Plan refer to the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan. References to the 2006 update refer to the update of the 2006 Bay-Delta Plan.

A summary description of the most recent updates to the Plan and issues of concern
are provided in Section D: Key Issues and Plan Updates.

Appendix 1 of this-plan, titled "Plan Amendment Repert," explains the State Water Board's considerations-in-developing-this Water Quality Control Plan. Appendix 1 provides the reasoning for any changes to the 1995-Plan, as well the environmental

analysis for those changes. Documents used-to develop this amendment of the
1995 Plan are listed in-Appendix 2, titled "Referenced Decuments". Appendix-3, titled "Respenses-te Comments," contains the State Water Beard's responses-te
comments received in-conjunetion with the publie-hearing held to solieit-feedback-on
this-plan.

B. Purpose and Applicability Application of the Water Quality Control Plan
This-plan-establishee-water quality ebjeetives-for-which implementation-can-be-fully aeeemplished enly if the State Water Beard assigns some-measure-of respensibility to water right holders and-water users te-mitigate-fer the-effeets-on the designated benefieial uses ef their diversiens and tse-of water. Like all-A water quality control plans, this plan consists of: (1) beneficial uses to be protected; (2) water quality objectives for the reasonable protection of beneficial uses; and (3) a program of
implementation for achieving the water quality objectives. This plan establishes
water quality objectives for which implementation can be fully accomplished only if
the State Water Board assigns some measure of responsibility to water rights
holders and water users to mitigate for the effects on the designated beneficial uses
of their diversions and use of water. Together, the beneficial uses and the water
quality objectives established to reasonably protect the beneficial uses are called water quality standards under the terminology of the federal Clean Water Act.
For-the-geographic-area-of the-Bay-Dolta-Estuary. (This plan is complementary to the other water quality control plans adopted by the State and Regional Water Quality Control Boards (Regional Water Boards) and State policies for water quality control adopted by the State Water Board. This plan provides reasonable protection for the Estuary's beneficial uses that require control of salinity (caused by saltwater intrusion, municipal discharges, and agricultural drainage) and water project
operations (flows and diversions). This plan protects the beneficial uses of the Bay- Delta Estuary and tributary watersheds. This plan supersedes the regional water quality control plans to the extent of any conflict between this plan and the regional water quality control plans. The other plans and policies establish water quality objectives and requirements for parameters such as toxic chemicals, bacterial contamination, and other parameters which have the potential to impair beneficial
uses or cause nuisance.

Most of the objectives in this ongoing plan are being, and will continue to be, implemented by assigning responsibilities to water right holders because the parameters to be controlled are primarily impacted by flows and diversions. This plan, however, is not to be construed as establishing the responsibilities of water. right holders. Nor is this plan to be construed as establishing the quantities of water that any particular water right holder or group of water right holders may be required to release or forego to meet the objectives in this plan. The State Water Board will consider, in a future water rights proceeding or proceedings, the nature and extent of water right holders' responsibilities to meet these objectives. If necessary after a

4
63

water rights proceeding, this plan will be amended to reflect any changes that may be needed to ensure consistency between the plan and the water right decision.

C. Legal Authority

The State Water Board has prepared this Water Quality Control Plan under the
Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act. The Regional Water Boards have
primary responsibility for formulating and adopting water quality control plans for their respective regions (Wat. Code § 13240), but the State Water Board also is authorized, under Water Code section 13170, to adopt water quality control plans in accordance with the provisions of section 13240 et seq3. When the State Water
Board adopts a water quality control plan, it supersedes regional water quality control plans for the same waters to the extent of any conflict. (Wat. Code § 13170.)
This plan ineludes an-was informed by an environmental report prepared in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21080.5. The Secretary for Resources has certified the State Water Board's basin planning program as meeting the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21080.5. (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15251(g).) Section 21080.5 authorizes state agencies acting under a certified program to assess the environmental effects of their actions within the decision- making document instead of in a separate environmental impact report or negative
declaration.

a. Program of Implementation. A program of implementation for achieving water quality objectives shall include, but not be limited to: (1) a description of the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the objectives, including recommendations
for appropriate action by any entity, public or private; (2) a time schedule for the actions to be taken; and (3) a description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.)

b. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Approval of This Plan. After adopting this Water Quality Control Plan, the State Water Board will submit this plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for approval under the federal Clean Water Act. (33 U.S.C. section 1251 et seq.) To the extent that this plan addresses matters outside the scope of the Clean Water Act, this plan will be provided to the USEPA for its consideration as a matter of State/federal comity. The State Water Board does not concede that it is required under the Clean Water Act to submit all parts of this plan to the USEPA. Assuming the USEPA has authority under the Clean Water Act to approve the objectives for flow and operations, the State Water Board believes that the USEPA could not adopt standards for these
parameters under the Clean Water Act.4 If the USEPA attempted to adopt such

.The State Water Board also has authority to adopt State policy for water quality control under Water Code section 13140. The State Water Board reserves its arguments regarding the USEPA's authority to adopt standards for flow and operations, including standards for salinity intrusion. The State Water Board's legal comments regarding the USEPA's authority are set
forth the State Water Board's comments on the USEPA's January 6, 1994 draft standards, which were provided to the USEPA on March 11, 1994.

standards, it could fundamentally interfere with the State's water allocation authority
under section 101(g) of the Clean Water Act.5

D. Emerging Key Issues and Plan Updates

This Water Quality Gontrol-Plan is periodically updated. The most recent update of the Plan was completed in-29162018, at which time the following elements were
updated:

San Joaquin River flow objectives to protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses
and southern Delta salinity objective to protect agricultural beneficial uses;
Programs of implementation to achieve and determine compliance with the
above objectives; and
Monitoring and special studies to fill information needs and inform future
updates to the obiectives.

This 2016-2018 update of the San Joaquin River flow objectives implements the
Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan recommendation for the State Water Board
to adopt, and as soon as reasonably possible, implement flow objectives for high-
priority tributaries in the Delta watershed that are necessary to achieve the coequal
goals.°

The 2016-2018 amendments to this Plan primarily address portions of the Plan
concerning the San Joaguin River flow objectives and southern Delta salinity
objectives. In addition, updates without regulatory effect were made to descriptions
of non-State Water Board programs related to salinity, key Bay-Delta issues and the
State Water Board's planning efforts. Not all elements of the Bay-Delta Plan were
updated in 20186. Some of the information in the Plan may therefore be out of date.
This information will be updated as part of the State Water Board's process of
reviewing and updating other elements of the Plan, including water quality objectives
and programs of implementation for:

Delta outflows
Sacramento and other tributary inflows other than San Joaquin River
Interior Delta flows
Suisun Marsh and Suisun Bay salinity

5 The Supreme Court, in PUD No. 1 of Jefferson County v. Washington Dep't of Ecology (1994) 114 S.Ct. 1900, upheld : state's ability to impose an instream flow requirement under Clean Water Act section 401 to protect fish habitat which had been designated as a beneficial use in a water quality standard under Clean Water Act section 303. In reaching this result, the Supreme Court rejected arguments based on Clean Water Act section 101(g) that water quantities could not be regulated under the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court pointed out that insufficient flows can cause water quality violations, and that reduced habitat caused by low flows may constitute pollution. The Court's narrow interpretation of section 101(g) allows - regulation of water users by a state to prevent their having an adverse effect on water quality, but does not go so far as to allow a fundamental interference by the USEPA with a state's water allocation authority.
6 The 2009 Delta Reform Act declared that State policy for the Delta must serve two "coequal goals": providing a more reliable
water supply for California, and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem; and to do so in a manner that protects and enhances the unique cultural, recreational, natural resource, and agricultural values of the Delta as an evolving
place.

This subsequent-review will alse-continue to address two key issues identified in the
2006 update of the Plan: ecosystem regime shift and climate change,

primarily a-planning decument-that serves to identify the water quality objeetives and the beneficial uses-to-be protected. At-the time of this 2006-update-te the Plan there are-a-number-of emerging-issues-that this Plan either-dees-not currently-regulate-or may net-fully regulate-because eirsumstances and seientific-knewledge are changing. Those emerging issues are identified here. Inaddition-to the activities deseribed- in the Program of Implementation Chapter, the State Water Board will immediately-begin a process-to-evaluate and prieritize-water-quality contrel-planning activities to address the following emerging-issues:
1. Ecosystem Regime Shif|Pelagie-Organism-Deeline (POD)
2. Climate Change 3. Delta and Gentral Valley Salinity
4. San Joaquin River Flows

The State Water Board-will conduet these-planning activities in conjunetion-with the
Delta-Vision Process to-develop a sustainable use and protection plan-for the Delta,
Suisun Bay, and Suisun Marsh. The Delta Visien Prosess, an interagency effert-and outgrewth of the Little Hoover Gommission's review of CALFED, was just
commeneing-at the-time-of this Bay-Delta Plan update. Consistent with this process,
The State Water Board will conduct these planning activities with the support of the
Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Science Program and the Independent Science
Board to assure that Plan updates are based on the best available science. tThe
State Water Board recognizes that planning for and management of the Delta's
multiple uses, resources, and ecosystem should occur in cooperation with elected officials, government agencies, stakeholders, academia, and affected Delta and
California communities.

4. Ecosystem Regime Shift Pelagie-Organism-Decline There was a rapid decline in the populations of numerous pelagic fishes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary and Suisun Bay starting in 2002. This
decline became known as the Pelagic Organism Decline (POD), and was studied
intensely by the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) POD work team and
numerous other researchers. The POD studies largely concluded that the decline
resulted from multiple adverse conditions, with no single explanatory factor.
Ongoing research is largely focused on the working hypothesis that the Bay-Delta
has undergone an ecosystem regime shift from highly variable environmental
conditions that favored native and other estuarine-dependent species to less
variable conditions that favor invasive species. Work to better understand the
influence that these and other factors have in relation to POD is ongoing. There is a marked deeline-in -numerous pelagie-fishes -in the Saeramente San Jeaquin Delfa Estuary and Suisun Bay. Gurrently, the -Interageney Ecological Program (IEP), through its POD werk-team, is conducting studies-toevaluate the potential causes-of these-declines. Some-of the pessible causes that are being considered include

7
66

invasive species, water project operations, and texins. The results of the-POD
studies-will be available in 2007. At that time, the State Water-Board will review the study-results-and-may amend portions-of this Plan to-improve habitat conditions in the Estuary.

2. Climate Change
A growing body of information suggests that climate change could result in: (1) sea level rise that would adversely impact levees, water quality, and conveyance of water supplies through the Delta; (2) decreased snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada that would reduce effectiveness of existing water storage facilities; (3) increased rainfall that could exacerbate flooding; and (4) adverse biological effects from changes in flow and water quality. Water quality control planning must begin to address these possible effects. Future State Water Board activities therefore should be responsive to the impacts of climate change and provide timely response and guidance to water resources agencies, consistent with the Water Quality Control Plan, as they submit plans and requests to process applications for water conveyance facilities and flow control structures. such as the current-South Delta Improvements Preject or
potential future conveyanse-structures such as a Delta-peripheral canal.
3. Delta-and Contral-Valley Salinity
A jeint State and-Regional Board Workshop-on-Central Valley salinity issues-held in January 2006-resulted in-bread stakeholder-suppert for development of a Salinity Management Plan-for the Gentral Valley and Delta (Salinity Management-Plan) te
preteet-benefieial uses-of beth surface waters and-ground waters. Develepment and full-implementation-of the Salinity Management Plan is-expeeted-to take 40 te-50 years and-to reduce economie-hardship related to managing-salinity. The-State Water Board will develop regulations and provide regulatory encouragement te ensure-that infrastrueture is develeped that-impreves and maintains Gentral Valley and Delta salinity while providing certaintyto-loeal and-regional-planners, municipalities, agrioulture, water suppliers, foed prosessers, and ethers.

The State Water Beard will continue to coordinate updates-of the Bay-Delta Plan
with-on-geing develepment-of this comprehensive Salinity Management Plan. As part-of this-larger planning effert, the State Water Beard-has issued a-public-netice-of a-workshep to be held-in January 2007 te review. (1) the salinity requirements of the benefieial uses of water in the seuthern Delta; (2) the sauses of salt leading in the southern Delta; (3) praetices that-ei uld reduce salt leading from-Delta sources; (4 flow and salt lead reduction measures-to-implement the salinity objectives; and (5) the -timeline for implementatien-of these-measures. The State Water Beard-intends
to develop and manage-a study of salinity in-the-southern Delta as-part of this effort. This-precess-could result in amendments-to-the Bay-Delta Plan, further changes in water rights, or changes-in-beth the Bay-Delta-Plan-and water rights.
4. San Jeaquin-River-Flows
Data submitted by fisheries agencies suggest that-varieus fish species within the
Delta and San Joaquin River basin have not shown significant signs ef recevery

8
67

since adoption of the San Joaquin-River Spring Flow and Pulse Flow oebjectives-in the 1995 Plan and the implementation of the Spring Flow ebjectives in D 1644.
Some species have shown significant declines. The San Jeaquin River flow
ebjectives-are not changed in-the 2006 Plan due to a lack-of seientific information-on which te base any changes.7 While the Department of Fish-and Game-(DFG) recommended changes to the-ebjeetives, these recommendations were based-on
modeling that-had-net-yet been-completed. In addition, other-parties alse recommended changes-to the-ebjectives that were-net-substantiated by sufficient seientifie-information. In recegnitien-ef-the species-recevery-concerns-within the San Jeaquin-River basin and the Delta, the State Water Board will schedule a werkshep after revisiens are completed-to DFG's San Joaquin River salmon escapement medel in-respense te-peer review (anticipated for summer-of 2007) to-receive additional infermatien-concerning the model and its findings and ether seientifie information-concerning the San Joaquin River flow ebjectives. The State Water
Board may receive additional information-concerning-implementation-of the
ebjeetives in-response to-coneerns raised by the Department-of Interior (DOI), and ethers. Based on information received during the workshop, the State Water Board may amend-the Bay-Delta -Plan-ebjeetives, the-Program of Implementation-for these ebjeetives, and/or-make changes in water rights. If adequate information is-net
available to suppert changes-to the objeetives, the State Water Board may direet the cempletion of additional studies and analyses.

tn-response-te-concerns raised-by DFG and others-concerning the interim San
Joaquin River Pulse-Flow objeetives being implemented as part of the Vernalis Adaptive-Management Plan (VAMP) experiments, prior-to the-workshop, the State Water-Beard recommends that parties te the San Joaquin River Agreement (SJRA)
conduet-a-peer review-of the VAMP study design. The State Water-Board requests
that the-peer review analyze whether the experimental flows are providing adequate protection-for San Jeaquin River and Delta species and whether changes should be made to the experimental design-to ensure-that adequate infermation is-ebtained frem the-experiment-en which to base long-term ebjeetives. The State Water Board requests that the parties-to-the SJRA-present the-findings of the-peer review to-the State Water Board during its workshop.

* The Program-of Implementation-for the-Pulse-Flow Objectives is-amended in the 2006 Plan to allow for-staged implementation-of the ebjectives by conducting the Vernalis Adaptive Management Plan (VAMP) until- 2041.- These-changes are consistent-with-the current implementation-of the ebjectives since 2000-pursuant-te-D-1641.

Chapter II. Beneficial Uses
A water quality control plan must establish beneficial uses. (Wat. Code § 13050(j).) Beneficial uses serve as a basis a for establishing water quality objectives. The beneficial uses to be protected were established in the 1978 Delta Plan and the 1991 Bay-Delta Plan. Sinee all ef the-beneficial uses exist and there were-ne
requests for changes-in-the-beneficial-uses, these These uses are carried over in
this plan from earlier plans, including the 1995 Plan. The fish and wildlife beneficial
uses designated in the "Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River Basin
and San Joaquin River Basin" for the Stanislaus River. Tuolumne River. Merced
River, and the San Joaquin River from the mouth of the Merced River to Vernalis
remain in effect and this plan includes measures to protect those uses. The
beneficial uses protected by this plan are presented below.

Municipal and Domestic Supply (MUN) - Uses of water for community, military, or
individual water supply systems including, but not limited to, drinking water supply.

Chapter III. Water Quality Objectives

A water quality control plan must contain such water quality objectives as are
needed to ensure the reasonable protection of beneficial uses and the prevention of
nuisance. (Wat. Code, § 13241.) The State Water Board must consider, in
establishing water quality objectives:
The past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water; The environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under consideration, including the quality of water available thereto;
The water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors that affect water quality in the area;
Economic considerations;
The need for developing housing within the region;
The need to develop and use recycled water. (Wat. Code, § 13241.)

Flow and water project operations are within the scope of objectives that can be
adopted in a water quality control plan under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

This chapter establishes water quality objectives which, in conjunction with the water quality objectives for the Bay-Delta Estuary watershed that are included in other State Water Board adopted water quality control plans and in water quality control plans for the Central Valley and San Francisco Bay Basins, when implemented, will: (1) provide for reasonable protection of municipal, industrial, and agricultural beneficial uses;
(2) provide reasonable protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses at a level which stabilizes or enhances the conditions of aquatic resources; and (3) prevent nuisance. These water quality objectives are established to attain the highest
quality of water that is reasonable, considering all the demands being made on
waters in the Estuary watershed.
The water quality objectives in this plan apply to waters of the San Francisco Bay system and the legal Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and tributary watersheds, as specified in the objectives. Unless otherwise indicated, water quality objectives cited for a general area, such as for the southern Delta, are applicable for all locations in
that general area and compliance locations will be used to determine compliance
with the cited objectives. Tables 1, 2, and 3 contain the water quality objectives for the protection of municipal and industrial, agricultural, and fish and wildlife beneficial uses, respectively.
A. Water Quality Objectives for Municipal and Industrial Beneficial Uses
The water quality objectives in Table 1 provide reasonable protection of the beneficial uses MUN, IND, and PRO, from the effects of salinity intrusion. These
municipal and industrial objectives also provide protection for the beneficial uses of

12
71

REC-1, REC-2, and GWR. These ebjeetives are unchanged from the 1995 Bay-
Delta Plan.

B. Water Quality Objectives for Agricultural Beneficial Uses
The water quality objectives in 2 Table 2 provide reasonable protection of the beneficial use AGR, from the effects of salinity intrusion and agricultural drainage in
the western, interior, and southern Delta. These ebjeetives are unchanged from the
1991 Bay-Delta-Plan.

C. Water Quality Objectives for Fish and Wildlife Beneficial Uses
The water quality objectives in Table 3 provide reasonable protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses in the Bay-Delta Estuary including EST, COLD, WARM,
MIGR, SPWN, WILD, and RARE. They also provide reasonable protection of fish
and wildlife beneficial uses designated in the "Water Quality Control Plan for the
Sacramento River Basin and San Joaquin River Basin" for the Stanislaus River,
Tuolumne River, Merced River, and the San Joaquin River from the mouth of the
Merced River to Vernalis, as well as those presumed to exist under the Clean Water
Act.8 Protection of these fish and wildlife beneficial uses also provides protection for
the beneficial uses of SHELL, COMM, and NAV. The parameters to be regulated under Table 3 are dissolved oxygen, salinity (expressed as electrical conductivity), Delta outflow, river flows, export limits, and Delta Cross Channel gate operation. Information available in 1995 indicated that, unlike water quality objectives for parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature, and toxic chemicals, which have threshold levels beyond which adverse impacts to the beneficial uses occur,
there were no defined threshold conditions that could be used to set objectives for flows and project operations. Instead, available information indicated that a continuum of protection exists. Based on that information, higher flows and lower exports provided greater protection for the bulk of estuarine resources up to the limit of unimpaired conditions. Therefore, these objectives were set based on a subjective determination of the reasonable needs of all the consumptive and nonconsumptive demands on the waters of the Estuary. After-completion-of the POD studies, the State Beard will-review the-study results and may censider amending this Plan-to-impreve water quality preteetiens fer fish and-wildlife in-the
Estuary,

[2] Determination of compliance with an objective expressed as a running average begins on the last day of the averaging period. The averaging period commences with the first day of the time period of the applicable objective. If the objective
is not met on the last day of the averaging period, all days in the averaging period are considered out of compliance.

[3] The Sacramento Valley 40-30-30 Water Year Hydrologic Classification Index (see Figure 2) applies unless otherwise specified.

[4] Compliance will be determined at Jersey Point (station D15) and Prisoners Point (station D29).
[5] This standard does not apply in May when the best available May estimate of the Sacramento River Index for the water year is less than 8.1 MAF at the 90% exceedance level. [Note: The Sacramento River Index refers to the sum of the unimpaired runoff in the water year as published in the California Department of Water Resources' (DWR) Bulletin 120 for
the following locations: Sacramento River above Bend Bridge, near Red Bluff; Feather River, total unimpaired inflow to
Oroville Reservoir; Yuba River at Smartville; and American River, total unimpaired inflow to Folsom Reservoir.]
[6]. An exceedance of any of these objectives at a time when it is established through certification by the entity operating the Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gates that the Gates are being operated to the maximum extent shall not be considered : violation of the objective.
[7] A deficiency period is: (1) the second consecutive dry water year following a critical year; (2) a dry water year following a year in which the Sacramento River Index (described in footnote was less than 11.35; or (3) a critical water year following a dry or critical water year. The determination of a deficiency period is made using the prior year's final Water Year Type determination and a forecast of the current year's Water Year Type; and remains in effect until a subsequent water year is other than a Dry or Critical water year as announced on May 31 by DWR and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) as the final water year determination.

[8] Net Delta Outflow Index (NDOI) is defined in Figure 4.
[9] For the May-January objectives, if the value is less than or equal to 5,000 cfs, the 7-day running average shall not be less than 1,000 cfs below the value; if the value is greater than 5,000 cfs, the 7-day running average shall not be less than
80% of the value.

[10] The objective is increased to 6,000 cfs if the best available estimate of the Eight River Index for December is greater than 800 TAF. [Note: The Eight River Index refers to the sum of the unimpaired runoff as published in the DWR Bulletin 120
for the following locations: Sacramento River flow at Bend Bridge, near Red Bluff; Feather River, total inflow to Oroville
Reservoir; Yuba River flow at Smartville; American River, total inflow to Folsom Reservoir; Stanislaus River, total inflow to
New Melones Reservoir; Tuolumne River, total inflow to Don Pedro Reservoir; Merced River, total inflow to Exchequer
Reservoir; and San Joaquin River, total inflow to Millerton Lake.]
[11] The minimum daily Delta outflow shall be 7,100 cfs for this period, calculated as a 3-day running average. This requirement is also met if either the daily average or 14-day running average EC at the confluence of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin rivers is less than or equal to 2.64 mmhos/cm (Collinsville station C2). If the best available estimate of
the Eight River Index (described in footnote 10) for January is more than 900 TAF, the daily average or 14-day running
average EC at station C2 shall be less than or equal to 2.64 mmhos/cm for at least one day between February and February 14; however, if the best available estimate of the Eight River Index for January is between 650 TAF and 900 TAF, the Executive Director of the State Water Board shall decide whether this requirement applies. If the best available
estimate of the Eight River Index for February is less than 500 TAF the standard may be further relaxed in March upon the request of the DWR and the USBR, subject to the to approval of the Executive Director of the State Water Board. The standard does not apply in May and June if the best available May estimate of the Sacramento River Index (described in footnote 5) for the 5) water year is less than 8.1 MAF at the 90% exceedance level. Under this circumstance, a minimum

14-day running average flow of 4,000 cfs is required in May and June. Additional Delta outflow objectives are contained
in Table 4.

[163]Plus up to an additional 28 TAF pulse/attraction flow during all water year types. The amount of additional water will be limited to that amount necessary to provide achieve a monthly average flow of 2,000 cfs. The additional 28 TAF pulse flow is not required in a critical year following a critical year. The pulse flow will be scheduled by the DWR and the USBR in consultation with the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the DFGW. Consultation-with the GALFED Operations-Group established-under the-Framework-Agreement will satisfy the-consultation requirement.

-** [141 Unimpaired flow represents the natural water production of a river basin, unaltered by upstream diversions, storage, or by
export or import of water to or from other watersheds. Compliance with the percent of unimpaired flow from February through June in each river is determined by dividing the 7-day average observed flow at the compliance stations by the 7-
day average calculated Full-Natural-Flow (ENE) at the FNF stations. Refinements to methods and measurements used to estimate FNF can be used for compliance if refinements improve accuracy and precision of FNE estimates. The total volume of water established by the percent of unimpaired flow requirement may be managed using an averaging period consistent with approved adaptive methods outlined in the program of implementatio
[175]Combined export rate for this objective is defined as the Clifton Court Forebay inflow rate (minus actual Byron-Bethany Irrigation District diversions from Clifton Court Forebay) and the export rate of the Tracy pumping plant.
[186]This time period may be varied based on real-time monitoring,_and will coincide with the San Joaquin River pulse flow described in feotnete 15.- The DWR and the USBR, in consultation with the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the DFGW,
will determine the time period for this 31-day export limit. Consultation with the CALFED Operations Group established
under the Framework Agreement will satisfy the consultation requirement.
[197]Maximum export rate is 1,500 cfs or 100% of the 3-day running average of San Joaquin River flow at Vernalis, whichever is greater. Variations to this maximum export rate may be authorized if agreed to by the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the DFGW. This flexibility is intended to result in no net water supply cost annually within the limits of the water quality and operational requirements of this plan. Variations may result from recommendations of agencies for protection of fish resources, including actions taken pursuant to the State and federal Endangered Species Act. Any variations will be effective immediately upon notice to the Executive Director of the State Water Board. If the Executive Director does not object to the variations within 10 days, the variations will remain in effect. The Executive Director of the State Water Board is also authorized to grant short-term exemptions to export limits for the purpose of facilitating a study of the -feasibility of recirculating export water into the San Joaquin River to meet flow objectives.
[2018]Percent of Delta inflow diverted is defined in Figure 4. For the calculation of maximum percent Delta inflow diverted, the export rate is a 3-day running average and the Delta inflow is a 14-day running average, except when the Central Valley Project or the State Water Project (SWP) is making storage withdrawals for export, in which case both the export rate and the Delta inflow are 3-day running averages.
[2419]The percent Delta inflow diverted values can be varied either up or down. - Variations are authorized subject to the process described in footnote 19Z.
[220]If the best available estimate of the Eight River Index (described in footnote 10) for January is less than or equal to 1.0 MAF, the export limit for February is 45% of Delta inflow. If the best available estimate of the Eight River Index for January is greater than 1.5 MAF, the February export limit is 35% of Delta inflow. If the best available estimate of the Eight River Index for January is between 1.0 MAF and 1.5 MAF, the DWR and the USBR will set the export limit for February within the range of 35% to 45%, after consultation with the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the DFGW. • Consultation with the CALFED Operations Group established under the Framework Agreement will satisfy the
consultation requirement.
[231]For the November-January period, close Delta Cross Channel gates for a total of up to 45 days. The to USBR will determine the timing and duration of the gate closure after consultation with the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the

DFGW." Consultation with the CALFED Operations Group established under the Framework Agreement will satisfy the consultation requirement.

[242]For the May 21-June 15 period, close the Delta Cross Channel gates for a total of 14 days. The USBR will determine the timing and duration of the gate closure after consultation with the USFWS, the NOAA Fisheries and the DFGW. Consultation with the CALFED Operations Group established under the Framework Agreement will satisfy the consultation requirement. Gate closures shall be based on the need for the protection of fish. The process for approval of variations shall be similar to that described in footnote 197.

NDOI and PERCENT INFLOW DIVERTED 1

The NDOI and the percent inflow diverted, as described in this figure, shall be computed daily by the DWR and the USBR using the following formulas (all flows are in cfs):
NDOI = DELTA INFLOW - NET DELTA CONSUMPTIVE USE - DELTA EXPORTS

PERCENT INFLOW DIVERTED = (CCF + TPP) + DELTA INFLOW

+ where DELTA INFLOW = SAC + SRTP + YOLO + EAST + MISC + SJR

SAC - Sacramento River at Freeport mean daily flow for the previous day; the 25-hour
tidal cycle measurements from 12:00 midnight to 1:00 a.m. may be used
instead.
SRTP = Sacramento Regional Treatment Plant average daily discharge for the previous week.
YOLO = Yolo Bypass mean daily flow for the previous day, which is equal to the flows from the Sacramento Weir, Fremont Weir, Cache Creek at Rumsey, and the South Fork of Putah Creek.
EAST = Eastside Streams mean daily flow for the previous day from the Mokelumne
River at Woodbridge, Cosumnes River at Michigan Bar, and Calaveras River at
Bellota.
MISC = Combined mean daily flow for the previous day of Bear Creek, Dry Creek, Stockton Diverting Canal, French Camp Slough, Marsh Creek, and Morrison Creek.
SJR = San Joaquin River flow at Vernalis, mean daily flow for the previous day.
where NET DELTA CONSUMPTIVE USE = GDEPL - PREC

GDEPL= Delta gross channel depletion for the previous day based on water year type

Chapter IV. Program of Implementation
The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act states that a water quality control plan consists of a designation or establishment of beneficial uses to be protected, water quality objectives, and program of implementation needed for achieving water
quality objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13050(j).) The implementation program shall include, but not be limited to:
1 . A description of the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the objectives, including recommendations for appropriate action by any entity,
public or private; 2. A time schedule for the actions to be taken; and 3. A description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with the objectives. (Wat. Code, § 13242.)

This program of implementation for the Water Quality Control Plan for the Bay Delta Estuary consists of five general components: (1) implementation measures within State Water Board authority; (2) measures requiring a combination of State Water
Board authorities and actions by other agencies; (3) recommendations to other
agencies; (4) a monitoring and special studies program; and (5) other studies that are being conducted by other entities but may provide information relevant to future proceedings. The specific actions identified within these components include time schedules for implementation, if appropriate. No time schedule is included for actions that have already been implemented.

The State Water Board will exercise its quasi-legislative or adjudicative powers
involving water rights and water quality to require implementation of the water guality
objectives. Water quality actions include water quality certifications, regulations,
waste discharge requirements, and water quality permitting._Currently, the water right permits of the DWR and USBR-inelude terms and conditions that define their
responsibilities-to implement the municipal and industrial, agricultural, and fish and
wildlife-ebjeetives.-In the future, the State Water Board may amend this program of implementation, take action in a water right proceeding or proceedings to change
the water right responsibilities of the DWR, the USBR, and other water right holders
to implement these objectives, or take other actions that implement the objectives.

A. Implementation Measures within State Water Board Authority

Under its water rights and water quality authority, the State Water Board will take
actions to require implementation of centinue, as necessary and appropriate, te determine the contributiens from water-right permit and lisense helders needed-te
implement the objectives in this Plan. The State Water Board may implement the objectives by conducting water right proceedings, which may include adopting
regulations, conducting adjudicative proceedings, or both, that Water right respensibilities may be assigned by eendueting a-water right-preceeding at which the Beard will-take into consideration the requirements of the Public Trust Doctrine

26
85

and the California Constitution, article X, section 2. The State Water Board will also continue, as necessary and appropriate, to use its Clean Water Act section 401 :
water quality certification authority to implement objectives in this Plan, and may
take other actions under its water quality authority to implement objectives in this
Plan. The following water quality objectives are currently, or may in the future be, primarily implemented in-whele-or in part-using water rights authority, but may also be implemented through water quality actions:

1. Delta Outflow
2. River Flows: Sacramento River at Rio Vista
3. River Flows: Lower San Joaquin River-at Airpert Way Bridge, Vernalis
4. Export Limits
5. Delta Cross Channel Gates Operation
6. Salinity

The first five are-flow-based ebjectives that rely upon water rights autherities-te implement. Salinity, though a-water quality objective, is still implemented, in part, threugh the State-Water Beard's water rights autherity.
The State Water Board may require compliance with these objectives in stages or may shift responsibility for meeting an objective among water right holders and other
entities based on evidence it receives in a water right proceeding or in a water
quality proceeding.

1. Delta Outflow Objective
The Delta Outflow Objective is to be implemented through water right actions. It requires a minimum amount of outflow, measured in cubic feet per second (cfs) as
defined in footnote 11 of Table 3. The permits and license of the DWR and the
USBR are conditioned to establish responsibilities to ensure that the Delta Outflow Objective is met on an interim basis until the State Water Board adopts a water right decision or order that assigns permanent responsibility for meeting the Delta Outflow Objective. This water right decision or order would follow a water right proceeding after a request for such a proceeding by the DWR or USBR.

2. River Flows: Sacramento River at Rio Vista
This objective is to be implemented through water right actions. The permits and license of the DWR and the USBR are conditioned to establish responsibilities to ensure that the flow objectives at Rio Vista on the Sacramento River are met on an interim basis until the State Water Board adopts a decision that assigns permanent responsibility for meeting the Sacramento River at Rio Vista flow objectives. This water right decision would follow a water right proceeding after a request for such a proceeding by the DWR or USBR.
3. River Flows: Lower San Joaquin River at Airport Way Bridge, Vernalis The Lower San Joaquin River (LSJR) water quality objectives for the reasonable
protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses, referred to as the LSJR flow objectives,

27
86

include all of the LSJR flow objectives for February through June, the LSJR base
flow objective for February through June at Vernalis, and the October pulse flow
objective, as set forth in Table 3.

This program of implementation focuses on flow-related actions on the Stanislaus,
Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers (collectively, "LSJR Tributaries") that are necessary
to achieve the LSJR flow objectives. The State Water Board also recognizes that
Recommended Actions, including non-flow measures, such as habitat restoration,
must also be part of efforts to comprehensively address Delta aguatic ecosystem
needs as a whole. The State Water Board encourages voluntary agreements that
will assist in implementing the LSJR flow objectives, and will consider such
agreements as part of its proceedings to implement this Plan, consistent with its
obligations under applicable law.

Implementation of February through June LSJR Flow Objectives

By 2022, the State Water Board will fully implement the February through June
LSJR flow objectives through water right actions or water quality actions, such as
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) hydropower licensing processes.

The State Water Board will exercise its water right and water quality authority to help
ensure that the flows required to meet the LSJR flow objectives are used for their
intended purpose and are not diverted for other purposes. In order to help ensure
that actions taken in response to implementation of the LSJR flow objectives do not
result in unreasonable redirected impacts to groundwater resources, the State Water
Board will take actions as necessary pursuant to its authorities, including its
authorities to prevent the waste, unreasonable use, unreasonable method of use.
and unreasonable method of diversion of water (Cal. Const., art. X, § 2; Wat. Code,
§S 100, 275) and to enforce the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)
(Wat. Code, § 10720 et seq.).

When implementing the LSJR flow objectives, the State Water Board will include
minimum reservoir carryover storage targets or other requirements to help ensure
that providing flows to meet the flow objectives will not have significant adverse
temperature or other impacts on fish and wildlife or, if feasible, on other beneficial
uses. The State Water Board will also take actions as necessary to ensure that implementation of the flow objectives does not impact supplies of water for minimum
health and safety needs, particularly during drought periods. Actions may include,
but are not limited to, assistance with funding and development of water
conservation efforts and regional water supply reliability projects and regulation of
public drinking water systems and water rights.

9 To refine the implementation actions and provide for coordination with ongoing FERC proceedings in the LSJR
watershed, the February through June LSJR flow objective may be phased in over time, but must be fully
implemented by 2022.

28
87

Although the lowest downstream compliance location for the LSJR flow objectives is
at Vernalis, the objectives are intended to protect migratory LSJR fish in a larger area, including within the Delta, where fish that migrate to or from the LSJR
watershed depend on adequate flows from the LSJR and its salmon-bearing
tributaries.

It is the State Water Board's intention that an entity's implementation of the LSJR :
flow objectives, including implementation through flow requirements imposed in a
FERC process, will meet any responsibility to contribute to the LSJR inflow
component of the Delta outflow objective in this Plan. The State Water Board.
however, may further consider and reallocate responsibility for implementing the
Delta outflow objective in any subsequent proceeding, including a water right
proceeding.

Flow Requirements for February through June

The LSJR flow objectives for February through June shall be implemented by
requiring 40 percent of unimpaired flow, based on a minimum 7-day running
average, from each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers. This required
percentage of unimpaired flow, however, may be adjusted within the range allowed
by the LSJR flow objectives through adaptive methods detailed below. The required
pereentage-of-unimpaired flow is in-addition to flews in-the LSJR frem sourees other
than the LSJR Tributaries. The required percentage of unimpaired flow does not
apply to an individual tributary during periods when flows from that tributary could
cause or contribute to flooding or other related public safety concerns, as
determined by the State Water Board or Executive Director through consultation with
federal, state, and local agencies and other persons or entities with expertise in
flood management.

In addition, the LSJR base flow objective for February through June shall be
implemented by reguiring a minimum base flow of 1,000 cfs, based on a minimum 7-day running average, at Vernalis at all times. This minimum base flow. however,
may be adjusted within the range allowed by the LSJR base flow objective through
adaptive methods detailed below. When the percentage of unimpaired flow
requirement is insufficient to meet the minimum base flow requirement, the
Stanislaus River shall provide 29 percent, the Tuolumne River 47 percent and the
Merced River 24 percent of the additional total outflow needed to achieve and
maintain the required base flow at Vernalis.

The Executive Director may approve changes to the compliance locations and gage
station numbers set forth in Table 3 if information shows that another location and
gage station more accurately represent the flows of the LSJR tributary at its
confluence with the LSJR.

29
88

Adaptive Methods for February through June Flows

Adjustments to the February through June unimpaired flow requirements allowed by
the LSJR flow objectives should be implemented in a coordinated and adaptive
manner, taking into account current information. Specifically, FERC licensing
proceedings on the Merced and Tuolumne Rivers, other scientific review processes
initiated to develop potential management strategies on a tributary basis, and the
establishment of the San Joaquin River Monitoring and Evaluation Program
(SJRMEP) described below are expected to yield additional scientific information
that will inform future management of flows for the protection of fish and wildlife
beneficial uses.

Adaptive implementation could also optimize flows to achieve the objectives while
allowing for consideration of other beneficial uses, provided that these other
considerations do not reduce intended benefits to fish and wildlife.

The State Water Board may approve Aadaptive adjustments to the flow requirements as set forth in (a) - (d) below may be appreved-by the State Water
Board-on an annual or long-term basis, or by the Executive Direeter as provided belew, if information produced through the monitoring and review processes
described in this program of implementation, or other best available scientific
information; indicates that the change for the period at issue will satisfy the following
criteria for adaptive adjustments: (1) it will be sufficient to support and maintain the
natural production of viable native San Joaquin River watershed fish populations
migrating through the Delta; and (2) it will meet any existing biological goals approved by the State Water Board. The Executive Director may approve adaptive
adjustments that satisfy the criteria above and as provided below:

a) The required percent of unimpaired flow may be adjusted to any value
between 30 percent and 50 percent, inclusive. The Executive Director may
approve changes within this range on an annual basis if all members of the
Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Working Group (STM Working Group),
described below, agree to the changes.

b) The required percent of unimpaired flow for February through June may be
managed as a total volume of water and released on an adaptive schedule
during that period where scientific information indicates a flow pattern
different from that which would occur by tracking the unimpaired flow
percentage would better protect fish and wildlife beneficial uses. The total
volume of water must be at least equal to the volume of water that would be
released by tracking the unimpaired flow percentage from February through
June. The Executive Director may approve such changes on an annual basis
-.- if the change is recommended by one or more members of the STM Working
Group.

30
89

c The release of a portion of the February through June unimpaired flow may
be delayed until after June to prevent adverse effects to fisheries, including
temperature, that would otherwise result from implementation of the February
through June flow requirements. The ability to delay release of flow until after
June is only allowed when the unimpaired flow requirement is greater than
30 percent. If the requirement is greater than 30 percent but less than
40 percent under (a) above, the amount of flow that may be-released after
June is limited to the portion of the unimpaired flow requirement over
30 percent. (For example, if the flow requirement is 35 percent, 5 percent
may be released after June.) If the requirement is 40 percent or greater under
(a) above, then 25 percent of the total volume of the flow requirement may be
released after June. (For example, if the requirement is 50 percent, at least
37.5 percent unimpaired flow must be released in February through June and
up to 12.5 percent unimpaired flow may be released after June.) If after June
the STM Werking Group determines that conditions have changed such that
water held for release-after June should net be roleased by the fall-ef that year, the water may be held until the fellewing year.. The Executive Director
may approve changes on an annual basis if the change is recommended by
one or more members of the STM Working Group.

d) The required base flow for February through June may be adjusted to any
value between 800 and 1,200 cfs, inclusive. The Executive Director may
approve changes within this range on an annual basis if all members of the
STM Working Group agree to the changes.

-Any of the adjustments in (a)-(d) above may be made independently of each other or
combined. The adjustments in (a), (b), and (c) may also be made independently on
each of the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers, so long as the flows are
coordinated to achieve beneficial results in the LSJR related to the protection of fish
and wildlife beneficial uses. Experiments may also be conducted within the adaptive
adjustments in (a)-(d), subject to the approvals provided therein, in order to improve
scientific understanding of needed measures for the protection of fish and wildlife
beneficial uses, such as the optimal timing of required flows. Any experiment shall
be coordinated with the SJRMEP and identify the scientific uncertainties to be
addressed and the actions that will be taken to reduce those uncertainties, including
monitoring and evaluation.

31
90

Stanislaus, Tuolumne and Merced Working Group

The State Water Board will establish a STM Working Group to assist with the implementation, monitoring and effectiveness assessment of the February through June LSJR flow requirements. Specifically, the State Water Board will seek
recommendations from the STM Working Group on biological goals; procedures for
implementing the adaptive methods described above; annual adaptive operations
plans; and the SJRMEP, including special studies and reporting requirements. Each
of these activities is described in more detail below.

The State Water Board will seek participation in the STM Working Group by the
following entities who have expertise in LSJR, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced
Rivers fisheries management, hydrology, operations, and monitoring and
assessment needs: the DFW; NMFS; USFWS; and water users on the Stanislaus,
•Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers. The STM Working Group will also include State
Water Board staff and may include any other persons or entities the Executive
Director determines to have appropriate expertise. Subgroups of the STM Working
Group may be formed as appropriate and State Water Board staff may also initiate
activities in coordination with members of the STM Working Group.

Biological Goals

Biological goals will be used to inform the adaptive methods, evaluate the
effectiveness of this program of implementation, the SJRMEP, and future changes
to the Bay-Delta Plan. The State Water Board will seek recommendations on the
biological goals from the STM Working Group, State Water Board staff, and other
interested persons, in consultation with the Delta Science Program. The State
Water Board will consider approval of the biological goals within 180 days from the date of the Office of Administrative Law's (OAL) approval of this amendment to the
Bay-Delta Plan and may modify them based on new information developed through
the monitoring and evaluation activities described below or other pertinent sources
of scientific information. Biological goals will specifically be developed for LSJR
salmonids, as salmonids are among the fish species most sensitive to LSJR flow
modifications. The State Water Board may seek recommendations on biological
goals for other LSJR species as appropriate.

Biological goals for salmonids will specifically be developed for:
-abundancei
productivity as measured by population growth rate:
genetic and life history diversity; and
population spatial extent, distribution, and structure.

Within-a given tributary, fReasonable contributions to ereduetivity these biological
goals may include meeting temperature targets and other measures of quality and
quantity of spawning, and rearing, and migration habitat, fry production, and juvenile
outmigrant survival to the confluence of each tributary to the LSJR.

32
91

The salmonid biological goals for this program of implementation will be specific to
the LSJR and its tributaries and will contribute to meeting the overall goals for each
population, including the salmon doubling objective established in state and federal
law. Biological goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, result-focused,
and include a time frame for when they will be achieved. Biological goals for
salmonid populations will be consistent with best available scientific information,
including information regarding viable salmonid populations, recovery plans for listed
salmonids, or other appropriate information.

Unimpaired Flow Compliance

Implementation of the unimpaired flow requirement for February through June will
require the development of information and specific measures to achieve the flow objectives and to monitor and evaluate compliance. The STM Working Group, or State Water Board staff as necessary, will, in consultation with the Delta Science
Program, develop and recommend such proposed measures. The State Water
Board or Executive Director will consider approving the measures within 180 days
from the date of OAL's approval of this amendment to the Bay-Delta Plan. The
approved measures will inform State Water Board water right proceedings, FERC
licensing proceedings, or other implementation actions to achieve the February
through June flows. As information and methods improve, specific measures to
achieve the flow obiectives and to monitor and evaluate compliance may be
modified and submitted for approval.

Procedures for Implementation of Adaptive Methods

The STM Working Group, or State Water Board staff as necessary, will, in
consultation with the Delta Science Program, develop proposed procedures for
allowing the adaptive adjustments to the February through June flow requirements
discussed above. The State Water Board or Executive Director will consider
approving procedures for allowing those adaptive adjustments within one year
following the date of OAL's approval of this amendment to the Bay-Delta Plan.

Annual Adaptive Operations Plan

The STM Working Group or members or subsets of the STM Working Group, as
appropriate, will be required to submit proposed annual plans for adaptive implementation actions (annual operations plans) for the coming season by January 10 of each year for approval by the State Water Board or Executive
Director. The State Water Board recognizes that an annual operations plan is based
on a forecast from the best available information and may not accurately reflect
actual conditions that occur during the February through June period. Accordingly,
the State Water Board will consider this factor and whether the hydrologic condition
could have been planned for in evaluating deviations from approved operations
plans. An annual operations plan shall include actions and operations that consider

and will work under a reasonable range of hydrological conditions. It shall also
identify how unimpaired flows are calculated and adjustments to be made as
updated information becomes available, such as DWR's Bulletin 120.10 An annual
operations plan shall be informed by the review activities described below and may
be modified with the approval of the State Water Board or Executive Director. A
-multi-year operations plan meeting these requirements may be submitted at any
time,

Implementation of October Pulse Flow Objective

The October pulse flow objective is currently implemented through water right
actions. The State Water Board will reevaluate the assignment of responsibility for
meeting the October pulse flow objective during a water right proceeding, FERC
licensing proceeding, or other proceeding.

Through water right, FERC licensing, or other processes, the State Water Board will
require monitoring and special studies to determine what, if any, changes should be
made to the October pulse flow objective and its implementation. The State Water
Board may require such monitoring and special studies to be part of the SJRMEP.
The State Water Board will evaluate the need to modify the October pulse flow
objective in a future update of the Bay-Delta Plan based on information developed
through these processes.

State of Emergency

At its discretion, or at the request of any affected responsible agency or person, the
State Water Board may authorize a temporary change in the implementation of the
LSJR flow objectives in a water right proceeding if the State Water Board
determines that either (i) there is an emergency as defined in the California
Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.3) or (ii) the Governor of
the State of California or-a local governing bedy-has declared an state or lecal
emergency pursuant to the California Emergency Services Act (Gov. Code, § 8550
et seg.) and LSJR flow requirements affect or are affected by the conditions of such
emergency. Before authorizing any temporary change, the State Water Board must
find that measures will be taken to reasonably protect the fish and wildlife beneficial
use in light of the circumstances of the emergency.

San Joaguin River Monitoring and Evaluation Program

In order to determine compliance with the LSJR flow objectives, inform adaptive
implementation, investigate the technical factors involved in water quality control,
and potential needed future changes to the LSJR flow objectives; including flows for

other times of the year, a comprehensive monitoring, special studies, evaluation,
and reporting program is necessary. The State Water Board will require in water
right permits, and water quality certifications_  as appropriate, annual and
comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and reporting through water rights and water
quality actions. Pursuant to its authorities, including Water Code section 13165,
comprehensive monitoring will be required to address both the individual and
cumulative impacts of diversions and discharges to fish and wildlife beneficial uses.
The following requirements, at a minimum, shall be imposed:

1) Monitoring, special studies, and evaluations of the effects of flow and
other factors on the viability of native LSJR watershed fish populations
throughout the year, including assessment of abundance, spatial
extent (or distribution), diversity (both genetic and life history), and
productivity.
Consideration of recommendations from entities with relevant Central
Valley monitoring plans to improve standardization of methods,
including the quantification of bias and precision of population
estimates.
3) Regular external scientific review of monitoring, evaluation, and
reporting.

Monitoring should be integrated and coordinated with new and ongoing monitoring
and special studies programs in the LSJR, including pursuant to federal biological
opinion requirements, FERC licensing proceedings for the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers, Central Valley Regional Water Board requirements, and the Delta Science
Program. At least every five years, the State Water Board will request the Delta
Science Program to conduct a review of the San Joaquin River Monitoring and
Evaluation Program.

Annual reporting

To inform the next year's operations and other activities, the State Water Board will
require preparation and submittal of an annual report to the State Water Board by
December 31 of each year. The annual report shall describe implementation of
flows, including any flow shifting done pursuant to the annual adaptive operations
plan, monitoring and special studies activities, and implementation of other
measures to protect fish and wildlife during the previous water year, including the
actions by other entities identified in this program of implementation. The annual
report shall also identify any deviations from the annual adaptive operations plan
and describe future special studies. The State Water Board may-will hold public
meetings to receive and discuss the annual report.

Comprehensive Reporting

Additionally, every three to five years following implementation of this update to the
Bay-Delta Plan, the State Water Board will require preparation and submittal of a

35
94

comprehensive report that, in addition to the requirements of annual reporting, reviews the progress toward meeting the biological goals and identifies any recommended changes to the implementation of the flow objectives. The
comprehensive report and any recommendations shall be peer-reviewed by an
appropriate independent science panel, which will make its own conclusions and
recommendations. The State Water Board will hold public meetings to consider the
comprehensive report, technical information, and conclusions or recommendations
developed through the peer review process. This information will be used to inform
potential adaptive changes to the implementation of the flow objectives and, as
appropriate, future potential changes to the Bay-Delta Plan.

In order to leverage expertise and limited resources (financial and otherwise), parties are encouraged to work collaboratively in one or more groups and in
consultation with the STM Working Group, USBR and DWR, in meeting the above monitoring and reporting requirements. The State Water Board may streamline
monitoring and reporting obligations of parties working collaboratively with each
other, the STM Working Group, USBR, DWR, the Delta Science Program or other
appropriate parties.

Voluntary Agreements

The State Water Board recognizes that voluntary agreements can help inform and
expedite implementation of the water quality objectives and can provide durable
solutions in the Delta watershed.

..Subject to acceptance by the State Water Board, a voluntary agreement may serve
as an implementation mechanism for the LSJR flow objectives for the LSJR
Tributaries as a whole, an individual tributary, or some combination thereof.
Voluntary agreements may include commitments to meet the flow requirements and
to undertake non-flow actions. If the voluntary agreements include non-flow actions
recommended in this Plan or by DFW, the non-flow measures may support a
change in the required percent of unimpaired flow, within the range prescribed by
the flow objectives, or other adaptive adjustments otherwise allowed in this program
of implementation. Any such changes must be supported by DFW and satisfy the
criteria for adaptive adjustments contained within this program of implementation. At
a minimum, to be considered by the State Water Board, voluntary agreements must
include provisions for transparency and accountability, monitoring and reporting, and
for planning, adaptive adjustments, and periodic evaluation, that are comparable to
similar elements contained in the program of implementation for the LSJR flow
objectives.

The State Water Board encourages parties to present any executed voluntary,
agreement to the State Water Board for its review as soon as feasible to improve
conditions in the watershed.
This ebjeetive is to be implemented threugh water right actions. This plan ineludes a
time schedule for completing implementation. Flow objectives for the San Jeaquin

River at the Airport Way Bridge-near Vernalis have been-established for three time
periods:
• Spring flow objeetives, February through April 14 and May 16 through June;

4. Export Limits These objectives are to be implemented through water right actions. The water right permits and licenses of the DWR and the USBR are conditioned upon meeting the
objectives for export pumping.

5. Delta Cross Channel Gates Operation
This objective is to be implemented through water right actions. The USBR, as the
owner and operator of the Gates, is solely responsible under its water right permits
and licenses for implementing the Delta Cross Channel Gates Closure objectives.
6. Salinity Control Salinity objectives are implemented through a mix of water right actions (flow) and
salinity control measures depending on the location and beneficial use affected.
Salinity objectives and their implementation fall into the following broad categories:

.- Municipal and Industrial Uses: Theseis objectives are-is to be implemented
through a combination of water right actions and other actions, depending on the location at which the objective applies. The water right permits and licenses of the DWR and the USBR currently are conditioned upon
implementation of chloride objectives to protect municipal and industrial uses. The salinity objectives at Contra Costa Water District's Pumping Plant No. 1
on Rock Slough, however, are being implemented in part through flows provided by the DWR and the USBR on Old River at the head of Rock Slough
and in part through infrastructure improvements that reduce water quality degradation caused by localized drainage into Rock Slough.

ii. Fish and Wildlife in Suisun Marsh: Theseis objectives are-is to be
-implemented through water right actions because the salinity levels are
determined by flows and control structure operations. The water right permits and licenses of the DWR and the USBR currently are conditioned upon
implementation of the numeric salinity objectives for Suisun Marsh at stations S-21, and S-42 (Figure 5). Due to evidence showing a potential for the

39
98

objectives at stations S-97 and S-35 to cause harm to the beneficial uses they are intended to protect, the State Water Board in Decision 1641 (D- 1641) did not require that DWR and USBR attain the objectives at stations S-
97 and S-35. Implementation of the salinity objectives at these two stations is
discussed in section B.5.

ili. Fish and Wildlife in the San Joaguin River: Theseis objectives are-is to be
implemented through water right actions. The water right permits and licenses of the DWR and the USBR currently are conditioned upon implementation of the San Joaquin River salinity objective to protect fish and wildlife uses.

iv. Agriculture in the Western Delta, Interior Delta, and Export Area: These
objectives are to be implemented through water right actions. The water right
permits and licenses of the DWR and the USBR currently are conditioned
upon implementation of the Western Delta, Interior Delta, and Export Area
salinity objectives to protect agricultural uses.

V. Agriculture in the Southern Delta: The water rights of the DWR and the USBR
are conditioned upon implementation of the southern Delta salinity objectives to protect agricultural beneficial uses. Implementation of salinity objectives in the southern Delta requires a mix of salt load control and flow related measures. It is therefore discussed in section B of the Program of Implementation: 'Measures Requiring a Combination of State Water Board Authorities and Actions by Other Agencies.'
B. Measures Requiring a Combination of State Water Board Authorities and Actions by Other Agencies

Implementation of the following water quality objectives will require water rights and
water quality measures by the State Water Board, in concert with actions taken by
other agencies:

Implementation of these objectives can be accomplished through a combination of
the following: dilution flows, regulation of water diversions, pollutant discharge controls, best management practices to control the amount of waste produced, and improvements in water circulation. In addition to describing the actions taken, or to be taken, by the State Water Board, this section describes the actions taken, and that should be taken, by other agencies to implement these objectives. The State
4'9 Water Board will use its authority, as needed and appropriate, under section 13165 of the California Water Code to require that studies are conducted.
1. Southern Delta Agricultural Salinity Objectives
The program of implementation for the southern Delta salinity objective describes
the actions necessary to achieve the objective and the monitoring, special studies, and reporting requirements that the State Water Board will require to evaluate

40
99

compliance with the objective and to obtain additional information to inform
implementation of the objective and understanding of salinity conditions in the
southern Delta. The southern Delta salinity objective will be achieved primarily
through water right and water quality control actions that affect flow, ineluding
through the- Rregulation of municipal and other discharges-by municipal and other
disehargers will also be required.

Elevated salinity in the-southern Delta is-caused-by various facters, including low
flews; salts imported to the-San Joaquin Basin in irrigation-water; municipal discharges; subsurface aceretions from groundwater; tidal actions; diversions-of water by the SWP, CVP, and-local water users; channel eapacity; and diseharges from land derived-salts, primarily from agrieultural drainage. These salinity ebjectives currently are implemented through a-mix of water right actions and salinity control. The water rights of the USBR-are-conditioned-upon -implementation of the salinity objectives-on the San Joaquin-Rivef- at-Vemalis-and the water-rights-of-DWR and USBR are conditiened-upon implementation of the salinity-objectives at-the ether three-southern-Delta stations (San Joaquin River at Brandt Bridge, Old River at Middle River and Old River at Traey Road Bridge (interior southern Delta stations)). Salinity objectives on the San Joaquin River at Vernalis are alse being implemented through nen-water right aetions, including-the San Jeaquin River Salinity Control Pregram-in-the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Contrel Board's (Regional Water Board) Water Quality Control-Plan-for the Saeramente and San Jeaquin River Basins. In October-of 2005, the State Water Board approved an
Amendment to the Water-Quality Gontrol Plan for the Saeramento-River and San
Jeaquin-River Basins. The amendment consists-of a Control Program-for Salt and
Beren Discharges inte the Lower San Jeaquin River and ether aetions-te implement
salinity ebjectives in the SJR at Vernalis. The salt and boren-basin-plan amendment
ineludes-implementation measures and a timeline for implementation ef-salt lead
allecations.

The salinity ebjeetives at Vernalis-can be attained by releasing-dilutien water frem
New Melones and other sourses, completing a drain to remove the salts generated
by agricultural drainage and municipal discharges from the San Joaquin Valley, and condueting measures in the San Jeaquin-Valley such as the measures-diseussed below for contrelling salinity in the interier southern Delta. The salinity ebjectives-for the interior southern Delta can-be implemented by measures that inelude-statt regulatory actions, state funding of projeets and studies, regulation of water diversions, pollutant discharge controls, improvements in water circulation, and long- term-implementation-of best management-practices-to-control-saline-discharges.
State Regulatory Actions

San Joaquin River at Airport Way Near Vernalis

i. In D-1641 the State Water Board concluded that USBR, through its
activities associated with operating the CVP in the San Joaquin River

41
100

basin, has caused reduced water quality of the San Joaquin River at
Vernalis. For the San Joaquin River at Airport Way near Vernalis, Revised Water Right Deeisien- D-1641 imposes conditions on USBR's
water rights requiring implementation of EC levels of 0.7 mmhos/cm
from April through August and 1.0 mmhos/cm from September through
March (units of mmhos/cm are equal to units of dS/m). As part of
implementing the salinity water quality objective for the interior
southern Delta, USBR shall be required to continue to comply with
these salinity levels, as a condition of its water rights. Implementation
of the southern Delta salinity objective at Vernalis may be modified by
the State Water Board in a future Bay-Delta Plan update and a
subsequent water right proceeding, if necessary, after adoption of a
Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) or other salinity management plan by the State Water Board or Central Valley Regional Water Quality
Control Board (Central Valley Regional Water Board) that identifies
more appropriate salinity management measures. The State Water
Board-has conditioned the water rights of some water right helders-on
the presence of dilution rently, the water rights of USBR are conditioned upon-implementation-of the Vernalis ebjeetives, and the water rights-of USBR and DWR-are-conditioned upon-implementation of the-interier southern Delta ebjectives. The State Water Board cot
also require releases-from ether non-SWP/GVP reserveirs after notice
and an opportunity for a hearing. In lieu-of some-water-releases, water
right helders such as USBR-and-DWWR-could use measures-that affect
cireulatien of water in the southern Delta (ineluding permanent
eperational gates).
Interior Southern Delta Compliance Locations

Revised Water Right Deeisien-In D-1641 the State Water Board concluded that DWR and USBR are partially responsible for salinity problems in the southern Delta due to hydrologic changes caused by export pumping. D-1641 imposes conditions on DWR's and USBR's
water rights requiring implementation of EC levels of 0.7 mmhos/cm
from April through August and 1.0 mmhos/cm from September through
March at the three compliance stations in the interior southern Delta
(Interagency Stations No. C-6, C-8, and P-12). As part of
implementing the salinity water quality objective for the interior

Q L.MUT. southern Delta, the State Water Board will amend DWR's and USBR's
water rights to continue to require implementation of the interior
southern Delta salinity water quality objectives consistent with this
plan. shall be required to comply with-the 1.0-dS/m water quality ebjeetive year-round as a condition-of their water rights. The State 3 Water Board may also consider the responsibility of others for
implementing the interior southern Delta salinity objective based on
implementation or completion of the Comprehensive Operations Plan,

42
101

Monitoring Special Study, modeling, or Monitoring and Reporting Plan
described below, or development of other information,

The interior southern Delta salinity compliance locations are comprised
of three river segments rather than three specific point locations so
that compliance with the southern Delta salinity objective can be better
-determined in a Delta environment subject to alternating tidal flows.
DWR's and USBR's water rights shall be conditioned to require
development of information that will be used to determine the
appropriate locations and methods to assess attainment of the salinity
objective in the interior southern Delta, including through completien of
the Comprehensive Operations Plan, Monitoring Special Study,
Modeling, and Monitoring and Reporting Plan described below.
Infermation from these aetivities will be used te-determine the
appropriate lesations and metheds to-assess attainment-ef the salinity
objeetive-in the interier seuthern Delta. Prior to State Water Board
approval of the Monitoring and Reporting Plan, attainment-compliance
of the salinity objective for the interior southern Delta will be assessed
at stations C-6, C-8, and P-12, which USBR and DWR shall be

•: required to continue to operate as a condition of their water rights. Chapter III of this plan provides the general rule that unless otherwise
provided, water quality objectives cited for a general area are
applicable for all locations in that general area. Consistent with this,
the use of compliance locations and gage stations to determine
compliance by DWR and USBR shall not be interpreted as a limitation on the applicability of the southern Delta salinity objective, which
applies throughout the southern Delta,

Comprehensive Operations Plan: The State Water Board will continue
to require DWR and USBR to address the impacts of their operations
on interior southern Delta salinity levels. Specifically, the State Water
Board will require the development and implementation of a
Comprehensive Operations Plan (COP). The COP must:

describe the actions that will fully address the impacts of SWP
and CVP export operations on water levels and flow conditions
that may affect salinity conditions in the southern Delta,
including the availability of assimilative capacity for local
sources of salinity;
include detailed information regarding the configuration and
operations of any facilities relied upon in the plan; and
identify specific performance goals (i.e.; water levels, flows, or
other similar measures) for these facilities.

Monitoring requirements needed to measure compliance with the
specific performance goals in the COP must be included in the

43
102

Monitoring and Reporting Plan, discussed below. DWR and USBR
shall be required to consult with the South Delta Water Agency
(SDWA), Contra Costa Water District (CCWD), State Water Board
staff, other state and federal resource agencies, and local stakeholders
to develop the COP, and will be required to hold periodic coordination
meetings, no less than quarterly, throughout implementation of the
plan.

DWR and USBR shall submit the COP to the Executive Director for
approval within six months from the date of the OAL's approval of this
amendment to the Bay-Delta Plan. Once approved, the COP shall be
reviewed annually, and updated as needed, with a corresponding
report submitted by Oeteber 3February 1 each year to the Executive
• Director for approval. The State Water Board will require compliance
with this measure pursuant to its Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control
Act authority to require technical and monitoring requirements, or as a
requirement of a water right order.

iv. Special Studies, Modeling and Monitoring and Reporting: To
implement and determine compliance with the salinity objective in
these river segments, and to inform the COP, the State Water Board
will require DWR and USBR to complete the following activities.. The
State Water Board will require compliance with these activities
pursuant to its Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act authority to
require technical and monitoring requirements, or as a requirement of
a water right order:

a. .Monitoring Special Study: Prior to development of the
long-term Monitoring and Reporting Plan, described below,
DWR and USBR shall work with State Water Board staff and
solicit stakeholder input to develop and implement a special
study to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution and
associated dynamics of water level, flow, and salinity conditions
in the southern Delta waterways. The study shall identify the
extent of low or null flow conditions and any associated
concentration of local salt discharges. The State Water Board
will request local agricultural water users and municipal
dischargers to provide data regarding local diversions and
return flows or discharges. DWR and USBR shall submit a plan
for this special study to the Executive Director for approval
within six months from the date of OAL's approval of this
amendment to the Bay-Delta Plan. Once approved, the
monitoring contained in this plan shall be conducted until
superseded by the long-term Monitoring and Reporting Plan,
described below, is approved.

44
103

b.: Modeling: DWR and USBR shall provide modeling and
other technical assistance necessary to prepare and update the
COP, and otherwise assist in implementing the southern Delta
agricultural salinity objective. DWR and USBR will be required
to continue to provide this assistance as required by State
Water Board Order WR 2010-0002, which modifies paragraph
A.3 of Order WR 2006-0006.

Monitoring and Reporting Plan: DWR and USBR shall
develop long-term monitoring protocols to measure compliance
with the performance goals of the COP, and to assess
attainment of the salinity objective in the interior southern Delta.
These monitoring and reporting protocols shall be based on the
information obtained in the Monitoring Special Study, and shall
include specific alternative-compliance monitoring locations in,
or monitoring protocols for, the three river segments that
comprise the interior southern delta salinity compliance
locations. The Executive Director may approve changes to the
gage stations at which compliance is determined, except
monitoring station C-10, in Table 2, if information shows that
other gage stations more accurately represent salinity
conditions in the interior southern Delta.

The Monitoring and Reporting Plan will be required to be
integrated and coordinated with existing monitoring and special
studies programs in the Delta. DWR and USBR shall submit
the Monitoring and Reporting Plan to the Executive Director for
approval within 18 months from the date of OAL's approval of
this amendment to the Bay-Delta Plan.

V. DWR's and USBR's water rights shall be conditioned to require
continued operations of the agricultural barriers at Grant Line Canal,
Middle River, and Old River at Tracy, or other reasonable measures, to
address the impacts of SWP and CVP export operations on water
levels and flow conditions that might affect southern Delta salinity
conditions, including the assimilative capacity for local sources of
salinity in the southern Delta. The water right conditions shall require
any necessary modifications to the design and operations of the
barriers or other measures as determined by the COP.

Vi... In addition to the above requirements, the salinity water quality
objective for the southern Delta will be implemented through the Lower
San Joaquin River flow objectives, which will increase inflow of low
salinity water into the southern Delta during February through June
and thereafter under adaptive implementation to prevent adverse

45
104

effects to fisheries. This will assist in achieving the southern Delta
water quality objective.

#.vii. Salinity problems in the southern Delta primarily result from low
flows, tidal action, diversions by the CVP, SWP and local water
users, agricultural return flows, poor circulation, and channel
capacity. As early as the 1991 Bay-Delta Plan, the State Water
Board recognized the need to meet the salinity objectives largely
through regulation of water flow. This Bay-Delta Plan continues
Revised Decision 1641's obligations on the CVP and SWP to meet
the salinity water quality objectives. Overall, discharges from publicly
owned treatment works (POTWs) in the southern Delta have only a
small effect on southern Delta salinity. Studies show the de minimis
influence of POTW discharges on downstream ambient EC levels,
both in low and high CVP and SWP export scenarios. The extent to
which a POTW can meet salinity water quality objectives in the
southern Delta is in part controlled by factors beyond its control,
namely flows and circulation patterns, which are largely controlled by
tidal action and water diversions. PQTW discharges also reflect the
EC levels of their source water, which is high in the southern Delta.
POTWs are subject to the Clean Water Act and must control their
salt discharges. It is reasonable to view the extent to which they must
control their discharges in light of the constraints they face, the de
minimis effect of their discharge on water quality related to salinity,
and this implementation program's focus on water levels and flows to
achieve the salinity water quality objectives, Desalination through
reverse-osmosis processes can reduce salinity in POTW effluent, but
is energy intensive, may be cost-prohibitive to construct and operate,
and may also create brine waste disposal issues in an area that is
already challenged by high salts. The State Water Board, therefore.
finds that reverse-osmosis treatment for POTW wastewater
discharges into the southern Delta is currently not a feasible
technology for the purpose of controlling salinity in the southern
Delta.

The Central Valley Regional Water Board shall regulate impese
discharge-contrels-en-in-Delta discharges of salts by agricultural,
municipal POTW, and other dischargers consistent with applicable state and federal law, including, but not limited to, establishing water-
quality based effluent limitations and compliance, monitoring and
reporting requirements as part of the reissuance of National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits under the Clean
Water Act and the regulations thereunder. In most, if not all, cases, it
may be infeasible for POTWs discharging to the southern Delta to
comply with traditional numeric water-quality based effluent

46
105

limitations for salts in NPDES permits. In cases where it is infeasible,
the Central Valley Regional Water Board shall include in NPDES
permits the following types of enforceable effluent limitations:

(a) A performance-based effluent limitation derived using, at a
minimum, the past three years of effluent data and one that
considers the potential for drought conditions, changing water
sources, and water conservation.
(b) Best management practices, including but not limited to: (A) an
industrial pretreatment program, implemented through local
ordinances, that minimizes salinity inputs from all industrial sources
of salinity within the POTW's collection system; (B) source control
measures, such as reducing salinity concentrations in source water
supplies: (C) actions to limit or ban the use of residential self-
generating water softeners or imposing salt efficiency standards on
such water softeners; (D) a salinity education and outreach
program; and (E) ongoing participation in the Central Valley Salinity
Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CV-SALTS).

In addition, where it is infeasible for POTWs discharging to the
southern Delta to comply with traditional numeric water-quality based
effluent limitations for salts, the Central Valley Regional Water Board
shall require POTWs to submit the following information, which shall
be submitted with a POTW's application for a renewal of its NPDES
permit, except for (e) and (f), which shall be submitted in annual
reports:

(a) An evaluation of whether technological or economic changes have
made previously deemed infeasible upgrades to control salinity in
the POTW's effluent feasible.
(b) A survey of industrial sources of salinity regulated by the industrial
pretreatment program, along with all annual reports submitted
pursuant to that program documenting the implementation of
salinity management strategies at the industrial facility within the
collection system area.
(c) Documentation of source control measures taken. If alternative
lower-salinity source water supplies were available but not utilized,
a justification for not using such supplies shall be provided.
(d) An evaluation of the efficacy of actions taken to limit or ban the use
of residential self-generating water softeners or to impose efficiency
standards on water softeners within the POTW's collection system
area. This evaluation shall include the estimated number of such
-water softeners in the POTW's collection system area. If a ban

47
106

against the use of self-generating water softeners is not instituted,
a justification why a ban is not feasible.
(e) Materials developed and disseminated in support of the salinity
education and outreach program.
(f) Documented proof of participation in CV-SALTS.
Where it is or becomes feasible for a POTW to comply with numeric
water quality based effluent limitations for salts, the Central Valley
Regional Water Board shall require them in the applicable NPDES
permit. In such cases, POTW compliance actions include, without
limitation, source control, such as reducing salinity concentrations in
source water supplies; pretreatment programs, such as reducing water
"softener use among water users; and desalination. Where appropriate,
the Central Valley Regional Water Board may also grant variances in
accordance with applicable state and federal law.

The Gentral Valley Regienal-Water Beard shall regulate-impese discharge centrols-on -in-Delta-diseharges-of salts-by agricultural, demestie, and municipal dischargers sonsistent with applicable state and federal law, including, but not limited te. establishing water-quality based effluent limitations and complianee, monitering and reperting requiremente as-part ef the reissuance-of-Natienal Pellutant-Diseharge

Central Valley Regional Water Board Actions

The Central Valley Regional Water Board is undertaking the following efforts, which
will assist in implementing the southern Delta salinity objective:

-Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CV-SALTS):
CV-SALTS is a stakeholder-led effort initiated by the State Water Board and
the Central Valley Regional Water Board in 2006 to develop comprehensive
long-term measures to address salinity and nitrate problems in California's
Central Valley, including formulation of a basin plan amendment and
implementation actions. The State Water Board may consider modifications
to the southern Delta salinity objective and program of implementation in a
future Bay-Delta Plan update, as well as requirements imposed through water
right actions, based on information and recommendations generated from the
CV-SALTS initiative.

ii. San Joaquin River at Vernalis Salt and Boron TMDL: The Central Valley
Regional Water Board is implementing the salinity and boron TMDL at
Vernalis. Actions described in the program of implementation for the TMDL
include execution of a Management Agency Agreement with USBR
addressing salt imported into the San Joaquin River basin via the Delta-
Mendota Canal, development of new numeric salinity objectives, and
establishment of the Real Time Management Program for the control of
salinity discharges to the San Joaquin River.

iii. Upstream of Vernalis San Joaquin River Salinity Objectives: CV-SALTS has
established a subcommittee that has-developed a proposal for, and the
Central Valley Regional Water Board approved, a basin plan amendment to
the Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River Basin and San
Joaquin River Basin to establish numerical salinity objectives and a program
of implementation for the Lower San Joaquin River upstream of Vernalis.

iv. Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program: Under the Irrigated Lands Regulatory
Program, the Central Valley Regional Water Board issues waste discharge
requirements (WDRs) to coalition groups and individual dischargers requiring
surface water quality monitoring and the preparation and implementation of
management plans to address identified water quality problems, including
those associated with salinity. The most recent WDRs require third parties to
develop regional water quality management plans for areas where irrigated
agriculture is contributing to water quality problems. It requires growers to
implement practices consistent with those plans to address the identified
problems.

v. Variances from Surface Water Quality Standards for Point Source
- Dischargers, Variance Program for Salinity, and Exception from

49
108

Implementation of Water Quality Objectives for Salinity: The Central Valley
Regional Water Board adopted Resolution R5-2014-0074 to amend water
quality control plans for the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River basins
and the Tulare Lake basin to add policies for Variances from Surface Water
Quality Standards for Point Source Dischargers (Variance Policy), a Variance
Program for Salinity (Salinity Variance Program) and an Exception from
Implementation of Water Quality Objectives for Salinity (Salinity Exception
Program).- The amendments were approved by the State Water Board on
March 17, 2015, (Resolution No. 2015-0010), and by OAL on June 19, 2015.
and. -by USEPA on July 8, 2016approval of the-amendments is anticipated in
2016.

The Variance Policy will allow the Central Valley Regional Water Board
the authority to grant short-term exceptions from meeting water guality
based effluent limitations to dischargers subject to NPDES permits. The
policy will only apply to non-priority pollutants, which includes-salinity.
The-Salinity Variance Program will allow the Central Valley Regional
Water Board the authority to grant multiple discharger variances from
meeting water quality based effluent limitations for salinity constituents to
publicly owned treatment works. A multiple discharger variance provides
a streamlined approval procedure in which an individual discharger
variance application, which is consistent with the multiple discharger
variance, does not require separate review and approval from the USEPA
once the multiple discharger variance is approved by USEPA.
The Salinity Exception Program establishes procedures for dischargers
that are subject to WDRs and conditional waivers to obtain a short-term
exception from meeting effluent or groundwater limitations for salinity
constituents.

The above programs will support the development and initial implementation
of the comprehensive salt and nitrate management plans in the Central Valley
by requiring dischargers to participate in the CV-SALTS effort.

State Funding of Programs

The State Water Board has various financial assistance programs under
which it can contribute funding for programs that will help meet the salinity
objectives or to improving understanding about salinity conditions in the southern Delta (primarily the San Joaquin River upstream of Vernalis). To date, it has funded tens of millions of dollars worth of projects and studies for
such programs. -The State Water Board provides funds through the State
Revolving Fund-Loan Program, the Agricultural Drainage Loan Program, the
Agricultural Drainage Management Loan Program, Proposition 13, 40, and 50
grant funding through the Nonpoint Source Pollution Control Programs and Watershed Protection Programs.

Current Projects and Actions by Other Agencies

The following projects may assist in meeting the southern Delta salinity objectives by reducing high salinity drainage to the San Joaquin River; improving circulation in the southern Delta; and supplementing flows through recirculation. All or a portion of these projects are being funded through the above referenced programs. Each of these projects, described below, should be pursued by the identified agencies. If successful, these projects and the actions they contain could make additional
regulatory measures by the State Water Board and the Central Valley Regional Water Board unnecessary.

Grasslands Bypass Project: The Grasslands Bypass Project manages
discharges of agricultural drainage water from 97,000 acres in the Grasslands
Watershed. The purpose of the project is to prevent discharges of water containing high levels of selenium to wildlife refuges and wetlands in the San
Joaquin Valley. Recent monitoring data shows that from 1995-2015 the
discharge of salts was reduced by 83% compared to, but it-has reduced the
load-of salts by 39-persent-(from 187,300 tens te 113,600 tons) from pre-
project conditions through various management measures including sump
management, recycled tail and tile water programs, on-farm tile and tail water management, and various source control measures. The Grassland Areas
farmers, USBR, the Central Valley Regional Water Board, and other agencies should continue to evaluate the various management measures in the Grasslands Bypass Project and should continue to implement those measures that are effective in reducing salinity and selenium discharges to the San Joaquin River to meet the goal of zero discharges to the San Joaquin
River from the Grasslands area by 2019.

ii. West Side Regional Drainage Plan: The West Side Regional Drainage Plan evolved from the Grasslands Bypass Project as a long-term solution to eliminate discharges to the San Joaquin River of drainage water from
irrigated agriculture containing high amounts of selenium, salt and other
constituents. The plan uses the following practices: a) Reduction of drainage volumes by using source control/efficient water management techniques such as replacing furrow irrigation with micro- irrigation technology and lining unlined delivery canals;
b) Recirculation of tailwater on primary irrigation lands;
c) Collection and reuse of tile drainage water on halophytic croplands to
concentrate drainage; d) Installation and pumping of groundwater wells in strategic locations to eliminate groundwater infiltration into tile drains; and

bAFME we Treatment and disposal of remaining drainage water through reverse osmosis, evaporation and disposal or reuse of salts.
When fully implemented, the parties implementing the plan expect to assure
achievement of the salinity objectives at Vernalis and reduce the frequency of
exceedances of the salinity objectives at Brandt Bridge by 71 percent over a

51
110

73-year hydrology. They expect to-complete the plan-by 2010. -Stakeholder
parties to the Westside Regional Drainage Plan should continue work to
implement the various practices discussed above to achieve the goal of zero discharges to the San Joaquin River from the Grasslands area by 20102019.

iii. San Luis Unit Feature Reevaluation Project: USBR eurrently is evaluatinged seven alternatives as part of the San Luis Unit Feature Reevaluation Project - - to provide drainage service to the San Luis Unit of the CVP. This project
would reduce discharges to the San Joaquin River and sustain long-term
agricultural production on drainage-impacted lands. The alternatives under
consideratiened included: on-farm, in-district drainage reduction actions; federal facilities to collect and convey drain water to regional reuse facilities; and some level of land retirement. Additional options under considerationed included options for in-valley disposal of drain water, ocean disposal, and Delta disposal. USBR's preferred alternative is an in-valley/land retirement alternative, and wouldthat involves treatment of drain water through reverse osmosis and selenium biotreatment before disposal in evaporation basins. USBR expects implementation to help reduce saline discharges to the lower San Joaquin River. A desalination demonstration project is currently being
implemented as part of this effort.

iv. •Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) Land Retirement Program: USBR and Westland's Water District are implementing land retirement projects under the CVPIA Land Retirement Program and under settlement agreements in drainage-impacted areas of the San Luis Unit of the Joaquin Valley. The prejests will reduee the volume-of subsurface drain-water discharged to the San Joaquin River.

V. San Joaquin River Real-time Water Quality Salinity Management Program:
The San Joaquin River Real-time Water Quality Salinity Management Program is a projeet-bypartnership effort between agricultural dischargers
within the Lower San Joaquin River Basin, DWR, USBR, USFWS and United

--1ond% 9 States Geological Survey (USGS) that uses telemetered stream stage and salinity data and computer models to simulate and forecast water quality conditions along the lower San Joaquin River. The main objective of the
project is to control and time the releases of wetland and agricultural drainage to coincide with periods when dilution flow is sufficient to meet the Vernalis
salinity objectives. The Central Valley Regional Water Board adopted a
resolution in 2014 approving the proposed framework to establish the
program (R5-2014-0151). The framework document describes completed
pilot studies that establish the feasibility of the program and describes the
steps to be taken to implement the program.

DWR, DFG, University-of Califernia Davis (UC Davis), and other parties are
undertaking varieus projects-to determine whether there are wetlands
management-praetices-that can improve-water quality in the San-Joaquin

52
111

River and conditions for wildlife. Wetlands discharges may account-for-more
than nine-pereent of the tetal salt-load in the San Joaquin River at Vernalis. The research is-focused on coordinating the release of high salinity wetlands discharges-to the river at times when assimilative capacity is available. DFG, USFWS, and USBR-in-coordination with CALFED, DWR, UC Davis, and
other appropriate-parties should diligently pursue completion of research-te determine-opportunities-for improving wetlands management for the benefit-of wildlife and water quality. Any cest effective and reasonable oppertunities-te improve water quality through improved wetlands management-witheut
adversely impacting fish and wildlife should be implemented as soon as
practicable.

vi. South Delta Improvements Program: DWR and USBR propose to construct
permanent tidal gates in the southern Delta as part of the South Delta
.Improvements. Program (SDIP) to replace the temporary barriers that are
currently constructed on an annual basis. DWR and USBR expect that the gates project will assist in achieving the salinity objectives at the two Old River compliance measurement locations by improving water circulation in the southern Delta. Due to concern regarding the impact the gates project
may have on migratory fish, additional studies are being conducted prior to
the re-initiation of consultation for Endangered Species Act permits required
for this project. Consequently, implementation of this project has been
postponed indefinitely.
..Gurrently, DWR-and USBR-expeet the-project-to be operational in-the-spring-f
2009.

Delta-Mendeta Canal Recirculation: Several agencies and water distriets are
considering-releasing water from the Delta-Mendota Ganal to the San
Jeaquin River to meet water quality ebjectives at Vernalis. Water Right D-
1641 requires USBR-to-condi such a study. However, other ageneies including DWR-have also-been invelved in assessing this-alternative. USBR in-eoerdination-with other ageneies should complete the reeireulation
analyses and assess the feasibility-of using-recirculation-te meet southern
Delta-salinity-objectives. If recirculation is cost effective and dees not have significant unaveidable impaets towater quality, fish and wildlife, water supplies, and other beneficial uses-ef water, USBR and/er other agencies
should-implement a recireulation-project to-meet and/or supplement the southern-Delta-salinity objeetives.

Recommended Projects, Studies, and Actiens:

The fellewing recommended prejeets, studies, and aetions will previde
information that can-be used during-subsequent updates-of the Water Quality Contrel Plan and water rights preceedings to implement the-Plan:

53
112

i. Central Valley Salinity Committee and Salinity Study Task Force: At a
January-of 2006 joint workshop, the State Water Board and Central Valley Regional Water Beard established a Salinity Committee to address salinity issues in-the Central Valley. The Committee will establish a Salinity Study Task-Force to-evaluate the impact of salinity on water reseurces and develop a viable salinity management-plan; spensor a fellow-up joint State Water Beard/Regienal Water Board salinity workshop to receive-comments-on the salinity management-plan; conduet meetings te gather additional-publie-input; contraet for preparation-of ar mic study of salinity impacts and the
social and economic consequenses-of net implementing a viable salinity management-pregram; and sponser a-conference-that-will-highlight the-major salinity-related issues and their statewide impaets.

ii. Southern Delta Salinity Objeetives: There is a need-for an updated .independent seientifie investigation of irrigation salinity needs in the-southern Delta (similar to the investigation on which the current-ebjectives are based) The-seientifie investigation-should address whether the agrieultural-beneficial uses in the southern-Delta would be reasenably protected at different salinity
levels, whether-management-practices are available that would allew for
proteetien-of the beneficial uses at a higher salinity-level in the-channels-of the southern Delta, and whether such management practices are technically
and finaneially feasible. The investigation could address the feasibility ef providing an alternative method of delivering fresh water to agrieultural water users in the southern-Delta. The seientifie-investigation-must-be specific-te the southern Delta. The State Water Board will conduet a workshop te
diseuss-this subject in January 2007.

2. San Joaquin River Dissolved Oxygen Objective
D-1641 directs the Central Valley Regional Water Board to establish a TMDL to a address the dissolved oxygen (DO) impairment in the San Joaquin River. In November of 2005, the State Water Board approved an Amendment to the Water
Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River Basins. The
amendment, approved by the ffice of Administrative Law in August 2006, consists of a Control Program for Factors Contributing to the DO impairment in the Stockton Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) and other actions to implement DO objectives in
the DWSC portion of the San Joaquin River. The DO basin plan amendment includes implementation measures and a timeline for implementation for both the 1995 Plan DO objective and the DO objective in the Water Quality Control Plan for the Sacramento River Basin and the San Joaquin River Basin.

The Central Valley Regional Water Board should continue to implement the recently
adopted DO TMDL. Further, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USCOE) and other agencies and parties that contribute to the DO impairment should complete the measures recommended by the Central Valley Regional Water Board in the basin plan amendment. In addition, the responsible entities should complete their investigations into the feasibility of operating an aeration facility in the Stockton

54
113

DWSC to assist in achieving the objectives. If the pilot project and other information demonstrates that permanent installation and operation of aeration devices is
feasible and would not have immitigable adverse impacts on fish, wildlife, water
quality and other-resources, DWR, CALFED, and the other implementing agencies
should pursue operation of such a facility with operating assistance from the State Water Contractors (SWC), the Port of Stockton, San Luis Delta-Mendota Water Authority (SLDMWA), the San Joaquin River Group Authority-(SJRGA), and other appropriate agencies.
DWR and USBR should continue to expeditiously pursue installation of a permanent operable gate (barrier) at the head of Old River or equivalent measures to assist in achieving the DO objective.

3. Narrative Objective for Salmon Protection D-1641 assigned responsibility to the USBR and DWR to comply with the river flow and operational objectives for fish and wildlife. These objectives help protect salmon migration through the Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1641 did not require separate
actions to implement the narrative objective for salmon because the State Water Board expects that implementation of the numeric flow-dependent objectives and other non-flow measures will implement this objective.

The narrative objective for salmon protection in the Delta is consistent with the
anadromous fish doubling goals of the CVPIA. Under the Anadromous Fish Restoration Program (AFRP), State, federal and local entities are continuing to
implement programs within and outside the Delta geared towards achieving the
CVPIA anadromous fish doubling goals.
The State Water Board intends to invite DFG, NOAA Fisheries, and other agencies
monitoring the progress of the salmon doubling effort to present to the Board the results from ongoing studies, fishery improvement programs, and any recommendations for a specific numeric objective at subsequent workshops every two years starting from the date of the adoption of this Plan. The State Water Board will consider monitoring results when determining whether numeric objectives either
should replace or augment the narrative objective. The Board may use the information it receives to modify the objective in future proceedings.

Actions by parties other than the State Water Board are required to implement the
narrative objective for salmon protection if implementation of the flow-dependent objectives does not achieve the objective. Other agencies are implementing the following actions. These actions not only benefit the salmonids while they are in the
Estuary, but also help improve habitat for other species.
•Through the CVPIA, Section 3406 (b) 21, Anadromous Fish Screen Program, the USBR, USFWS, and other participating agencies should continue to work
towards the implementation of new screening facilities on diversions in the Bay-Delta Estuary to reduce losses of fish in all life stages to unscreened

55
114

water diversions. In evaluating Delta diversions, these agencies should: (1) decide where screens are needed; (2) consider whether diversion points should be relocated or consolidated; and (3) provide their recommendations on changes in points of diversion to the State Water Board for consideration in a water rights proceeding.

ii. The DWR and the USBR, in consultation with the DFG, USFWS, and NOAA
Fisheries, should continue to evaluate and implement all feasible measures and programs to reduce entrainment and mortality of fish salvaged at the Skinner Fish Protection Facility (Banks Pumping Plant) and the Tracy Fish
Collection Facility (Tracy Pumping Plant). These measures should include:
(1) monitoring entrainment on a real-time basis to identify periods of peak susceptibility of various species; (2) coordinating operations of the two diversions, including interchangeable pumping, to reduce combined losses; (3) increasing screening efficiency; (4) improving fish salvage and handling; and (5) controlling predators at the SWP and CVP intakes.
4. Narrative Objective for Brackish Tidal Marshes of Suisun Bay In the 1995 Plan, the State Water Board recommended that DWR convene a Suisun
Marsh Ecological Work group (SEW) consisting of representatives from various
State, federal and private agencies and other interested parties. The SEW was
assigned eight tasks, one of which was to determine a numeric objective to replace the narrative objective for tidal brackish marshes of Suisun Bay. However, the SEW was unable to determine a single numeric objective for the tidal marshes. In 2001 the Suisun-Marsh Charter Group (SMCG16) was formed to develop a plan to balance the competing needs in Suisun Marsh. The SMCG is currently preparing a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (PEIS/EIR) for the Habitat Management, Preservation, and Restoration Plan for the
Suisun Marsh-(Suisun Marsh Plan). In the preparation of the Suisun Marsh Plan, the principal Suisun Marsh agencies are evaluating Plan alternatives with a tidal wetland habitat restoration component ranging from 3,000 to 36,000 acres.
State Water Board staff will use the results of the final PEIS/EIR and the resulting Suisun Marsh Plan during the next Water Quality Control Plan update to determine whether and how to convert the narrative objective to a numeric objective for the Brackish Tidal Marshes.

5. Numeric Objectives for Suisun Marsh State Water Board staff will use the results of the final PEIS/EIR and the resulting
Suisun Marsh Plan currently being prepared by the Suisun Marsh Charter Group (SMCG), to determine in a future plan amendment whether the objectives at stations
S-97 and S-35 should be amended or deleted. The objectives at stations S-97 and
S-35 may be amended and/or implemented in stages, as appropriate, and shall be

16 The SMCG Principle Agencies include Suisun Resource Conservation District, DFG, DWR, USBR, CBDA, NMFS and USFWS.

56
115

implemented no later than either January 1, 2015, or an earlier date, if a further
review of these objectives does not determine that they are not needed.

The objectives for water supply intakes for waterfowl management areas on Van Sickle and Chipps islands, which have no locations specified, may be amended and/or implemented in stages, and shall be implemented no later than January 1, 2015 if a further review of these objectives does not determine that they are not needed. Other measures to control Suisun Marsh soil and channel water salinities
are discussed in section C9.

C. Recommendations to Other Agencies
Consistent with the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, this Water Quality Control Plan identifies control actions recommended for implementation by agencies
other than the State Water Board. Actions are recommended both for the
attainment of water quality objectives and to obtain additional information on the
effects of flow and water quality on beneficial uses.

Numerous actions can be taken, in addition to establishing and implementing water quality objectives for the Bay-Delta Estuary, to improve fish and wildlife beneficial uses in the Estuary. These actions involve improvements to habitat conditions both
inside and outside of the Estuary, many of which are under the authorities of other agencies, as well as studies needed to better understand the effects of flow and water quality on beneficial uses.
There is an ongoing effort by State agencies, the federal government, and
agricultural, urban, and environmental interests to identify, fund, and implement, as
warranted, measures to address the broader non-flow-related range of factors
potentially affecting water quality and habitat in the Bay-Delta Estuary. Potential
measures under consideration by these entities include those that would be implemented outside of the Estuary itself. These efforts, in connection with the other measures to implement the objectives in this plan, are among the ongoing programs to provide better protection for the beneficial uses that depend on the Bay-Delta
Estuary.

The State Water Board will use its authority, as needed and appropriate, under section 13165 of the California Water Code to require that the following actions and studies be conducted.

1. Review and modify, if necessary, existing commercial and sport fishing
regulations Current levels of sport and commercial fishing may be contributing to reduced fish
populations in the Bay-Delta Estuary. Since the implementation of the 1995 Plan, the Fish and Game Commission was granted authority over all state managed bottom trawl fisheries not managed under a federal fishery management plan or. state fishery management plan. (Fish & Game Code, § 8841.) This authority

57
116

ensures the sustainable management of resources, protects the health of ecosystems, and assists in the orderly transition to sustainable gear types when bottom trawling is incompatible with these goals.

The DFG, California Fish and Game Commission, Pacific Fisheries Management
Council, and NOAA Fisheries should take the following actions within their
respective authorities: (1) develop and implement a fisheries management program to provide short-term protection for aquatic species of concern through seasonal and area closures, gear restrictions to reduce capture and mortality of sub-legal fish, and other appropriate means; and (2) review immediately, and then at least every two years, and modify, if necessary, existing harvest regulations to ensure that they adequately protect aquatic species.

2. Reduce illegal harvesting Illegal harvesting has a certain but un-quantified impact on fisheries of the Bay-Delta Estuary. The DWR and the DFG should expand the current illegal harvest
enforcement program. Additionally, the DFG should continue to develop and
implement educational programs to curb poaching of fishery resources.
3. Reduce the impacts of introduced species on native species in the Estuary The intentional and accidental introduction of non-native species has caused major changes in the composition of aquatic resources in the Bay-Delta Estuary; however, the exact impacts of existing introduced species on native species in the Estuary are not clear. The impact of introduced species is being investigated as a potential cause of the POD. The results of the ongoing POD studies may provide insight into the reasons for the decline, and provide the scientific basis for actions that can be
taken to reverse the trend.

Until the results from the POD studies are made available, other programs are being
implemented by other agencies to lessen the propagation of invasive species. The National Invasive Species Act of 1996 established various programs intended to decrease the propagation of invasive species into waters of the U.S. and to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species. These programs include the Ballast Water Management Demonstration Program and the Aquatic Nuisance Species Program and allows for State Invasive Species Management Plans to be created independent of federal action. Under the National invasive Species Act of 1996, the DFG, USFWS, and NOAA Fisheries should continue to pursue programs to determine the impacts of introduced species, including striped bass, on the native aquatic
resources of the Estuary, and the potential benefits of control measures. The DFG should also continue its efforts under the Fish and Game Code sections 6430-6439,
enacted in 1992, concerning introduced species. Additionally, the California Fish and Game Commission should deny all requests for the introduction of new aquatic
species into the watershed of the Bay-Delta Estuary unless it finds, based on strong, reliable evidence, that an introduction will not have deleterious effects on native
species.

58
117

4. Improve hatchery programs for species of concern Existing fish hatcheries are operated in order to provide mitigation for the loss of stream spawning and rearing habitat due to the construction of large dams. As noted by NOAA Fisheries in the Biological Opinion on the Long-Term Central Valley
Project and State Water Project Operations Criteria and Plan (OCAP), the viability of natural fish populations has been compromised due to the operation of hatcheries, as the hatchery fish are not isolated from the natural systems. Hatchery fish, while - increasing the abundance of fish numbers, often result in increased harvesting pressure on natural fish stocks. Additionally the hybridization between hatchery and natural fish stocks has caused deterioration of the natural population.
To assist in the management of natural fish stocks, Congress has mandated that all
federal and federally funded salmon and steelhead hatcheries implement a marking
program on the fish they release to visually distinguish between hatchery and
natural stock:-DFG, NOAA Fisheries, and USFWS should continue to: (1) carefully examine and periodically re-examine the role and contribution of existing hatchery production for various fish species (e.g., chinook salmon, steelhead trout), including a consideration of the need for genetic diversity and maintaining the integrity of different salmon runs and (2) evaluate strategies for improving the survival of
hatchery fish, before and after release, including diet and pre-release conditioning, selection of the life stage and size of fish to be released, timing releases relative to the presence or absence of other species, and using multiple release locations.
5. Expand the gravel replacement and maintenance programs for salmonid spawning habitat The presence of dams on the major tributaries of the Delta blocks the movement of
gravel eroding from upstream areas and causes fine sediments to infiltrate the remaining gravels. Reduction in the riverbed gravels required for salmonid spawning limits the success of chinook salmon and steelhead trout reproduction in the watershed of the Bay-Delta Estuary.
Under the AFRP, and other gravel replacement and maintenance programs, the DWR, the USBR, and other agencies that currently conduct gravel replacement and spawning habitat improvement programs on the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems should continue and, where possible, increase their efforts in the reaches where salmonids are likely to spawn.

6. Evaluate alternative water conveyance and storage facilities of the SWP
and CVP in the Delta
The current water diversion facilities of the CVP and the SWP in the southern Delta
adversely impact fish populations. These facilities or alternative facilities are needed to meet water supply demands in areas south and west of the Delta. - Various alternatives have been identified to minimize impacts to fish while meeting water supply demands. The proposed alternatives include construction of a water diversion intake on the Sacramento River equipped with state-of-the-art fish screens, isolated and through-Delta water conveyance facilities, and new water

59
118

storage facilities within and south of the Delta. The DWR and USBR should continue their efforts to develop alternative water conveyance and storage facilities in the Delta, and should evaluate these alternatives and their feasibility and take
action as necessary to minimize impacts to fish.
7. Develop an experimental study program on the effects of pulse flows on fish eggs and larvae in the Delta The magnitude of freshwater outflow passing through the Delta affects the geographic distribution of many planktonic fish eggs and larvae. The egg and larval stages of many fish species occur in the Delta during a relatively short period of time in the spring (April-June). When there is high freshwater outflow, the planktonic eggs and larvae are moved downstream into Suisun Bay where they are less susceptible to entrainment at the SWP and CVP diversions and at other diversion points within the Delta. Absent high freshwater flows, pulse flows can be used to move the eggs and larvae downstream into Suisun Bay. To improve the efficiency of water used for this purpose, it would be helpful to experimentally quantify the magnitude and duration of pulse flows needed to move a substantial proportion of fish eggs and larvae into Suisun Bay.

DWR and USBR should conduct experiments to investigate and evaluate the biological benefits of pulse flows to move planktonic fish eggs and larvae into Suisun Bay. These experiments, which should be conducted as soon as feasible, should: (1) include flows from both the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers; (2) include real-time biological monitoring to determine the most favorable times for the pulse flows and the effects of the pulse flows on the eggs and larvae; (3) determine whether short-term pulse flows have a lasting benefit or whether, when outflows are reduced after a pulse flow, the larval fish are drawn back into interior Delta areas; and (4) take into account base flows and availability of water supplies. The experiments should be designed so that they can be used to refine potential pulse flow requirements in the future.

8. Implement actions needed to restore and preserve marsh, riparian, and upland habitat in the Delta
Most of the historical fish and wildlife habitat in the Delta has been eliminated or
disturbed. In the Delta, less than 100,000 acres of the total 738,000 acres remains
as marsh, riparian, and upland habitat. The remainder of the area is highly altered due to conversion to agricultural land, industrial and urban development, and actions
for flood control and navigation, such as dredging channels and riprapping banks. Furthermore, many of the alterations that have already occurred require extensive ongoing maintenance, which also disrupts fish and wildlife habitat. Restoration of fish and wildlife habitat in the Delta would benefit many species of the Bay-Delta
Estuary.

State and federal agencies should require, to the extent of their authorities, habitat restoration in the Delta as a condition of approving projects. For example, the Delta Protection Commission, in all of its actions under the Delta Protection Act of 1992

60
119

(Pub. Resources Code § 29700 et seq.) that provide for the coordination of local land use decisions® in the Delta, should continue to implement and support programs such as the Delta Mercury TMDL Collaborative (AB 2901), the Lower Bypass
Collaborative/Management Plan and the Delta-wide Conservation Easement Concept. The DFG, when it considers approving stream alterations, and the DFG, USFWS, and NOAA Fisheries, when they consider projects that affect endangered species, should consider habitat requirements. The USCOE should consider habitat requirements in connection with applications for permits under Clean Water Act section 404. Within their authorities, these agencies should provide for: (1) levee
setback requirements; (2) reductions in the depth of selected Delta channels, by
using either dredge material from navigational channels or natural infill, to restore
more productive shallows and hoals; (3) conversion of low-lying Delta islands to
habitat areas; and (4) other habitat enhancement measures. The State Water Board
will consider habitat requirements where needed to meet water quality standards under the Clean Water Act when approving section 401 certifications.

9. Suisun Marsh soil and channel water salinity objectives
In addition to the formation of the SEW discussed above, the 1995 Plan
recommended three measures to be implemented to control Suisun Marsh soil and channel water salinities. The first measure, calling for continuation of the actions identified for implementation in the Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement (SMPA),
is included in the Revised Suisun Marsh Preservation Agreement executed on June
25, 2005. The Suisun Marsh Charter Group is evaluating two additional actions that
may be added to the SMPA in a future amendment. The second measure, calling for a study to determine the relationship between channel water salinity and soil water salinity under alternative management practices, was completed in 2001 by DWR as part of the Comprehensive Review of Suisun Marsh Monitoring Data, 1985- 1995. The third measure, requiring that DWR, USBR, DFG, and Suisun Resource Conservation District (SRCD), together with the property owners in Suisun Marsh, to employ a watermaster, has been accomplished through implementation of the Water Manager Program under the Revised SMPA.
In June of 2005, SRCD, DWR, USBR, and DFG signed the Revised SMPA. This agreement funded the Water Manager Program to help coordinate and improve
water management practices on individual private managed wetlands throughout the
Marsh. The duties of the Water Managers include:

promote and encourage wetland management activities, including flooding, draining and circulation, so that they occur at the appropriate critical times of the year to produce desired wildlife habitats.
provide technical support in the field to answer questions and educate landowners on beneficial management techniques.

61
120

protect and enhance endangered species habitat, manage water application, and provide new scientific information pertaining to common management
activities.

supervise and coordinate the portable pump program to ensure proper maintenance and operation of the pumps.

assist landowners in planning yearly maintenance and enhancement
projects.

additional activities may include assisting DFG on water management of State owned property, assisting in yearly salt marsh harvest mouse monitoring, California clapper rail surveys, and inspections of levees during
storms to identify damages and assist in flood fight coordination.

10. San Joaquin River Spring-Flow Objeetives-Non-Flow Actions
In addition to the recommendations in the preceding sections, the following recommendations apply specifically to the San Joaguin River. The recommendations are for non-flow actions that are complementary to the LSJR flow
objectives for the protection of fish and wildlife. These recommended actions,
together with the coordinated monitoring and adaptive implementation of the LSJR
flow objectives, are expected to improve habitat conditions that benefit native fish
and wildlife, or are expected to improve related science and management within the
LSJR watershed.

Additionally, educational outreach programs should be developed and conducted
with interested stakeholders or watershed groups to promote collaborative
development, funding; and implementation of habitat enhancement and protection
projects, and to promote resource stewardship among stakeholders. In many cases.
the recommended actions will require authorizations by the appropriate agencies,
which should consider this Plan when acting on them.
.: Restore, Enhance, and Protect Floodplain and Riparian Habitat: The USCOE,
USBR, DFW, USFWS, FERC licensees, water districts, local landowners,
and other appropriate entities should undertake, participate in, fund or
authorize riparian and floodplain habitat corridor restoration, enhancement
and protection actions along the LSJR and its tributaries, including but not
limited to the following:

a) Obtain easements or acquire land for riparian and floodplain habitat
restoration.
b) Reduce salmon stranding events in ponds, pits, and other unnatural
features by physically modifying problem areas within river corridors.
Facilitate the establishment and maintenance of self-sustaining native
riparian and floodplain vegetation.

62
121

d) Restore, enhance, and protect secondary/side-channel habitats to
increase habitat diversity and function within the Stanislaus, Tuolumne,
and Merced Rivers.
e Import silt or fine sediment onto floodplain restoration projects to
improve soil moisture properties and encourage riparian vegetation
success.
Identify locations in the LSJR and its tributaries that are appropriate for
levee modification (e.g. rip-rap removal and levee set back or
removal) for the purpose of improving native fish and wildlife habitat.
ii. Reduce Vegetation Disturbing Activities in Floodplains and Floodways,
Where Safe and Appropriate: The NMFS, DFW, USFWS. Central Valley
Flood Protection Board, USACE, local landowners, county governments,
local agricultural commissions and other land management agencies in the
LSJR, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced River watersheds should reduce
grazing, mowing, cutting, spraying, discing and other vegetation disturbing
activities in floodplains and floodways, where safe and appropriate, to
promote and restore these areas with riparian vegetation. Actions include but
are not limited to the following:

a) Develop grazing strategies that protect and improve streamside
vegetation, and that minimize bank disturbance.
b) Conduct outreach to inform landowners of state and federal laws an
requlations that protect riparian, wetland, and Endangered Species Act
(state and federal) protected vegetation.
C) Review and potentially modify existing floodplain, floodway, and
riparian vegetation management plans, or develop new ones using the
best available science, to balance the needs of the ecosystem and the
needs of public safety and other considerations.
d) Compile data, conduct studies, and review literature to determine the
influence that large trees and other vegetation types have on levee
and floodway safety, and use this information to make science based
management decisions.
iii. Provide and Maintain Coarse Sediment for Salmonid Spawning and Rearing:
DWR, USBR, DFW, USFS, NMFS, FERC, FERC licensees and other entities
performing or otherwise participating in habitat restoration, enhancement and
protection projects should provide and maintain an adequate supply of coarse
sediment for salmonid spawning and rearing habitat. In addition, entities that
can control contributions of fine sediment in the Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and
Merced River watersheds should reduce the input of fine sediment in
spawning areas. These actions, include but are not limited to the following:

a) Develop and maintain coarse sediment management plans for the
-major LSJR tributaries that consist of two temporal stages: (1) short-
term restoration and gravel augmentation to re-build spawning habitat
and to restore functional processes important to native fish and wildlife;
and (2) long-term course sediment augmentation program to maintain

63
122

the functioning of the restored habitat and to compensate for the
blockage, by dams, of the natural gravel supply.
b) Develop and implement erosion control measures including the
construction of sediment retention basins within the Stanislaus,
Tuolumne, and Merced River watersheds.
C Identify and remediate unpaved roads or other disturbed areas that
may be contributing to fine sediment input.
iv. Enhance In-Channel Complexity: The DFW, USFWS, NMFS, FERC, FERC
licensees, conservation groups, water districts and other appropriate entities
should enhance in-channel complexity within the LSJR tributaries by adding instream structures, including but not limited to the following:

a) Add boulders, large woody debris, or other structures where
appropriate in river channels, taking human safety into consideration.
b) If large woody debris or coarse sediment is removed from upstream
reservoirs, it should be transported downstream and placed into the
Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers due to that reservoir's
contribution to deficits of large woody debris and coarse sediment
supply in these rivers.

V. Improve Reservoir Operations and/or Physical Structures to Maintain
Adequate Water Temperature Conditions: The USBR, NMFS, USFWS,
DFW, FERC, FERC licensees, dam owners or operators, and others, should
evaluate and implement temperature control solutions, including but not
limited to the following:

a) Cold water pool management.
b) Installation or modification of selective withdrawal structures (e.g.
temperature control curtains or shutters).

vi. Expand Fish Screening: The DFW, NMFS, USFWS, water districts, local
landowners, and others should evaluate unscreened diversions on the
Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Merced Rivers and the LSJR for their potential to
cause mortality to migrating salmonids and implement fish screening
solutions where appropriate and effective.

vii. Improve Fish Passage Above Dams: The USBR, NMFS, USFWS, DFW,
FERC, FERC licensees, dam owners or operators, and others, should
evaluate and implement fish passage solutions to all human-made barriers
which block native fishes from accessing important habitats, including but not
limited to the following:

a) Near-term actions assessing habitat suitability upstream of dams,
investigating fish passage options and developing plans for long-term
reintroductions of salmonids upstream of existing dams.

64
123

b) Provide fish passage at existing dams which block or impede native
fish movements.
viii. Improve Fish and Water Barrier Programs: The USBR, DWR, DFW,
USFWS, and NMFS should develop and implement improvements to fish and
water barrier programs within the Delta, including but not limited to the
following:

a) Research, monitor, and report the effects of physical and non-physical
barriers within the delta on water quality and fish.
b) Develop and evaluate physical and non-physical barrier designs to maximize their effectiveness in reducing adverse impacts on native
fish and wildlife and their habitat.

ix. Reduce Predation and Competition by Non-Native Fish: The DFW, NMFW.
USFWS, FERC, FERC licensees, local water districts, conservation groups,
landowners,; water users and other appropriate entities should reduce impacts
that non-native predators and competitors have on native fish and modify
habitats which currently favor non-native fish over native fish in the LSJR and its
tributaries to favor native fish. Actions include but are not limited to the following:

a) Study and report the effects that predators and non-native fish have on
native fish.
b) Identify gravel pits, scour pools, ponds, weirs, diversion dams, and
other structures or areas that harbor significant numbers of non-native
fish and predatory fish that may currently reduce native fish survival.
C Modify priority structures and areas to reduce predation and non-native
fish effects and to improve native fish success.
d) Evaluate and implement changes to fishing regulations to reduce the
impact that non-native competitor and predator fish have on native
fish.

X. Reduce Invasive Species: The NMFS, DFW, USFWS, USBR, United States
Department of Agriculture, California Department of Food and Agriculture, the
State Lands Commission, the California Fish and Game Commission, the
California State Parks Division of Boating and Waterways, local agencies in
LSJR Tributaries' watersheds, and other appropriate entities should reduce the
impacts aquatic invasive species (plants and animals) have on native fish and
wildlife of the Bay-Delta watershed. Actions include but are not limited to the
following:

a Fund and launch prevention, early detection, and rapid response
actions, including efforts to coordinate various aquatic invasive species
monitoring programs and expand monitoring of freshwater systems.
b) Evaluate and implement appropriate actions to minimize the effects of
aquatic invasive species on native fishes in the Bay-Delta watershed.

65
124

C) Monitor and regulate the importation of aguatic invasive species to
minimize the effects of such species on native fishes in the Bay-Delta
watershed.
d)- Conduct a statewide assessment of the risk from various aquatic
invasive species vectors.
e) Support public education preventing the introduction of aquatic
invasive species, including promoting the use of native and
noninvasive alternatives.

The DFG, USFWS, and NOAA-Fisheries, in coordination with the IEP and other
interested-parties, should compile information and conduct specifie-studies-te determine whether and what changes should-be made te the Spring Flow Objectives te protect San Joaquin River chineok-salmon and steelhead, pelagie-organisms (see the POD seetien for additional information-concerning-these-studies) and oth applicable fish and wildlife-species.

11. San Joaquin River Pulse Flow Objectives-Restoration Program
The historic operation of the Friant Dam resulted in significant portions of the main
stem of the San Joaquin River between Friant Dam and the confluence of the
Merced River being dry. In 2006, in response to litigation over those impacts, the
Department of Interior, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Friant
Division long-term contractors reached a settlement to restore and maintain fish in
"good condition" from below Friant Dam to the confluence of the Merced River,
including naturally-reproducing and self-sustaining populations of salmon and other fish. In addition, the parties to the settlement agreed to reduce or avoid adverse
water supply impacts to the Friant Division long-term contractors that could result
from the implementation of interim and restoration flows. The settlement also
acknowledged the potential for significant public benefits beyond its restoration and
management goals including water quality benefits downstream of the Merced River.

The DFW. USBR, NMFS, and USFWS in coordination with the IEP, STM Working
Group, and other interested parties should evaluate San Joaquin River Restoration
Program flow contributions to flow and water quality requirements at Vernalis. The
State Water Board may consider water quality objectives for the stream system
above the San Joaquin River's confluence with the Merced River in future updates
to this Plan.

could undertake its own-proceeding to make-changes to water rights, the ebjectives, andfor the pregram of implementation-for the ebjectives.
D. Monitoring and Special Studies Program

This Plan requires, and the permits and license of the DWR and the USBR include conditions for, a monitoring program to provide baseline information and determine compliance with water quality objectives. This Plan also requires, and the permits of DWR and USBR include conditions for, special studies that will (1) evaluate the response of the aquatic habitat and organisms to the objectives; and (2) increase understanding of the large-scale characteristics and functions of the Estuary ecosystem to better predict system-wide responses to management options.
The monitoring and special studies program, also known as the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) is predicated on the ongoing monitoring efforts of the IEP. IEP member agencies include the State Water Board, DFG, USGS, NOAA Fisheries, USCOE, USEPA, DWR, and the USBR. The program is coordinated with the CBDA and UC Davis to minimize duplication and facilitate the exchange of data.

Table 4 of the 1995 Plan (now Table 7), established a preliminary compliance and baseline monitoring program. Condition 11 (e) on page 149 of D-1641 required the DWR and the USBR to complete an assessment of the EMP every three years to evaluate whether the goals of the monitoring program were being attained. This review was completed in 2003 and based on the conclusions of the review, several changes to the EMP were proposed that were considered to be functionally equivalent to the existing program. IEP participants developed a more appropriate compliance and baseline monitoring program. The new program contains
Geographic Information System (GIS) coordinates for each monitoring and baseline station. In addition the modifications will: 1) enhance continuous monitoring at key locations to better measure the temporal variability in the system; 2) enhance

47. The State Water Board could then determine whether changes would alse-be needed te the-Plan
and undertake-proceedings-to make any necessary changes.

67
126

shallow water monitoring to better measure the spatial variability in the system; 3) reduce the tidal spring-neap bias that occurs in the current program; 4) improve the quality assurance and quality control of the program by providing continuous monitoring data that can be used as crosschecks against discrete or periodic sampling data; and 5) improve employee safety.
Prior to the release of the 1995 Plan, the IEP had been conducting a special studies program including the 20mm delta smelt survey and the juvenile salmon and delta
fishes abundance and distribution sampling. These studies emphasize understanding the ecological responses of species of special concern to water project operations resulting from implementation of this Plan. Other ongoing studies, such as the Bay shrimp and crab abundance and distribution sampling, and the Bay salinity monitoring, enhance knowledge of how the Estuary responds to factors other than the operational impacts of water development facilities.
Since the release of the 1995 Plan, various State and federal agencies and interested parties developed a near-real-time monitoring program managed by the Water Operations Management Team (WOMT) to assist the CALFED Ops group acting pursuant to the Principles for Agreement. The State and federal agencies should continue to conduct a process like the CALFED Ops process to ensure that the SWP and CVP operations developed to comply with the Plan are as efficient as possible.

All stations with compliance monitoring component are identified by historical "interagency" station numbers as given in State Water Board D-1641 (2000) and Water Right Decision 1485 (1978). Modified station ID numbers (e.g. C3A) identify baseline stations near historical
stations.
2 All stations with a compliance monitoring component retain their historical "interagency" station descriptions as given in State Water Board

3 D-1641 (2000) and D-1485 (1978). Baseline stations with modified station ID numbers (e.g. C3A) have modified station descriptions. Coordinates are geographic North American Datum 1983 and have been verified to be accurate for 1:24,000 scale mapping. Continuous recording (every 15 minutes) of water temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), and/or dissolved oxygen. For municipal and

5 industrial intake chloride objectives, EC can | monitored and converted to chloride concentration. Continuous, multi-parameter monitoring (recording every 1 to 15 minutes with telemetry capabilities) includes the following variables: water .temperature, EC, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chlorophyll a fluorescence, tidal elevation, and meteorological data (air temperature, wind

6 speed and direction, solar radiation). Discrete physical/chemical monitoring is conducted on a year-round, near-monthly basis that alternates between spring and neap tides and
includes the following variables: macronutrients (inorganic forms of nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon), total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, total particulate and dissolved organic nitrogen and carbon, chlorophyll a, pH, dissolved DO, EC (specific conductance), turbidity, secchi depth, and water temperature. In addition, on-board continuous recording is conducted intermittently for the following variables: water
temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. 7 Discrete sampling for phytoplankton enumeration or algai pigment analysis is conducted on a year-round, near-monthly basis that alternates between spring and neap tides.
8 Tow or pump sampling for zooplankton, mysids, and amphipods is conducted on a year-round, near-monthly basis that alternates between spring and neap tides.. In water years 2004 and 2005, replicated benthos and sediment grab samples are taken quarterly (every three months) and during special studies; more frequent monitoring sampling resumes in water year 2006.

The following studies are currently in progress and are being completed by other agencies independent of State Water Board action. Upon completion, the State Water Board may use the information provided by these studies to amend portions of this Plan.

1. Delta Cross Channel Gate
In the fall of 2000, the CALFED Bay Delta Program and the IEP began investigating the costs and benefits associated with re-operating the Delta Cross Channel (DCC)
gate to address water quality and fisheries concerns. These studies have been
delayed due to lack.of funding and staffing problems. When completed, the Board
expects the CALFED Bay Delta Program multidisciplinary studies to address the
multi-purpose aspects of DCC gate operation (balancing the beneficial uses of fisheries, water quality, water supply and flood control), and provide evidence for
future amendments to the DCC objective.

2. Potential New Municipal and Industrial Objectives Further understanding of the chemical reactions which form disinfection by-products (DBPs) is required before water quality objectives for bromides and organic carbon can be set. However, USEPA may require compliance with new federal drinking water standards as soon as 2012. The preferred methods for developing this information are collaborative processes such as the CALFED Drinking Water Quality
Program (DWQP), which includes the Central Valley Drinking Water Policy. DWR,
CALFED, and the Central Valley Regional Water Board are planning to complete development of the Central Valley Drinking Water Policy by 2009. This work may include development of bromide objectives and other constituents for the Central
Valley Drinking Water Policy. After the Drinking Water Policy is completed, the
State Water Board may convene a workshop to receive comments as to whether
there is a need for objectives in the Bay-Delta Plan for bromides and organic carbon.

3. Pelagic Organism Decline The IEP formed a POD work team to evaluate the potential causes of the marked declines in numerous pelagic fishes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary and Suisun Bay. This multi-agency effort has produced a work plan that provides an
overview of the problem, and a description of the studies used to examine some of
the suspected causes of the decline.

In order to better understand the results of the POD studies, the IEP has created a conceptual model of the decline. The model is based on three general factors that may be acting individually or in concert to lower pelagic productivity. The three main suspected factors are: toxins, invasive species and water project operations. The POD studies were designed to provide insight into the reasons for the decline and to
set the scientific basis for future work, with the eventual goal of narrowing down the
causes of the decline and determining what actions can be taken to reverse the
trend. The proposed studies represent an interdisciplinary, multi-agency effort including staff from DFG, DWR, USBR, USEPA, USGS, CBDA, San Francisco State University and UC Davis. The proposed work falls into three general types: (1) an expansion of existing monitoring (five expanded surveys); (2) ongoing studies
(19 studies); and (3) new studies (15 studies).
The program will be run by the existing IEP Pelagic Organisms Decline Project Work Team to develop, direct, review and analyze the results of the effort. The program will yield a range of products and deliverables including management briefs, publications and reports, web-based monitoring data, and presentations at conferences, workshops and meetings.

In February 2006, the CBDA provided an independent review of the initial results of
the 2005 IEP POD Workplan and the 2005 IEP POD Synthesis Report entitled
Review Panel Report: San Francisco Estuary Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
Interagency Ecological Program on Pelagic Organism Decline. The report provides perspectives on data synthesis presented and makes recommendations for

improvements in analyzing, interpreting and defining appropriate context for future
IEP POD-oriented investigations.

The expected completion date for the POD studies is 2007. Once the study results have been compiled; the State Water Board will ask the IEP to make a presentation of findings to the State Water Board at a subsequent workshop. Study results will
be considered in the ongoing Plan review, and may be used to determine whether
changes should be made to existing Water Quality Objectives, i.e. adding flexibility to the Delta Outflow Objective or the Delta Export Limits Objective. After the initial presentation to the State Water Board, the IEP shall give the State Water Board updates of current studies and new findings at subsequent workshops on an annual basis. The IEP presentations to the State Water Board shall continue until the next review of this Plan. The information collected by the State Water Board may be used to modify the water quality objectives in this Plan in the future.

4. Suisun Marsh
In 2001, the SMCG was formed to resolve issues of amending the SMPA, obtain a
Regional General Permit, implement the Suisun Marsh Levee Program, and recover endangered species. The broader purpose of the SMCG is to develop and agree on a long-term implementation plan. The SMCG principal agencies are USFWS, USBR, DFG, DWR, Suisun Resource Conservation District, and NOAA Fisheries.
The proposed Suisun Marsh Plan would be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Resources Agency's Bay-Delta Program, and would balance them with the SMPA, federal and State Endangered Species Acts and other management and restoration programs within the Suisun Marsh in a manner responsive to the concerns of all stakeholders and based upon voluntary participation of private landowners. In March 2006, the Plan was undergoing California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)/National Environmental Policy Act review. The final CEQA document will be released in December 2008. The State Water Board will use the
final Suisun Marsh Plan and the analysis in the final CEQA document in its next
periodic review to determine what amendments, if any, to make to Suisun Marsh soil
and channel water salinity objectives, and the narrative objective for brackish tidal
marshes of Suisun Bay.
