FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT -

1 (hereafter, "the Project"), to enforce the Zoning and Planning Law, the California Environmental

2 Quality Act ("CEQA"), the County's Hillside Management Areas Ordinance, the prohibition on

3 gifts of and waste of public funds, and the public trust doctrine. Petitioners allege:

INTRODUCTION
5
1.
6 This action challenges the approval by the Board of Supervisors of the County of

7 Los Angeles, with associated CEQA and planning documents, of the NorthLake Specific Plan

8 Project ("the Project"). The Project would involve the residential development of 3150 housing

9 units on 1,330 acres of sensitive land with several unique biological resources, in contravention

10 of CEQA, the State Zoning and Planning Law, and the County's own Hillside Management
Areas ("HMA") Ordinance.

2.
12 Petitioners seek to set aside these approvals:

a.
13 The Board of Supervisors' denial of GSEJA's, the Santa Monica Mountains

14 Conservancy's, and the Center for Biological Diversity's appeals in connection with the Project,

b.
15 The Board of Supervisors' approval of County Project No. R2015-00408-(5),

16 Vesting Tentative Tract Map No. TR-073335-(5), Conditional Use Permit No. 201500019-(5),

C.
19 The Board of Supervisors' approval authorizing the development of Phase

20 1 of the NorthLake Specific Plan of approximately 720 acres of the 1,330-acre Specific Plan

21 area, including 2,295 residential units, 38,700 sq ft of mixed-use community commercial use,

22 32,175 sq ft of highway commercial use, 799.5 acres of parks and open space, a 23-acre school

23 a site, a 1.4-acre fire station site, and all associated infrastructure and utilities, located east of

COMPLAINT 2

1 prepared Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations Regarding the NorthLake

2 Specific Plan Project (State Clearinghouse No. 2015031080), as adopted by the Board of

11 thereof, and

12 V. Findings on Project No. 2015-00408-(5) and Conditional Use Permit No.

13 201500019.

14 3. On information and belief, a Notice of Determination for the Project was posted

15 on or about April 4, 2019, after the Board of Supervisors took final action on the Project.

16 4. The Board of Supervisors is the ultimate land-use authority and decisionmaking
17 body in the County of Los Angeles.

18 5. In approving the Project, the County and Board of Supervisors violated provisions

19 of CEQA requiring that a lead agency fully assess and disclose significant impacts, and that it

20 provide reliable mitigation subject to specific performance standards such that a project's

21 impacts will be mitigated to the fullest extent feasible.

22 6. It also approved development contrary to an existing Specific Plan for the site,

23 without amending that Specific Plan. This violated both the Zoning and Planning Law, and the

24 County's own Hillside Management Areas Ordinance, because the Ordinance prohibits grading

25 of ridgelines unless that grading follows an existing specific plan, and this Project was not.

26 7. The Board of Supervisors approved development of the Project even though it
27 involved grading and the development or partial development of a private project and single-
28 family homes on County-owned land, without obtaining any compensation from the developer or
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 3

P making any findings as to why this was not a waste or a gift of public funds. Dedication of

2 public land to this private use was a gift of public funds.

3 8. The Board of Supervisors' approval of the development also violated the public

4 trust doctrine, as the development involved the filling in of a blue-line stream (including on

5 County-owned land) which feeds into navigable waters, specifically, Castaic Lagoon. The
6 development violates both branches of the public trust doctrine, i.e., that involving the protection

7 of navigable waters both in quantity and quality, and that involving the protection of wildlife.

8 9. Also troublesome was the County's inadequate CEQA review regarding

9 biological resources onsite and downstream from the Project (since the Project involves filling in

10 a blue-line stream on which endangered species such as the least Bell's vireo and the willow and
11 southwestern willow flycatchers depend).

12 10. For example, the County planned to "translocate" colonies of Western Spadefoot

13 toad by "creating" new wetland habitats for them, without even discussing the upland habitat

14 requirements the toad had, without providing for adaptive management, and with only a five-
15 year period for monitoring thereafter, when that period of monitoring would not assure that the
16 wetlands were functioning, much less that the toads were surviving. Nor could the County point

17 to any actual projects where such translocation had worked. The only location for the toad that

18 the "Draft Spadefoot Relocation Plan," released not with the Draft EIR but only with the Final

19 EIR, identified was in the middle of habitat designated for the federally threatened Coastal

20 California gnatcatcher ("CAGN"), and was almost entirely lacking in the required grassland

21 according to the County's mapping of the site.? Finally, the Plan claimed to rely on Adaptive

22 Management but failed to set forth any standards, making the claim an empty promise.

23 11. The County planned on "translocating" large swaths of critically threatened plants

24

25 As one commenter noted, studies of created wetlands have shown that only 20% or less function as intended. Moreover, the DEIR did not evaluate impacts to biota at the receiving 26 site for the Spadefoot Relocation Plan.

27 It should also be noted that actual areas where California gnatcatcher had been documented to be present on the Project site were planned to be plowed over for development, so the
28 County and the developer could only hope that it would move to a small corner of the site adjacent to development, where they also planned to place the Spadefoot toad.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND 4 COMPLAINT

p including the slender mariposa lily and club-haired mariposa lily similarly with no substantial

2 evidence of success in doing so, and in the face of evidence that such translocation efforts had

3 failed and had damaged the plant life in the translocation area.

4 12. Without exception, or perhaps almost without, exception, the County relied upon
5 faulty analysis and mitigation plans which it circulated not with the Draft Supplemental

6 Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR"), but with the Final Supplemental Environmental
7 Impact Report ("FSEIR"), on which the public was not invited to comment. This violates the

8 central purposes of CEQA.

9 13. The County failed to find significant impacts to biological resources and to
10 greenhouse gases despite substantial evidence in the record that such impacts would occur, it

11 failed to adopt several feasible mitigation measures identified by state and regional agencies and
12 members of the public, and it adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations not based on
13 substantial evidence.

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 14. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
16 1094.5. The Court also has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections
17 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

18 15. Venue is proper in this Court because the County of Los Angeles and the
19 proposed Project are in Los Angeles County, so the actions giving rise to the causes of action
20 herein transpired in Los Angeles County. See Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 394.

21 16. This action is timely filed within 30 days of posting the Notice of Determination
22 under CEQA on or about April 4, 2019.

23 17. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies by commenting on the

24 Project before the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of the applicable

25 Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b) and
26 generally; Petitioners rely upon their own comments and those of others as recognized under

27 Pub. Res. Code section 21177 and otherwise in suing.

28 18. Petitioners complied with CEQA by filing and serving before this Petition for
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND 5 COMPLAINT

F Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File under Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, and by

2 notifying the County of Petitioner's election to prepare the administrative record under Pub. Res.

3 Code section 21167.6. Petitioners notified the Attorney General of the commencement of this

4 action under Pub. Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and

5 are serving a copy of this Amended Petition and Complaint on the Attorney General.

6 PARTIES

7 19. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance, formerly SoCal

8 Environmental Justice Alliance, is an advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the

9 environment and the promotion of safe and healthy communities. GSEJA sues on behalf of itself

10 and neighbors of the Project and the general public and is acting as a private attorney general

11 conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of
12 Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

13 20. Petitioners Brett Copeland and Adria Copeland are Los Angeles County taxpayers

14 who sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a. The Copelands are liable for or have paid

15 taxes within one year as specified in section 526a which fund Respondent and Defendant County
16 of Los Angeles, or they are liable to pay such taxes, and they challenge the gift of a portion of
17 the County's parcel APN 3247-017-900 for a private development project, and the waste of the

18 County's resources in that regard, as well as the use of that land and the public's resources in

19 violation of the public trust doctrine.

20 21. Respondent County of Los Angeles ("County") is a California County and the

21 lead agency for the Project under CEQA. County is the agency charged with the authority of

22 regulating and administering land use and development within its territory in compliance with its

23 General Plan and zoning ordinances and applicable provisions of state law including CEQA. As

24 the lead agency for the Project, the County is charged with the duty of ensuring compliance with

25 these applicable laws.

26 22. Respondent Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County ("BOS") is the elected

27 body within the County ultimately responsible for land use and planning decisions within the

28 County.

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS

22 28. The Project Site and Proposed Project. The Project site comprises 1330 acres in
23 rural northern Los Angeles County, east of Interstate 5, west of Castaic Lake, and north of the
24 community of Castaic. The Project site was the subject of a Specific Plan adopted in 1992. Only

25 the County considers the environmental review conducted for that Specific Plan over 25 years

26 ago to still be relevant today. Only the County would justify the proposed development on the

27 ground that it involved somewhat less development than that originally envisioned in the

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 7

1 Specific Plan.3 The Project involves the development of 3,150 residential units on the 1330

2 acres; in violation of CEQA's proscription of "segmentation," the Project divided the site into a

3 "Phase I" and a "Phase II;" a vesting tentative tract map ("VTTM") was sought only for Phase I,

4 covering 720 acres. The Project studied in the DEIR involved developing 1974 dwelling units
on the 720-acre Phase parcel, as well as industrial and commercial uses, until the Planning
6 Commission urged the developer to add 323 additional housing units (including 315 affordable

7 housing units) for a total of 2297 units to replace the industrial and most of the commercial

8 development. The Project as approved involved this higher number of units, although there was

9 no evaluation of this change in the DEIR or FEIR.4

10 29. Importance of the Project Site. The Project site contains a major canyon,
11 Grasshopper Canyon, and a blue-line stream, which drains into Castaic Lagoon to the south. It is
12 immediately adjacent to the Castaic State Recreation Area ("Castaic SRA"). Development

13 would extend the suburban limit over three miles into public open space, would involve 33
14 million cubic yards of grading, and the filling in of the blue-line stream. The applicant claimed

15 these actions and the mass paving that would follow would not have significant impacts on the

16 endangered and threatened species on the site and would not affect the endangered species
17 downstream. The California Department of Parks and Recreation ("DPR"), the California

18 Department of Fish & Wildlife ("CDFW"),5 and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy

19 ("SMMC"), and the Center for Biological Diversity ("CBD") and Petitioner, supported by a

20
For this reason, the County referred to the Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") as a
21 Draft "Supplemental" Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR"), and the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") as a Final "Supplemental" Environmental Impact
22 Report ("FSEIR"). Because Petitioner does not believe tiering on the 26-year-old 1992 Specific Plan EIR was valid, Petitioner refers to the documents at issue here as the DEIR and
23 the FEIR. As the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy made clear, the County's contention

24 that the developer had enforceable entitlements due to the 1992 EIR process was simply a "myth."
4
25 County staff claimed there was an "Errata" to the DEIR showing that this change to Phase had no impacts on, e.g., traffic, air quality or greenhouse gases, but this document was not
26 made available with the materials transmitted to the County Board of Supervisors. The absence of this document requires recirculation.
27 California Department of Parks and Recreation and California Department of Fish & Wildlife

28 would both be "responsible agencies" under CEQA with respect to this Project.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 8

F Ph.D. biologist with over 28 years of experience who is the author of at least 80 peer-reviewed

2 publications, disagreed. There was no substantial evidence to support the County's conclusions

3 of no significant impacts.6

4 30. Inadequate Assessment of Risks from the Oil Pipeline; Need for Recirculation.

5 The Project site, although largely pristine, is traversed by an active oil pipeline. In the DEIR, the

6 County proposed to relocate that pipeline onto California Department of Parks and Recreation
7 land. Not surprisingly at all, California Department of Parks and Recreation refused the proposal

8 in no uncertain terms, and not until the release of the FEIR did the County release a new planned

9 alignment placing the pipeline along the edge of the Castaic State Recreation Area. The threats
10 posed by the new alignment were entirely unevaluated and the proposal constituted significant

11 new information requiring recirculation of the DEIR.

12 31. Inadequate Assessment of Edge Effects; Need for Recirculation. The DEIR and

13 FEIR did not adequately evaluate the impacts on the thin layer of open space planned to surround
14 the development. The developer's Conceptual Plan in the FSEIR. Appendices acknowledging

15 that ecological values would be limited in this strip of "habitat" of 600 feet or less in width was
16 significant new information and should have prompted recirculation of the DEIR. Further, the
17 planned use of this strip for mitigation was insufficient under CEQA's standards. Finally, the

18 County did not properly assess impacts from predictable "edge effects" such as light spillage

19 onto natural habitat, humans and domestic animals entering into such habitat, and roadkill of

20 common and special status species because of development on the site.

21 32. Inadequate Assessment of Site's Function as a Wildlife Corridor; Need for

22 Recirculation. The DEIR and FEIR failed to adequately assess the site's use as a wildlife

23 corridor, despite comments from California Department of Fish & Wildlife, Santa Monica
24 Mountains Conservancy, and Petitioner's expert that it would serve such a role. The County's

25 failure to assess the site for its value in this regard represented a failure to proceed by law and its

26 bare conclusion that the site did not represent such a corridor was not supported by substantial

27

6
28 The Downstream Impacts Assessment, published with the FEIR, did not assess the impacts to species from toxic loading such as from pesticides.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 9

P evidence. Among other things, Petitioner's expert suggested that the County conduct trappings

2 or automated photographic analysis to confirm that it did not serve as such a corridor, but the

3 County failed to do so. Further, he noted that the site would be used as a corridor by multiple

4 volant species, and its role in this regard had not been assessed.

5 33. Inadequate Evaluation of Impacts to Western Spadefoot; Need for Recirculation.

6 As noted above, the Project represents a disaster for the numerous colonies of Western Spadefoot

7 toad on the site. California Department of Fish & Wildlife commented that the DEIR had

8 significant inconsistencies in its discussion of where the Spadefoot was present on the site, and

9 that it was not clear how moving the toad within the development was feasible given that the

10 toad has an average home range of 1355 feet from its breeding pool. The County claimed that its
11 surveys disclosing locations of the toad were adequate despite the inconsistencies California
12 Department of Fish & Wildlife noted, because there would be another focused survey done later.

13 This does not comply with CEQA, which requires that the public be informed of the extent of
14 damage to the environment before a project is approved. The County further released a "Draft

15 Spadefoot Relocation Plan" with its FEIR, but this document disclosed that one of only two
16 proposed sites for relocation onsite was well within 1355 feet of development, and though the

17 County claimed in the FEIR it could relocate the Spadefoot offsite, the viability of this option

18 was not discussed in the Relocation Plan. The Relocation Plan constituted significant new
19 information under CEQA. The Relocation Plan did not contain specific performance measures

20 and was improper deferral under CEQA. The Relocation Plan's commitment to only five years

21 of monitoring could not support a conclusion that impacts would be mitigated to less than

22 significant levels.

23 34. Inadequate Assessment as to Vernal Pools; Need for Recirculation. The DEIR

24 failed to assess impacts to vernal pools, eight of which the County originally acknowledged were

25 present on the site. As California Department of Fish & Wildlife noted, eliminating those vernal

26 pools was a significant impact. Although the County tried to backtrack and claim that these

27 depressions were not vernal pools, there was no substantial evidence in the record for such an
28 assertion. The County's new assertion that the pools were not vernal pools required
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 10

P recirculation.

2 35. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Downstream Endangered Species. Both

3 California Department of Fish & Wildlife and California Department of Parks and Recreation

4 pointed out that the DEIR did not address impacts to the endangered least Bell's vireo, the
5 southwestern willow flycatcher and the willow flycatcher, all of which are downstream from the

6 site.7 California Department of Fish & Wildlife indicated there should be 4:1 habitat mitigation,

7 but this was not provided for, and there was no demonstration that such mitigation would be
8 infeasible, much less that it was not required. The County relied on using "best management
9 practices" ("BMPs") that for the most part it did not adopt as mitigation, and there was no
10 substantial evidence in the record that these measures would assure sufficient water quality and

11 quantity to support these species. The DEIR should have been recirculated with a proper
12 discussion of this impact.

13 36. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Rare Plants and Inadequate Mitigation;
14 Need for Recirculation. California Department of Fish & Wildlife commented regarding the

15 translocation of mariposa lilies that it was unaware of any successful translocation efforts, and
16 that it knew at least one instance where a transplantation effort damaged the existing population

17 on the site. There was no substantial evidence to support the developer's conclusion that its

18 vague plans would work. California Department of Fish & Wildlife commented that it could not

19 comment on the location, technique, success criteria, monitoring methods, density, funding

20 adequacy, protection or length of monitoring proposed for the relocation efforts for the numerous

21 rare plants because they were not provided for in the DEIR. The County's identification of bare

22 "mitigation ratios," all of which California Department of Fish & Wildlife found insufficient in

23 any case, does not constitute "specific performance criteria" permitting deferred mitigation under

24 CEQA. And as California Department of Fish & Wildlife clarified, the length of monitoring was
25 inadequate to assure success of the mitigation. Finally, California Department of Fish &

26

27 For that matter, people are downstream from the site, in that there is swimming in Castaic Lagoon, which Grasshopper Creek drains into.
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND 11 COMPLAINT

Wildlife pointed out there was only one nursery in the state qualified to store the plant material

2 needed for translocation, and the County refused to commit to using that nursery.

3 37. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to the Burrowing Owl; Inadequate Mitigation;
4 Need to Recirculate. California Department of Fish & Wildlife, Petitioner's expert, and others

5 commented that the assessment of impacts to the burrowing owl ("BUOW") was not adequate

6 because no compliant breeding survey was done per the California Department of Fish &

7 Wildlife 2012 Staff Report. While the developer attempted to remedy this a with a survey in 2017,

8 the survey was patently inadequate: as Petitioner's expert noted, that survey effort involved two

9 people spending six hours over the course of three days. Assuming that the area (both disturbed

10 areas and grasslands) covered 500 acres of the site, this meant the surveyors spent roughly 14

11 seconds per acre in their survey. There were additional documented problems with how the
12 survey was conducted relative to the manner required under the 2012 Staff Report. And the EIR

13 contained insufficient mitigation measures regarding excluding wintering burrowing owl from

14 the site, and lacked any plan to purchase or maintain adequate (or any) burrowing owl habitat

15 elsewhere.

16 38. Preconstruction Surveys Are Inadequate as Mitigation; the DEIR Lacked an

17 Adequate Baseline. As both California Department of Fish & Wildlife and Petitioner's expert

18 commented, the DEIR repeatedly relied on preconstruction surveys as supposedly avoiding
19 impacts. However, preconstruction surveys should follow focused detection surveys both

20 because (1) the public should be informed of the extent of environmental impacts to sensitive

21 species, and (2) the detection surveys are necessary for the agency to properly formulate

22 mitigation measures (after receiving comments from responsible agencies, among other things).

23 This was not done here. The DEIR and FEIR's conclusion that species impacts would be

24 mitigated to less than significant based on preconstruction surveys was not supported by

25

8
26 The County issued a "Draft Special Status Plant Mitigation 'Plan'" with the FEIR, which meant the DEIR should have been recirculated with it. Additionally, the area proposed for
27 plant mitigation onsite was also proposed California gnatcatcher habitat, meaning that relocation could be prohibited as it could result in take of the California gnatcatcher. Further,
28 the "Plan" did not distinguish between the two types of mariposa lily on the site, although one is far more rare.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 12

substantial evidence. Even more to the point, the County's own SCVAP EIR (upon which this

2 one supposedly tiered) required protocol-level detection surveys at the Project level, yet the

3 County refused to do them. As Petitioner's expert clarified, the County's conclusion that species

4 were absent based on a lack of records in the California Natural Diversity Data Base was not

5 supported by substantial evidence, and the County's refusal to acknowledge sightings noted in

6 eBird was similarly unfounded.9

7 39. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Bats; Recirculation Required. The DEIR

8 included no assessment of impacts to bats and special status bats. After California Department

9 of Fish & Wildlife and Petitioner's expert commented this was inadequate, the developer

10 conducted surveys over three nights in July of 2017. Those surveys detected 10 species of bat,

11 with special status. The DEIR should have been recirculated with this information. The County
12 claimed that despite the identification of the bats onsite there was no significant impact to them,

13 but there was no substantial evidence for this conclusion, as California Department of Fish &
14 Wildlife noted.10 As Petitioner's biologist clarified, impacts to those species from the Project

15 could be significant. Further, the County concluded that species other than those actually
16 detected in the three nights were not present, without a substantial evidence basis.

17 40. Deferral of Mitigation in General. The County repeatedly deferred the
18 development of mitigation plans and the actual imposition of mitigation requirements, repeatedly

19 allowing for future studies and mitigation based on what those studies turned up. This is

20

21 As Petitioner's expert noted, "the County dismissed eBird as unprofessional while at the
22 same time claiming that a cursory walkover during 3 days in the middle of California's most intense drought in history was consistent with industry standards and therefore professional."
23 10 California Department of Fish & Wildlife further commented that the DEIR failed to assess

24 impacts to the ringtail; the County took the position in response that it was not present because there were no California Natural Diversity Database ("CNDDB") records. The

25 absence of a CNDDB record does not prove the absence of a species, particularly not on private lands.
11
26 Here, as in numerous other places in the EIR, the County took the position that there would be no significant impact to a special status species unless the Project would "cause regional
27 populations to fall below self-sustaining levels," and would not impact a "substantial population," but (1) the County had no scientific basis for concluding that these standards
28 would not be met, and (2) the standards are Appendix G provides that standard. not the proper standard for impacts to species.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 13

inappropriate under CEQA, which requires at a minimum that the lead agency (1) show that the

2 mitigation could not have been developed before circulation of the DEIR, and (2) set forth

3 specific and measurable performance criteria sufficient to demonstrate that the mitigation will

4 actually succeed. None of the County's deferrals met these standards.

5 41. Inadequacy of the "Conceptual Habitat Mitigation Plan"; Need for
6 Recirculation. The DEIR failed to contain a habitat mitigation plan; the County came out with a
7 "Conceptual Plan" with the FEIR. The "Conceptual Plan" took credit for 182 acres of on-site
8 mitigation at a 1:1 ratio immediately after conceding that such a ratio was unwarranted for the

9 habitat on the site. The "Conceptual Plan" improperly deferred the development of a Habitat
10 Mitigation and Monitoring Plan ("HMMP") and relied upon general, exceedingly flexible factors

11 for "consideration" of off-site lands for mitigation, and it failed to actually identify the mitigation

12 sites. As Petitioner's expert clarified, without the identification of a specific site, there was not

13 substantial evidence the Project would work, because there have been cases where projects have
14 been approved and mitigation has been found to be infeasible.

15 42. Significant Greenhouse Gas Impacts Not Acknowledged; Inadequate Mitigation.
16 The DEIR concluded that the Project's greenhouse gas ("GHG") impacts would be less than

17 significant because the Project supposedly complied with the County's Climate Action Plan

18 ("CCAP"). However, the Project was not compliant with the County's Climate Action Plan, and

19 in any event, the County's Climate Action Plan only looked to the 2020 horizon. The Supreme

20 Court, the Legislature, the Governor's Office and the California Air Resources Board have made

21 more than clear that agencies must assess compliance with the goals not simply of AB 32 but

22 also of SB 32, which requires a 40% reduction below 1990 emission levels by 2030, and

23 Executive Order S-3-05, which requires an 80% reduction below 1990 emission levels by

24 2050.12 The DEIR acknowledged that the Project will generate GHGs of at least 66,083 metric

25

26 12 Nor did the DEIR acknowledge or assess compliance with Executive Order B-16-2012, which calls for an 80% reduction of GHG emissions from the transportation sector by 2050.
27 Finally, Petitioner notes that Executive Order S-3-05's target was recently made even more

28 stringent by Executive Order B-55-18, which requires the State to be fully carbon neutral by

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 14

1 tons of CO2 per year ("MTCO2e"), and that mitigation measures (some of which, such as the
2 Transportation Demand Management (*TDM") Plan, were entirely unproven) would reduce that

3 amount by less than 10,000 MTCO2e.13 The County's analysis failed to proceed by law and was

4 not supported by substantial evidence. Because impacts were significant, the County had to

5 impose further mitigations (and the County failed to proceed by law in failing to impose
6 additional feasible mitigation proposed by Center for Biological Diversity such as committing to

7 zero net energy on the site, to more EV charging stations, to more renewable energy, and to a

8 local offset program.  And those mitigations the County did impose were not enforceable (the

9 County failed to proceed by law in this respect) and they therefore do not present substantial

10 evidence that impacts would be mitigated to less than significant levels. There was no support in

11 the record for the TDM Plan's supposed reductions.

12 43. Conclusions Regarding Fire Safety Not Supported by Substantial Evidence. The

13 County improperly concluded that the Project, approved in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity

14 Zone, would not lead to more fires and risk exacerbating the risk of wildfire on the site. The

15 County concluded the Project would not lead to further fires because it was not "high density,"
16 but (1) the assumption that "low density" development cannot exacerbate fire risk was

17 unsupported, and (2) in any event the development called for up to 18 units per acre, which is

18 high density for single family homes.

19 44. Inadequate Assessment of Impacts to Numerous Special Status Bird Species;

20 Inadequate Mitigation, Need to Recirculate. The County improperly concluded that impacts to

21 several bird species would be less than significant because, supposedly, those birds do not nest

22

23 2045. That Order predated the Board of Supervisors' action on the Project, although it was apparently not considered by the Board.
24 13 These GHG impacts were likely understated because, among other things, the County
25 demanded that the Project involve an additional 323 housing units as opposed to industrial and commercial development, and this would lead to multiple additional long commutes.
26 The County claimed that this issue was dealt with in an Errata, but that Errata was not made
available with the Board of Supervisors' packet.
27 14 The County claimed it was imposing "grey water systems," but the FEIR conceded that the County was simply going to provide information to future residents.
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 15

on the site, but (1) absent protocol surveys, there was no basis for concluding this, and (2)
2 nesting alone cannot sustain birds, they must also forage, and losing foraging habitat, not

3 evaluated by the EIR, could be significant. 15 Further, the EIR improperly planned mitigation for

4 lost habitat for the least Bell's vireo and southwestern willow flycatcher habitat at a 2:1 ratio,

5 when California Department of Fish & Wildlife recommends a 5:1 ratio in the south coast

6 region. The planned habitat mitigation for the California gnatcatcher was inadequate given that

7 the species' range is shifting northward due to climate change, and the ratio of 2:1 was again
8 inadequate. The mitigation habitat should always be provided before Project construction but the

9 County did not make this commitment. Finally, Petitioner provided clear evidence that the

10 nesting season for raptors begins January 1, not February 1, but the County failed to modify its

11 mitigation measure to address this.

12 45. Petitioner's expert noted that eBird disclosed that a California condor - perhaps

13 one of the rarest birds in the wild - had been discovered over the site. The County ignored the

14 sighting. Then an "Errata" to the EIR conceded that 8 condors were sighted - one on the ground

15 - at or near the site in 2018. Despite this information, the County failed to acknowledge a
16 significant impact to the species or to formulate any mitigation. An Errata to the EIR was

17 insufficient to address this significant new impact.

18 46. The EIR also failed to address a significant potential impact to bald eagles and

19 golden eagles, despite substantial evidence they could use the site for foraging habitat, and

20 regarding the golden eagle, it failed to acknowledge significant cumulative impacts due to the

21 eagle's tendency not to fly over human-occupied spaces.

22 47. The county claimed that "After nearly 20 years of biological surveys on the

23 Project site, the ferruginous hawk has been observed only a few times during the winter season,"

24 as if surveys for the hawk had been done in the winter. They had not, nor had any species other

25 than the burrowing owl been surveyed for in the winter, and that was only during at most three

26

27 15 The County claimed that an analysis based only on nesting habitat was "industry standard"
28 without a substantial evidence basis for that; in any event, it is science that presents the CEQA standard, not what developers' consultants may choose to do for expediency.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 16

T winters. The County's claim was deliberately misleading. Again, the County used an improper

2 standard to determine lack of a significant impact to the species.

3 48. The EIR failed to assess impacts to the Swainson's hawk, the white tailed kite,

4 and the merlin, again without a substantial evidence basis. The County actually discounted a

5 special status bird that was present, the tricolored blackbird, because it had not seen more than

6 one, and contended that the bird was absent based on a lack of references to it in eBird and the

7 Los Angeles Breeding Bird Atlas, though these are voluntary databases.

8 49. Inadequate Analysis of Impacts to Grasshopper Creek; Need to Recirculate. The

9 EIR improperly concluded that it would impact "only 26 percent of the Grasshopper Canyon
10 Watershed," as opposed to actually conceding it would destroy 3.5 miles of Grasshopper Creek,

11 a blue line stream, itself. The EIR's claim of no significant impact is contrary to Guidelines

12 Appendix G's standard that an impact is significant if it will "have a substantial adverse effect on

13 any riparian habitat." The EIR further assumes that's BMPs, which are legally required by water
14 quality agencies, will protect water quality for species downstream, even though many streams in

15 Southern California fail to meet state and federal water quality control standards despite
16 implementing BMPs, and even though the standard for protecting wildlife must be more
17 stringent. The EIR failed to even incorporate the BMPs as mitigation measures anyway, in a

18 failure to proceed by law.

19 50. Failure to Address a Variety of Impacts to Wildlife; Need to Recirculate. The

20 EIR failed to limit free roaming domestic animals, or to assess the inevitable impacts to wildlife

21 they will cause. It failed to provide a specific Integrated Pest Management Program. It failed to

22 limit the impacts of residents or their pets entering into sensitive areas, providing only for "split

23 rail fencing" to supposedly limit these impacts. It failed to provide for worker or resident

24 awareness programs.

25 51. Inadequate Mitigation for Air Quality Impacts. The County failed to adopt all
26 feasible mitigation for the significant air quality impacts it acknowledged would occur because

27 of the Project. Center for Biological Diversity offered multiple mitigation measures

28 recommended by several air quality management districts, but the County ignored them entirely.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND 17 COMPLAINT

1 52. Inadequate Baseline for Species Onsite; Need to Recirculate. A number of

2 special status species were not searched for onsite with any focused effort. Instead, the

3 developer relied on 3 days of general surveys in April 2014, in the worst drought in California's

4 recorded history. Among the species the EIR improperly excluded which might be present are

5 the San Joaquin pocket mouse, the Los Angeles pocket mouse, and the Tehachapi pocket mouse.

6 The DEIR was apparently deliberately misleading in leaving out any note of the presence of the

7 desert woodrat, which the County acknowledged was present in the FEIR.

8 53. Failure to Assess Automobile Collision Impacts and Bird Strikes to Buildings;

9 Need to Recirculate. The County improperly concluded there would be no impacts to special
10 status species because of the road construction and use onsite, even though there was no reason

11 for assuming that only common species would be affected. And the EIR failed to assess impacts

12 to birds from striking buildings on the Project site, even in the face of documented evidence this

13 would lead to thousands of fatalities. Further the County refused to mitigate for these significant

14 impacts, even though such mitigation was plainly feasible.

15 54. Failure to Assess Cumulative Impacts. The County used an inappropriate
16 standard for assessing cumulative impacts, and improperly relied on a list of projects identified

17 for cumulative traffic impacts as the basis for its conclusions.

18 55. Riparian Trees. MM 5.2-3 regarding the loss of riparian trees was insufficiently

19 specific and improperly deferred, and the EIR failed to assess potentially significant impacts to

20 the trees or the birds that depended on them.

21 56. Special Status Reptiles. The County failed to find a significant impact to special

22 status reptiles which would be crushed by the Project even though it acknowledged that its

23 mitigation measure for capturing them, MM 5.2-10, would be unlikely to work.

24 57. Alternatives Analysis. California Department of Fish & Wildlife, Santa Monica
25 Mountains Conservancy, and Center for Biological Diversity all urged the County and the

26 developer to consider clustered development on the site to avoid impacts to the numerous

27 sensitive resources onsite. The County dismissed such an approach from any serious
28 consideration. While it initially identified a "Creek Avoidance Alternative," it incredibly
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 181

P rejected that alternative because utility lines would have to cross the Creek, which might lead to

2 risks of contamination. As Center for Biological Diversity noted, the risk of contamination in

3 the Creek Avoidance Alternative was hardly outweighed by the certainty of destroying the Creek

4 entirely because of the proposed Project. There was no substantial evidence that the Creek

5 Avoidance Alternative would be economically infeasible, and the County's post hoc justification

6 that the Alternative would not involve the development of affordable housing units was

7 insufficient because the Creek Avoidance Alternative could have involved affordable housing

8 units just as much as the proposed Project did. (Again, the County only added these affordable

9 units at the last minute and they were not evaluated in the DEIR.)16

10 58. The DEIR further failed to analyze a low carbon alternative. The County claimed

11 this was unnecessary because the Project supposedly did not have significant GHG impacts, but

12 the County was wrong on this front.

13 59. The DEIR and FEIR further exposed the arbitrariness of the County's planning
14 process because the DEIR included a "No Industrial Development" alternative rejected because

15 it did not include industrial development - even though the Project approved by the County did

16 not either.

17 60. Finally, the EIR's consideration of alternatives did not reflect a reasonable range

18 of alternatives because there were no alternatives carried forward for further consideration that
19  reduced impacts to biological resources. While the County's position was that impacts to
20 biological resources were less than significant, that position was not backed up by substantial

21 evidence.17

22

23 16 The County also justified rejecting the Alternative on the ground that the Alternative would not reduce vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") like the Project, but the County elsewhere
24 conceded that the Project would not reduce VMT either, SO there was no substantial evidence for the County's conclusion.
25 Finally, incredibly, the County claimed that the Alternative was infeasible because it would require the development of parks, when the Project is surrounded by the Castaic State 26 Recreation Area, and because it would require the development of a school or schools, when

27 the Project does not commit to the development of the schools either.
17 As Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy wrote, the County failed to demonstrate why a less
28 damaging alternative was infeasible. The County typically requires a 50% open space dedication, and this Project is not even close to achieving such a dedication.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 19

1 61. Failure to Exercise Independent Judgment. The County failed to exercise its

2 independent judgment on the record, repeatedly relying on studies transmitted by consultants to

3 the developer (in virtually all cases after the DEIR had been circulated, another violation of
4 CEQA). The County's actions represent a failure to proceed by law, and the studies sent to the

5 developer do not represent substantial evidence because there is no evidence the County

6 critically reviewed them.

7 62. Findings Not Supported by Substantial Evidence. The County's Findings to

8 support its Statement of Overriding Considerations and approving the Project were not supported

9 by substantial evidence regarding the claims that the community would benefit, that the Castaic
10 State Recreation Area would be unharmed, that all feasible mitigation measures had been

11 adopted, that alternatives (including the Creek Avoidance Alternative) were infeasible, and that
12 the Project met the Project's objectives."

13 63. Violation of Laws Related to Specific Plans, and the County's Own Hillside

14 Management Ordinance. The County effectively amended the 1992 Specific Plan by changing
15 items included therein as recognized by, inter alia, Government Code sections 65451(a)(2),
16 65451(a)(1), and 65451(a)(3). The proposed utilities and sewer systems are inconsistent with
17 those provided in the Specific Plan; the proposed number of lots, sizes of lots and number of
18 homes planned for in Phase 2 are significantly different from those provided for in the 1992

19 Specific Plan. The County's Hillside Area Management Ordinance applied because the Project

20 is not consistent with the 1992 Specific Plan, and the County failed to proceed by law in not

21 complying with that Ordinance.

22 64. Violations of Public Trust Doctrine. California's public trust doctrine has its

23 roots in that of the United States and ultimately roman law. The California courts have

24 recognized two strands of the doctrine: that protecting navigable waters and that protecting

25

26 18 The DEIR improperly concluded that the Project met the objective of "reduc[ing] offsite trips
27 and vehicle miles traveled," DEIR at 4-3, when the FEIR conceded that it was too
speculative to conclude that onsite jobs would be filled by future residents; in any event,
28 most of those onsite jobs were eliminated by the Project as revised and adopted by the Planning Commission and subsequently the Board of Supervisors.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 20

T wildlife. The County of Los Angeles and Doe Nos. 11-20 violated both by approving and

2 allowing the present Project to move forward.

3 65. Regarding navigable waters, the doctrine protects not only those waters, but also

4 the sources of water that feed them; it extends to private lands and those that are public; and it

5 encompasses the protection of birds and aquatic species and protecting navigation, recreation,

6 and fishing.

7 66. Regarding wildlife, the public trust is more than an affirmation of state power to

8 use public property for public purposes. It is an affirmation of the duty of the state to protect the
9 people's common heritage. While this branch of the doctrine is initially statutory, statutory
10 enactments do not render the judicially fashioned public trust doctrine superfluous. This strand

11 of the public trust doctrine also may concern activities on private lands.

12 67. Both the Department of Water Resources and California Department of Fish &

13 Wildlife commented negatively on the proposed Project.

14 68. The public, including Petitioners, have the authority to enforce both branches of

15 the public trust doctrine when they have joined the agency responsible for violating the public
16 trust doctrine. Here, that is the County, and possibly Doe Nos. 11-20.

17 69. The County and Doe Nos. 11-20 violated both aspects of the public trust doctrine

18 by donating its resources, consisting of County-owned land with Assessor's Parcel Number
19 3247-017-900, for use in a private development project, as well as by approving the Project. The

20 County's lands included a portion of the blue-line stream known as Grasshopper Creek (although

21 it violated the doctrine to allow private development on private land as well). The County and

22 Doe Nos. 11-20 allowed grading and filling of its lands, including the stream, despite the impacts

23 on Castaic Lagoon, which is fed by the stream, and despite the Project's impacts on the federally

24 endangered least Bell's vireo, the federally endangered southwestern willow flycatcher, and

25 other species such as the federally threatened California gnatcatcher.

26 70. Under the public trust doctrine, the County and Doe Nos. 11-20 had the obligation

27 to use the County's and state's public resources for public benefit, including but not limited to

28 protecting wildlife resources.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND 21 COMPLAINT

1 71. Gift and Waste of Public Funds. The County's donation of its lands to a private

2 development project, including the development of single-family homes thereon, or portions of
3 single-family homes or their lots, is also a gift and waste of public funds prohibited by the

4 California Constitution. The prohibition on the gift and waste of public funds covers any
devotion of public resources to a private project for no compensation. Petitioners Brett and

6 Adria Copeland sue under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a to enjoin the use of the

7 County's land for this Project; all three Petitioners seek a declaratory judgment that using the

8 County's land is illegal and ultra vires.

22 74. The DEIR failed to fully analyze significant impacts to biological resources in
23 numerous respects, as well as GHGs, as discussed above. The County failed to make findings of

24 significance, it failed to impose mitigation measures or adopt alternatives, and it failed to adopt a

25 statement of overriding considerations based on substantial evidence as to those impacts.

13 Vision" EIR prepared in 2012. The present DEIR claimed that the changes to those documents

14 made by this one were supposedly "minor," such that only s "supplemental" EIR was required

15 under Guidelines section 15163. The changes were hardly minor - among other things, the 1992

16 EIR was prepared before climate change analysis was required, and before most if not all
17 special-status species onsite were listed as such. And a massive Valley-wide general planning

18 effort plainly did not address the significant impacts at the NorthLake site.

19 94. Tiering is appropriate when a lead agency starts from environmental review for a

20 a plan such as a general plan and goes to a more specific level of development. Tiering is not

21 appropriate from one Specific Plan to another Specific Plan, which is what the County attempted

22 to do here. See Guidelines § 15385(a), (b).

23 95. In the DEIR, the County repeatedly justified its failure to address aspects of the

24 proposed new Specific Plan because they had been addressed in the earlier EIR. This was
25 inappropriate under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and recirculation without reliance on the

26 earlier EIRs is required.

27 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

28 Segmentation

FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND

• 25 COMPLAINT

1 [Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]

2 [Petitioner GSEJA v. Respondents County and County BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; Real

3 Parties in Interest]

4 96. Petitioner GSEJA reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 95 as if set

forth.

6 97. Under CEQA when evaluating project, the lead agency - the County here -

7 must evaluate "the whole of an action," including all phases of the project. See CEQA

8 Guidelines §§ 15063(a)(1), 15126, 15378(a).

9 98. The County failed to evaluate the whole of the action here, slicing the Project into
10 two separate actions one of which - Phase II - it refused to evaluate. Phase II was readily

11 foreseeable because of this Project, it was planned on the same parcel of land, and it would
12 involve further impacts. It should have been evaluated in the Project EIR.

13 99. The County's approach is entirely inappropriate under CEQA, and a court must

14 prohibit efforts such as the County's here.

15 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Failure to Comply with State Zoning and Planning Law

17 [Gov. Code § 65000 et seq.]

18 [All Petitioners v. the County and County BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; Real Parties in

19 Interest]

20 100. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 99 as if fully set forth.

21 101. The County significantly changed the Specific Plan in approving the Project, and

22 it was therefore required to amend its Specific Plan, under Gov. Code sections 65451(a)(2),

23 65451(a)(1), and 65451(a)(3).

24 102. The County's failure to abide by these requirements represented a failure to
25 comply with a mandatory duty, a failure to proceed by law and an abuse of discretion.

26 103. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate requiring the County to amend its Specific Plan

27 to accurately depict the proposed Project, and/or or declaratory relief under Code of Civil
28 Procedure section 1060 that the County's failure to do so was unlawful.
FIRST AMENDED PETITION AND
COMPLAINT 26

1 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Failure to Comply with County Hillside Area Management Ordinance

3 [County Code § 22.56.217]

4 [All Petitioners v. the County and County BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; Real Parties in
Interest]

6 104. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs : through 103 as if fully set

7 forth.

8 105. The County had to comply with the Hillside Management Ordinance because it

9 effectively amended the Specific Plan in approving the Project, and the Project was not

10 consistent with the existing Specific Plan.

11 106. The County failed to comply with the Hillside Management Ordinance in
12 allowing extensive grading and filling, including on County-owned land.

13 107. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate requiring the County and County BOARD OF

14 SUPERVISORS to comply with the requirements of the Hillside Management Ordinance, and/or

15 or declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 that the County's failure to do

16 SO was unlawful.

21 Interest]

22 108. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 107 as if fully set

23 forth.

24 109. Petitioners the Copelands seek to restrain the devotion of County property,
25 consisting of portions of APN 3247-017-900, for use in a private development project with no

26 compensation therefor.

27 110. All Petitioners a seek a declaration of the rights and duties of the County and

2 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Violation of Public Trust Doctrine: Navigable Waters

4 [All Petitioners v. the County and County BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; Real Parties in

5 Interest]

6 111. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 110 as if fully set

7 forth.

8 112. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate, injunction, and/or declaratory relief barring the

9 County and Doe Nos. 11 through 20 from devoting stream resources, including stream resources

10 on public lands, to a private development project which may deplete the quantity or quality of
11 the water in the Castaic Lagoon, : a navigable waterway used for boating, recreation, fishing and

12 wildlife resources.

14 Violation of Public Trust Doctrine: Protection of Wildlife

15 [All Petitioners v. the County and County BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; Real Parties in

16 Interest]

17 113. Petitioners reincorporate and reallege paragraphs 1 through 112 as if fully set

18 forth.

19 114. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate, injunction, and/or declaratory relief barring the

20 County and Doe Nos. 11 through 20 from approving a development project, including on public

21 lands, which may have damaging effects on wildlife resources, including on special status,

22 endangered and threatened species.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray

24 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the County to set aside its

25 decision approving the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
