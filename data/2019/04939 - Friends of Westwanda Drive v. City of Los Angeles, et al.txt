2 Petitioner, FRIENDS OF WESTWANDA DRIVE ("Petitioner"), alleges:

1.

3 The project is a proposed single-family dwelling on an undeveloped property
located at 10034 Westwanda Drive, Los Angeles, CA (*Project"). The Project contemplates the
removal of 954 cubic yards of soil for the construction of a 3,238 single-family dwelling on
5 approximately 4,009 square foot never-before developed steep hillside site. 'The Project is
6

7 a located on a hillside parcel at 10034 Westwanda Drive in Benedict Canyon (which is within the

8 Santa Monica Mountains). Westwanda Drive is less than 20 feet in width in at least four separate
locations (otherwise known as a "substandard" street). The vacant site is beautiful, hillside

10 untouched adjacent to a large habitat block officially mapped by the Santa Monica Mountain

11 Conservancy ("SMMC"). Among other things, the Project requires the removal of protected trees

8 Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 12 and the issuance of a Tree Removal Permit from the City of Los Angeles.

2. Petitioner, Friends of Westwanda ("Petitioner"), is an unincorporated association

8
# 13 whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in Benedict Canyon and in the
14

Beverly area of Westwanda Drive in particular. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and
15 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to
16 environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
17

18 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and
19| environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the
20 Project.

21 3.

22 Respondent, City of Los Angeles ("Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated

23 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
24 4.

25 Real Party in Interest, Karla Shahin is the owner of the property located at 10034

26 Westwanda Drive. Real Party in Interest, Armen Melfonians is the husband of Ms. Shahin and

27 has a direct interest in the development of the property in question. Both Karla Shahin and

28 Armen Melfonians are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Real Party in Interest" or

1 "Developer."

2 5. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein

3 as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

5 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each

6 Respondent designated herein as a ROE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
7 alleged in this Petition.

8 6. On March 14, 2018, the City of Los Angeles Urban Forestry Division approved a

9 Tree Removal Permit in order to facilitate the Project. The City erroneously determined that the
10 Project was exempt from CEQA and issued a Notice of Exemption for the Project. The permit
11 authorized the removal of three Coast Live Oak Trees and six Southern California Black Walnut 8 d77 Channel Law Group, LLZ06 12 2L0S VPNE HUSIMA SCO Beverly Hills, Trees, which are both protected tree species pursuant to Ordinance No. 177404 which cannot be
13 | removed without a determination by the Board of Public Works that removal is necessary in
14 order to allow for "reasonable development."
15 7. Petitioner filed an appeal of the environmental determination with the City Clerk
16 on August 31, 2018 pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c). This section of the
17 Public Resources Code states as follows: "lf a nonelected decisionmaking body of a local lead
18 agency certifies an environmental impact report, approves a negative declaration or mitigated
19 negative declaration, or determines that a project is not subject to this division, that
20 certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected
21 decisionmaking body, if any." A hearing was conducted before the Public Works and Gang
22 Reduction Committee on The City Council denied Petitioner's appeal on August 20, 2019.
23 8. The developer filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on August
24 20, 2019. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the aforementioned Notice
25 of Exemption with the County Recorder.

26 9. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
27 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and

local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et

3 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources

4 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil

5 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

10. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county
in which the city or local agency is situated." Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent
8 is located in the County of Los Angeles.

11. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written

8 d11 5dnoJs MEl |ouueyo -1706 12 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

13 12. 8 e}ns *pAa eJJys|!M €8E8 California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
'SIl!H Auenea 14 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
16 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary 15

projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
18 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 17

19 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
20 13. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
21 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
22 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
23 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
24 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
25 a 'project' as 'the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
26 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
27 environment...™" Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora

(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
2 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
3 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).

14. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

5 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair

6 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
7 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
8 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
10 15. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
11 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, 9 8
L1Z06 12 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
13 8 ouns "pAa eJJys|m €:€8 Channel Law Group, CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is it to alert the
SII!H Auereg 14 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
15 points of no return."" Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
16 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
17 16. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
18 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
19 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
20 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal
21 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
22 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
17. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this

Petition.

6 18. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 project.
7 The Class 3 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures (which
8 include the construction of one single family dwelling). However, according to the State CEQA
Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of this exemption:
10 (a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the
11
8 project is to be located project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the d77 Channel Law Group, LIZ06 12 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
13 8 oynS "pALE EJIYSIIM €8€8 classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an
Beverly SI!H 14 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
15 mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
16 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
17 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
18 significant.
19 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
20 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on
21 the environment due to unusual circumstances.
22 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
23 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
24 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
25 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
26 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
27 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
28

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of
2 the Government Code.

3 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

5 19. The City also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 2
6 urban infill project. However, this exemption is not available when there are "unusual
7 circumstances" associated with the Project.

8 20. As explained below, the City erroneously concluded that the Project was eligible
for the Class 3 and Class 32 categorical xemptions.
10 21. The Project's Location and Impacts Prevents the City from Utilizing the Class 3
11
8 Exemption. As explained in the CEQA Guidelines, "a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 SI!H GLIS VPNB MLHN S IMA E SS Beverly 12 impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant.' CEQA
13 Guidelines Section 15300.2(a). An exemption does not apply where the project may impact on
14 an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped,
15 and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
16 22. The Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 1979. The
17 property is subject to the Plan because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone.
18 The Zone was established by the Legislature via the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act,
19 which is codified at Section 33001 of the Public Resources Code. The Act states as follows:
20

21 "The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, as defined in Section 33105, is a unique and
22 valuable economic, environmental, agricultural, scientific, educational, and recreational resource that should be held in trust for present and future generations; that, 23 as the last large undeveloped area contiguous to the shoreline within the greater Los
24 Angeles metropolitan region, comprised of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, it provides essential relief from the urban environment; that it exists as a single
25 ecosystem in which changes that affect one part may also affect all other parts; and that the preservation and protection of this resource is in the public interest."
26

27 23. The Legislature itself declared that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone is

28 a unique and valuable environmental resource that provided essential relief from the urban

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environment. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act goes on to say the following:
2

3 "in the absence of a governmental mechanism to perform such evaluations, piecemeal development projects were occurring within the zone which resulted in the irreplaceable loss of open space and recreational resources, in the physical and biological deterioration of air, land, and water systems within the zone, and adversely 5 affected regional life-support systems, including fish and wildlife, therefore being harmful to the needs of the present and future population of the region." 6

7 24. The Legislature further declared at PRC Section 33008 that:

8

"there are existing problems of substandard lots, incompatible land uses, conflicts with
recreational use, and inadequate resource protection which, in some cases, cannot be
10 addressed in a feasible manner by local government exercise of the police power or federal land acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, 11 and that it is necessary to enact the provisions of this division as a complement to the full 8 d77 'dnoJg MET |éuueu) exercise of the police power by local governments . . LLZ06 12

13 8 HNS "PALE EJLYS|!M E888 25. The Legislature also stated that "the people of the State of California have an SIIIH Auereg 14

15 interest in the protection of resources and the use of lands acquired or managed by the

16 conservancy pursuant to this division, and that the conservancy in carrying out its duties pursuant

17 to this division acts on behalf of the State of California."

26. The City of Los Angeles adopted a formal resolution in 1979 undertaking its 18

19 intent to implement the Plan as the local agency with planning and land use jurisdiction. The

20 Plan was mandated by the Legislature and is a planning tool designed to help conserve and

21 preserve the Santa Monica Mountains. Policy No. 21 specifically deals with Wildlife Protection.

27. The property's value as habitat for flora and fauna cannot be disputed. The entire 22

23 area serves as a refuge for a area wildlife. Refuges such as this are important elements of the urban

24 landscape and their value cannot be dismissed. Developments like the proposed Project displace

25 "urban wildlife' into residential backyards and city streets, and habitat disruption can result in an

26 imbalance on food chain populations and lead wildlife to seek both food and shelter in residential

27 areas and to stray into city streets and public areas.

28. The future viability of hundreds of California's wildlife species are dependent on 28

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the maintenance of biologically functional and contiguous oak and walnut woodland ecosystems

2 at local and bioregional scales. Oak/walnut woodlands are incredibly important the local wildlife.

29. Under these circumstances (where a project may impact on an environmental
resource of critical concern) a party need only demonstrate a "fair argument" that a project may
5 have significant effect on the environment. This standard of review was recently outlined in

6 Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition v. City of Berkeley (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 880. There should

7 be no doubt that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone comprises an environmental resource of
8 critical concern. As noted in Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition, a "resource" is a "patural
source of wealth or revenue," or a "natural feature or phenomenon that enhances the quality of
10 human life." Legislature's explicit findings regarding the characteristics of the Zone in the Santa
11
8 Monica Mountains Conservancy Act more than meets this definitional requirement. Further, Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 LOS VPINS HUSIAN ESCO SIl!H Auereg 12 Petitioner demonstrated during the administrative process that the Project will have a potentially
13 significant environmental impact even after replacement trees are planted. Petitioner

14 commissioned an expert report and the author concluded that the loss of habitat of a sensitive
15 natural community constitutes significant impact that is not mitigated by application of the
16 City's Protected Tree Ordinance.
17 30. In sum, the use of the Class 3 single-family home exemption cannot be used
18 because of the project's location and the potential for significant impacts on the environment.
19 The Santa Monica Mountains are an environmental resource of critical concern that have been
20 designed and precisely mapped pursuant to state law, and the Project will have a potentially
21 significant impact on the environment.
22 31. Unusual Circumstances Pertaining to Biological Resources Renders Both Class 3
23 and Class 32 Exemption Unavailable. Both of the exemptions utilized by the City are
24 unavailable due to "unusual circumstances." Application of both exemptions is limited by the
25 factors described in section 15300.2." An exemption should be denied if one of the exceptions
26 listed in section 15300.2 of the Guidelines applies. Section 15300.2, subdivision (c), of the
27 Guidelines provides for one such exception and states that if there is a "reasonable possibility"
28

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of a "significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances," then the categorical
2 exception cannot apply. A "circumstance is 'unusual' .. . judged relative to the typical
3 circumstances related to an otherwise typically exempt project." Voices for Rural Living v. El

4 Dorado Irr. Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1108-09. Petitioner commissioned an expert

5 report from Land Protection Partners to demonstrate that mere replacement of trees would not

6 reduce the impacts of the Project on biological resources. Notably, the expert concluded that
the loss of habitat of a sensitive natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not

8 mitigated by application of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

32. The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Proposed Mitigation
10 Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval for the Project. Significantly, in
11
3 evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on mitigation Channel Law Group, LLP L LZ06 a measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis for

S BynS "PAE BJJYSIM €888 12

13 determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection &
'SIl!H ueseg 14 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.
15 33. The City has sought to deem this project "exempt" from City by way of an
16 environmental mitigation measure namely, the planting of replacement trees on the property.
17 However, the general requirement to plant replacement trees is not a regulatory compliance
18 measure at all. Rather, it is a discretionary environmental mitigation measure. The City's
19 Protected Tree Ordinance states as follows:

20 "The Board of Public Works or its authorized officer or employee may [r]equire as a
21 condition of a grant of permit for the relocation or removal of a protected tree, that the
property boundaries by at least two trees of a 22 permittee replace the tree within the same
23 protected variety included within the definition set forth in Section 46.01 of this Code, in
24 a manner acceptable to the Board."
25 LAMC Section 46.02(c).
26 34. The Ordinance uses the word "may" - not "shall." This is significant. The tree
27 replacements that are traditionally mandated by the Board of Public Works are discretionary
28

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environmental mitigation measures. They are not mandatory "regulatory compliance measures."
The City cannot use a mitigation measure to reach a determination that a project is exempt from
CEQA. This is fundamental black letter CEQA law.

35. Further, the Grading Division has issued a Geology and Soils Report Approval
5 Letter for the Project. This letter contains numerous conditions of approval. Many of these

6 conditions are not simply applications of the California Building Code or existing City of Los

7 Angeles regulations. The fact that the Geology Report contains specialized mitigation measures

8 renders the application of a categorical exemption in appropriate and unlawful.

36. The Project is Also Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Seeks to Defer
10 Application of Mitigation Measures to Another Date. Additionally, many of the conditions of
11 approval in the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter simply "kick the can" down the road 8 Channel Law Group, d77 L1Z06 eyns "paa eujys!m €:eg 12 and defer required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
13 37. Conditioning a project on another agency's future review of environmental 8
SIl!H ÁueAeg 14 impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other agency, is
15 insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency that potentially significant impacts will
16  be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring
17 formulation of mitigation measures at a future time violates the rule that members of the public
18 and other agencies must be given an opportunity to review mitigation measures before project
19 is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See League for Protection of Oakland Architectural &
20 Historic Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896; Gentry v. City of Murrieta
21 (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1396; Quall Botanical Ganlens Found., Inc. v. City of Encinitas
22 (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1605, fn. 4; Oro Fino Gold Mining Corp. V. Cnty. of El Dorado
23 (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 872, 884; Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p.
24 306, (condition requiring that mitigation measures recommended by future study to be conducted
25 by civil engineer evaluating possible soil stability, erosion, sediment, and flooding impacts was
26 improper). Moreover, a condition that requires implementation of mitigation measures to be
27 recommended in a future study may conflict the requirement that project plans incorporate

1 mitigation measures before a proposed negative declaration is released for public review. PRC §
2 21080, subd. (c)(2); 14 Cal Code Regs § 15070(b)(1). Studies conducted after a project's
3 approval do not guarantee an adequate inquiry into environmental effects. Such a mitigation

4 measure would effectively be exempt from public and governmental scrutiny.

5 38. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of

6 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to consider Petitioner's

7 appeal and conduct the required additional environmental analysis under CEQA before
8 approving the Project.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; Tree Removal Permit Issued for 2239 Laurel Canyon Boulevard; Council File # 18-0916: Log Reference 1-745954991

Dear City of Los Angeles:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Friends of Westwanda Drive ("Petitioner"), intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the City of Los Angeles (City" or "Respondent"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City incorrectly determined that the proposed single-family dwelling and associated tree removal permit located at 10034 Westwanda Drive ("Project") was exempt from CEQA. Among other things, the Petition will request that the court direct the City to vacate and rescind the project approvals, the determination that the project is exempt CEQA and to otherwise comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioners' cost and
attorneys' fees.
CuZLo Jamie T. Hall
Attorney for Petitioner
