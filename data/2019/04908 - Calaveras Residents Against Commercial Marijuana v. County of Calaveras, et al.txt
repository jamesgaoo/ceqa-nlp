INTRODUCTION

2 1. In 2017, Calaveras County prepared an Environmental Impact Report

3 ("EIR") to study the environmental impacts of a proposed Medical Cannabis Cultivation

4 and Commerce Ordinance ("Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance"), an ordinance that
would have allowed and regulated the commercial cultivation of marijuana for medical use

6 in the County.

2. The County, however, never approved that ordinance. Instead, on or about
8 January 10, 2018, to avoid the severe environmental impacts that would have resulted from
allowing commercial marijuana cultivation, the County of Calaveras and its Board of
10 Supervisors (collectively, "the County" or "Respondents") adopted an ordinance banning
11 commercial marijuana cultivation (*Ban Ordinance") and certified the EIR for the Ban
12 Ordinance.

13 3. Almost two years later, however, the County abruptly changed course. In
14 October of 2019, the Board of Supervisors adopted a new ordinance that, rather than
15 banning cultivation, would allow and regulate marijuana cultivation (Ordinance No.
16 2019102203122, the Commercial and Non-Commercial Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory
17 Ordinance, Chapter 17.95 of the County Code ("New Cultivation Ordinance")). The New
18 Cultivation Ordinance is substantially different from the Prior Denied Cultivation
19 Ordinance. For example, the County has stripped away measures that the former EIR
20 reviewed and would have required in the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance to protect the
21 environment.

22 4. In conjunction with the New Cultivation Ordinance, the County also adopted
23 a series of related resolutions and approvals as part of its new cannabis regulatory
24 program, including the Division of Cannabis Control, Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory
25 Fee, Cannabis Background Badge Ordinance, and Cannabis Background Clearance Badge
26 Fee (these approvals together with the New Cultivation Ordinance are referred to
27 collectively herein as "the Project").
28 5. The County adopted the New Cultivation Ordinance pursuant to an
2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Conn Ala

Addendum to the former EIR. It also concluded that most of its various other approvals
2 were exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources
3 Code section 21000 et seq. For one of these approvals, the creation of the Division of

4 Cannabis Control, the County failed to make any determinations pursuant to CEQA or

5 conduct any form of environmental review.

6 6. This lawsuit challenges the County's decision to adopt the Project, to
7 approve an Addendum to the former EIR for the New Cultivation Ordinance, and to
8 decide, variously, that the other related actions were either exempt from CEQA or not
9 "projects" within the meaning of that statute. The Project, which would open Calaveras
10 County to the commercial cultivation of marijuana for medical and adult recreational use,
11 would have devasting impacts on the environment. Marijuana cultivation at the scale
12 permitted by the Project would lead to significant environmental impacts, including animal
13 deaths from pesticide exposure, objectionable skunk-like odors seeping into neighbors'
14 houses, contamination of surface waters as chemicals wash off of marijuana grows,
15 significant depletion of groundwater supplies, increases in traffic, and potential increases
16 in crime associated with illegal marijuana activities. To provide just a few reported
17 examples:
18 "As federal and state officers approached a [marijuana] grow

19 site in Northern California, they discovered a black bear and her cubs seizing and convulsing as they slowly succumbed to

20 the neurological effects of .. . pesticides.'

21 "When they arrived [at a Calaveras County marijuana grow site], deputies found three men who had been fatally shot. Two

22 of the yíctims lay on a dirt roadway; the third was off the road. »2

23 "The Cannabis industry relies very heavily on using hazardous

24 and explosive substances Inspectors regularly encounter facilities experimenting with solvents or processes that haven't

-

2 been approved by the city or the state."3

7. Notably, the Project allows for far more intensive marijuana growth than the
3 Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance in that it would allow marijuana cultivation for

4

5 medical and recreational use. Additionally, the Project increases the maximum allowable

6 cultivation area per parcel from 22,000 square feet to 43,560 square feet,
§ 17.95.050(D)(2)4; allows the co-location of multiple grow sites, or premises, on a single
7 parcel, § 17.95.090(F); and allows single cultivators to amass multiple permits,
8 § 17.95.050(D)(15)(b). Together, these changes allow the concentration of intensive
9 marijuana operations owned by a single entity in marijuana mega-complexes of multiple
10 acres. Further, violations of the cannabis regulations, previously punishable as
11 misdemeanors, would now be punishable as infractions, providing less deterrent effect to
12 those who would seek to violate the law. § 17.95.160(F). Making matters worse, the
13 Project jettisons and/or undermines mitigation that the former EIR would have required to
14 reduce the significant

15 8. environmental effects of the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance.
The County's actions in approving the Project violated CEQA and the
16 CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. Among
17 other flaws, the County unlawfully approved an Addendum to the former EIR when it
18 should have prepared a new EIR. The County was required to prepare a new EIR because

19 it never approved the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance studied by the former EIR or
20 made the required findings for that ordinance. Additionally, the County was required to

21 a prepare a new EIR because the Project and its surrounding circumstances have changed So
22 significantly from the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance and the former EIR that the
23 former EIR is no longer relevant to the Project and its environmental review.
24 9. In the alternative, the County violated CEQA by approving an Addendum
25 rather than a Supplemental EIR ("SEIR"). Even if the County could rely on the prior

28 Joel Schwartz, Calaveras County Fire Chiefs Association, statement to the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors (Feb. 19, 2019). All references to statutory sections are to the Calaveras County Code unless otherwise indicated.
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

environmental review, it would need to prepare a SEIR for the Project, rather than an
2 Addendum, due to changes in the project, changed circumstances, and new information
3 showing that the Project would have new or more severe environmental impacts than

4 previously studied. The County failed to account for significant impacts that would result

5 from, among other things, the intensive concentration of marijuana cultivation that the new
6 ordinance would allow and the elimination or modification or mitigation measures
7 provided in the former EIR.

8 10. Respondents' approval of the Project also violates State Planning and Zoning
9 Law, Government Code section 65300 et seq., because the Project is inconsistent with the

10 County's General Plan. Additionally, the County approved the new cultivation ordinance
11 despite the fact that the County's 1996 General Plan in place at the time the Project was
12 approved is legally deficient under the state law governing general plans, and the Project
13 implicates that deficiency. As such, the ordinance is invalid and void.

14 11. By approving the Project, Respondents have opened the County to a flood of
15 marijuana growth and all of the disastrous environmental impacts that come with it
16 including, for example: skunk-like odors; illegal pesticides in the soil, water, and,
17 ultimately, in the bodies of Calaveras's residents, visitors, and animals; increased traffic;
18 decreased groundwater; and increased safety risks. The County must withdraw its
19 approvals of the Project and conduct an environmental review that adequately and
20 accurately analyzes such significant or potentially significant impacts and the threats the
21 Project poses to Calaveras County and its residents and visitors, and mitigates or avoids
22 any significant impacts to the extent feasible.

23 PARTIES

24 12. Petitioner Calaveras Residents Against Commercial Marijuana ("Calaveras
25 Residents" or "Petitioner") is an unincorporated group of ordinary citizens residing in
26 Calaveras County that works to protect the future of its children, neighborhoods,
27 communities, and county from the negative environmental effects of commercial
28 marijuana cultivation. The organization was formed to oppose commercial marijuana
5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Cann

1 cultivation in Calaveras County. Calaveras Residents and its members seek to preserve the

2 quiet, peace, and rural beauty of the county and its natural landscape, and to prevent
3 environmental impacts, such as noxious odors, traffic, noise, water impacts, and safety
4 hazards, associated with marijuana cultivation activity. The individual members of
5 Calaveras Residents include residents and taxpayers of Calaveras County who live near the
6 areas that the Project would open to commercial marijuana activity, and who would be
7 negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts and improper land use
8 approvals. The interests that Calaveras Residents seeks to further in this action are directly
9 related to the goals and purposes of the organization. Calaveras Residents and its members
10 have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with CEQA, the CEQA
11 Guidelines, and the State Planning and Zoning Law. These interests would be directly and
12 adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this
13 Petition and which would cause substantial and irreversible harm to the natural
14 environment. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial
15 benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms
16 alleged herein. Calaveras Residents submitted comments to the County objecting to and
17 commenting on the Project and the Addendum.

18 13. The individual members of Calaveras Residents would be irreparably
19 harmed by the significant environmental impacts associated with the implementation of the
20 Project and the environmental damage that would be caused by commercial marijuana
21 operations in the County, including, but not limited to, decreased groundwater supplies,
22 noxious odors, increased traffic, increased greenhouse gas emissions, damage to sensitive
23 plant and animal species and habitat, and increased safety risks.
24 14. Respondent County of Calaveras, a political subdivision of the State of
25 California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated
26 territory of the County, including, but not limited to, implementing and complying with the
27 provisions of CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law. Respondent County of
28 Calaveras is the "lead agency" for purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with
6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
(oca Mo

principal responsibility for conducting environmental review and approving the Project.

2 15. Respondent Board of Supervisors is the duly elected legislative body for
Calaveras County. As the County's decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors is
charged with the responsibilities under CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law for

5 conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting
6 the various approvals necessary for the Project.

7 16. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents Doe 1 through Doe 20, inclusive, and
therefore sues said Respondents under fictional names. Petitioner alleges, upon
10 information and belief, that each fictionally named Respondent is responsible in some

11 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based. Petitioner will amend this
12 Petition to show their true names and capacities if and when the same have been

13 I ascertained.

14 17. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
15 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Doe 21 through Doe 40,
16 inclusive, and therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioner
17 alleges, upon information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is
18 responsible in some manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has
19 material interests affected by the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the
20 Project. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities if and
21 when the same have been ascertained.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 18. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085
24 (alternatively section 1094.5), and 1087; and Public Resources Code sections 21168.5
25 (alternatively section 21168) and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of
26 mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project.

27 19. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this
28 Petition arose in Calaveras County where the proposed Project takes place.

8 22. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code
9 section 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General on
10 November 21, 2019. A copy of the letter transmitting this Petition is attached hereto as
11 Exhibit B.

12 23. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this
13  instant action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
14 required by law. Each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition was timely raised
15 by Calaveras Residents, by its members, or by others.
16 24. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
17 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set
18 aside their approval of the Project, the Addendum, and their exemption determinations. In
19 the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of
20 state law.

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 History of Cannabis Regulations in Calaveras County
23 25. Cannabis is listed by the federal government as a Schedule I controlled
24 substance under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 801 § et seq. As such, the
25 possession or use of cannabis, including for medical purposes, is illegal under federal law.

26 26. California voters legalized the cultivation and use of medical marijuana
27 | under state law in November 1996.

28 27. In November 2016. California voters passed Proposition 64, titled "The
8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

P Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act," which legalized and regulated the
2 recreational use of marijuana by adults. A majority of voters in Calaveras County voted
3 against Proposition 64 and opposed the legalization of marijuana for adult recreational use.

4 28. In June 2017, the California legislature enacted the Medical and Adult Use

5 Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act ("MAUCRSA"). Under MAUCRSA, the legislature
6 directed various state agencies to issue regulations related to commercial cannabis.

7 29. State law allows local governments considerable flexibility and discretion to
8 regulate cannabis cultivation and commercial cannabis activity. For example, Proposition

9 64 allows local governments to completely prohibit commercial cannabis activity, or to
10 prohibit outdoor cultivation of cannabis. Local governments may also adopt zoning or
11 other laws regulating where cannabis businesses may occur, and requiring businesses to
12 obtain permits or licenses from local agencies in addition to the licenses required by the
13 state. See Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 26200.

14 30. In February 2016, the Board of Supervisors directed County staff to prepare

15 an ordinance regulating commercial cannabis activities at that time, related to medical
16| use only.

17 31. In May 2016, the Board of Supervisors adopted an interim urgency
18 ordinance establishing land use regulations concerning the cultivation, manufacture,
19 testing, distribution, transportation, and storage of medical marijuana within the County,
20 pending environmental review and adoption of a permanent ordinance. The urgency
21 ordinance allowed for the registration of existing cannabis operations. Over 700
22 applications for registration were filed. Half of those applications were denied, and the
23 County was unable to complete the review process for some applicants. The urgency
24 ordinance expired on February 14, 2018.
25 The Prior Environment Impact Report, the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance, and
26 the Ban Ordinance.

27 32. On April 7, 2016, the County issued a notice of preparation ("NOP") for an
28 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). The EIR identified the prior cultivation ordinance
9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
CARA ATA

P as the proposed project. The draft EIR ("DEIR") was released for public comment from

2 May 1, 2017, through June 14, 2017. The County issued a final EIR ("FEIR") on

3 September 5, 2017.

4 33. The prior cultivation ordinance, as analyzed in the former EIR, included
5 regulations governing the cultivation, manufacture, testing, distribution, transportation, and
6 storage of medical marijuana within Calaveras County. The regulations restricted the
7 location, type, and size of commercial activities involving medical marijuana and included
measures to attempt to control the adverse environmental impacts associated with

9 commercial marijuana cultivation. In particular, the regulations:

10 a. Limited the maximum cultivation area per parcel to 22,000 square feet
11 for outdoor, mixed light, and indoor cultivation;

12 b. Allowed commercial activities related to medical cannabis use only;

13 C. Allowed cultivators who registered under the 2016 urgency ordinance
14 five years to apply for and receive a cannabis cultivation permit;
15 d. Required biological site assessments prepared in compliance with
16 Regional Water Quality Control Board Order R5-2015-0113 (*2015 Regional Water
17 Quality Order");

18 e. Required background checks, to be conducted by the Calaveras
19 County Sheriff, for all individuals applying for a commercial medical cannabis permit; and
20 f. Required soil sampling to look for the presence of unpermitted
21 pesticides.

22 34. The former EIR concluded that the prior cultivation ordinance would have
23 significant and unavoidable adverse impacts on the environment. In particular, the EIR
24 determined that commercial activities related to medical marijuana would generate
25 objectional odors. The marijuana-related odors would be so substantial, the EIR stated, that
26 setbacks would not be sufficient to prevent "detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to a
27 substantial number of people.' DEIR, ES-2. The EIR also concluded that the proposed
28 project could produce a long-term increase in traffic. Id.
10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

35. The former EIR concluded that other significant or potentially significant
2 environmental impacts of the prior cultivation ordinance would be reduced to less than
3 significant impacts only with the implementation of specific mitigation measures. For
4 example, the EIR concluded that:

5 a. Greenhouse-gas-emissions-related impacts would be reduced to less

6 than significant levels only with the implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.2-2, which
7 prohibited the use of fossil fuel-powered outdoor power equipment during operations at
8 cannabis grow sites and processing facilities, and 3.2-3, which required applicants to
9 demonstrate certain reductions in annual greenhouse gas emissions. DEIR, ES-4 to ES-5;
10 FEIR, 3-2.

11 b. Groundwater supply impacts would be reduced to less than significant
12 levels only with the implementation of Mitigation Measure 3.5-3, which required
13 applicants to prepare and implement a well-monitoring program, with tests completed
14 monthly during August, September, and October of each year, to test for continuous
15 decline in water levels in water supply wells. DEIR, ES-9; FEIR, 3-2 to 3-3.
16 C. Impacts related to ten distinct impact areas, including (1) special
17 status species, (2) modification or loss of streamside habitat, (3) local policies protecting
18 biological resources, (4) disturbance or loss of wildlife migratory corridors, (5) historical
19 resources, (6) disturbance of archaeological resources, (7) construction water quality, (8)
20 operational water quality, (9) surface drainage and onsite and offsite flooding, and (10)
21 degradation or removal of sensitive natural communities, would be reduced to less than
22 significant levels only with the implementation of Mitigation Measures 3.3-1 and 3.3-3.
23 DEIR, ES-7 to ES-9; FEIR, 3-2. Mitigation Measures 3.3-1 and 3.3-3 effectively required
24 compliance with the provisions of the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order. See id.

25 36. The DEIR also analyzed three alternatives: the "No Project" alternative,
26 which assumed continuation of the status quo then existing, as well as the expiration of the
27 urgency ordinance; a Ban on Commercial Cannabis Operations Alternative ("Ban
28 Alternative"), which examined a countywide ban on commercial cannabis operations; and
11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

1 a Reduced Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis Operations, which

2 assumed a reduction in the zoning designations that would allow commercial cannabis

3 operations. DEIR 6-3. A fourth alternative, Minimum Parcel Sizes and Further Reduced
4 Zoning Designations Available for Commercial Cannabis Operations, was analyzed in the

5 FEIR. FEIR, 3-7 to 3-10.

6 37. The EIR concluded that the ban alternative was the environmentally superior

7 alternative, and that the ban alternative would meet the project objectives to
8 "comprehensively regulate cannabis within the County and seek to maintain the health,
9 safety, and well-being of County residents and the environment." DEIR 6-9, 6-12.
10 38. On January 10, 2018, the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors certified

11 the former EIR.

12 39. Despite the fact that the EIR analyzed the prior cultivation ordinance as the
13 proposed project, the Board denied that ordinance and instead adopted the Ban Ordinance,
14 the environmentally superior alternative. The Ban Ordinance prohibited, to the maximum
15 extent allowed under state law, with limited exceptions, the commercial, medical, and
16 recreational cultivation, manufacture, processing, testing, distribution, transportation, and
17 storage of cannabis.

18 40. The Board adopted findings related to the Ban Ordinance. That document did
19 not include any findings concerning the specific significant impacts of the Prior Denied
20 Cultivation Ordinance described in the EIR, nor did it include any findings related to the
21 specific mitigation measures or other alternatives discussed in the EIR. Instead, the Board
22 "determined that the potential impacts of the Ban Ordinance are less than significant," and
23 thus that the Board was "not required to consider the feasibility of any project
24 alternatives." In adopting the Ban Ordinance as the environmentally superior alternative,
25 the Board explained that the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance "would result in
26 numerous environmental impacts and, while most of those impacts could be reduced to a
27 less-than-significant level with mitigation, the [Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance] would
28 result in traffic and odor impacts that would remain significant and unavoidable even with
12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Conn ATa

1 the mitigation measures identified in the EIR." The Board did not include a statement of
2 overriding considerations as to the prior cultivation ordinance, again because it denied that
3  ordinance.

4 The New Cultivation Ordinance

41. Despite the Board's determination, only one year earlier, that banning
6 cannabis cultivation was the environmentally superior course of action, in January 2019,
7 the Board of Supervisors directed County staff to prepare a new a cultivation ordinance

8 allowing commercial cannabis activities in the County.
42. Unlike the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance, the New Cultivation
10 Ordinance would allow cannabis cultivation for medical and recreational use.
11 Additionally, the maximum allowable cultivation area per parcel increased from 22,000
12 square feet under the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance to 43,560 square feet under the
13 New Cultivation Ordinance. § 17.95.050(D)(2). The New Cultivation Ordinance further
14 allows for multiple cultivation areas on a single parcel. § 17.95.090(F). And a single
15 permittee may amass multiple permits from those who are not using their permit rights.
16 § 17.95.050(D)(15)(b). Further, violations of the cannabis regulations, punishable as
17 misdemeanors under the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance, are now punishable only as
18 infractions under the New Cultivation Ordinance. § 17.95.160(F).

19 43. In addition to those changes, the New Cultivation Ordinance modifies

20 provisions related to mitigation that the former EIR had included for the Prior Denied

21 Cultivation Ordinance. For example, the New Cultivation Ordinance limits well
22 monitoring tests to the first five years after permit issuance, § 17.95.090(EE), while the
23 former EIR included no durational limitation, FEIR, 3-2 to 3-3. Further, the New

24 Cultivation Ordinance would allow significant declines in groundwater levels to occur year
25 after year, even during the first five years, § 17.95.140(C)(1), while the former EIR would
26 have required cultivators to obtain alternative water sources to remedy such declines,
27 FEIR, 3-2 to 3-3. Additionally, the New Cultivation Ordinance eliminates the prohibition
28 on the use of off-road equipment powered by fossil fuels set forth by the former EIR to
13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

reduce greenhouse gas emissions to less than significant levels. DEIR, ES-4 to ES-5.

2 44. In addition to the changes made in the new ordinance, the 2015 Regional
3 Water Quality Order, on which the EIR relied to reduce ten significant or potentially

4 significant impacts of the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance to less than significant
5 levels, has been rescinded and replaced by a statewide general order. See DEIR ES-7 to
6 ES-9; FEIR, 3-2.
7 Environmental Review of the New Cultivation Ordinance

8 45. County staff prepared an Addendum to the former EIR for the New
9 Cultivation Ordinance. An addendum is appropriate when "some changes or additions" to
10 a previously certified EIR are needed, "but none of the conditions described in Section

11 15162 [of the CEQA Guidelines] calling for preparation of a subsequent EIR have
12 occurred." CEQA Guidelines § 15164(a). Under section 15162, an agency must prepare a
13 subsequent EIR ("SEIR") where substantial changes proposed in the project or in the
14 surrounding circumstances would result in new significant environmental impacts or a
15 substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant environmental
16  impacts, or where new information of substantial importance shows that the project would
17 result in a new significant environmental impact or a substantial increase in the severity of a
18 previously identified significant environmental impacts.
19 46. The Addendum concludes, despite the fact that the prior cultivation
20 ordinance was denied and despite the substantial differences between the Prior Denied
21 Cultivation Ordinance and the New Cultivation Ordinance, that major revisions to the
22 former EIR were unnecessary. The Addendum further concludes, based on a flawed and
23 inadequate analysis, that the New Cultivation Ordinance would not result in new
24 significant environmental impacts or impacts that would be substantially more severe than
25 those identified in the former EIR.

26 47. On August 21, 2019, a member of Calaveras Residents made a written
27 request to the Planning Department for additional parcel and acreage information in order
28 to determine the total area where marijuana growth would be allowed under the New
14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

1 Cultivation Ordinance. On August 29, 2019, County Counsel's office denied that request.

2 48. The Planning Commission considered the New Cultivation Ordinance on
3 August 22; September 12, and September 18, 2019. On September 12 and 18, 2019,
4 members of Calaveras Residents requested to provide public comment, but were denied.
5 And on October 1 and 2, 2019, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to the
6 consider the New Cultivation Ordinance and Addendum.

7 49. Calaveras Residents submitted comments to the Planning Commission on
8 September 11, 2019, and to the Board of Supervisors on September 30 and October 21,
9 2019. In its comments, Calaveras Residents detailed numerous flaws of the Addendum and
10 described various ways in which changes to the project and its circumstances introduced
11 new significant environmental impacts or increased the severity of previously identified
12 significant environmental impacts.

13 50. Calaveras Residents commented that the County must prepare a new EIR for
14 the New Cultivation Ordinance because sections 15162 and 15164 of the CEQA
15 Guidelines do not apply in this instance. Those sections-and Public Resources Code
16 section 21166-apply when project has been subject to environmental review and
17 approved. But the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance -the ordinance against which the
18 Addendum compares the New Cultivation Ordinance-was never approved. Nor did the
19 County make specific findings about the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance. The County
20 approved and made specific findings concerning the Ban Ordinance only. The previously
21 adopted findings do not indicate that the County meaningfully considered, much less
22 agreed with, the former EIR's analysis and conclusions regarding the Prior Denied
23 Cultivation Ordinance. Because the County never approved the Prior Denied Cultivation
24 Ordinance, Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines sections 15162
25 and 15164 do not apply.

26 51. Calaveras Residents further commented that the County must prepare a new
27 EIR for the new cultivation ordinance because the Project and surrounding circumstances
28 have changed so drastically that the former EIR is no longer relevant. For example,
15
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

Calaveras Residents stated that the New Cultivation Ordinance allows cultivation for
2 recreational uses, while the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance only allowed cultivation
3 for medical uses. Further, the maximum allowable area devoted to cultivation on each
4 parcel increased, as did the number of cultivation sites that could be co-located on one
5 parcel. The New Cultivation Ordinance also abandoned mitigation measures that the

6 former EIR found necessary, including Mitigation Measure 3.2-2 and significant aspects of
7 Mitigation Measure 3.5-3. Changed surrounding circumstances described by Calaveras
8 Residents included the rescinding of the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order, upon which

9 ten mitigation measures relied. The Addendum entirely fails to analyze whether the new
10 order's provisions will prevent the associated ten significant impacts from occurring. As a
11 result of these and other changes to the Project and surrounding circumstances, the Project
12 will have new or more severe significant impacts on the environment. Furthermore, there
13 have been additional changes in the state regulatory landscape, and changes in the
14 prevalence of illegal marijuana activities in the County that, according to the Sheriff's
15 Department, increased with the adoption of the urgency ordinance.

16 52. In addition to the above, Calaveras Residents commented that, even if Public
17 Resources Code section 21166 applied to the new cultivation ordinance, the County must
18  prepare a SEIR, rather than an addendum, because substantial changes to the ordinance
19 (relative to the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance examined by the former EIR) and to
20 the surrounding circumstances would require major revisions of the EIR due to the
21 involvement of new significant environmental effects a or a substantial increase in the
22 severity of previously identified significant effects, and/or because new information
23 became available that shows that the New Cultivation Ordinance may have new significant
24 impacts or more severe significant impacts. For example:

25 a. Calaveras Residents commented that the New Cultivation Ordinance's

26 addition of cultivation for adult recreational use, in combination with the increase in
27 maximum permitted cultivation area per parcel, § 17.95.050(D)(2), the permitted co-
28 location of multiple premises per parcel, § 17.95.090(F), and the change to allow
16
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
ATA

1 applicants to amass multiple permits from others who are not using their rights,

2 § 17.95.050(D)(15)(b), would create new significant impacts or substantially increase the
3 severity of previously identified impacts because of an overall increase in the amount and
4 intensity of marijuana operations. In particular, these changes could allow a single operator
5 to group multiple marijuana operations of one acre each on a single large parcel, forming a

6 multi-acre marijuana mega-site. Calaveras Residents argued that the Addendum's assertion
7 that the overall area devoted to cannabis cultivation would decrease under the New
8 Cultivation Ordinance was fatally flawed, and the assumptions supporting that assertion

9 were inadequately justified. See Addendum, 4-5. Further, Calaveras Residents commented
10 that the provisions allowing marijuana mega-sites would lead to significant greenhouse gas
11 emissions and transportation impacts because of increased vehicle trips for larger numbers
12 of employees needed to serve these large operations. Cannabis mega-sites could also result
13 in significant impacts to hydrology and groundwater supplies in localized areas, as those
14 sites would concentrate runoff and demand for groundwater in a small area. a The
15 concentration of intensive cannabis operations could also create new significant impacts
16 related to the obstruction of movement corridors for animal species, noise caused by
17 tractor and heavy equipment use that would have been impractical on the smaller plots
18 allowed by the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance, and objectionable odors.

19 b. Calaveras Residents also commented that the elimination or
20 modification of mitigation measures assumed by the former EIR was a significant change

21 in the New Cultivation Ordinance that would lead to new and/or more severe significant
22 effects on the environment. For example, Calaveras Residents commented that the
23 modification of Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 would lead to significant impacts to groundwater
24 supplies. In the former EIR, Mitigation Measure 3.5-3 was imposed to require ongoing
25 monitoring of water supply wells to ensure that groundwater levels were not being
26 significantly reduced. The New Cultivation Ordinance, however, only requires well tests
27 for the first five years after permit issuance, § 17.95.090(EE), meaning that the County will
28 not be aware of any significant reductions in groundwater levels after that time and will
17
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief

not be in a position to prevent significant impacts from occurring. Additionally, the New

2 Cultivation Ordinance requires cultivators to show that water supplies are adequate to

3 serve cannabis operations, § 17.95.140(C)(1), while the former EIR would have required
4 cultivators to demonstrate that there had been no continuous decline in groundwater

5 supplies overall. This change further erodes Mitigation Measure 3.5-3's effectiveness: as

6 long as water supplies are adequate to serve cannabis operations, the new cultivation
7 ordinance allows groundwater supplies to decline without regard to the other important

8 uses for groundwater, such as supporting natural habitats or supplying other agricultural

9 uses, that may be affected. Calaveras Residents also commented that the elimination of
10 Mitigation Measure 3.2-2, which prohibited the use of fossil-fuel-powered equipment in

11 cannabis cultivation operations, would lead to significant impacts related to greenhouse
12 gas emissions.

13 C. Calaveras Residents further commented that the rescission of the 2015
14 Regional Water Quality Order was a significant change in circumstances that would lead
15 to new or more severe significant impacts. The EIR relies extensively on the 2015
16 Regional Water Quality Order, applied to cannabis cultivators through Mitigation Measure
17 3.1-1, to find that various impacts would be either insignificant or reduced to less-than-
18 significant levels. The 2015 Regional Water Quality Order was rescinded effective June
19 30, 2019, and replaced with a State General Order. The Addendum does not contain a
20 sufficient discussion of whether the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order's requirements are

21 present in the new State General Order. As a result, the public is unable to assess whether
22 potentially significant impacts related to special status species, modification or loss of
23 streamside habitat, local policies protecting biological resources, disturbance or loss of
24 wildlife migratory corridors, historical resources, disturbance of archaeological resources,
25 construction water quality, operational water quality, surface drainage and onsite and
26 offsite flooding, and degradation or removal of sensitive natural communities will be
27 effectively mitigated, or whether they will remain significant. Calaveras Residents
28 commented that the County must remedy its failure to inform the public about the potential
18
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
ATa

environmental impacts related to this significant change in circumstances by providing a

2 complete and adequate analysis in a SEIR.

3 d. Calaveras Residents commented that information about enforcement
4 activities, illegal marijuana operations, and pesticide use since the Ban Ordinance was
5 enacted was new information of substantial importance that could not have been known

6 before and that demonstrated the existence of new significant environmental impacts. In
7 particular, Calaveras Residents cited research showing that use of illegal pesticides, with
8 devastating impacts to biological resources, is widespread in Northern California, even on
9 permitted cannabis cultivation sites.

10 e. Calaveras Residents also commented that new studies that were not
11 available when the EIR was certified showed that cannabis cultivation sites could have a
12 previously unstudied significant impact on air quality because of emissions of Volatile
13 Organic Compounds from the cannabis plants themselves.
14 53. Calaveras Residents also commented that the new cultivation ordinance
15 violated the State Planning and Zoning Law. As an initial matter, Calaveras Residents
16 commented that the County did not have a legally compliant general plan, and that zoning
17 ordinances, like the New Cultivation Ordinance, which are enacted pursuant to a deficient
18 general plan and that implicate deficiencies of the general plan, are invalid and void.
19 Calaveras Residents commented that, among other flaws, the Calaveras County General
20 Plan at the time the County approved the Project failed to distinguish between
21 recommendations, background information, and adopted policies, and contains
22 inconsistent and improper descriptions of land use designations. The New Cultivation
23 Ordinance implicates both of these flaws and other deficiencies and cannot be adopted
24 until the County approves a valid general plan.

25 54. Calaveras Residents further commented that the new cultivation ordinance
26 violated both CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law because it conflicts with
27 policies of the County's General Plan. For example, Calaveras Residents commented that
28 the New Cultivation Ordinance conflicts with the General Plan's goals and policies:
19
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
ORRA Aa

a. Requiring the County to "work cooperatively with state and federal
2 agencies in the safe handling of hazardous materials." 1996 General Plan, Safety Element,
3 Page VII-17 (Safety Goal VII-5 and Safety Policy VII-5A). The Project conflicts with this
4 policy because cannabis cultivation is illegal under federal law, and no products are
approved for use associated with cannabis cultivation. As a result, the County will not be
able to work cooperatively with federal agencies to safely handle hazardous materials
7 associated with cannabis cultivation.

b. Requiring the County to require conditional use permits for all rural

9 home industries and consider permit applications on a case-by-case basis. 1996 General
10 Plan, Land Use Element, Page II-23 (Land Use Policy II-19A). The Project conflicts with
11 this policy because it allows for ministerial cannabis cultivation permits in certain low
12 density and rural/agricultural residential zones. See § 17.95.050(D).

13 C. Requiring the County to provide for adequate domestic water
14 supplies. 1996 General Plan, Conservation Element, Page IV-26 (Conservation Goal IV-
15 10). The Project conflicts with this policy because the County reduced the effectiveness of
16 Mitigation Measure 3.5-3, leading to potentially significant impacts related to groundwater
17 supplies.

18 55. Calaveras Residents provided further examples of conflicts between the New
19 Cultivation Ordinance and the policies and goals of the County's new proposed General
20 Plan, which had not been adopted at the time the County was considering the Project.

21 56. Despite receiving these comments, and similar negative comments from
22 others, on October 22, 2019, the Board of Supervisors approved the Addendum, adopted
23 the New Cultivation Ordinance, and adopted related findings.

24 57. Calaveras Residents had previously commented that the County's proposed
25 findings failed to comply with CEQA. For example, Calaveras Residents commented that
26 the finding stating that Mitigation Measure 3.2-2 is not needed to reduce greenhouse gas
27 impacts to less-than-significant levels in light of Mitigation Measure 3.2-3 is not supported
28 by substantial evidence, because it failed to account for the fact that Mitigation Measure
20
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Coro ATa

3.2-3 assumed that Mitigation Measure 3.2-2 would be in place. The County further failed

2 to sufficiently explain what had changed between the former EIR and the New Cultivation
3 Ordinance that made Mitigation Measure 3.2-2-which was feasible before suddenly
4 infeasible. Calaveras Residents also commented that the County's findings related to
5 groundwater supplies were inadequate and not supported by substantial evidence because
6 they failed to adequately address the effects of the changes to Mitigation Measure 3.5-3.
7 Calaveras Residents also commented that, to the extent that the findings do not address the

8 other new or more severe significant environmental impacts related to changes made to the

9 Project, the findings are not supported by substantial evidence. The County's final
10 approved findings failed to address or correct the flaws described in the comments
11 submitted by Calaveras Residents.

12 58. Although the version of the New Cultivation Ordinance approved by the
13 Board of Supervisors was different from the versions that had been before the Planning
14 Commission, Calaveras Residents commented that the revisions did not address the flaws
15 described in earlier comments and, in some instances, introduced or exacerbated problems.

16 59. In addition to adoption of the New Cultivation Ordinance, as part of its new
17 cannabis regulatory program, the County also took the following related actions on
18 October 22, 2019:

19 a. approved the Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Fee;

20 b. approved the Cannabis Background Badge Ordinance; and

21 C. approved the Cannabis Background Clearance Badge Fee.

22 60. Related to these approvals, the County filed the following notices with the
23 County Clerk on October 23, 2019:
24 a. a Notice of Determination for the Commercial and Non-Commercial
25 Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Ordinance (i.e., the New Cultivation Ordinance);

26 b. a Notice of Exemption for the Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Fee;

27 C. a Notice of Exemption for the Cannabis Background Badge
28 Ordinance; and
21
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Cono ATA

d. a Notice of Exemption for the Cannabis Background Clearance Badge

2 Fee.

3 61. In addition to the approvals listed above, on October 1, 2019, the County
4 conditionally approved the creation of the Division of Cannabis Control, pending approval

5 of the Project. The County did not issue a Notice of Exemption, Notice of Determination,

6 or any other CEQA notice related to this action.

7 62. Calaveras Residents consistently informed the County in its comments that
8 proceeding with these related actions as separate projects was a violation of CEQA. CEQA

9 defines a project as "the whole of an action." CEQA Guidelines § 15378. Agencies may
10 not lawfully chop one large project into many little projects to determine that each small
11 project would not have a significant effect on the environment, when, taken together, all of
12 the actions may have disastrous consequences. Calaveras Residents commented that the
13 badging ordinance, the creation of the Division of Cannabis Control, and any other related
14 actions had to be considered part of one single cannabis regulatory Project and analyzed in
15 an EIR. Calaveras Residents observed that the creation* of a new department could have
16 significant environmental impacts related to public services: for example, the department
17 could require the construction and operation of additional facilities, creating attendant
18 environmental impacts not discussed in the former EIR or Addendum.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)

21 63. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
22 paragraphs in their entirety.
23 64. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal
24 of long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the
25 environment. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause
26 a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

27 65. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that an

28 agency prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a
22
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Cono Aa

- fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. As the
2 cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and analyze a project's
3 potentially significant environmental impacts. In addition, the EIR also must inform
4 decision-makers and the public of feasible mitigation measures and alternative project
5 designs or elements that would lessen or avoid the project's significant adverse
6 environmental impacts.

7 66. CEQA also mandates that, if an agency determines to approve a project, the
8 agency shall adopt all feasible mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the
9 project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts
10 cannot feasibly be mitigated to a less-than-significant level, the project can be approved

11 only if there are no feasible, environmentally superior alternatives available and the agency
12 finds that the project's benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.
13 67. Under CEQA, all findings required for the public agency's approval of a
14 project must be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the
15 administrative record. CEQA further requires that an agency provide an explanation of
16 how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions that the agency has reached.
17 68. CEQA requires agencies to prepare a SEIR where (a) substantial changes are
18 proposed to the project; (b) substantial changes occur in the circumstances under which the
19 project is to be undertaken; or (c) new information of substantial importance emerges, and
20 the changes or new information cause or demonstrate, respectively, new significant
21 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
22 significant effects.

23 69. The County violated CEQA by approving an Addendum for the new
24 cultivation ordinance that is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of
25 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. The County should have conducted independent
26. environmental review of the New Cultivation Ordinance and related Project approvals
27 because the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance, to which the New Cultivation Ordinance
28 was compared in the Addendum, was never approved. Instead, the County approved a Ban
23
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Cona Aa

1 Ordinance and made CEQA findings only with respect to that ordinance.

2 70. The County further violated CEQA by approving an Addendum for the New

3 Cultivation Ordinance when the Project and surrounding circumstances have changed so

4 significantly that the former EIR is no longer relevant to the Project and the related

5 environmental issues.

6 71: Even without performing independent environmental review for the Project,
7 the County violated CEQA by preparing an Addendum when the County should have at
8 least prepared a SEIR. All three requirements for a SEIR are met here. The Project has

9 changed significantly from the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance discussed in the former
10 EIR, thereby requiring a SEIR. Changes that will lead to new or more severe significant
11 environmental impacts include, but are not limited to, allowing cannabis cultivation for
12 medical and recreational use, increasing the maximum allowable cultivation area per
13 parcel, § 17.95.050(D)(2), allowing co-location of multiple grow sites on a single parcel,
14  § 17.95.090(F), and eliminating or modifying provisions related to mitigation that the
15 former EIR would have required for the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance. Changed
16 circumstances that result in significant environmental impacts also compel a SEIR. For
17 example, the regulatory landscape has changed significantly since the former EIR was
18 certified, and the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order, on which the former EIR
19 extensively relied, was rescinded and replaced with a different order. The Addendum fails
20 to identify whether the new order adequately mitigates the significant impacts that the
21 former EIR determined would have been reduced to less than significant levels via
22 compliance with the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order. Finally, a SEIR is required if
23 new information that was not previously known shows new or more severe impacts than
24 previously identified. Here, such information includes, but is not limited to, information
25 about illegal marijuana activities, pesticide use, and information about air quality impacts
26 from cannabis plants. Such information was not known and could not have been known
27 when the former EIR was developed and indicates that new or more severe impacts will
28 occur.
24
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Cona Aa

72: The County further violated CEQA by approving an Addendum that relies

2 on an incomplete and unstable description of the Project and the Project setting. For

3 example, the project description impermissibly piecemeals the components of the County's
4 new cannabis regulatory program, fails to adequately describe the changes to the Project,
5 including but not limited to amendments and the elimination or modification of mitigation
6 measures found necessary by the former EIR, and fails to provide relevant information
7 and/or otherwise adequately justify the Addendum's assumption that the new cultivation

8 ordinance would result in less overall cannabis cultivation in the County than would have

9 resulted from the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance discussed in the former EIR.

10 73. The County further violated CEQA by approving an Addendum that failed to

11 adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's significant impacts on the
12 environment, including, but not limited to: (1) significant impacts related to greenhouse
13 gas emissions, traffic and vehicle miles traveled, hydrology and groundwater supplies,
14 obstruction of movement corridors, noise, and objectionable odors as a result of multiple
15 concentrated, co-located cannabis cultivation operations of one acre each allowed by the
16 new cultivation ordinance; (2) significant impacts, such as to greenhouse gas emissions
17 and groundwater supplies, related to the elimination of mitigation identified by the former
18 EIR for the Prior Denied Cultivation Ordinance; (3) numerous significant or potentially
19 significant impacts related to the rescission of the 2015 Regional Water Quality Order; (4)
20 impacts related to biological resources and hazardous materials revealed by new

21 information about illegal marijuana operations, enforcement, and pesticide use; (5) various
22 significant impacts related to the County's reliance on infeasible mitigation measures; (6)
23 significant impacts related to air quality revealed by new information about emissions from
24 cannabis plants; and (7) significant land use impacts related to the Project's conflicts and
25 inconsistencies with the County's General Plan.

26 74. The County further violated CEQA by approving an Addendum that failed to
27 adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant cumulative and growth-
28 inducing impacts.
25
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief
Conn ATa

- 75. The County further violated CEQA by approving an Addendum that failed to
2 consider an adequate range of alternatives. The Addendum improperly rejected potentially
3 feasible alternatives suggested by Petitioners and others, including but not limited to the no

4

5 project alternative of continuing with the Ban Ordinance.

76. The County further violated CEQA by finding elements of the Project to be
6 exempt from or not a "project" under CEQA, when, collectively, the Project as a whole has
7 numerous significant environmental impacts.

8 77. The County also violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The
9 County's findings do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to
10 conclusions, as required by law. The Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding
11 Considerations are unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.

12 78. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
13 discretion by approving an Addendum that does not comply with the requirements of
14 CEQA or the CEQA Guidelines and precluded informed decision-making. As such, the
15 County's approval of the Addendum and approvals of the Project must be set aside.
16

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 79. (Violations of the State Planning and Zoning Law)
Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding
19 paragraphs in their entirety.
20 80. The State Planning and Zoning Law requires the County to adopt and
21 maintain a legally adequate and compliant general plan. Failure to do so renders the
22 general plan invalid. State Planning and Zoning Law also requires that land use decisions
23 be consistent with the jurisdiction's legally adequate general plan. If the general plan is not
24 legally adequate, land use decisions adopted pursuant to the general plan and that implicate
25 the general plan's legal inadequacies will be invalid and void.

26 81. The County's General Plan in effect at the time the County adopted the
27 Project was and is not compliant with the State Planning and Zoning Law. The County
28 therefore violated the State Planning and Zoning Law by adopting the Project, which
26 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief NanA ATa

implicates the General Plan's deficiencies, pursuant to the County's defective General
2 Plan. The Project, including the zoning ordinances adopted as part of the Project, is
3 therefore invalid and void.

82. The County further violated the State Planning and Zoning law by adopting

5 the Project despite its inconsistencies with the County's General Plan. The Project is

6 inconsistent with General Plan policies including, but not limited to, Safety Goal VII-5,
7 Safety Policy VII-5A, Land Use Policy II-19A, and Conservation Goal IV-10.

8 83. The County's actions as described herein constitute a prejudicial abuse of
9 discretion in that they reflect failure to proceed in the manner required by law and are not
10 supported by substantial evidence. Respondents' adoption of the Project must be declared
11 void and set aside and the matter remanded to Respondents for proper consideration.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

14 84. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to
15 vacate and set aside their (a) approval of the Addendum; (b) adoptions of Findings of Fact
16 and Statement of Overriding Considerations; and (c) approvals of the Project, including the
17 New Cultivation Ordinance, the Cannabis Cultivation Regulatory Fee, the Cannabis
18 Background Badge Ordinance, the Cannabis Background Clearance Badge Fee, and the
19 creation of the Division of Cannabis Control.

20 85: For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to
21 comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action as required by
22 Public Resources Code section 21168.9;

23 86. For a judicial determination and declaration from this Court that:

24 a. the Project is inconsistent with the County's General Plan, and that
25 approval of the Project violates State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code
26 § 65300 et seq.; and/or

27 b. the County's General Plan pursuant to which the Project was adopted
28 is not compliant with the State Planning and Zoning Law, and the Project approvals are
27

Conn AA

1 therefore invalid and void.

2 87. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
3 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, and employees,

4 and all others acting in concert with Respondents on their behalf, from taking any action to
5 implement the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the
6 CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and Zoning Law, a newly adopted and legally adequate
7 Calaveras County General Plan, and other applicable laws;

8 88. For a stay, and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief,
9 restraining any Real Party in Interest and its agents, employees, officers, and
10 representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the Project in any way pending
11 full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and
12 Zoning Law, a newly adopted and legally adequate Calaveras County General Plan, and
13 other applicable laws;

14 89. For costs of the suit;

15 90. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5

16 and other provisions of law; and
17 91. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
