] I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff SHAMROCK/OUTLETS AT THE BORDER LLC

3 ("Shamrock") brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

4 (*Petition") against Respondents and Defendants CITY OF SAN DIEGO, CITY COUNCIL OF

5 THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO, and the PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF SAN

6 DIEGO (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") and Real Party in Interest BAJA-MEX

7 INSURANCE SERVICES INC. ("Baja-Mex" or "Real Party"), challenging the City's October

8 25, 2018, adoption of Addendum No. 375960 to the Program Environmental Impact Report for

9 the San Ysidro Community Plan Update (No. 310690/SCH No. 2015111012) (*Addendum") for

d'TT'NO3AHOS HASHVA LLVAH NIBISNMOHS 10 Baja-Mex's proposed Virginia Avenue Parking Garage ("Project"), as a violation of the

11 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").
OLS1 anng *KeMpong 0005-10126 PD *o62j0 5 5 12 Shamrock also challenges the City's May 14, 2019, approval of a Coastal Development Permit,

13 Planned Development Permit, and Neighborhood Use Permit ("Land Use Permits") for the

14 Project.

15 2. The Project proposes the construction of a six story, 70 foot high monolithic

16 parking structure at the entrance to a vital commercial area in the San Ysidro community and the

17 San Y sidro international border crossing. The Project's design and building footprint is in stark

18 contrast to the surrounding uses and the applicable land use plan. Further, the traffic generated by

19 the Project will create a significant safety concern for pedestrians and cars alike.

20 3. Disregarding these impacts, the City analyzed the Project's environmental impacts

21 via the Addendum, rather than a subsequent or supplemental environmental impact report

22 ("EIR"), and granted the Land Use Permits after approving several deviations from the applicable

23 building restrictions.

24 4. Accordingly, Shamrock respectfully seeks a writ of mandate requiring the City to

25 rescind, void, and vacate any and all motions and resolutions reflecting its approval of the Project,

26 adoption of the Addendum and granting of the Land Use Permits. These motions and resolutions

27 include, but may not be limited, to City Council Resolution No. 312463, which granted the Land

28 Use Permits for the Project, and the Planning Commission's adoption of the Addendum.
19350696 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 5. Shamrock also prays for appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the City from

2 taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this

3 litigation and prior to complying with CEQA and applicable land use and zoning laws.

4 II. PARTIES

5 6. Petitioner Shamrock is a limited liability company organized and existing under

6 the laws of the State of Delaware and registered to do business in California. Shamrock has an

7 interest in The Outlets at the Border, a retail outlet mall located at 4463 Camino de la Plaza, San

8 Ysidro, California 92173, directly south of the Project. Pedestrians and vehicles frequenting The

9 Outlets at the Border use the same sidewalks and roads as would pedestrians and vehicles
1

ATTYMMUOS HMMVA.LIVAH MIMISNMONS 10 accessing the Project site. The health and safety of The Outlets at the Border's employees and

11 customers will be directly affected by the Project as the Project will cause significant adverse
0005-10126 VO *033 l OED1 SRS KENPONE SEE 12 impacts, which have not been adequately analyzed or mitigated to the extent feasible. Shamrock

13 is suing on its behalf, and on behalf of others who will be affected in the area surrounding the

14 Project, as well as for all citizens more broadly, including those who seek to maintain the

15 integrity and fairness of the environmental review and land use entitlement process.

16 7. Respondent City of San Diego is a municipality governed by a City Charter and a

17 political subdivision of the State of California.

18 8. Respondent City of San Diego City Council is the elected governing body of the

19 City.

20 9. Respondent City of San Diego Planning Commission is an inferior decision-

21 making body for the City, appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the City Council.

22 10. Real Party in Interest Baja-Mex Insurance Services Inc. is a California corporation

23 and the Project applicant.

24 11. Shamrock is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents

25 and Defendants DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by fictitious

26 names. Shamrock will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when the

27 same has been ascertained.

28
2 19350696

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

12. Shamrock is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties-in-

2 Interest ROES 11-20, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by fictitious names. Shamrock

3 will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when the same has been

4 ascertained.

5 MI. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 13. This Petition is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085

7 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq., including sections 21168, 21168.5

8 and 21168.9. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the above provisions and

9 because the Respondents and Real Party named in this litigation are present and operating within
JTT*NOINHOS NISUVA LLYAH NIGISNMONA 10 the jurisdictional limits of the County of San Diego.

11 14. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
0005-10126 V3 -3gl t oLft agrs Keaproug szz 12 sections 393, 394 and 395 because the Project is located in, and impacts the residents of, the

13 County of San Diego, and because all of the acts and omissions complained of took place within

14 the County of San Diego. Venue is also proper because Respondents are located within the 5
15 County of San Diego.

16 IV. STANDING

17 15. Shamrock has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in the City's full and

18 complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in approving the Project.

19 16. The City owed mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal

20 authorities under CEQA and all other applicable laws before exercising its discretion to approve

21 the Project.

22 17. Shamrock also has the right to enforce the public's right and duties that CEQA and

23 all other applicable laws impose on the City.

24 18. Shamrock has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

25 of law, and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested herein.

26 V. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

27 19. Shamrock objected to approval of the Project prior to the close of the Planning

28 Commission hearings, and appealed the Planning Commission's approval to the City Council.
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19350696

Shamrock also objected to approval of the Project prior to the close of the City Council hearing

2 on the Project.

20. The grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in

4 the Petition are consistent with the objections to the Project raised by Shamrock prior to the close

5 of the public hearings on the Project.

6 21. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in

7 this Petition were, for some reason, not raised prior to the close of the public hearings on the

8 Project, it was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise

9 those objections prior to the approval of the Project, or because the City failed to give notice

10 required by law.

11 22. Shamrock has exhausted its administrative remedies.

0005-10176 VD ulagg a SST 5 H SEE BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 12 VI. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

13 23. The Project site, 4575 Camino de la Plaza, San Ysidro, California 92173, is 0.733

14 acres in size and is located on the southwest corner of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue,

15 identified as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" and "secondary gateway" in the San Ysidro

16 Community Plan ("SYCP"). (SYCP, pp. 4-2, 4-42.)

17 24. The Project site is zoned CR-1-2 (Commercial-Regional) and is within the San

18 Ysidro Commercial District of the SYCP.

19 25. Land uses immediately surrounding the site include the Las Americas Premium

20 Outlets to the west, The Outlets at the Border to the southwest, the City's Virginia Avenue

21 Transit Center and the federal San Ysidro Land Port of Entry pedestrian crossing to Mexico to the

22 south and southeast, and parking lots to the northeast and east. Surrounding buildings are

23 generally one and two story commercial buildings with setbacks and landscaping on street

24 frontage,

25 26. As described in the SYCP, the outlets in the San Y sidro Commercial District

26 "have been successful in attracting regional and bi-national shoppers and tourists traveling to and

27 from Mexico." (SYCP, p. 2-17.) Further, the Port of Entry "is one of the busiest international

28 border crossings in the world and continues to function as a significant international community
19350696

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and tourist terminal." (SYCP, p. 2-22.) Acknowledging these important community facilities,

2 the SYCP includes policies to protect and enhance the outlets and the Port of Entry. (See, e.g.,

3 SYCP, Policies 2.3.4 & 3.9.1-3,9.8.)
v 27. The Project site currently contains a one story, 2,400 square foot building and

5 associated 54-space surface parking lot, which is permitted as part of the International Gateway of

6 the Americas project ("International Gateway Project"). The International Gateway Project was

7 granted a Coastal Development Permit/Site Development Permit (No. 40-0338) by the City in

8 2001 and currently consists of over 650,000 square feet of commercial development on a 57-acre

9 site in the SYCP.

10 28. The Project proposes to demolish the one story building and surface parking
1NDTUHOS HIAYVA LIVAH NITASNMONS 11 spaces on the Project site and construct a six a story parking structure, containing over 13,210
0005-10126 V3 *oRaro : 0La) aims 'Komppoug szz 12 square feet of ground-level retail space and 349 parking spaces.

13 29. The Project's building will be 70 feet tall and will be setback less than ten feet on

14 and south sides. The building, in other words, would be a monolithic block on the its east, west S
15 corner of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue, one of the primary intersections in the San

16
To approve the Project's building, the City was required to process deviations Ysidro Community.

17 30.

18 from the Municipal Code's setback, height, ground floor height and signage restrictions.

19 31. Access to the Project site is currently restricted to eastbound travelers on' Camino

20 de la Plaza via a driveway on the northern portion of the Project site. The Project proposes to

21 change the access to the site by adding left turn lane for westbound travelers on Camino de la

22 Plaza to access the Project site. The turn lane would be 100 feet from the intersection of Camino

23 de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue and would require westbound travelers to cross three eastbound

24 lanes of traffic, one bicycle a lane and a heavily travelled pedestrian sidewalk to enter the Project

25 site.

26 32. The City tiered its environmental analysis of the Project off the Program

27 Environmental Impact Report for the San Ysidro Community Plan Update (No. 310690/SCH No.

5 28 2015111012) (*SYCP EIR").

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19350696

33. The SYCP EIR was certified by the City Council on August 5, 2016 and provides

2 the environmental analysis for the San Ysidro Community Plan Update. The SYCP EIR states:

3 "This PEIR is specifically intended to implement the intent of Section 15183 of the CEQA

4 Guidelines dealing with subsequent approvals of projects which are consistent with the

5 Community Plan for which a PEIR has been prepared." (SYCP EIR, p. 1-2.)

6 34. The SYCP EIR further states that the City will conduct "an Initial Study for each

7 subsequent project to determine if any impacts related to the project" meet certain criteria which

8 will require additional environmental review for the project. (SYCP EIR, pp. 1-2-3.)

9 35. The City prepared the Addendum, which concluded that: "Based upon a review of

dTT'XJANHOS 83SXVA LLVAH NIALSNALONA 10 the current project, none of the situations described in Sections 15162 and 15164 of the State

11 CEQA Guidelines apply. No changes in circumstances have occurred, and no new information of
0005-10T 12 substantial importance has manifested, which would result in new significant or substantially

225 Broadway, 13
Sen Diego, C increased adverse impacts as a result of the project." (Addendum, p. 4.)

14 36. The Planning Commission held a hearing on October 4, 2018 to consider the

15 Project. Shamrock submitted a comment letter to the Planning Commission in opposition to the

16 Project and made oral comments during the hearing.

17 37. Among other things, Shamrock's comments detailed the Project's significant

18 traffic, visual, and neighborhood character impacts. Specifically, Shamrock noted the serious

19 pedestrian and vehicle safety concerns generated by the Project. For example, westbound

20 vehicles attempting to access the Project driveway will have to navigate through three eastbound

21 through lanes, a bike lane, and a heavily used pedestrian sidewalk. The Addendum failed to

22 consider the delay these vehicles will face as a result of the pedestrian activity a on the sidewalk

23 crossing the Project's driveway. These vehicles may stack up behind the left turn lane into the

24 Camino de La Plaza/Virgínia Avenue Intersection, which is only 100 feet from the turn lane. The

25 Project, in other words, will create a significant traffic impact due to this pedestrian/vehicle

26 conflict.

27 38. Shamrock also commented on the Project's many inconsistencies with the SYCP's

28 Mobility and Urban Design Goals and Policies, which, for example, require buildings to be
19350696 6

VERIPIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

tailored to surrounding uses and promote pedestrian activities. As Shamrock commented, the

2 Project's monolithic building conflicts with these policies by providing a massive block and
interrupting views of the outlets and the Port of Entry.

39. On October 4, 2018, the Planning Commission decided to continue the hearing to

5 its October 25, 2018 meeting.

6 40. Prior to the October 25, 2018 hearing, Shamrock again submitted written

7 comments to the Planning Commission in opposition to the Project, reiterating its concerns with

8 the traffic, visual, and neighborhood character impacts generated by the Project. Shamrock also

9 made oral comments in opposition to the Project during the October 25, 2018 hearing on the
d'TT'XJ3HHOS HASUV LLVAH NIB.LSNASONS 10 Project. Despite these objections, the Planning Commission approved the Project on October 25,

11 2018, adopting the Addendum and approving the Land Use Permits.
8 5e breaa, CX 93101-5000 0L91 aums Kkempeog s 12 41. On November 8, 2018, Shamrock timely appealed the Planning Commission's

13 action to the City Council.

14 42. On April 22, 2019, the City prepared an Errata to the Addendum to reflect "the

15 Project changes made by the applicant and accepted by the Planning Commission during their

16 motion and final approval of the Project."

17 43. The City Council noticed a public hearing on the appeal for May 14, 2019 and

18 Shamrock submitted additional written comments in support of its appeal on May 10, 2019. The

19 City Council denied the appeal and affirmed the Planning Commission's decision on May 14,

20 2019.

21 44. The City filed a Notice of Determination for the Addendum on May 24, 2019 with

22 the San Diego County Clerk's office.

23 45. A copy of Shamrock's November 8, 2018 appeal, which includes Shamrock's

24 written comments submitted to the Planning Commission prior to the October 4, 2018 and

25 October 25, 2018 hearings, is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.

26 46. A copy of Shamrock's written comments submitted to the City Council prior to the

27 May 14, 2019 hearing is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.

28
19350696 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 47. Shamrock, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if

2 the relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is commenced based upon the

Addendum.

4 48. Shamrock has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

5 to redress the claims pleaded herein.

6 49. Shamrock has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

7 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to Respondents prior to the

8 commencement of this suit, copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

9 50. Shamrock will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney

10 General as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7. TT NOINHOS HABJVA LAVAH NIAISNMOäg 11 51. Shamrock hereby and by a separate election notifies the City that Shamrock elects
000s-10176 YD *08aIg ucs DZ91 Pjng "KeMpeora sZE 12 to prepare the record of proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project in compliance with

13 Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). A copy of such notice is filed

14 concurrently with this Petition.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 15
16 (Violations of CEQA: Pub. Resources Code, $ 21000 et seg. - Failure to Identify Reasonably

17 Foreseeable and Potentially Significant Adverse Impacts, to Adopt Feasible Mitigation

18 Measures, and to Prepare a Supplemental or Subsequent Environmental Impact Report)

19 52. Shamrock realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 51,

20 inclusive, of this Petition, as though fully set forth herein.

21 53. When an BIR for ! project has been previously certified, CEQA requires the

22 preparation of a supplemental or subsequent EIR that complies with the requirements of the

23 statute where, in part, substantial changes are proposed in the project which will result in new

24 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant

25 effects. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; CEQA Guidelines, § 15162.) Statutory

26 requirements include, but are not limited to, fully disclosing and meaningfully analyzing the

27 Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19350696

1 54. Furthermore, where a project is consistent with the development density

2 established by an existing community plan for which an EIR has been certified, the public agency

3 approving the project shall, pursuant to certain requirements, analyze the project's environmental

4 effects which: "(1) Are peculiar to the project or the parcel on which the project would be located;

5 (2) Were not analyzed as significant effects in a prior EIR on the . community plan with which

6 the project is consistent; (3) Are potentially significant off-site impacts and cumulative impacts

7 which were not discussed in the prior EIR prepared for the . community plan ...; or (4) Are

8 previously identified significant effects which, as a result of substantial new information which a

9 was not known at the time the EIR was certified, are determined to have a more severe adverse
d'TT'NOTAHOS XASHYA LLVAH NI3JSNMONS 10 impact than discussed in the prior EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, §15183(b); Pub. Resources Code,

11 § 21083.3.)
000S-10186 VD 'oRara ues 12 55. CEQA also mandates that a lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation L9I 2OINS *Kempeoug SZE 13 measures that would reduce or avoid a project's significant environmental impacts.

14 56. The City violated CEQA by adopting the Addendum for the Project rather than

15 preparing an EIR. Among other things, the City violated CEQA by:

16 a. Failing to complete an initial study analyzing the Project's environmental

17 impacts as required by the SYCP EIR;

b. Failing to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's reasonably 18

19 foresecable significant adverse impacts on the environment, including but not limited to the

20 Project's direct and cumulative traffic, visual, and neighborhood character impacts;

C. Failing to adequately analyze the traffic impacts associated with westbound 21

22 vehicles on Camino de la Plaza attempting to turn left into the Project driveway while pedestrians

23 and bicyclists cross the driveway;

24 d. Failing to adequately analyze the traffic impacts associated with the

25 Project's inconsistency with the SYCP's Mobility Goals and Policies, such as the goal of

26 reducing pedestrian/vehicle conflicts (SYCP, p. 3-1);

e. Failing to adequately analyze the Project's traffic impacts to the 27

11 the Project's significant environmental effects; and,
Erroneously concluding without substantial evidence that the changes to 0005-10176 Diego, C 12 j. 0291 aunS Kawprong sez & 13 the Project will not result in new significant impacts or more severe effects than those previously

14 identified in the EIR for the San Ysidro Community Plan Update (Project No. 310690/SCH No. 5

.16 57. The Addendum, in other words, is so fundamentally flawed that it precludes

17 meaningful public review, and is insufficient to address the environmental impacts flowing from

18 the Project. Substantial evidence shows that an EIR was required to address the Project's

19 environmental impacts.

20 58, As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, the City

21 prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting and relying upon an inadequate Addendum rather

22 than preparing an EIR and, as such, the adoption of the Addendum should be set aside.

1 60. There is insufficient evidence to support the findings required by the San Diego

2 Municipal Code to issue the Land Use Permits.

3 Coastal Development Permit

61. San Diego Municipal Code section 126.0708 states that a Coastal Development

5 Permit may only be approved if the City finds that the project "is in conformity with the certified

6 Local Coastal Program land use plan and complies with all regulations of the certified

7 Implementation Program." (Emphasis in original.)

62. The SYCP, certified by the Coastal Commission on December 13, 2017, is the
Local Coastal Program land use plan governing the Project site.

63. The Project conflicts with the SYCP's policies, including, among others, the dT1*XOTNHOS HIAHVA LIVAH NIALSNMONS 10

11 SYCP's Mobility and Urban Design Policies. For example, the Project disregards the SYCP's
0009-10126 1205710H8 AE MI S Diego, 5 12 goal of reducing pedestrian/vehicle conflicts and the SYCP's policies to tailor buildings to

13 surrounding uses and promote pedestrian activities, as evidenced by the numerous deviations

14 required to permit the Project's building.

15 64. Disregarding these inconsistencies, the City granted the Coastal Development

16 Permit for the Project.

17 65. The City's granting of the Coastal Development Permit for the Project constituted

18 an abuse of discretion in it that it was arbitrary, a violation of law, and not supported by substantial

19 evidence.

20 Planned Development Permit

21 66. San Diego Municipal Code section 126.0605 states that a Planned Development

22 Permit may only be approved if: "(1) The proposed development will not adversely affect the

23 applicable land use plan; (2) The proposed development will not be detrimental to the public

24 health, safety, and welfare; and (3) The proposed development will comply with the regulations of

25 the Land Development Code including any proposed deviations pursuant to Section

26 126.0602(b)(1) that are appropriate for this location and will result in a more desirable project

27 than would be achieved if designed in strict conformance with the development regulations of the
applicable zone, and any allowable deviations that are otherwise authorized pursuant to the Land 28

2 67. As explained above, the Project conflicts with the SYCP's goals and policies,

3 including, among others, the SYCP's Mobility and Urban Design goals and policies.

4 68. The Project creates a pedestrian and vehicle safety hazard through its proposed

5 westbound turn lane into the Project, which will cross three lanes of traffic, one bicycle lane and a

6 heavily trafficked pedestrian sidewalk.

7 69. The Project's deviations permit a building footprint that lies in stark contrast to the

8 surrounding land uses and the SYCP's policies. Thus, the deviations do not result in a more

9 desirable project than if the Project's building were designed in strict conformance with the

10 applicable development regulations.

11 70. Disregarding these facts, the City granted the Planned Development Permit for the
OLo auing 'KeApeong s? JUTNDINHOS MUSMVA LLVAH NIELSNMOUS 0005-10128 V.3 ofagg 12 Project.

13 71. The City's granting of the Planned Development Permit for the Project constituted

15 evidence.

16 Neighborhood Use Permit

17 72. San Diego Municipal Code section 126.0205 states that a Neighborhood Use

18 Permit may only be approved if the City finds: "(a) The proposed development will not adversely

19 affect the applicable land use plan; (b) The proposed development will not be detrimental to the

20 public health, safety, and welfare; and (c) The proposed development will comply with the

21 regulations of the Land Development Code including any allowable deviations pursuant to the

Shamrock's reasons for appealing the Project's approval and adoption/certification of Addendum No. 375960 are set forth in full in the attached letters, dated October 4 and 25, 2018. The following summary outlines Shamrock's reasons for appealing the
Planning Commission's decision.
The Project is barred from proceeding under a CEQA Addendum because the Project will cause new significant environmental effects and/or cause a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects beyond those analyzed in the San Ysidro Community Pian (SYCP) PEIR with respect to (a) transportation and circulation, and (b) visual impacts and neighborhood character. The Project will cause new impacts to the intersection of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue by causing traffic waiting to turn left into the Project to back up into the intersection, and new impacts to pedestrian mobility by placing pedestrians walking in front of the Project along Camino de la Plaza in danger. The Project will cause new neighborhood character impacts by not complying with SYCP policies,

Also, the Addendum is facially insufficient because it does not analyze a sufficiently broad study area for
transportation and circulation impacts, thereby leaving unanswered what the true direct and indirect impacts of the Project will be. In addition, by failing to use an adequate study area, the Addendum also fails to adequately analyze potentially significant cumulative impacts beyond the scope of the SYCP PEIR.
The Project also does not comply with SYCP policies that recognize the importance of the Camino de la Plaza • Virginia Avenue intersection as a gateway between the U.S. and Mexico.

RE: Opposition to Item 3, Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960
Dear Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners:
Isubmit this letter on behalf of our client, Shamrock/Outlets at the Border LLC ("Shamrock"), in opposition to the Virginia Avenue Parking Garage project ("Proposed Project"). Shamrock opposes the Proposed Project for three key reasons:
1. CEQA: The Addendum to the San Ysidro Community Plan Program Environmental Impact Report No. 310690/SCH No. 2015111012 ("SYCP EIR") prepared for the Proposed Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

2. Safety: The Proposed Project would create a dangerous situation for the large number of pedestrians seeking to access the new PedWest border crossing and Shamrock's Outlets at the Border project, and
3. Scene: The Proposed Project would create a monolithic block at the doorstep of the PedWest International Pedestrian Port of Entry that would not only be an eyesore but would also provide a service---automobile parking spaces--that is unneeded in the area.

Shamrock is keenly interested in what happens with the Proposed Project because it is a vested and valued member of the community. Shamrock's Outlets at the Border project-immediately adjacent to the Proposed Project-is a large employer, large sales tax generator, and a significant draw for people on both sides of the border.
Shamrock has also worked closely with the City and the General Services Administration ("GSA") for many years on the development of the new Ped West pedestrian border crossing, and donated the land necessary for Ped West and the City's Virginia Avenue Transit Center. Shamrock is also an involved
member of the San Ysidro community, and plays host to community meetings at its center.

Shamrock respectfully requests that you reject the Proposed Project.

I. THE ADDENDUM DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CEQA
The Addendum does not comply with CEQA for two reasons. First, the Project is barred from preparing an addendum under 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") section 15164 because the Project will cause new significant environmental effects and/or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects beyond those analyzed in the SYCP EIR. And second, the Addendum is facially insufficient because it does not analyze a sufficiently broad study area, thereby leaving unanswered what the true impacts of the Project will be.
The Project Will Result In New and/or Substantially More Severe Environmental
Impacts

The CEQA Guidelines state that an addendum to an existing EIR is only proper where none of the circumstances set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15162(a)(1) -(a)(3) are present. (CEQA Guidelines § 15164(a).) In fact, a lead agency is prohibited from requiring a new or supplemental EIR unless one of the section 15162(a)(1) - (a)(3) circumstances are present.
The City should have required a new or supplemental EIR because the Proposed Project will trigger new/more severe environmental impacts than disclosed in the SYCP in EIR's analysis of Transportation and Circulation, and Visual Impacts and Nelghborhood Character, thereby triggering CEQA Guidelines Section 15162(a)(1).

1. Transporlation and Circulation

a. of New Impact to the Intersection of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue
The SYCP EIR analyzed the Community Plan Updale's impact on traffic circulation by asking, "Issue 1: Would traffic associated with the proposed SYCPU .. . cause any intersections, roads, or freeway segments to exceed the City's significance thresholds?"
The SYCP EIR found that the Community Plan Update would have a significant impact at the intersection la of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue, which could be reduced to acceptable levels by installing traffic signal and providing a second west-bound (WB) left-turn lane. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-43 and Tables 5.2- 10 and 5.2-14.)
Analyzing the same impact, the Addendum concludes that the Proposed Project would not cause a significant impact to study area intersections under existing, near term, or horizon year (2035) conditions. (Addendum at 9.)
An analysis by traffic engineers at Linscott, Law and Greenspan of the Proposed Project's "Traffic Impact Analysis" identified substantial problems with this impact conclusion. (See Exhibit 1, LLG Memorandum, dated Öctober 3, 2018 (*LLG Memo").) In particular, the LLG Memo finds that the "Traffic Impact Analysis" did not adequately analyze the potential impacts associated with the Proposed Project's WB left-turn lane into the driveway on Camino de la Plaza.

Section 15162(a)(1) states: "Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous EIR ... due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severlty of previously identified significant effects.'

17530372

Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners City of San Diego Planning Commission
Opposition to Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960 October 4, 2018
Page 3

In fact, the LLG Memo finds that during peak hour traffic, WB vehicles wailing to turn left will stack into the
Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection. (ld. at 2.) The "Traffic Impact Analysis" fails to reveal this impact because it did not consider the delay that heavy pedestrian traffic passing in front of the Proposed Project's driveway would cause to vehicles waiting to turn left. (ld. t 2-3.)

Using the numbers from the Traffic Impaot Analysis, we can expect more than 500 pedestrians to cross the drivoway during the PM peak hour. (LLG Memo at 2, and Figure 1.) (Actually, those numbers may actually be low, since pedestrian counts were taken in April 2017, before the Ped West international border crossing was fully operational.)
Exhibit G provides the Traffic Impact Analysis' "Queuing Analysis." Yei a close inspection of the Queuing
Analysis reveals that "[w]hile Appendix G analyzes pedestrians and bicycles as they move through the Virginia / Camino de la Plaza intersection, [it] does not analyze the uncontrolled actions of pedestrians and bicycles at the projoct driveway." (LLG Memo at 3 [emphasis added].)
Accordingly, WB vehicles attempting to turn laft will wait much longer than the Traffic Impact Analysis
anticipates because they will encounter heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza. (LLG Memo at
2.)

is This is an entirely new impact from any intersection impacts analyzed in the SYCP EIR. and will trigger a significant impact at Issue 1 because vehicle stacking into the Virginia Avenue / Camino de la Plaza
intersection would exceed City significance thresholds.

b. New Significant Impact to Pedestrian Mobility
San Y sidro Community Plan Update Mobillty Element contains goals and to policies to promote and enhance pedestrian-friendly facilities throughout the community, including the border region, (SYCP at 3-1; SYCP EIR at 5.2-48.) In fact, the very first goal-in the Mobllity Element emphasizes "pedestrian-friendly facilities" in order to "minimize or reduce pedestrian/vehicular conflicts."2 (SYCP at 3-1.) So does the first pedestrian policy 3.2.1, which emphasizes "walkabillty and connectivity .
The SYCP EIR analyzed the significance of the Community Plan Update's impacts on "alternative transportation modes" by asking: "Issue 2: Would the proposed SYCPU or SYHVSP decrease the percent of allernative mode trips in the City's transportation system?" (SYCP EIR at 5.2-46.) Citing the Mobility Element's goals and policies, the SYCP EIR concluded that the Community Plan Update would have a less than significant impact with respect to pedestrians on Issue 2 due to the pedestrian improvements included in the Community Plan Update. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-49.) In this fashion, the City adopted the Mobility Element's goals and policies as part of the significance threshold and applicable mitigation to address the potential impact of the Community Plan Update. (See Spring Valley Lake Ass'n v. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 102.)

Mobility Element Goal: "Pedestrian-friendly facilities throughout the community with emphasis on the San
Y sidro Historic Village and Border Village areas in order to minimize or reduce pedestrian/vehicular
conflicts."
3 Mobility Element Policy 3.2.1: "Support and promote walkability and connectlvity through the construction of sidewalk and intersection improvements throughout the community at, but not limited to; the following
locations: . . . (I) Camino de la Plaza (Refer to Figure 3-7)." (emphasis original - Figure 3-7 provides a close-up schematic of the intersection of Camino de la Plaza and E. San Ysidro Boulevard.)

The Addendum asserts that it will also have a less than significant impact to "alternative transportation modes" because of its alleged consistency with the goals of the Mobility Element. (Addendum al 9-10.) Yet the Addendum provides no analysis as to whether the Proposed Project's double-wide driveway and exit on Camino de la Plaza would meet the "pedestrian-friendly" goals and policies in the Mobility Element, or whether it would impact pedestrians walking along Camino de la Plaza. ((cl.)
As described above, the "Traffic Impact Analysis" failed to account for heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza. As vehlcles stack back into Virginia Avenue, stressed drivers will attempt to dart across three traffic lanes, a Class II bicycle lane, and a heavily traveled sidewalk to enter the Proposed Project. LLG concludes that this situation will create "a high conflict driveway that will put pedestrians [traversing Camino de la Plaza] at risk." (LLG Memo at 3.)
The Proposed Project will conflict with the Mobility Element's goals and policy because it will create anything but a "pedestrian-friendly" facility. This will cause a new significant impact to pedestrlan mobility.4

2. Visual Impacts and Neighborhood Character
The SYCP EIR analyzed the Community Plan Update's impact on visual effects and neighborhood character by asking, "Issue 2: Would the proposed [Community Plan Update] . . . negatively or
substantially aller the character of the neighborhood?" (SYCP EIR at 5.8-19.)
The SYCP EIR found that the Community Plan Update would have a less than significant impact to the 'San Ysidro Neighborhood District'-where both the Proposed Project and Outlets at the Border are located-based on policles In the Urban Design Element that would "guide the design of future commercial development," including "Urban Design Element Policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31." (SYCP EIR at 5.8-21 and 5.8-22.) In this fashion, the City adopted specific Urban Design Element policies as part of the significance threshold and applicable mitigation to address the potential impact of the Community Plan Update. (See Spring Valley Lake Ass'n, 248 Cal.App.4th at 102.)
The Addendum asserts (hat the Proposed Project will have a less than significant impact based on its consistency with four Urban Design Elemnent policies, including Policies 4.2.3, 4.2.10, 4.3.2, and 4.3.39. (Addendum at 19-20.) Patsy Price of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, a professional planner certified by the American Institute of Certifled Planners, analyzed the Proposed Project's alleged consistency with Policies 4.2.3 and 4.2.10 and found its conclusion cannot be supported. (See Exhibit 2, Price Memo, at 1-2.)
Urban Design Policy 4.2.3:5 The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Policy because it is incompatible in scale with the heights used in the Las Americas Outlet Center located to the west and Outlets at the Border to the south, which are made up of single story commercial buildings. Smaller scale buildings surrounded by landscaping are located at the Camino de la Plaza street frontage, with larger, multi-tenant buildings set back significantly from the street frontage. Development ta the north and east of the Proposed Project site also consists of one- and two- story structures with landscaping along the street frontage. The Project's proposed 6-stary, 70
' It is worth noting that SYCP EIR found certain mitigation measures infeasible because they would impact existing or proposed sidewalks or bicycle facilities, which would discourage walking and bicycling. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-42 and Table 5.2-13.)
Policy 4.2.3 requires: "Tallor building height and scale to be sensitive to surrounding residential and
commercial uses.

17530372

Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners City of San Diego Planning Commission Opposition to Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960
October 4, 2018
Page 5

foot height wilh reduced setbacks and minimal landscaping is not at all consistent with or sensitive
to the height and scale of surrounding development.

Urban Design Policy 4.2.10: First, the Addendum selectively quotes this Policy, omitting the bold italicized portion: "Strengthen neighborhood identity and connectivity with pedestrian
promenades, wayfincing, and gateway features (also see Section 4.11)." Not only is the Proposed Project inconsistent with this Policy because it in no way develops a "pedestrian promenade" (see Price letter at 2), but It also utterly falls to provide any "gateway features," even though it sils at what the Community Plan identifies as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see
Figure 4-1, SYCP at 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP at Policy 4.11.10.F.)
Urban Design Policy 4.3.2:6 The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Policy because it in no way develops a "pedestrian promenade" (see Price letter at 2), and fails to provide "façade improvements, enriched streetscapes and landscaping* along the Camino de la Plaza frontage, which will be exposed to the most trafflc.

Urban Design Policy 4.3.39: This Policy is an Industrial Area Design policy. Whether the Proposed Project is consistent with this Policy is Irrelevant to the commercial project being analyzed.

Finally, the Addendum utterly fails to compare the Proposed Project's consistency with Urban Design Polioies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31, the key policies the SYCP EIR assumed would "guide the design of future commercial development.* (SYCP EIR at 5.8-21.) In fact, the Proposed Project is
inconsistent with a number of these key Commercial Policies (See Price Memo at 2-3), including:

Q Commercial Policy 4.3.20: Proposed Project fails to "promote pedestrian activities and
amenities .

3 Commercial Policy 4.3.22: Proposed Project fails to "promote consistent architectural
theming for commercial centers" and does not utilize "complementary materials, colors,
lighting, and massing."

3 Commercial Policy 4.3.23: Proposed Project fails to provide "articulation and variation in massing to minimize bullding scale and provide an enhanced pedestrian orientation . In fact, the 70 foot tall building seeks variances to setbacks and looms over pedestrians on Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue.
o Commercial Policy 4.3.29: Proposed Project fails to provide street landscaping on Camino de la Plaza, which therefore cannot be carried onto Virginia Avenue.

As demonstrated above, the Proposed Project will have a new significant impact to neighborhood character because It is larger in mass, bulk, and scale than surrounding development, and is Inconsistent with the Urban Design Policies that the SYCP EIR assumed would prevent future commercial development from causing a significant impact. This is a new significant impact that was not analyzed in the SYCP EIR and requires preparation of a new or supplemental EIR.

'Pollcy 4.3.2 requires: "Promote enhancements to commercial areas including façade improvements, enriched streetscapes and landscaping, unified signage programs, improved pedestrian access, and infill pad development."

B. Inadequate Study Area for Transportation and Circulation
CEQA requires that the City physical changes" analyze any "direct physical changes" and "reasonably foreseeable indirect in the environment that "may be caused by the project." (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d).) With respect to traffic and circulation impacts, the City has developed a Traffic Impact Study Manual to guide a project applicant's analysis. Pursuant to this Traffic Impact Study Manual, the Manual requires the applicant to perform a traffic study on the *study area" that will be impacted by the project. According to the Manual, all intersections with 50 or more peak hour trips in elther direction must be analyzed as part of the project's "study area." (City of San Diego, Trip Impact Study Manual at 5-6 (1998).)

The 'Traffic Impact Analysis" oniy analyzed one intersection--Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue. Given the size and density of the Proposed Project, determine whether it used the proper study area. LLG scrutinized the "Traffic Impact Analysis® to Figure 5 of the "T raffic Impact Analys]s" shows 52 vehicles heading east of Virginia Avenue on Camino de la Plaza. (LLG Memo at 1.) Further, the trip la distribution chart in Figure 4 shows that 90% of trips to/from the east should be applied to over 100 peak hour trips. (ld.)
Accordingly, bolh Figures 4 and 5 indicate that the "Traffio Impact Analysis" used an insufficiently small "study area" because it falled to include intersections beyond Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue that will experience at least 50 or more peak hour trips. In LLG's professional opinion, "the intersections of Camino de la Plaza at the [southbound] 1-5 ramps and Camino de la Plaza at San Ysidro Boulevard should be included in the analysis to evaluate the impacts of the project." (LLG Memo al 1.)
By failing to adequately analyze the direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts of the Proposed Project, the Addendum fails to support its conclusion that there are no significant impacts to intersections that should be in the study area but have not been analyzed.
In addition, by failing to adequately use an adequate study area, the Proposed Project also fails to provide a sufficient basis to determine whether any significant cumulative impacts beyond the scope of the SYCP EIR may occur as a result of this Proposed Project and all past. present, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130.)

C. Inadequate Project Description
The Proposed Project relies upon a strip of property-owned by Shamrock-along its Virginia Avenue frontage as a key element of its project design and future construction implementation. The Addendum assumes that the Proposed Project has legal rights to use this strip of property. In fact, Shamrock has refused to grant an easement for the Propose Project.
CEQA requires that the project description be accurate. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) Due to its reliance on this strip of property along Virginia Avenue, the Addendum includes an inadequate project description, and therefore fails to analyze a real project. Without an accurate project description, the Addendum fails as an environmental document. (ld.)

II. THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE A MONOLITHIC BLOCK BLOCKING THE PED WEST INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND THE OUTLETS AT THE BORDER PROJECT
The physical effect of the Proposed Project will be to effectively screen the public from seeing both Ped West facility, and the Outlets at the Border project. The Proposed Project will have detrimental impacts on
both facilities.

17530372

Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners City of San Diego Planning Commission Opposition to Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960 October 4, 2018

In numerous places throughout the SYCP, various policies recognize the importance of the Camino de la
Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see Figure 4-1, SYCP at at Policy 4.11.10.f.) Yet the Proposed Project will do nothing 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP to create a significant gateway between the United States and Mexico. To the contrary, it will provide a monolithic structure with no dynamism or appeal.
Furthermore, Shamrock has significant concerns that the Proposed Project will screen its customers from the Outlets at the Border project. As a major local employer, significant sales tax revenue generator, and
significant draw to the border, this is a concern not only to Shamrock but also to the broader community
and the City.
That is why Shamrock has refused to grant the Proposed Project the easement along its Virginia Avenue frontage upon which the project design relies.
As a developer, Shamrock takes no pleasure in standing in opposition to the Proposed Project: Yet as a vested member of the community, has no choice but to voice its concerns with the project.

Sincerely,

Ryan R. Waterman

Traffic Impact Analysis (dated November 2017), Project No. 375960. The project www.lgengineers.com

is located southwest quadrant of the intersection of Camino De La Plaza and Pasadona
Virginia Avenue in the community of San Ysidro. The review generally considers trvina
CEQA problems, safety issues, project access and technical errors. San Diego
Woodland Hills
A. Significant Impact Issues
1. Insufficient Study Area- The Traffic Impact Analysis must analyze all
intersections with 50 or more peak hour trips in either direction, per City of San
Dicgo "Traffic Impact Study Manual" guidelines. Figure 5 of the report shows 52
vehicles going east of Virginia Avenue on Camino De La Plaza. Also, the
project's trip distribution (see Figure 4) shows 90% of trips to/from the east, and
108 peak hour trips in and out. Using simple math, 90% of 108 peak hour in and
out trips shows more than enough trips to study more than just the Camino de la
Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection. Therefore, the intersections of Camino De La Plaza at the SB T-5 ramps and Camino De La Plaza at San Ysidro Boulevard
should be included in the analysis to evaluate the impacts of the project.

2. Substandard access- The project proposes driveway access to the project for
vehicles traveling both west and eastbound on Camino de la Plaza, located
approximately 100 feet. from Virginia Avenue. The project proposes a striped
side-by-side WB left turn lane LO access the driveway. The WB left turn pocket
length is 60 feet, which can accommodate two cars (at 25 feet per car). Drivers
turning left into the site will have to navigate through one eastbound left turn lane,
two EB through lanes, bike lane, and a heavily active pedestrian sidewalk.
The Traffic Impact Analysis concludes that the WB left turn will operate at LOS A
during AM and PM peak hours. (Traffic Impact Analysis, at p. 13) The significant
issue with the Traffic Impact Analysis' conclusion is that it fails to adequately account for heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza when calculating

Nr2897Keview Meno_3991, (17546023_2)_L.207dcex

John P. Keating, P.E.

queuing to turn left. In fact, the project will cause stacking into the Virginia Avenue intersection as drivers waiting to turn left into the project encounter heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza.
Based on the Traffic Impact Analysis' pedestrian counts (Appendix H), there are
395 pedestrians per PM Peak hour (both EB and WB direction combined) walking
on the south side and 152 pedestrians per PM Peak hour (both NB and SB direction combined) walking on the west side of Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza intersection as shown in Figure 1, below.

Based on the pedestrian counts at the Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza
intersection, it is expected to have more than 500 pedestrians crossing the
project driveway during the PM peak hour. It should be noted that when the
pedestrian counts were collected in April 2017, the Ped West facility was not fully open. Accordingly, it is our professional opinion that the pedestrian volumes are likely higher today, and will be even higher in the 2035 horizon
year.

The Traffic Impact Analysis did not adequately account for pedestriaus when
calculating queuing for WB left turn. (See Traffic Impact Analysis at 16.) In
fact, the queuing analysis does not account for heavy pedestrian traffic along
Camino de la Plaza. (See Traffic Impact Analysis at 16, and Appendix G)
Whiie Appendix G analyzes pedestrians and bicycles as they move through the
Virginia / Camino de la Plaza intersection, but Appendix G does not analyze
the uncontrolled actions of pedestrians and bicycles at the project driveway.
The Traffic Impact Analysis assumed zero pedestrians when analyzing traffic
moving in and out of the site.

This failure to account for heavy pedestrian traffic, the insufficient WB left turn pocket, and proximity to the Virginia/Camino de la Plaza intersection poses a
potential accident problem at the driveway access due to the left turn lane, and
potential accident problem in the Virginia/Camino de la Plaza intersection.
3. Unsafe driveway-As documented by paragraph 2, the project driveway will be
a high conflict driveway that will put pedestrians at risk.

B. Technical Errors
1. Queuing Incorrect- Due to the heavy pedestrian activity along the sidewalk, WB left turning vehicles will have to wait for an adequate gap in vehicles and podestrians. The left turn pocket leugth can only store 2 vehicles. This will
cause vehicles to spill back into the through lane and impede segment and
intersection opcrations. The left turn pocket length is insufficient and does not
meet City standards.

2. U-turn- The project traffic impact study Section 3.0 suggested a proposed widening of the north side of Camino De La Plaza to add a U-turn to the eastbound lef turn move at the Camino De La Plaza and Virginia Avenue
intersection. Since the U-turn is parl of the project trip assignment, the study
should recommend a minimum roadway width and provide a turn-template to
ensure the feasibility of a UJ-turn.

3. WB Exit - The braffic impact study suggested that drivers that want to go west
will need to weave to the EB left turn lane upon exiting driveway and make a
U-furn. Howeyer there is not enough weaving length available for velicles to
get into the left turn lane. This will create a potential safety issue as the driveway
is in close proximity (within 100 feet) to the intersection of Virginia Avenue
and Camino De La Plaza.

Conclusions:

1. The study area must be expanded to include all intersections with 50 peak hour trips and others susceptible to significant impacts, including the SB I-5 ramps and Camino De La Plaza at San Y sidro Boulevard.
2. The Camino De La Plaza driveway must be restricted to right-turns into the project only, with no WB left-turns allowed, in order to avoid danger to pedestrians and queuing into the Virginia Avenue/Camino de la Plaza intersection. This should be accomplished via the installation of a raised
median at least 150 feet long, by the applicant.

3. Due to the current prohibition of U-turns along Camino De La Plaza, a second access point on the south side of the site is necessary, near the existing driveway on the south side. No new driveways should be allowed on Virginia Avenue.

RE: Planning Commission October 4, 2018 Hearing, Item 3 Virginia Ave Parking Garage - Project No. 375960

Dear Chair Haase and Honorable Members of the Planning Commission:

I am a land use planner with over 15 years of experience in jurisdictions throughout California, and have worked for public agencles as a professional planner, and for private property owners as a land use project manager. I regularly represent clients before planning commissions and design boards as well as assisting clients in designing context appropriate development projects. My detailed bio is attached.

I reviewed the project plans, staff report, and environmental analysis for the proposed Virginia Avenue
Parking Garage (Project) as well as the applicable policies and provisions of the San Ysidro Community Plan (SYCP). It is my professional opinion that the Project is inconsistent with numerous SYCP policies that require development to be compatible with and in scale with its surroundings and require enhanced pedestrian amenities and improved pedestrian and bicyclist safety in new development and redevelopment. Specifically:

The Project is not compatible with the surrounding context as it far exceeds the height, bulk, and scale of surrounding development. to The staff report fails to address the Project's compatibility with surrounding development and the Addendum to the Environmental Impact Report (EIR Addendum) erroneously states that the project is consistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.3' because it is compatible in scale with the heights used in the Las Americas Outlet Center located
to the west. In fact, the Las Americas Outlet Center is made up of single story commercial
buildings. Smaller scale buildings surrounded by landscaping are located at the Camino de la Plaza street frontage of the center and larger, multi-tenant buildings are set back significantly from the street frontage. Development to the north and east of the Project site also consists of one- and two-story structures with landscaping along the street frontage. The Project's proposed 6-story, 70 foot height with reduced setbacks and minimal landscaping is not at all consistent with or sensitive to the height and scale of surrounding development. Therefore, it is inconsistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.3 as well as Policy 4.3.8.

Policy 4.2.3 requires: Tailor building height and scale to be sensitive to surrounding residential and
commercial uses. Policy 4.3.8 requires: Encourage infill projects and promote compatibility with the surrounding context in terms of building scale, compactness of development, and design character and articulation.

The Project will reduce pedestrian safety and detract from the pedestrian environment. The staff report and EIR Addendum assert that the project is consistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.10° because it includes a "pedestrian promenade" along the street fronlages and an indentation of six
feet on the Virginia Avenue side. While the staff report notes the Project "is localed in a very complex-traffic area,' it fails to address how the existing complex traffic conditions as well as the addition of a left turn lane immediately west of the Camino de la Plaza/Virginia Avenue intersection will impact pedestrian safety and cyclist safety. (Staff Report at p. 8.)
The Project site is located in an area with both heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic adjacent to the Ped West international pedestrian border crossing. While including some pedestrian amenities
along the Virginia Avenue street frontage, the Project design prioritizes vehicular traffic at the expense of pedestrian safety along Camino de la Plaza. The majority of the Camino de la Plaza la frontage is a driveway and the blank façade of the parking structure, with minimal proposed landscaping. This does not enhance the pedestrian environment, and, in fact, the significant amount of vehicular traffic turning into the Project from the left turn lane, which crosses two lanes of traffic and a Class bikeway, will decrease pedestrian and cyclist safety.
The Project proposes a reduced setback of 6 feet 6 inches on the Virginia Avenue frontage for upper stories and 12 feet 9 inch setback for the first story. Rather than providing a pedestrian friendly environment, the bulk and scale of the structure is likely to have an imposing effect with five stories of parking structure looming over pedestrians.
A deviation from the maximum height and setback reductions cannot be justified for this primary intersection/activity node and potential gateway opportunity area. The SYCP identifies the corner of Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza as a primary intersection/activity node and potential gateway opportunity. (See SYCP at Figure 4-1.) An increase in height above the maximum allowed by zoning cannot be justified for this primary intersection and gateway site. In fact, height of 60 feet does not appear to be justified based on SYCP policies requiring compatibility with the surrounding context.
The staff report states that "[bjuilding height was dictated by the need to provide a minimum number of parking spaces and physical conditions of the site, which do not allow for subterranean parking levels" and identifies this as justification for a 10 foot increase in the maximum 60 fool height limit. (Staff Report at p. 7.) The minimum number of parking spaces to serve the on-site retail uses is 66 spaces. The additional 283 spaces are proposed private paid parking spaces. There is no requirement that these spaces be provided. The bullding height and setback reductions are clearly intended to maximize the profitability of the development without regard for its impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
The Project is inconsistent with key commercial pollcies of the San Ysidro Community Plan upon which the SYPC EIR's conclusions are based. Finally, the EIR Addendum utterly fails to analyze the Project's consistency with SYPC Urban Design Element policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31, the key policies the SYCP EIR assumed would "guide the design of future commercial development." (SYCP EIR af 5.8-21.) In fact, the Project is inconsistent with a number of these key commercial policies, including:

O Commercial Policy 4.3.20: The Project fails to "promote pedestrian activities and
amenities ....

' Policy 4.2.10 requires: Strengthen neighborhood identity and connectivity with pedestrian promenades, wayfinding, and gateway features.

City of San Diego Planning Commission Opposition to Virginia Ave Parking Garage - Project No. 375960

Page

O Commercial Policy 4.3.22: The Project fails to "promote consistent architectural themning
for commercial centers" and does nol utilize "complementary materials, colors, lighting,
and massing."

O Commercial Policy 4.3.23: The Project falls to provide."articulation and variation in
massing to minimize building scale and provide an enhanced pedestrian orientation . . . ." In fact, the 70 foot tall building seeks variances to setbacks and looms over pedestrians on Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue.
Commercial Policy 4.3.29: The Project fails to provide street any substantial landscaping on Camino de la Plaza, which therefore cannot be carried onto Virginia Avenue.
The proposed Project will result in a monolithic parking structure that is Incompatible with surrounding development, decreases pedestrian and cyclist safety, and is inappropriate for this primary intersection and gateway site. I respectfully encourage the Planning Commission to deny the Project as proposed and require the applicant to reduce the size, bulk, and scale of the development to be more compatible with its
surroundings and provide true pedestrian amenities and enhanced pedestrian safely features in this
heavily trafficked and important gateway location.

RE: Opposition to Item 3, Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960 (Trailed from October 4, 2018, Hearing)

Dear Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners:

I submit this letter on behalf of our client, Shamrock/Outlets at the Border LLC ("Shamrock"), in continued
opposition to the Virginia Avenue Parking Garage project ("Proposed Project"). Shamrock opposes the
Proposed Project for three key reasons:
1. CEQA: The Addendum to the San Ysidro Community Plan Program Environmental Impact Report No. 310690/SCH No. 2015111012 ("SYCP EIR") prepared for the Proposed Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
2. Safety: The Proposed Project would create a dangerous situation for the large number of pedestrians going to or coming from the new International Pedestrian Port of Entry border crossing (PedWest / PedEast) and Shamrock's Outlets at the Border project, and
3. Scene: The Proposed Project would create a monolithic block at the doorstep of the International Pedestrian Port of Entry that would not only be an eyesore but would also provide a service - automobile parking spaces-that is unneeded in the area.
This letter briefly responds to the project applicant's late submittal to the Planning Commission, which Shamrock received on October 23, 2018.

In a prior letter, dated October 4, 2018 ("October 4 Letter"), Shamrock explained why it respectfully requests that you reject the Proposed Project. (See Exhibit B.)

I. THE ADDENDUM DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CEQA

The October 4 Letter identified two ways in which the Addendum violates CEQA. First, the Proposed
Project is barred from preparing a CEQA addendum under 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines")
section 15164 because the Proposed Project will cause new significant environmental effects and/or a

substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects beyond those analyzed in the SYCP EIR for (a) transportation, and (b) visual effects and neighborhood character. And second, the Addendum is facially insufficient because it does not analyze a sufficiently broad study area, thereby leaving unanswered what the true Impacts of the Proposed Project will be.
The project applicant responded to the transporlation claims in the Oclober 4 Letler through a letler from RCE Traffic and Transportation Engineering ("RCE Letter"). Traffic engineers at Linscott, Law and Greenspan ("LLG") analyzed the RCE Letter in a memorandum dated October 24, 2018. LLG's findings are attached as Exhibit A.
Response to the RCE Letter

1. New Impact to the Intersection at Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue and Pedestrian Mobility
LLG found that west-bound ("WB") traffic turning left from Camino de la Plaza into the Proposed Project's driveway will stack back into the Camino de la Plaza / Virginia Avenue intersection during the peak hour condition because the Proposed Project's "Traffio Impact Analysis" does not consider delay from heavy pedestrian trafflc passing in front of the driveway. (Exhibit B, October 4 Letter, Exhibit 1 at 2-3.) 1

In response, RCE conducted mid-week and Saturday pedestrian / bicycle counts that found that 208 PM peak hour mid-week pedestrians and 364 PM peak hour Saturday pedestrians crossed the Proposed Project's driveway on Camino de la Plaza-an average of 3+ podestrians per minute mid-week and 6+ pedestrians per minute on Saturday.' (RCE Letter at 3.)
From that count, RCE makes two unsupported assumptions.
First, ROE opines without analysis or support that despite heavy pedestrian usage, "[]here are adequate gaps in pedestrian travel to allow safe ingress and egress to the proposed project driveway on Camino de la Plaza." (RCE Letter at 2.)
Neither "speculation" nor "unsubstantiated opinion or narrative" qualify under CEQA as "substantial evidence." (CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).)
RCE could not opine that there are "adequate gaps in pedestrian travel" without performing a pedestrian gap analysis, and then combining that analysis with the queueing analysis in the "Traffic Impact Analysis® at Appendix G. (Exhibit A, LLG Memo af 1.) "Drivers attempting to turn to turn into the project driveway need drivers in all three EB lanes of Camino de la Plaza to respect the KEEP CLEAR zone at the same time there is a gap In pedestrian flows, a challenging situation.* (Id. [emphasis original].) This is the analysis called for but lacking in the RCE Letter.
Second, RCE opines that "pedestrian volumes are not anticipated to increase substantially in the future due lo the existing fully operational Ped West facility and the fully developed area to the west." (RCE Letter at 1.) This unsupported opinion doos not take into account that Ped East has only been open since August 15, 2018, and that the San Diego Assoclatíon of Govemments antlcipates an 87% increase in vehicle traffic in San Ysidro by 2030. (Exhibit B, LLG Memo at 1.) Contrary to RCE, pedestrian traffic along Camino la is de la Plaza is likely to increase, not stay the same.

RCE did not survey pedestrian counts on Sunday,

Finally, the WB left-turn pocket into the Proposed Project can only effoctively queue one car-not two
cars-because a driver must initiate his or her turn at the beginning of the "KEEP CLEAR" zone, which
leaves insufficient spacing for a second car to enter the left-turn pocket. (Exhibit A, LLG Memo at 1.) "A second vehicle approaching the driveway will extend beyond the pocket and impede WB thru traffic (see LL.G Figure 3).' (ld. [emphasis original]).) This will create a dangerous condition and impede through traffic on Camino de ia Plaza.

2. Inadequate Study Area for Transportation and Circulation

CEQA requires that the City analyze any *direct physical changes" and "reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes" in the environment that "may be caused by the project.' (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d).) To provide guidance the City has developed a Traffic Impact Study Manual, which requires an applicant to analyze all intersections with 50 or more peak hour trips in either direction as part of the project's "study area." (City of San Diego, Trip Impact Study Manual at 5-6 (1998).)

Figure 5 of the "Traffic Impact Analysis" shows 52 vehicles from the Proposed Project heading east of
Virginia Avenue on Camino de la Plaza to the southbound I-5 ramps." The intersection at Camino de la
Plaza and the SB I-5 ramps was found to be impacted and requiring mitigation in the $YCP EIR, (See SYCP EIR at 5.2-34, Table 5.2-10 [Impact 42]; Table 5.2-12 [MM TRF-32. calling for additional lanes for the southbound ramp].)
The RCE Letter claims that less than 50 vehicles actually reach the SB I-5 ramp because a "minor number a of these trips divert into the existing driveway on the north side of Camino de la Plaza (RCE Letter at
1.) The only driveway east of the Proposed Project and on the north side of Camino de la Plaza between Virginia Avenue and the 1-5 SB ramps is Border Station Parking, a 24-hour park-and-walk facility located at 4570 Camino De La Plaza, San Ysidro, CA 92173. (See htlps://borderstationparking.com/.) This assumption is unsupported, strains credulity, and does not qualify as substantial evidence.
Furthermore, the "Traffic Impact Analysis" assumes that project trip generation can be reduced by 50% "based on the unsupported assumption that this amount of 'park & walk' activity is already on the street system (page 11 of TIA)." (Exhibit A, LLG Memo at 2.) Unsupported assumptions, like unsubstantiated opinions, do not count as substantial evidence under CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).)
If this "park & walk" assumption is reduced even slightly--from 50% to 40%-then intersections at East San Ysidro Boulevard and Camino de la Plaza, and East San Ysidro Boulevard and the NB I-5 ramps should also be analyzed. (See Exhibit A, LLG Memo at 2.)
By using an inadequate study area, the Addendum fails to adequately analyze the direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts of the Proposed Project.

B. Visual Impacts and Neighborhood Character

Our October 4 Lelter disclosed that the Proposed Project would have a significant impact to visual effects and neighborhood character. The project applicant does not respond in any way to these findings, nor has any substantial evidence been introduced to counter the report of Patsy Price, a professional planner

2 During the October 4 hearing, City staff acknowledged that traffic heading east on Camino de la Plaza exceeded the Manual's 50 peak trip threshold.

certified by the American Institute of Certified Planners. (Exhibit B, October 4 Letter, Exhibit 2, Price
Memo.)

The Proposed Project will have : to new significant impact to neighborhood character because it is larger in mass, bulk, and scale than surrounding development, and is inconsistent with the Urban Design Policies that the SYCP EIR assumed would prevent future commercial development from causing a significant impact. This is a new significant impact that was not analyzed in the SYCP EIR and requires preparation of a new or supplemental EIR.

Il. CONCLUSION
Shamrock respectfully requests that the Planning Commission reject the Proposed Project as the wrong choice for the "gateway" to the International Pedestrian Port of Entry.

Outlined below are further comments regarding the inadequacy of the Traffic Impact 4542 Ruttner Street
Suite 100
Analysis dated November 27, 2017. San Diego. CA 92111
858.300.88001
1. One-car queuing capacity: A new finding is that only one car can effectively 858.300.8810 r
queue i11 the WB left-turn pocket. This is based on the position from which a www.ligengineers.com driver must initiate the turn, which has [o be alt the beginning of the "KEEP CLEAR" zone. The TIA on page 16 says the driveway is 60 feet west of Virginia Pasodena
Aveuue. This distance doesn't consider the presence of the proposed raised Irvine
San Diego median. A second vehicle approaching the driveway will extend beyond the Woodland Hills pocket and impede WB thru traffic (see LLG Figure 3). This iS a dangerous
condition.

2. Unsupported assumptions regarding pedestrian travel: Contrary to RCE (RCE letter dated Oct. 22, 2018), pedestrian traffic in the area is very likely to increase over lime. Ped East has only been open since August 15, 2018, and the San Diego Association of Governments projects an 87% increase in vehicle traffic in San Ysidro by 2030. (https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/regions/welcome to-the-pacific-rim-region-9/land-ports-of-entry/san-vsidro-land-port-of-entry/san- ysidro-lpoe-project-facts) RCE's opinion that pedestrian traffic will not increase substantially is unsupported.
3. Unsupported opinion without pedestrian gap analysis: Contrary to RCE (RCE letter dated Oct. 22, 2018), the opinion that "adequate gaps in pedestrian travel"* exist to allow safe ingress and egress from the Project is unsupported without a pedestrian gap analysis. No such gap analysis was performed. Further, the TIA shows up to 364 pedestrians an hour crossing the project driveway, an average of 6 per minute, a fairly steady flow. Drivers attempting to turn into the project driveway need drivers in all three EB lanes of Camino de la Plaza to respect the KEEP CLEAR zone at the same time there is A gap in pedestrian flows, a challenging situation. Drivers that initiate the tum into the driveway only to be faced with pedestrian activity will have to yield to the peds, potentially blocking EB thru traffic when the light turns green. This is a
dangerous condition.

4. Unsupported study area assumptions: The study area intersections were based
on the "50 rip rule" in the City's Traffic Impact Study Manual. The project trip generation was reduced by 50% based on the unsupported assumption that this amount of "park & walk" activity is already on the street system (page 11 of TIA). At that, the trip assigument shows 52 trips approaching AND departing the SB I-5 ramps intersection (TIA Figure 5). This is a frequently congested intersection and it should have been included in the study arca (see LLG Figures 2-1 and 2-2). If the 50% reduction assumption turned out to be only a 40%, then the intersections on the east side of I-5 would have been included in the study
arca. The project study area should include the following intersections:
I-5 SB ramps / Camino de la Plaza
San Ysidro Blvd Camino de la Plaza
San Y sidro Blvd /NB I-5 ramps

RE: Opposition to Item 3, Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960

Dear Chair Haase and Honorable Planning Commissioners:
submit this letter on behalf of our client, Shamrock/Outlets at the Border LLC ("Shamrock"), in opposition to the Virginia Avenue Parking Garage project ("Proposed Project"). Shamrock opposes the Proposed
Project for three key reasons:

1. CEQA: The Addendum to the San Ysidro Community Plan Program Environmental Impact Report No. 310690/SCH No. 2015111012 ("SYCP EIR") prepared for the Proposed Project does not
comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

2. Safety: The Proposed Project would create dangerous situation for the large number of pedestrians seeking to access the new PedWest border crossing and Shamrock's Outlets at the Border project, and

3. Scene: The Proposed Project would create a monolithic block at the doorstep of the PedWest International Pedestrian Port of Entry that would not only be an eyesore but would also provide a service--automobile parking spaces-that is unneeded in the area.

Shamrock is keenly interested in what happens with the Proposed Project because it is a vested and valued member of the community. Shamrack's Outlets at the Border project-immediately adjacent to the Proposed Project-is a large employer, large sales tax generator, and a significant draw for people on both
sides of the border.

Shamrock has also worked closely with the City and the General Services Administration ("GSA") for many years on the development of the new Ped West pedestrian border crossing, and donated the land necessary for Ped West and the City's Virginia Avenue Transit Center. Shamrock is also an involved member of the San Ysidro community, and plays host to community meetings at its center.
Shamrock respectfully requests that you reject the Proposed Project.

I. THE ADDENDUM DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CEQA
The Addendum does not comply with CEQA for two reasons. First, the Project is barred from preparing an addendum under 14 Cal. Code Regs. ("CEQA Guidelines") section 15164 because the Project will cause new significant environmental effects and/or a substantlal Increase in the seventy of previously identified significant effects beyond those analyzed in the SYCP EIR. And second, the Addendum is facially insufficient because it does not analyze a sufficiently broad study area, thereby leaving unanswered what the true impacts of the Project will be.

A. The Project Will Result In New and/or Substantially More Severe Environmental
Impacts

The CEQA Guidelines state that an addendum to an existing EIR is only proper where none of the circumstances set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15162(a)(1) --(a)(3) are present. (CEQA Guidelines § 15164(a).) In fact, a lead agency is prohibited from requiring section 15162(a)(1) -(a)(3) circumstances are present. a new or supplemental EIR unless one of the

The City should have required a new or supplemental EIR because the Proposed Project will trigger new/more severe environmental impacts than disclosed in the SYCP EIR's analysis of Transportation and Circulation. and Visual Impacis and Neighborhood Character, thereby triggering CEQA Guidelines Section 15162(a)(1).

1. Transportation and Circulation

a. New Impact to the Intersection of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue
The SYCP EIR analyzed the Community Plan Update's impact on traffic circulation by asking, "Issue 1: Would traffic associated with the proposed SYCPU.. cause any intersections, roads, or freeway segments to exceed the City's significance thresholds?"
The SYCP EIR found that the Community Plan Update would have a significant impact at the intersection of Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue, which could be reduced to acceptable levels by installing traffic signal and providing a second west-bound (WB) left-turn lane. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-43 and Tables 5.2- 10 and 5.2-14.)
Analyzing the same impact, the Addendum concludes that the Proposed Project would not cause a significant impact to study area intersections under existing, near term, or horizon year (2035) conditions. (Addendum at 9.)
An analysis by traffic engineers at Linscott, Law and Greenspan of the Proposed Project's "Traffic Impact Analysis" identified substantial problems with this impact conclusion. (See Exhibit 1, LLG Memorandum, dated October 3, 2018 ("LLG Memo").) In particular, the LLG Memo finds that the "Traffic Impact Analysis" did not adequately analyze the potential impacts associated with the Proposed Project's WB left-turn lane into the driveway on Camino de la Plaza.

Section 15162(a)(1) states: "Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the previous EIR .. . due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a
substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects."

In fact, the LLG Memo finds that during peak hour traffic, WB vehicles wailing to turn left will stack into the Camino de la Pleza and Virginia Avenue Intersection. (Id, at 2.) The "Traffic Impact Analysis" fails lo reveal this impact because it did not consider the delay that heavy pedestrian traffic passing in front of the Proposed Project's driveway would cause to vehicles waiting to turn left. (ld. at 2-3.)

Using the numbers from the Traffic Impact Analysis, we can expect more than 500 pedestrians to cross the driveway during the PM peak hour. (LLG Memo at 2, and Figure 1.) (Actually, those numbers may actually be low, since pedestrian counts were taken in April 2017, before the Ped West international border crossing was fully operational.)
Exhibit G provides the Traffic Impact Analysis' "Queuing Analysis." Yet a close inspection of the Queuing
Analysis reveals that "[w]hile Appendix G analyzes pedestrians and bicycles as they move through the
Virginia / Camino de la Plaza intersection, (it] does not analyze the uncontrolled actions of pedestrians and
bicycles at the project driveway." (LLG Memo at 3 [emphasis added].)

Accordingly, WB vehicles attempting to turn left will wait much longer than the Traffic Impact Analysis
anticipates because they will encounter heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza. (LLG Memo at
2,)

This is an entirely new impact from any intersection impacts analyzed in the SYCP EIR. and will trigger a significant impact at Issue because vehicle stacking into the Virginia Avenue / Camino de la Plaza intersection would exceed City significance thresholds.

b. New Significant Impact to Pedestrian Mobility

San Ysidro Community Plan Update Mobility Element contains goals and policles to promote and enhance pedestrian-friendly facilities throughout the community, including the border region. (SYCP at 3-1; SYCP EIR at 5.2-48.) In fact, the very first goal in the Mobility Element emphasizes "pedestrian-friendly facilities" in order to "minimize or reduce pedestrian/vehicular conflicts."2 (SYCP at 3-1.) So does the first pedestrian policy 3.2.1, which emphasizes "walkabllity and connectivity ...
The SYCP EIR analyzed the significance of the Community Plan Update's impacts on "alternative transportation modes" by asking: "Issue 2: Would the proposed SYCPU or SYHVSP decrease the percent of alternative mode trips in the City's transportation system?" (SYCP EIR at 5.2-46.) Citing the Mobility Element's goals and policies, the SYCP EIR concluded that the Community Plan Update would have a less than signiflcant impact with respect to pedestrians on Issue 2 due to the pedestrian improvements included in the Community Plan Update. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-49.) In this fashion, the City adopted the Mobllity Element's goals and policles as part of the significance threshold and applicable mitigation to address the potential impact of the Community Plan Update. (See Spring Valley Lake Ass'n v. City of Victorville (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 91, 102.)

2 Mobility Element Gaal: "Pedestrian-friendly facilities throughout the community with emphasis on the San Ysidro Historic Village and Border Village areas in order to minimize or reduce pedestrian/vehicular conflicts."

* Mobility Element Policy 3.2.1: "Support and promote walkability and connectivity through the construction of sidewalk and intersection Improvements throughout the community at, but not limited to; the following locations: . . . (1) Camino de la Plaza (Refer to Figure 3-7)." (emphasis original - Figure 3-7 provides a close-up schematic of the Intersection of Camino de la Plaza and E. San Ysidro Boulevard.)

The Addendum asserts that it will also have a less than significant Impact to "alternative transportation modes" because of its alleged consistency with the goals of the Mobilily Element. (Addendum at 9-10.) Yet the Addendum provides no analysis as to whether the Proposed Project's double-wide driveway and exit on Camino de la Plaza would meet the "pedestrian-friendly" goals and policies in the Mobility Element, or whether it would impact pedestrians walking along Camino de la Plaza. (Id.)
As described above, the "Traffic Impact Analysis" failed to account for heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza. As vehicles stack back into Virginia Avenue, stressed drivers will attempt to dart across three traffic lanes, a Class I I bicycle lane, and a heavily traveled sidewalk to enter the Proposed Project. LLG concludes that this situation will create "a high conflict driveway that will put pedestrians [traversing Camino de la Plaza] at risk." (LLG Mamo at 3.)
The Proposed Project will conflict with the Mobility Element's goals and policy because it will create anything but a "pedestrian-friendly' facility. This will cause a new significant impact to pedestrian mobility.*

2. Visual Impacts and Neighborhood Character
The SYCP EIR analyzed the Community Plan Update's impact on visual effects and neighborhood character by asking, "Issue 2: Would the proposed [Community Plan Update] . . . negatively or substantially aller the character of the neighborhood?" (SYCP EIR at 5.8-19.)
The SYCP EIR found that the Community Plan Update would have a less than significant impact to the "San Ysidro Neighborhood Districl"-where both the Proposed Project and Outlets at the Border are located--based on policias in the Urban Design Element that would "guide the design of future commercial development," including "Urban Design Element Policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31.° (SYCP EIR at 5.8-21 and 5.8-22.) In this fashion, the City adopted specific Urban Design Element pollcies as part of the significance threshold and applicable mitigation to address the potential impact of the Community Plan Update. (See Spring Valley Lake Ass'n, 248 Cal.App. 4th at 102.)
The Addendum asserts that the Proposed Project will have a less than significant impact based on its consistency wilh four Urban Design Element policies, including Policies 4.2.3, 4.2.10, 4.3.2, and 4.3.39. (Addendum at 19-20.) Patsy Price of Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP, a professional planner certified by the American Institute of Certified Planners, analyzed the Proposed Project's alleged consistency with Policies 4.2.3 and 4.2.10 and found its conclusion cannot be supported. (See Exhibit 2. Price Merno, at 1-2.)
Urban Design Policy 4.2.3:5 The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Pollcy because il is incompatible in scale with the heights used in the Las Americas Outlet Center localed to the west and Outlets at the Border to the south, which are made up of single story commercial buildings. Smaller scale bulldings surrounded by landscaping are located at the Camino de la Plaza street frontage, with larger, multi-tenant buildings set back significantly from the street frontage. Development to the north and east of the Proposed Project site also consists of one- and two- story structures with landscaping along the street frortage. The Project's proposed 6-story, 70
4 jti worth noting that SYCP EIR found certain mitigation measures infeasible because they would impact existing or proposed sidewalks or bicycle facilities, which would discourage walking and bicycling. (SYCP EIR at 5.2-42 and Table 5.2-13.)
5 Policy 4.2.3 requires: "Tailor building height and scale to be sensitive to surrounding residential and
commercial uses."

foot height with reduced setbacks and minimal landscaping is nol iS at all consistent with or sensilive
1o the height and scale of surrounding development.

Urban Design Policy 4.2.10: First, the Addendum selectively quotes this Policy, omitting the bold ilalicized portion: "Strengthen neighborhood identity and connectivity with pedestrian
promenades, wayfinding, and gateway features (also see Section 4.11)." Not only is the
Proposed Project inconsislent with this Policy because it in no way develops a "pedestrian promenade° (see Price letter at 2), but it also ulterly fails to provide any "gateway features,' even though it sits at what the Community Plan Identifies as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see
Figure 4-1, SYCP at 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP at Policy 4.11.10.f.)

• Urban Design Policy 4.3.2:° The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Policy because it in no way develops *pedestrian promenade" (see Price letter at 2), and fails to provide "façade Improvements, anriched streetscapes and landscaping" along the Camino de la Plaza frontage, which will be exposed to the most traffic.
Urban Design Policy 4.3.39: This Policy is an Industrial Area Design policy. Whether the Proposed Project is consistent with this Policy is irrelevant to the commercial project being analyzed.

Finally, the Addendum utterly falls to compare the Proposed Project's consistency with Urban Design Policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31, the key policies the SYCP EIR assumed would "guide the design of future commercial development." (SYCP EIR at 5.8-21.) In fact, the Proposed Project is
inconsistent with a number of these key Commercial Policies (See Price Momo al 2-3), including:

0 Commercial Policy 4.3.20: Proposed Project fails to "promote pedestrian activities and
amenities ....

3 Commercial Policy 4.3.22: Proposed Project fails to "promote consistent architectural theming for commercial centers" and does not utilize "complementary materials, colors, lighting, and massing."

C Commercial Policy 4.3.23: Proposed Project fails to provide "articulation and variation in massing to minimize building scale and provide an enhanced pedestrian orientation. In fact, the 70 foot tall building seeks variances to setbacks and loorns over pedestrians
on Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue.

O Commercial Policy 4.3.29: Proposed Project fails to provide street landscaping on la Camino de la Plaza, which therefore cannot be carried onto Virginia Avenue,
As demonstrated above, the Proposed Project will have a new significant impact to neighborhood character
because it is larger in mass, bulk, and scale than surrounding development, and Is inconsistent with the
Urban Design Policies that the SYCP EIR assumed would prevent future commercial development from a causing a significant impact. This is a new significant impact that was not analyzed in the SYCP EIR and requires preparation of a new or supplemental EIR.
Policy 4.3.2 requires: "Promote enhancements to commercial areas including façade Improvements, enriched streetscapes and landscaping, unified slgnage programs, improved pedestrian access, and infill
pad development."

B. Inadequate Study Area for Transportation and Circulation
CEQA requires that the Cily analyze any "direct physical changes" and "reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes" in the environment that "may be caused by the project.' (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d).) With respect to traffic and circulation impacts, the City has developed a Traffic Impact Study Manual to guide a project applicant's analysis. Pursuant to this Traffic Impact Study Manual, the Manual requires the applicant to perform a traffic study on the "study area" that will be impacted by the project. According to the Manual, all intersections with 50 or more peak hour trips in either direction must be analyzed as part of the project's "study area." (City of San Diego, Trip impact Study Manual at 5-6 (1998).)
The "Traffic Impact Analysis" only analyzed one intersection-Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue. Given the size and density of the Proposed Project, LLG scrutinized the "Traffic Impact Analysis" to determine whether it used the proper study area. Figure 5 of the "Traffic Impact Analysis" shows 52 vehicles heading east of Virginia Avenue on Camino de la Plaza. (LLG Memo at 1.) Further, the trip distribution chart in Flgure 4 shows
hour trips. (ld.) that 90% of trips to/from the east should be applied to over 100 peak

Accordingly, both Figures 4 and 5 indicate that the "Traffic Impact Analysis" used an insufficiently small "study area" because it failed to include intersections beyond Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue that will experience at least 50 or more peak hour trips. In LLG's professional opinion, "the intersections of Camino de la Plaza at the [southbound} I-5 ramps and Camino de la Plaza at San Ysidro Boulevard should be included in the analysis to evaluate the impacts of the project." (LLG Memo at 1.)
to By failing to adequately analyze the direct and reasonably foreseeable indirect Impacts of the Proposed Project, the Addendum fails to support its conclusion that there are no significant impacts to intersections that should be in the study area but have not been analyzed.
In addition, by failing to adequately use an adequate study area, the Proposed Project also falls to provide sufficient basis to determine whether any significant cumulative impacts beyond the scope of the SYCP EIR may occur as a result of this Proposed Project and all past, present, and reasonably foreseeable development in the area. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130.)

C. Inadequate Project Description
The Proposed Project relies upon a strip of property--owned by Shamrock--along its Virginia Avenue frontage as key element of its project design and future construction implementation. The Addendum assumes that the Proposed Project has legal rights to use this strip of property. In fact, Shamrock has refused to grant an easement for the Proposed Project.
CEQA requires that the project description be accurate. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199.) Due to its reliance to on this strip of property along Virginia Avenue, the Addendum includes an inadequate project description, and therefore fails to analyze a real project. Without an accurate project description, the Addendum fails as an environmental document. (ld.)

Il. THE PROJECT WOULD CREATE A MONOLITHIC BLOCK BLOCKING THE PED WEST INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND THE OUTLETS AT THE BORDER PROJECT
The physical effect of the Proposed Project will be to effectively screen the public from seeing both Ped West facility, and the Outlets at the Border project. The Proposed Project will have detrimental impacts on both facilities.

In numerous places throughout the SYCP. various policies recognize the importance of the Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see Figure 4-1, SYCP at 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP at Policy 4.11.10.f.) Yet the Proposed Project will do nothing to create a significant gateway between the United States and Mexico. To the contrary, it will provide a monolithic structure with no dynamism or appeal.
Furthermore, Shamrock has significant concerns that the Proposed Project will screen its customers from the Outlets at the Border project. As a major local employer, significant sales tax revenue generator, and significant draw to the border, this is a concern not only to Shamrock but also to the broader communty and the City.

That is why Shamrock has refused to grant the Proposed Project the easement along its Virginia Avenue
frontage upon which the project design relies.
As a developer, Shamrock takes no pleasure in standing in opposition to the Proposed Project. Yet as a vested member of the community, it has no choice but to voice its concerns with the project.

Sincerely,

Ryan R. Waterman

CEQA problems, safety issues, project access and technical errors. San Dicgo
Woodiand Hills
A. Significant Impact Issues
1. Insufficient Study Area- The Traffic Impact Aualysis must analyze all intersections with 50 or more peak hour trips in either direction, per City of San
Diego "Traffic lmpact Study Manual" guidelines. Figure 5 of the report shows 52
vehicles going east of Virginia Avenue on Camino De La Plaza, Also, the
project's trip distribution (see Figure 4) shows 90% of trips to/from the east, and
108 peak hour trips in and out. Using simple math, 90% of 108 peak hour in and
out trips shows more than enough trips to study more than just the Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection. Therefore, the intersections of Camino
De La Plaza at the SB I-5 ramps and Camino De La Plaza at San Ysidro Boulevard
should be included in the analysis to evaluate the impacts of the project.

2. Substandard access- The project proposes driveway access to the project for
vehicles traveling both west and castbound 01 Camino de la Plaza, located
approximately 100 feet from Virginia Avenue. The project proposes a striped
side-by-side WB left turn lane 1o access the driveway. The WB left turn pocket
length is 60 feet, which can accommodate two cars (at 25 fcet per car), Drivers
turning lett into the site will have to navigate through one eastbound left turn lane,
two EB through lanes, bike lane, and a heavily active pedestrian sidewalk.

The Traffic Impact Analysis concludes that the WB left turn will operate at LOS A
during AM and PM peak hours. (Traffic Impact Analysis, at p. 13) The significant
issue with the Traffic Impact Analysis' conclusion is that it fails to adequately
account for heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza when calculating

queuing to turn left. In fact, the project will cause stacking into the Virginia Avenue intersection as drivers waiting to turn left into the project encounter heavy pedestrian traffic along Camino de la Plaza.
Based on the Traffic Impact Analysis' pedestrian counts (Appendix H), there are 395 pedestrians per PM Peak hour (both EB and WB direction combined) walking on the south side and 152 pedestrians per PM Peak hour (both NB and SB direction combined) walking on the west side of Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza intersection as shown in Figure 1, below.

Based on the pedestrian counts at the Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza
intersection, it is expected to have more than 500 pedestrians crossing the project driveway during the PM peak hour. It should be noted that when the pedestrian counts were collected in April 2017, the Ped West facility was not fully open. Accordingly, it is our professional opinion that the pedestrian volumes are likely higher today, and will be even higher in the 2035 horizon
year.

The Traffic Impact Analysis did not adequately account for pedestrians when calculating queuing for WB left turn. (See Traffic Impact Analysis at 16.) In
fact, the queuing analysis does not account for heavy pedestrian traffic along
Camino de la Plaza. (See Traffic Impact Analysis at 16, and Appendix G)
While Appendix G analyzes pedestrians and bicycles as they move through the
Virginia / Camino de la Plaza intersection, but Appendix G does not analyze the uncontrolled actions of pedestrians and bicycles at the project driveway.
The Traffic Impact Analysis assumed zero pedestrians when analyzing traffic
moving in and out of the site.

This failure to account for heavy pedestrian traffic, the insufficient WB left turn
pocket, and proximity to the Virginia/Camino de la Plaza intersection poses
potential accident problem at the driveway access due to the left turn lane, and
potential accident problem in the Virginia/Carino de la Plaza intersection.
3. Unsafe driveway- As documented by paragraph 2, the project driveway will be
a high conflict driveway that will put pedestrians at risk.

B. Technical Errors

1. Queuing Incorrect- Due to the heavy pedestrian activity along the sidewalk,
WB left turning vehicles will have to wait for an adequate gap in vehicles and
•pedestrians. The left Ltl1n pocket length can only store 2 vehicles. This will
cause vehicles to spill back into the through lane and impede segment and
intersection operations. The left tum pocket length is insufficient and does not
meet City standards.

2. U-turn- The project traffic impact study Section 3.0 suggested a proposed
widening of the north side of Camino De La Plaza to add a U-turn to the
eastbound left turn move at the Camino De La Plaza and Virginia Avenue
intersection. Since the U-turn is a part of the project trip assignment, the study
should recommend a minimum roadway width and provide a turn-template to
ensure the feasibility of a U-turn.

3. WB Exit - The traffic impact study suggested that drivers that want to go west
will need to weave to the EB left turn lane upon exiting driveway and make a
U-turn. However there is not enough weaving length available for vehicles to
get into the left turn lane. This will create a potential safety issue as the driveway
is in close proximity (within 100 feet) to the intersection of Virginia Avenue
and Camino De La Plaza.

Conclusions:

1. The study area must be expanded to include all intersections with 50 peak hour trips and others susceptible to significant impacts, including the SB I-5 ramps and Camino De La Plaza at San Y sidro Boulevard.
2. The Camino De La Plaza driveway must be restricted to right-turns into the project only, with 110 WB left-turns allowed, in order to avoid danger to pedestrians and queuing into the Virginia Avenue/Camino de la Plaza intersection. This should be accomplished via the installation of a raised
median at least 150 feet long, by the applicant.
3. Due to the current prohibition of U-turns along Camino De La Plaza, a second access point on the south side of the site is necessary, near the existing driveway on the south side. No new driveways should be allowed on Virginia Avenue.

RE: Planning Commission October 4, 2018 Hearing, Item 3 Virginia Ave Parking Garage - Project No. 375960

Dear Chair Haase and Honorable Members of the Planning Commission:

I am land use planner with over 15 years of experlence in jurisdictions throughout California, and have
worked for public agencies as a professional planner, and for private property owners as a land use project manager. I regularly represent clients before planning commissions and design boards as well as assisting clients in designing context appropriate development projects. My detailed bio is attached.
I reviewed the project plans, staff report, and environmental analysis for the proposed Virginia Avenue Parking Garage (Project) as well as the applicable policies and provisions of the San Ysidro Community Plan (SYCP). It is my professional opinion that the Project is inconsistent with numerous SYCP policies that require development to be compatible with and in scale with its surroundings and require enhanced pedestrian amenities and improved pedestrian and bicyclist safety in new development and redevelopment. Specifically:
The Project is not compatible with the surrounding context as it far exceeds the height, bulk, and scale of surrounding development. The staff report fails to address the Project's
compatibility with surrounding development and the Addendum to the Environmental Impact
Report (EIR Addendum) erroneously states that the project is consistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.3'
because it is compatible in scale with the heights used in the Las Americas Outlet Center located to the west. In fact, the Las Americas Outlet Center is made up of single story commercial buildings. Smaller scale buildings surrounded by landscaping are located at the Camino de la Plaza street frontage of the center and larger, multi-tenant buildings are set back significantly from the street frontage. Development to the north and east of the Project site also consists of one- and two-story structures with landscaping along the street frontage. The Project's proposed 6-story, 70 foot height with reduced setbacks and minimal landscaping is not at all consistent with or sensitive to the height and scale of surrounding development. Therefore, it is inconsistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.3 as well as Policy 4.3.8.1

1 Policy 4.2.3 requires: Tailor building height and scale to be sensitive to surrounding residential and commercial uses. Policy 4.3.8 requires: Encourage infill projects and promote compatibility with the surrounding context in terms of building scale, compactness of development, and design character and articulation.

The Project will reduce pedestrian safety and detract from the pedestrian environment. The staff report and EIR Addendum assert that the project is consistent with SYCP Policy 4.2.10° because It Includes a "pedestrlan promenade" along the street frontages and an indentation of six foet on the Virginia Avenue side. While the staff report notes the Project "is located in a very complex traffic area," it fails to address how the existing complex traffic conditions as well as the addition of a left turn lane immediately west of the Camino de la Plaza/Virginia Avenue intersection will impact pedestrian safety and cyclist safety. (Staff Report at p. 8.)
The Project site is located in an area with both heavy pedestrian and vehlcular traffic adjacent to the Ped West international pedestrian border crossing. While including some pedestrian amenities along the Virginia Avenue street frontage, the Project design prioritizes vehicular traffic at the expense of pedestrian safety along Camino de la Plaza. The majority of the Camino de la Plaza frontage is a driveway and the blank laçade of the parking structure, with minimal proposed landscaping. This does not enhance the pedestrian environment, and, in fact, the significant amount of vehicular traffic turning into the Project from the left turn lane, which crosses two lanes of traffic and a Class II bikeway, will decrease pedestrian and cyclist safety.
The Project proposes a reduced setback of 6 feet 6 inches on the Virginia Avenue frontage for upper stories and 12 feet 9 inch setback for the first story. Rather than providing a pedestrian friendly environment, the bulk and scale of the structure is likely to have an imposing effect with five stories of parking structure looming over pedestrians.
A deviation from the maximum height and setback reductions cannot be justified for this primary intersection/activity node and potential gateway opportunity area. The SYCP identifies the corner of Virginia Avenue and Camino De La Plaza as a primary intersection/activity node and potential gateway opportunity. (See SYCP at Figure 4-1.) An increase in height above the maximum allowed by zoning cannot be justified for this primary intersection and gateway site. In fact, a height of 60 feet does not appear to be justified based on SYCP policies requiring compatibility with the surrounding context.
The staff report states that "[bJuilding height was dictated by the need to provide a minimum number of parking spaces and physical conditions of the site, which do not allow for subterranean parking levels" and identifies this as justification for a 10 foot increase in the maximum 60 foot height limit. (Staff Report at p. 7.) The minimum number of parking spaces to serve lhe on-site retail uses is 66 spaces. The additional 283 spaces are proposed private paid parking spaces. There is no requirement that these spaces be provided. The building height and setback reductions are clearly intended to maximize the profitability of the development without regard for its impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
The Project is Inconsistent with key commercial policies of the San Ysidro Community Plan upon which the SYPC EIR's conclusions are based. Finally; the EIR Addendum utterly fails to analyze the Project's consistency with SYPC Urban Design Element policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31. the key policies the SYCP EIR assumed would "guide the design of future commercial development.' (SYCP EIR at 5.8-21.) In fact, the Project is inconsistent with a number of these key commercial policies, including:

g Commercial Policy 4.3.20: The Project fails to "promote pedestrian activities and
amenities ...."

3 Policy 4.2.10 requires: Strengthen neighborhood identity and connectivity with pedestrian promenades, wayfinding, and gateway features.

• Commercial Policy 4.3.22: The Project fails to "promote consistent architectural theming for commercial centers" and does not utilize "complementary materials, colors. lighting,
and massing."
Commercial Policy 4.3.23: The Project fails to provide "articulation and variation in massing to minimize building scale and provide an enhanced pedestrian orientation . .
In fact, the 70 foot tall building seeks variances to getbacks and looms over pedestrians on
Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue.

0 Commercial Policy 4.3.29: The Project fails to provide street any subslantial landscaping on Camino de la Plaza, which therefore cannot be carried onto Virginia Avenue.
The proposed Project will result in a monolithic parking structure that is incompatible with surrounding
development, decreases pedestrian and cyclist safety, and is inappropriate for this primary intersection and gateway sile. I respectfully encourage the Planning Commission to deny the Project as proposed and require the applicant to reduce the size, bulk, and scale of the development to be more compatible with its surroundings and provide true pedestrian amenities and enhanced pedestrian safety features in this heavily trafficked and important gateway location.

Hase

SHAMROCK/OUTLETS AT THE BORDER, LLC

May 10, 2019

VIA ELECTRONIC MAIL
(Hearings1@sandiego.gov)

Hon. Mayor Falconer and City Councilmembers Attention: City Clerk
City Administration Building
202 "C" Street
San Diego, CA 92101-4806
Mail Station 2A

RE: Appeal of Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960 Letter in Opposition

Dear Hon. Mayor Falconer and Hon. City Councilmembers:
By this letter Shamrock/Outlets at the Border LLC (*Shamrock") voices its continuing opposition to the Virginia Avenue Parking Garage, Project No. 375960, for the reasons set forth in its letters submitted to the Planning Commission on October 4 and October 25,
2018, and its timely appeal to the City Council, dated November 8, 2018, all incorporated by reference herein.
Shamrock's objection to the Proposed Project before the City Council is that it will not comply with San Ysidro Community Plan's ("SYCP) goals and policies that emphasize pedestrian and bicyclist mobility, compatible bulk and scale in development, and recognize the importance of the Camino de la Plaza Virginia Avenue intersection as a primary gateway between the U.S. and Mexico.'
Although the SYCP's policies apply to the Proposed Project, the Proposed Project does not comply with many of them, as described below:

Mobility Element

Shamrock raised concerns with the Proposed Project's environmental document before
the Planning Commission, however, the Proposed Project's CEQA document is not
before the City Council on appeal.

P.O. Box 90529 - San Diego, CA 92169

Hon. Mayor Falconer and Hon. City Councilmembers May 10, 2019
Page 2

Mobility Element Goal:2 The Proposed Project would not meet the "pedestrian- friendly" goal of the Mobility Element due to pedestrian and bicyclist conflicts caused by the Proposed Project on Camino de la Plaza.
Mobility Policy 3.2.1:3 The Proposed Project would also not meet the SYCP's
policy of development that emphasizes walkability and connectivity due to the pedestrian and bicyclist conflicts it will cause on Camino de la Plaza.
Urban Design Element
Urban Design Policy 4.2.3:4 The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Policy because it is incompatible in scale with the heights used in the Las Americas Outlet Center located to the west and Outlets at the Border to the south, which
are made up of single story commercial buildings. Smaller scale buildings surrounded by landscaping are located at the Camino de la Plaza street frontage,
with larger, multi-tenant buildings set back significantly from the street frontage.
Development to the north and east of the Proposed Project site also consists of one- and two-story structures with landscaping along the street frontage. The Project's proposed 6-story, 70 foot height with reduced setbacks and minimal landscaping is not at all consistent with or sensitive to the height and scale of surrounding development.
Urban Design Policy 4.2.10:5 Not only is the Proposed Project inconsistent with this Policy because it in no way develops a "pedestrian promenade," but it also utterly fails to provide any "gateway features," even though it sits at what the Community Plan identifies as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see Figure 4-1, SYCP at 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP at Policy
4.11.10.f.)

2 The first Mobility Element Goal states: "Pedestrian-friendly facilities throughout the community with emphasis on the San Ysidro Historic Village and Border Village areas in order to minimize or reduce pedestrian/vchicular conflicts."
Mobility Policy 3.2.1 states: "Support and promote walkability and connectivity through the construction of sidewalk and intersection improvements throughout the community at, but not limited to; the following locations: . . . (l) Camino de la Plaza (Refer to Figure 3-7)." (emphasis original - Figure 3-7 provides a close-up schematic of the intersection of Camino de la Plaza and E. San Ysidro Boulevard.)
4 Urban Design Policy 4.2.3 states: "Tailor building beight and scale to be sensitive to surrounding residential and commercial uses."
5 Urban Design Policy 4.2.10 states: "Strengthen neighborhood identity and connectivity with pedestrian promenades, wayfinding, and gateway features (also see Section 4.11)."

Hon. Mayor Falconer and Hon. City Councilmembers

Urban Design Policy 4.3.2:6 The Proposed Project is inconsistent with this Policy because it in no way develops a "pedestrian promenade* and fails to provide "*façade improvements, enriched streetscapes and landscaping" along the Camino de la Plaza frontage, which will be exposed to the most traffic.
Urban Design Policies 4.3.21 through 4.3.31: These policies are the key policies
in the SYCP intended to guide the design of future commercial development. In fact, the Proposed Project is inconsistent with a number of these key Commercial Policies, including:

O Commercial Policy 4.3.20: Proposed Project fails to "promote pedestrian activities and amenities . . ..

o Commercial Policy 4.3.22: Proposed Project fails to "promote consistent
architectural theming for commercial centers" and does not utilize "*complementary materials, colors, lighting, and massing.'

O Commercial Policy 4.3.23: Proposed Project fails to provide "*articulation and variation in massing to minimize building scale and provide an enhanced pedestrian orientation . . . ." In fact, the 70 foot tall building seeks variances to setbacks and looms over pedestrians on Camino de la
Plaza and Virginia Avenue.

O Commercial Policy 4.3.29: Proposed Project fails to provide street landscaping on Camino de la Plaza, which therefore cannot be carried onto Virginia Avenue.
The physical effect of the Proposed Project will be to effectively screen the public from seeing both the new pedestrian border crossing facility (Ped West), and the Outlets at the Border project. The Proposed Project will have detrimental impacts on both facilities.
In numerous places throughout the SYCP. various policies recognize the importance of the Camino de la Plaza and Virginia Avenue intersection as a "Primary Intersection / Activity Node" (see Figure 4-1, SYCP at 4-2) and a "secondary gateway" (see SYCP at Policy 4.11.10.f.). Yet the Proposed Project will do nothing to create a significant gateway between the United States and Mexico. To the contrary, it will provide a monolithic structure with no dynamism or appeal.
Furthermore, Shamrock has significant concerns that the Proposed Project will screen its customers from the Outlets at the Border project. As a major local employer, significant

6 Urban Design Policy 4.3.2 states: "Promote enhancements to commercial areas
including façade improvements, enriched streetscapes and landscaping, unified signage programs, improved pedestrian access, and infill pad development."

Hon. Mayor Falconer and Hon. City Councilmembers

sales tax revenue generator, and significant draw to the border, this is a concern not only
to Shamrock but also to the broader community and the City.

The Proposed Project is the wrong project in the wrong location, as demonstrated by its failure to comply with the SYCP.
Shamrock respectfully requests that the City Council reject the Proposed Project.

Sincerely,
Pt Randy Levinson
