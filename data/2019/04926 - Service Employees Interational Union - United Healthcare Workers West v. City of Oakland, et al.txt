RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the
City of Oakland

To the Attorney General of the State of California:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and
Code of Civil Procedure section 388, that on August 26, 2019, Petitioner Service Employees International Union - United Healthcare Workers West filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate (the "Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental
Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), against the City of Oakland ("City"). The Petition challenges the City's adoption of an ordinance authorizing the sale of one full city block of City-owned property in downtown Oakland for the purpose of a large commercial development project ("Project"). The lawsuit will be based on violations of CEQA and other claims, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative and environmental review proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition, and is attached to this notice as
Exhibit 1.

Very truly yours,

ALAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ORPARATION

1 Petitioner Service Employees International Union - United Healthcare Workers West

2 ("UHW" or "Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandamus against Respondent City of Oakland ("City"

3 or "Respondent") and alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. This petition challenges the City's adoption of an ordinance authorizing the sale of

6 one full city block of City-owned property in downtown Oakland for the purpose of a large

7 commercial development project ("Project").

8 2. An Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") was previously prepared for
9 development of this city block consisting of a mix of office and residential uses. Long after
10 circulation of the EIR for public comment, however, the development plans were changed to

11 include uses not previously contemplated, much less analyzed, in the original EIR. The most
12 notable of these new uses is a medical health clinic.

13 3. Although the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") contemplates that
14 projects may change over time, and includes procedures for supplemental review to
15 accommodate such changes, the City ignored these mandated procedures and approved the
16 revised Project without any analysis of how these new uses, including the proposed medical
17 health clinic, might result in new or exacerbated environmental impacts. As a result, the public
18 and the decision-makers have not been adequately advised of the environmental consequences
19 of the revised Project.

20 4. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside the City's
21 ordinance approving negotiation and execution of the proposed sale since, as more fully set forth
22 below, the City has violated CEQA.

23 PARTIES

24 5. Petitioner SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION - UNITED
25 HEALTHCARE WORKERS WEST ("UHW") is a labor organization and employer

26 representing thousands of healthcare workers who live, work, and recreate in downtown

27 Oakland near the Project site and in Alameda County. UHW members and employees who live
28 and work near the Project have several legally cognizable interests in the Project and will be

SOLURI
MESERVE 2

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 negatively affected by the Project's adverse environmental impacts and improper approval. For

2 example, many UHW members are Kaiser employees presently working in Oakland who could

3 be assigned to work in the medical clinic component of the Project. UHW's purposes include
4 advocating for vital services that keep UHW members and their families safe, make their

5 communities strong, and protect the environment. Further, UHW's office is located less than

6 one city block away from the Project site and so UHW employees working in that office will be

7 directly impacted by the Project. Thus, the interests of UHW and its members are unique and

8 will be directly impacted by the Project. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, its
9 members, employees, and in the public interest.

10 6. UHW and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondent's

11 compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and

12 adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this Petition
13 and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the

14 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a

15 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the procedural, environmental,
16 and other harms alleged herein.

17 7. Respondent CITY OF OAKLAND ("City" or "Respondent") is municipal
18 corporation, organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government

19 power. The City is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, the

20 City is responsible for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Revised
21 Project and its impacts, and, if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to

22 lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. The Revised Project is within the City's
23 jurisdictional limits.

24 8. Real Party in Interest W/L TELEGRAPH OWNER, LLC (Real Party") is
25 identified as the "project applicant" in the City's notice of determination ("NOD") for the
26 Project filed on July 25, 2019. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that
27 Real Party is a Delaware limited liability company operating in California.

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 9. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents, DOES 1
2 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes,

3 and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the

4 actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents

5 have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to

6 insert such identities and capacities.

7 10. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest,

8 ROES 1 through 10, and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioner is
9 informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named real parties are also
10 directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the true

11 identities and capacities of these real parties have been determined, Petitioner will amend this
12 Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 11. The Court has jurisdiction over this matter in accordance with Code of Civil
15 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5

16 12. Venue is proper in Alameda County in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure

17 section 394, subdivision (a), among others, because the Project is located in Alameda County.

18 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

19 13. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in
20 the administrative process. Petitioner and its members actively participated in the City's
21 administrative process for the Project, and stated their objections to the City's action. (See Pub.
22 Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

23 14. Petitioner is not required to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to any
24 claims arising from CEQA. The City failed to provide adequate public notice that it was taking
25 any CEQA action concerning the Project. The City Council agendas dated July 9, 2019 and July
26 16, 2019, make no reference to any CEQA actions associated with the City's approval of the
27 Project. On information and belief, the City's public notices for these same meetings are
28 lacking any such reference to CEQA action.

SOLURI
MESERVE 4

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 15. Because the City's public notices failed to alert the public that the City would take

2 any CEQA action associated with its approval of the Project, there is no requirement to exhaust

3 administrative remedies. (Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. County of Marin (2013) 218
4 Cal.App.4th 209, 226-227.)

5 16. Although not required by law due to the City's inadequate public notice of any

6 CEQA action on the Project, Petitioner and its members objected to the City's approval of the

7 Project orally and in writing.

8 17. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all a
9 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
10 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioner, and others, made oral and written comments on the Project,
11 and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition. The extent of public objections
12 cannot be fully determined until the administrative record has been certified, including
13 transcripts of all public hearings on the Project.
14 18. As a further result of the City's inadequate public notice, Petitioner is not limited

15 to alleging only those CEQA deficiencies that have been asserted during the City's
16 administrative process. (Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. County of Marin (2013) 218
17 Cal.App.4th 209, 226-227.) To the extent additional deficiencies are revealed in the certified
18 administrative record, Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege those deficiencies also.
19 19. Respondent has taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the NOD and
20 approving the Project.
21 20. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the City's abuse of
22 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit.

23 STANDING

24 21. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because it has
25 personal, business, community and environmental interests that are directly and adversely

26 affected by the City's approval of the Project and issuance of the NOD. Petitioner participated
27 in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted its remedies. Accordingly, Petitioner has
28 standing to sue.

SOLURI
MESERVE 5

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 22. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's impacts are fully

2 mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner's interests will be adversely

3 affected and injured by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project.

4 23. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action, including

5 complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing notice

6 to the City that this action would be filed. (See Exhibit A attached.)

7 IRREPARABLE HARM

8 24. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute prejudicial abuse of
9 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

10 §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

11 25. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.
12 If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Petitioner and the environment will be

13 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.
14 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

15 26. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner
16 elects to prepare the administrative record in this action.

17 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

18 27. The Project site is commonly identified as 2100 Telegraph Avenue in Oakland,
19 California. It comprises one full city block, and is bounded by Telegraph Avenue to the west,
20 22nd Street to the north, Broadway to the cast, and 21st Street to the south.
21 28. The Project site is owned by the City, and presently improved by a two-story
22 parking structure. Demolition of the existing structure is an element of the Project.

23 29. On or about December 2017, the City released a Draft Environmental Impact
24 Report ("DEIR") purporting to analyze the environmental impacts of a mixed-use development
25 project at the Project site involving "up to 2.8 million square feet of office or 1,556 residential
26 dwelling units or a mix of the two."

27 30. While purporting to evaluate "a range of development scenarios," the DEIR's
28 analysis was limited to only two land uses: commercial offices and residential dwellings. The

SOLURI
MESERVE 6

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 DEIR never mentioned any medical or clinical uses in its range of development scenarios, much

2 less analyze the impacts of such uses.

3 31. The Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") was subsequently prepared and
4 released on or about June 2018. As with the DEIR, the FEIR's analysis was limited to various

5 scenarios of office and residential uses, and never mentioned or analyzed any medical or clinical

6 uses as a component of the Project. The Planning Commission certified the FEIR, and approved

7 development plans for the Project, on or about July 2018.

8 32. On or about July 2019, or approximately one year after release of the FEIR, it was
9 publicly revealed that Kaiser Permanente ("Kaiser") would "purchase the rights to develop the
10| Project," and planned to construct and operate a medical health clinic as a component of the
11 Project. Medical clinics are classified as different uses from either office or residential uses in

12 the City's Planning Code.

13 33. The operation of a medical clinic raises environmental issues that are different
14 from office or residential uses including, but not limited to hazards and hazardous materials as

15 well as land use conflicts. Medical clinics are also subject to discretionary actions by other state

16 and local agencies that are not implicated by office or residential uses.

17 34. The City prepared a staff report for the Project describing the recent disclosure of

18 Kaiser's involvement in the Project, but failed to address the medical clinic component of the
19 Project. The staff report included no attachment setting forth an analysis of the environmental
20 implications of a medical clinic use. The City did not attach to its staff report a CEQA
21 Addendum or other document analyzing whether the medical clinic, or other proposed new uses
22 by Kaiser, trigger new or exacerbated environmental impacts pursuant to Public Resources Code

23 section 21166 or CEQA Guidelines section 15162.

24 35. Petitioner, and others, specifically advised the City on July 16, 2019, regarding the
25 existence of the medical health clinic element of the Project, and its potential for new significant
26 or exacerbated impacts that were not addressed in the earlier EIR. The City ignored this
27 information, and approved the Project on that same date without any analysis of the new medicall

28 health clinic use or other new uses proposed by Kaiser.

1 36. On July 25, 2019, the City filed a NOD for the Project triggering a 30-day statute

2 of limitations that expires on August 26, 2019. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15094, subd. (g), 15112,

3 subd. (c)(1); Code Civ. Proc., §12a.)

4 37. Petitioner filed its Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of

5 limitations.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violation of CEQA)

8 38. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 37 above.

9 39. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse
10 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing

11 the significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

12 40. The EIR is an informational document that must disclose any potentially
13 significant environmental impacts of the project, and inform decision-makers and the general
14 public of mitigation measures and alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially
15 lessen those impacts.

16 41. CEQA is designed to ensure that the public lead agency identifies all potentially
17 significant environmental impacts of a proposed project, adequately discloses those impacts to
18 the public, and implements all feasible alternatives or mitigation measures necessary to avoid or
19 substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21100; CEQA Guidelines,

20 §§ 15126.6, 15370.)

21 42. Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162
22 provide that a supplemental or subsequent EIR must be prepared where: (i) the revised project
23 will create new significant impacts on the environment that were not previously identified; (ii)
24 the revised project will create a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified
25 significant impact; or (iii) there is new information of substantial importance that was not
26 previously available, which shows a new significant impact, substantial increase in the severity
27 of previously identified significant impact, or mitigation measures that were not considered
28 would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment.

MESERVE 8

A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 43. A lead agency's findings that a supplemental or subsequent EIR is unnecessary

2 must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA Guidelines, §15164, subd. (e).)

3 44. The City's approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in
4 that the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and failed to support its decision

5 with substantial evidence.

6 45. Among other things, the City failed to adequately disclose, analyze, mitigate, and

7 avoid the new or significantly exacerbated environmental impacts that are the result of changes

8 made to the Project including but not limited to the new medical health clinic and other new

9 uses proposed for the Project. As just one example, the addition of a new medical health clinic
10 would result in new or significantly exacerbated impacts in the areas of hazards and hazardous

11 waste not implicated by office or residential uses. Further, the significance of these impacts

12 cannot be dismissed though the bare assumption that Kaiser will simply comply with applicable

13 laws since it has a history of violating laws designed to protect worker safety and the
14| environment. On or about 2012, Kaiser was fined approximately $74,000 for the unlawful

15 disposal of medical waste. On or about 2015, Kaiser was fined approximately $149,900 for
16 "willful" and "serious" violations involving the safe handling of hazardous materials.
17 46. The City failed to prepare and circulate a supplemental or subsequent EIR when

18 required under Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section 15162,

19 which among other things deprived Petitioner and other interested individuals of their

20 opportunity to participate in formal public review and comment in accordance with CEQA

21 Guidelines sections 15162, subdivision (d) and 15163, subdivision (c).

22 47. The City further violated CEQA by failing to prepare any analysis explaining why

23 a supplemental or subsequent EIR was not required for the Project. The City did not prepare a
24 CEQA Addendum or similar document setting forth a fact-based analysis supported by
25 substantial evidence. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15164.)

26 48. The City further violated CEQA by failing to adopt any findings that a
27 supplemental or subsequent EIR is unnecessary.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate CORPORATION

1 49. To the extent the City adopted any CEQA findings for the Project, those findings

2 are inadequate as a matter of law because they contain bare conclusions, and do not set forth the

3 basis for the City's conclusion. (Topanga Ass'n for a Scenic Community v. County of Los

4 Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 514.) Further, any such CEQA findings are not supported by

5 substantial evidence as CEQA requires. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15164, subd. (e).)

6 50. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by

7 approving the Project. Accordingly, the City's ordinance, both approving the sale of the

8 Property and finding that no further CEQA review was required, must be set aside.

9 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

11 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City to vacate and set aside the
12 ordinance approving the sale of the Project site, the City's NOD, and other approvals for the
13 Project.

14 2. For injunctive relief enjoining the City, its officers, employees, and agents, from
15 granting any authority, permits, or other entitlements for the Project.

16 3. For injunctive relief enjoining Real Party and any successors in interest from
17 undertaking any construction of the Project.

18 4. For reasonable attorneys' fees, including those pursuant to Government Code
19 section 800 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

20 5. For costs of suit.
