6 "City") CRA/LA, successor agency to the former Community Redevelopment Agency of

7 the City of Los Angeles, and its Governing Board and Oversight Board (sometimes

10 This petition and complaint challenges decisions and actions in connection

OdV WHI MVT NIELSHEATS Floor pe 'anuary obuaren quon 11 with the approval of a glass and steel high-density, 27-story mixed use development in the

91101-1504 12 Historic Downtown area of the City of Los Angeles (the "Alexan" or "Project"). Petitioner

13 a seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside all Project approvals on the bases

8
Pasadena, 14 that: (1) the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and other

15 laws by unlawfully acting as lead agency, thus acting without fundamental jurisdiction to

# 2
16 approve an addendum to an MND for the Project where jurisdiction to do so resided solely

17 in the CRA/LA; but (2) even if the City possessed the fundamental jurisdiction and

18 authority to perform CEQA review of the Project, the City's purported CEQA review and
findings are legally inadequate and the City violated CEQA.

19 2. Petitioner as well as members of the general public will suffer irreparable
20 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted, if the City is not required to vacate and

21

22 set aside its Project approvals, and if the Project is commenced based upon the City's
violations of CEQA and other laws.

23 3.

24 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to it in the
ordinary course of law to redress the claims alleged in this petition.

25 4.

26 The City approved the Project application and requested approvals in a

27 manner and under circumstances that violates CEQA by proceeding under an addendum

28 ("Addendum") to a mitigated negative declaration ("MND") for a 2007 approval of a
different project.

- 5.

2 In addition to approving a project that presents significant impacts to the

3 environment without proper environmental review, the City at all times relevant to the

4 present action failed to proceed in the manner required by law by refusing to refer the
matter to the CRA/LA, as the legally-designated lead agency.

5 6.

6 Because of the unlawful conduct with respect to the Alexan Project,

7 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's reliance on the Project

8 Addendum to the 2007 MND, and invalidating and setting aside the Project approvals.

24 requirements properly executed and the public duties of the City and the CRA/LA

25 enforced. Petitioner will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from the City's and

26 CRA/LA's actions, approvals and/or inactions as described herein, and is aggrieved by the

3 PROJECT IN CONTEXT OF FBI INVESTIGATION

4 18. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that there is a
5 pay-to-play culture at Los Angeles City Hall in which developers give money to elected

6 officials and their favorite organizations in an attempt to influence decisions about
7 development projects. Petitioner is also informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,

8 that actual corruption and widespread ethics violations are associated with some

9 developers.

10 19. The Alexan Project is located in Council District 14, which is currently, and
OdV 'WHL MVT THE SILVERSTEIN 11 at all times relevant to this matter has been, represented by Councilmember Jose Huizar.
% 215 North Marengo Avenue, Floor POSI-LOLL6 12 20. At all relevant times to this matter, including during the consideration,

13 8 processing and approvals of the Project by the City Council's Planning and Land Use
euapesed 14 Management ("PLUM") Committee and by the City Council, Huizar was the Chair of the
15 PLUM Committee, which heard and approved the Project, and Huizar was and remains a
16 member of the Los Angeles City Council, which heard and approved the Project.

17 21. It has been reported that an FBI investigation of possible corruption has

18 centered on Huizar and Downtown Los Angeles developments and that, in November

19 2018, the FBI executed a search warrant for fundraising and other records of
20 Councilmember Huizar. Among other things, the FBI is reportedly seeking information

21 about developer contributions to Huizar's reelection campaign, his officeholder committee,

22 related political committees, and his alma mater, Bishop Mora Salesian High School. See,

23 e.g., "Corruption Probe Focuses on Downtown Development," Los Angeles Times,

4 24. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that some or
all of Real Parties, or companies associated with them, may have received federal
6 subpoenas instructing them to turn over communications with Huizar and with many 5

7 current and former Huizar staffers, including related to the Project and related to Huizar's,
8 the PLUM Committee's, and the City Council's approvals thereof.
9 25. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that while the

15 Company.

16 27. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that at some
17 or all times relevant to the "contributions" made to Huizar's alma mater Bishop Mora
Salesian High School, Bishop Mora Salesian High School employed Huizar's.wife in a
19 fundraising capacity. (See "With FBI probe looming, L.A. City Council members revive 18

20 plan to limit developer donations," Los Angeles Times, January 15, 2019.) As a result,
21 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Huizar received a direct
22 financial benefit from such contributions, including but not limited to through his wife and
23 any compensation she received as part of such "fundraising" activities.
24 28. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that while the
Project was under consideration by Huizar and the City, numerous private meetings and
26 communications took place between Huizar and/or his staff, and some or all of Real Parties 25

27 or their agents, and that during such private meetings and communications, Huizar and/or

all of Real Parties, including to Huizar's reelection bid, his officeholder committee, any

29. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the FBI
investigation into Huizar and undue developer influence at Los Angeles City Hall and

5 Council District 14, in particular, is ongoing. Should the results of the FBI investigation

6 and/or discovery of information in this matter occur that may bear on violations of the law
7 by Huizar, his staff and/or the City in the approvals of the Project, including related to,

8 inter alia, violation of conflict of interest laws, including Govt. Code § 1090, et seq.,
9 and/or violation of the Political Reform Act, Govt. Code § 81000, et seq., Petitioner will

91101-1504 12 30. Jurisdiction over Respondents and Real Parties, and each of them, exists

STATUTORY SCHEME
18

19 California Environmental Quality Act

20 32. The California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code
21 Section 21000, et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality
22 environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide

23 concern." (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).)

24 33. The central purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies and the public are
25 adequately informed of the environmental effects of proposed agency action.
26 34. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve
27 these goals, principally the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures
28 provide both for the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse
- 8 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F effects on the environment of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to
2 approve, and require a description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and
3 feasible mitigation measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code
4 21002.)

5 35. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
6 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies
7 not approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation

8 measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)
9 36. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to
10 carry out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts
DoV 11 is developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that
3 North Marengo Avenue, WaH MY NIELSHEATIS 3HL POSI-L0LL6 12 requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance
13 would have produced a different result. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.) §
Pasadena 14 37. CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to
15 adopt guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Res. Code co % 16 21083.) These guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section
17 15000, et seq. (hereinafter "Guidelines").

18 38. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse

19 effect on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before
20 complying with CEQA. (Guidelines § 15004(b)(2).)

21 39. The "lead agency," which is the public agency that has the principal
22 responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for conducting an initial study to
23 determine, in consultation with other relevant agencies, whether an environmental impact
24 report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a

25 project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).)

26 40. CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for

27 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
28 indirect physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378(a).)

- 9-

-

2 41. An EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the
whole record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the
3 Il environment. ..." (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a
4

5 lead agency is presented with a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect a

on

6 the environment ... even though it may also be presented with other substantial

7 evidence that the project will not have a significant effect." (Guidelines § 15064(f)(1).)

8 42. Under specific and limited circumstances, the public agency evaluating a

9 proposed project may find that an EIR is not required. In such cases, the agency may

10 adopt a negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration ("MND"). A negative

OdV 'WAL MVT SILVERSTEIN JHL o J00L „,€ 'anuany oßUaJEN YuON SIZ 11 declaration may be prepared and adopted for a proposed project that "will not have a

91101-1504 significant effect on the environment and does not require the preparation of an
12 environmental impact report." (Pub. Res. Code § 21064.) An MND may be prepared or

8
Pasadena, 13 adopted when "revisions in the project plans ... would avoid the effects or mitigate the
14

15 effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment would occur" and

16 "there is not substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency that

17 the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code

18 § 21064.5.) If either of these conditions does not apply to the project in question, the
agency must prepare an EIR.

19 43. Because informing the public about the environmental impacts of a
20 proposed project is a critical function of CEQA, any proposed mitigation measures in an

21

22 MND must be made available for public review and comment prior to adoption of the
declaration. (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(c).)

23

24 44. An agency must prepare a Subsequent EIR or Supplemental EIR for a

25 project if the agency has some kind of continuing discretionary authority over the project

26 (Guidelines § 15162(c)), and the agency determines, based upon the basis of substantial
evidence in light of the whole record, that substantial changes proposed in the project
27 require major revisions to a previous EIR because of the involvement of new significant
28 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified

1 effects; substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

2 project is undertaken that will require major revision of a previous EIR because of the

3 involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the

4 severity of previously identified effects; or new information of substantial importance that

5 was not known or could not have been known without exercise of reasonable diligence at

6 the time of the previous EIR was certified shows any of the following: (1) The project will

7 have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR, (2) Significant

8 effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous

9 EIR, (3) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not feasible would, in fact,
10 be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project,
OdV 11 but the project proponents decline to adopt them, (4) Mitigation measures or alternatives
tOSL-L0LL6 VO 'euapesed 8 J00H % 'anuary oBuarep WNAA AOY MEINEAS SHL 4ION 12 that are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous document would
13 substantially reduce one or more significant effects, but the project proponents decline to

14 adopt them. (Guidelines § 15162(a).)
15 45. An addendum to a previously certified EIR or adopted MND may be used if
16 none of the conditions described in Section 15162 of the Guidelines have occurred, and if

17 only minor technical changes or additions are necessary. (Guidelines § 15164(b).)

18 46. A lead agency violates CEQA including if it abused its discretion either by
19 failing to proceed in the manner required by law or by making findings unsupported by
20 substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.)

21 47. The use of an addendum when a Subsequent, Supplemental, or new EIR or

22 MND is required is a failure to proceed in accordance with law, and a deprivation of the

23 public and decision makers of the benefit of further public comment on the new or revised

24 Project.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 25

26 48. In 2015, Real Party Maple applied to the City to construct a dense, steel and

27 glass residential and retail building on a lot located within the City's Historic Core, at 850
28 S. Hill Street, called the Alexan Project.

1 49. The Project location is surrounded on all sides by historically significant

2 buildings: the Eastern Colombia Building, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No.

3 294, noted as a visual landmark representative of the vitality of the city's architectural

4 history; the May Company Garage, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 1001;

5 the Coast Federal Savings Building, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 346;
6 | Hamburger's Department Store, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 459; and
7 Blackstone's Department Store, Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument No. 765.

8 50. The Project as approved would be located immediately adjacent to and

9 abutting the west side of the officially-registered Historic-Cultural Monument Eastern

10 Columbia Building. The Eastern Columbia Building is one of Los Angeles' most beautiful
% JO0kl pt 'anuany oBUaJeIN qION SIZ FIRM, 11 and historically significant structures. Situated within both the Los Angeles Historic Core
POS-LOLL6 1 12 and a National Historic District, it was designated by the Department of City Planning as
13 Historic-Cultural Monument No. 294 in 1985. The building with its historic four-sided
IELSHBATS 3HI S
Pasadena, 14 clock tower is one of the City's most treasured visual landmarks. It is listed in the National

15 Register of Historic Places as well as the California Register of Historic Places. Both the

16 structure and its distinctive clock tower are recognized a worldwide as a premier example of

17 Art Deco architecture. In the early 2000s, more than $80 million was spent in restoration

18 and renovation of the Eastern Columbia Building, attracting residents both enamored with

19 the building's illustrious history, and willing to spearhead a revitalization of the City's
20 Historic Core.

21 51. The proposed Project site at 850 S. Hill Street is regulated under the

22 ordinance as Sub-Area 2030, and subject to a "D Limitation." That means that

23 development of the property may not exceed a Floor to Area ratio "FAR" of 6:1.

24 52. In 2007, a previous owner of 850 S. Hill Street sought entitlements to build

25 a 21-story mixed-use development containing 158 residential condominiums, which was

26 approved by the Department of City Planning. That proposed development did not exceed
27 the 6:1 FAR, and therefore did not require an entitlement permitting development in excess

4 Declaration ("MND"). The City found that the Abandoned Project at 21 stories presented
5 significant environmental impacts related to, among other things, the adjacent historic
6 resources and aesthetics. The MND disclosed that the Abandoned Project was slightly
7 taller than adjacent resources and thus posed significant impacts. However, the MND

8 disclosed and the City found, that as conditioned and designed, the slight height

9 differential was mitigated to a less-than-significant level.

10 54. The Abandoned Project was conditioned on a height limitation of 21 stories,
OdV 'WHLH MVI NIELSHENTS 3HL Floor 'enuany oBuarey quoN 11 and specifically required a lower portion "chair" design to better respect the significance of
% 09L-401L6 12 the adjacent Eastern Columbia Building and other historic buildings.
55. 8 13 The Abandoned Project's design was intended to protect views to and from
Pasadena, 14 the landmark Clock Tower for the majority of the western facing side.
15 56. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that it was
16 determined by the City in 2007 that the Abandoned Project would cause significant
17 environmental impacts, including, but not limited to, impacts on neighboring historic
18 resources, but that conditions of approval and mitigation measures would sufficiently
19 reduce those impacts to less than significant.

20 57. In 2015, Real Parties Maple and Erdossy submitted an application to build
21 the Alexan Project, a different development with a completely new design that would seek
22 a total square footage for 850 S. Hill Street that would be 24% over the total square footage
23 allowed under the City Center Redevelopment Plan and the D Limitation on the property.
24 They applied for a Director's Determination for a Floor Area Deviation of 49,999 square
25 feet, purportedly under LAMC § 14.5.7. The new proposed structure would be 27 stories

26 (six stories taller than the Abandoned Project), and up to 320 feet tall.

H 58. The new Project would tower over the neighborhood including the Eastern
2 Columbia Building, which at 264 feet tall is the tallest building in this portion of the

3 Historic Core.

4 59. The tower portion of the Project, if built, would be positioned directly in
5 front of the Eastern Columbia Building on its west side.

6 60. The siting and massing of the Project's tower would create a monolithic,
7 slab-like structure that would almost completely block the west side of the iconic Eastern
8 Columbia's four-sided clock tower from public view.
9 61. The City Planning Department has acted as lead agency for purposes of
10 purported CEQA review of the Project, issuing an "addendum" to the 2007 MND for the
JO0k pif 'anuany oßuarey qON % OdV 'WAl MV SILVERSTEID 3HL 11 Abandoned Project and determining that no subsequent CEQA review was required.
POSI-LOLLE 12 62. Petitioner and others objected to the use of an addendum to the 2007 MND
other 8 13 and argued that an EIR (or at the very least a new MND) was required due to, among
Pasadena, 14 things, new and more severe significant impacts posed by the new Project that were not
15 disclosed in the 2007 MND.

16 63. Following Petitioner and others filing various objection letters and making
17 appearances before the CAPC and the Los Angeles City Council's PLUM Committee

18 chaired by Councilman Huizar, the PLUM Committee recommended a finding that the
19 Project was properly assessed in the Addendum and recommended to the full City Council
20 that the appeals should be dismissed and the Project should be approved.

21 64. On or about June 28, 2017, the matter came to the City Council as a whole.
22 Over Petitioner and others' objections, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's
23 recommendations.

24 65. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing
25 this action, including complying with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5 by
26 sending notice to the City that this action would be filed.

27 66. Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney
28 General as required by law.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA; Invalid Lead Agency)
3 67. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
4 - Paragraphs 1 through 66, inclusive, of this petition.

5 68. AB1x26 and follow up legislation abolished community redevelopment
6 agencies, and became effective in 2012. This legislation required successor agencies, such
7 as the CRA/LA, to wind down the activities of the former redevelopment agencies to
8 which they are the legal successors.
9 69. Although some financial obligations of the CRA/LA are terminated and

10 others continue to wind down, the various CRA redevelopment plans remain in effect, and
OdY WHl: JOoH, 11 at all times relevant to the present action, the CRA/LA retained all land use approval and % North Marengo Avenue, 1101-1504 12 administration powers over the redevelopment plans.
13 70. At all times relevant to the present action, the CRA/LA retained power and HELLSHBATS 3HI 8
'euapesec 14 authority for development approvals in the City Center Redevelopment Project Area
15 % where the Project is located.

16 71. At all times relevant to the present action and Project approvals granted by
17 the City, the land use authorities in the Redevelopment Plans pertinent to the instant
18 Project had not been transferred to the Department of City Planning. Further, under the
19 applicable Redevelopment Plans, the CRA/LA had, and continues to have, oversight and
20 review/approval authority for the Project and its entitlement applications.
21 72. The "lead agency," under CEQA is the public agency that is responsible for
22 conducting an initial study to determine whether an environmental impact report, a
23 negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration, among other documents, will be
24 prepared for a project. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067; 21080.1(a); 21083(a).) The lead agency
25 must also provide for public review and comment on a project and its associated
26 environmental documentation. The lead agency makes the first critical, and threshold,
27 environmental project review approvals. Subsequently, and based on the work first
28 performed by the lead agency, other responsible agencies might make secondary

1 approvals.

2 73. At all times relevant to the decisions and approvals at issue in this matter,
3 § LAMC § 16.05G2, inter alia, mandated that CEQA environmental review of a project's

4 Site Plan Review proposed within adopted redevelopment project areas be conducted by

5 the CRA (and now the CRA/LA as successor agency), not the City of Los Angeles.
6 LAMC § 16.05G2 provided:

7 "Environmental Review. As part of the application for site 8
plan review, the applicant shall file necessary forms and 9 information for environmental review as prescribed by the 10 Director. The Director, or his/her designee, shall cause to be JOOL 11 prepared, concurrently with the review and approval of the % +OSI-101L6 VO 'euapesed 8 3 Ody 'WHL MVT NELLSHEATIS THE North Marengo Avenue, 12

subject to the provisions of this section and shall prepare 17
the required environmental studies and notices." 18
(Emphasis added.) 19

20 74. The Project is located in the adopted and still-valid City Center
21 Redevelopment Plan Area.

22 75. Although legislation to transfer the CRA/LA environmental review and land

23 use authority responsibilities to the Department of City Planning has been considered by
24 the Los Angeles City Council for several years, the City has repeatedly declined to enact
25 any such legislation in a comprehensive and/or legal manner. It was only after Petitioner
26 sued the City for violation of LAMC Section 16.05G (in LASC Case No. BS167470) that
27 the City rapidly pushed through an invalid ordinance purporting to amend LAMC Section

28 16.05G. However, at the time of Project approvals, the lead agency for purposes of CEQA
• 16 -

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F review of the Project was designated by statute to be the CRA/LA.

2 76. At all times relevant to the Project approvals, the lead agency responsible
3 for preparing the CEQA environmental review for the Project, and determining in the first
4 instance whether an EIR must be prepared, was the CRA/LA. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21067;
5 21080.1(a); 21082; 21083(a); LAMC § 16.05G.)

6 77. The CRA/LA had a clear, present and ministerial duty to perform
7 environmental review of the Project as the lead agency, and to "prepare the required

8 environmental studies and notices." Despite this clear, present and ministerial duty, the
9 CRA/LA failed to carry out its responsibilities of administering adopted and active
10 redevelopment plans such as the instant City Center Redevelopment Plan, and the City has
OdV Floor 11 illegally usurped this role. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,
'enuany oBuaJeN quon 91101-150 LON ÉIRA WENSNE 0N SHL 12 that the CRA/LA illegally stood by as the City Planning Department, which lacked

8 13 fundamental jurisdiction to do so, unlawfully undertook lead agency duties for the Alexan
Pasadena, 14 Project, to Petitioner's and the public's prejudice.
15 78. In violation of CEQA, the LAMC, and the still-operative City Center
16 Redevelopment Plan, prior to the City's approval of the Project, the CRA/LA failed to
17 "assume lead agency responsibilities for environmental review" of the Project or "prepare
18 the required environmental studies and notices."

19 79. Because the CRA/LA never assumed lead agency responsibilities for the
20 Project nor made the determination whether the Project required an EIR, the City's actions
21 purportedly acting as lead agency and in approving the Project were ultra vires and

22 otherwise a violation of law, including CEQA.

23 80. Based on the facts as alleged herein, Petitioner is entitled to a writ of
24 mandamus compelling the City to set aside and invalidate the Project approvals, and a
25 declaration that the City and CRA/LA failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violations of CEQA; Addendum Does Not Comply with CEQA)
3 81. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
4 Paragraphs 1 through 80, inclusive, of this petition.

5 82. Without conceding that the City had fundamental jurisdiction over, or was
6 in any manner the proper lead agency related to, the Project approvals at issue herein, to
7 the extent the Court determines otherwise, the City also violated CEQA by failing to
8 follow the procedures therein relating to environmental documentation and approvals.
9 83. An agency's determination whether a project under consideration is a
10 modification to an earlier project, requiring a subsequent EIR or MND, or an entirely new
OdV 'WAIH MYT NELLSBATIS 3HL JO0H, 11 project, requiring an EIR or MND in the first instance, must be supported by substantial
% North Marengo Avenue, POSI-LOLL 12 evidence.

84. The City's determination that the Project approvals may rely on the 8 13
Pasadena, 14 Abandoned Project's 2007 MND as if the Alexan is the same project, but only modified,

42 15 which could subject the Alexan Project to the subsequent review provisions of CEQA, is
16 not supported by substantial evidence given the whole of the record. The City's
17 determination is an abuse of discretion, including but not limited to because use of an
18 addendum to previous environmental documents was, at all times relevant to the Project

19 approvals, not allowed for site plan reviews.

20 85. Petitioner and others submitted evidence to the City warranting
21 environmental review of the Project as a wholly new Project requiring a new Initial Study

22 and EIR. (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).)

23 86. The Alexan Project proposes substantial changes to the Abandoned Project,
24 which pose new and more severe significant unmitigated impacts that were not addressed
25 in the 2007 MND, cannot be addressed in an addendum, and must be addressed in an EIR.

26 87. Even if the Court upholds the City's determination that the Project was a
27 modification of the Abandoned Project, an EIR was required, including under CEQA

28 Guidelines Section 15162, which "requires an agency to prepare an EIR whenever there is

4 of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College District (2016) 1 Cal.5th

5 937, 959.

6 88. The administrative record contains substantial evidence to support a fair

7 argument that the Project, including its changes as compared with the Abandoned Project,

8 may have significant, unmitigable impacts including, but not limited to, impacts related to

9 historic resources, including public views of those resources, aesthetics, shade/shadow,

89.
8 13 Petitioner and others submitted evidence to the City warranting the
Pasadena, 14 preparation and circulation of an EIR for the Project.

15 90. The City's action in approving an addendum to the outdated 2007 MND for
16 the Abandoned Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to

17 proceed in the manner required by law, and failed to support its decision with substantial

18 evidence. Among other things, the City:

19 a. Illegally failed to prepare and circulate an EIR for an out-of-scale and

20 out-of-character development which is inconsistent with land use

21 plans and applicable design criteria and which threatens to cause

22 significant environmental impacts in a historically sensitive area;

23 b. Abused its discretion in relying on an addendum to the 2007 MND,
24 and by doing so, illegally minimized impacts from the Project by
25 mischaracterizing the Project setting, used faulty baseline conditions,

26 omitted and ignored major changes in circumstances resulting in part

27 from a 9-year Downtown boom in development which cause

- significant impacts, and excluded relevant related projects from its
2 cumulative impact analysis;
3 C. Illegally relied on an addendum to an MND for a different project
4 when the changes to the original Project, including but not limited to
5 the addition of 49,999 square feet of floor space, 74 feet in height (6
6 stories) and reconfiguration of the building site a in a way that would
7 block views to and a from a historic landmark, triggered the obligation
8 to prepare an EIR;

9 d. Illegally failed to adequately disclose, analyze, mitigate or avoid the
10 Project's significant environmental impacts;

e. Illegally deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures to a later

Pasadena, 2 * Illegally failed to properly analyze cumulative impacts.

g. Illegally failed to properly analyze alternatives.
15 h. Illegally failed to properly analyze growth inducing impacts. L
16 91. The City's decision to approve the Project based on an addendum to its
17 2007 MND for the Abandoned Project is not entitled to deferential review.

18 92. The record in this case contains substantial evidence to support a fair
19 argument that the Project may cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the environment,

20 and therefore, that the City's use of an addendum to a 10-year-old MND as the CEQA

21 review document for the Project violated CEQA and was a failure to proceed in the manner

22 required by law.

23 93. As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in

24 that Petitioner, other members of the public, and the City's decision makers themselves

25 were not fully informed about the significant environmental impacts of the Project prior to
26 the City's approval of the Project and approval of the Project's addendum, and have been
