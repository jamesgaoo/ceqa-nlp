VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK COPY

INTRODUCTION

3 1. In this petition, petitioner challenges the failure of respondent City of San
Buenaventura to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," Pub.
Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.) when it certified its Final Environmental Impact Report
("FEIR") and rendered final approval as lead agency of the State Water Interconnection
Project ("project"). Petitioner seeks to set aside Ventura's certification of the Final EIR for
the State Water Interconnection Project on August 5, 2019, and final project approval
recorded in Ventura's Notice of Determination (NOD), which the City filed on August 6,

10 2019 and the State Clearinghouse filed on August 12, 2019.

11 2.
12 The certified Environmental Impact Report challenged in this action is designated as
the State Water Interconnection Project Final Environmental Impact Report. This action
13 challenges Ventura's compliance with state law in its EIR certification, and its final project 14 decision as CEQA lead agency recorded in its Notice of Determination. Through the EIR 15 certification and final project decision challenged in this petition, Ventura seeks to build
16 and operate a pipeline approximately seven miles in length originating in the easterly
17 portion of the City of Ventura (Henderson Road between South Saticoy Avenue and South

18 Wells Road), and traversing southerly and easterly through unincorporated Ventura County 19 to the southwestern end of the City of Camarillo (near the intersection of Camino Tierra
20 Santa and Via Zamora). Ventura estimated the project would cost approximately $50

21 million, but did not finally determine the specific costs to be borne by the City or how they

22 are to be paid, leaving that matter to "future agreements."

23 3.
24 Although ostensibly adopted to provide a reliable source of supplemental water, the

25 project provides no new local supply, storage or conservation, and instead, solely relies on
the proposed interconnection to access water, if available, from California's State Water
26 Project ("SWP"). The project is incapable of ensuring that any specific amount of could be
27 reliably or lawfully delivered, and the City has elsewhere, in analysis excluded from the
28 FEIR, recognized the proposed SWP pipeline's unreliability to meet water supply needs.

2
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

Nonetheless, Ventura evaded these problems, seeking to enable delivery of SWP water to
2 the City, direct delivery of SWP water to the United Water Conservation Districtl
("United"), and direct or in-lieu delivery of SWP water to Casitas Municipal Water District
("Casitas"). Deliveries through the project's pipeline would also require wheeling
agreements with the Calleguas Municipal Water District ("Calleguas") and the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("Metropolitan").

4. Ventura's project, if built and operated, would facilitate dangerous and costly
dependence on unreliable and oversubscribed water allocations from the SWP. Local
dependence on the SWP through Ventura's project would create a new problem to be
overcome, rather than meeting local needs relating to water supply, water quality, and the

12 environment. SWP water available through the project's facilities, if any, would originate

13 in northern California and require export from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ("Delta"),

14 which the California Legislature has identified "as both the hub of the California water
system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North 15 and South America." (Wat. Code, § 85002.) Recognizing that existing Delta policies were
16 "not sustainable," Wat. Code, § 85001, subd. (e), the Legislature nearly a decade ago
17 required improvement in regional self-reliance, and mandated a statewide policy to

18 "reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs through a

19 statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use

20 efficiency." (Wat. Code, § 85021.) It is "the policy of the state to recognize and protect

21 those resources of the Delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations."

22 (Pub. Resources Code, § 29701.) Nonetheless Ventura certified its FEIR and proceeded to

23 final approval of the project to facilitate local reliance on Delta exports through the SWP

24 for the City and two nearby water districts, despite having excluded analysis of local
alternatives to improve water reliability.
25

26l 5. As finally reviewed and approved by Ventura, the project seeks to move more than

27 water; it would move backward in time to a bygone era that failed to ensure accountability

28 against degradation of the Delta and other protected ecosystems. Local decision-makers

3
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

addressing water supply, such as Ventura in its project decision, must instead focus on
ensuring integrated assessment of local supply and conservation options, rather than
excluding local alternatives prior to approving and investing in new SWP water supply
infrastructure. The costs of the project, including Ventura's initially estimated $50 million
and additional, undisclosed long-term risks from local dependence on the SWP system,
would likely cripple Ventura's ability to explore and develop sustainable local and regional
solutions, hardening its dependence on vulnerable watersheds not reliably available to meet
local or regional needs.

6. Ventura's proposed SWP interconnection, even if built and operated, could not
10 reliably ensure water deliveries for the City and nearby water districts even as a backup

11 source. The project is likely to entrench and compound the SWP's chronic problems with
12 overreliance on illusory "paper water" allocation amounts, which exist chiefly as an
13 accounting tool in long-term SWP contracts and cannot be reliably delivered. Since the

14 historic capability of the SWP is only half or less of the SWP's aggregate allocation|

15 amounts, courts have long recognized the risks of local action based on assumptions about

16 paper water, including the facilitation of project decisions "dependent on water worth little

17 more than a wish and a prayer." (Planning and Conservation League v. Department of

18 Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 908, 915.)

19 7. In certifying the FEIR and approving the project, Ventura failed to heed major

20 criticisms from the petitioner, public agencies and other members of the public. Major

21 errors in the FEIR and approval include, but are not limited to, the following:

22 Ventura prejudicially disconnected its final review and decision on the State Water
23 Interconnection Project from its own separate review of local approaches to water
24 reliability. Ventura avoided requests for an integrated assessment of local alternatives
25 before proceeding to finality on the interconnection.

26

27 Ventura's findings, certified FEIR and other approval documents fail to disclose that
in March 2019, Ventura published a draft EIR for its separately reviewed Ventura Water
28 Supply Project, which confirmed that SWP water from the City's State Water

VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

Interconnection Project would be an unreliable source of supply.
Ventura violated CEQA's requirement that an EIR must examine a reasonable range
of alternatives that would feasibly obtain most of the project objectives. Ventura refused to
study any local alternatives to the SWP Interconnection before final project approval.

Ventura relied on FEIR that selectively and inconsistently defined project
objectives to artificially truncate analysis of alternatives, and failed to confront the project's
own infeasibility to meet one or more of its listed project objectives.

Ventura failed to accurately disclose and analyze the project's growth-inducing
10 impacts, including the consequences of building project infrastructure that removes
11 obstacles to growth. Ventura avoided that analysis even though the pipeline's capacity
12 would vastly exceed the city's own projections in operative planning documents of amounts

13 needed to replace current shortfalls or accommodate projected demand.

14 Ventura failed to disclose and analyze significant environmental impacts from the
15| project's hardened local reliance on water resources from the Delta, and construction and
16 operation of a pipeline expressly designed to facilitate that reliance. 17

18 Ventura failed to analyze the consequences of foreseeable efforts to temporarily

19 utilize exported Delta water in the pipeline for local use even where doing so would violate

20| other requirements, such as those protecting watersheds of origin and the Delta, other
beneficial and instream uses, water quality, and public trust resources.
21

22 Ventura failed to disclose and analyze project impacts stemming from pressure to

23 overuse other environmentally impacted water sources when dependence on SWP water
24 foreseeably fails to ensure reliable water deliveries. Compared with Ventura's road not

25 taken, an integrated assessment of local supply and conservation options prior to finally

26 approving this project costing $50 million or more, the project is highly likely to place the

27 City in a weakened position to access lawful and environmentally responsible backup
sources during emergencies, water-short years, and other times when they are needed the
28|

VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

most.

The FEIR and findings areas have other subject areas with sorely deficient analysis,
such as the sections addressing cumulative impacts, impacts on protected species. Ventura
avoided assessment of harm to disadvantaged communities stemming from the project's
combination of physical changes, unreliability and excessive costs. Ventura also failed to
analyze how the project's dependence on controversial, challenged and still-forthcoming
SWP contract amendments could compound the impacts and risks from the project.
8 Based upon unlawful exclusion of analysis necessary to inform decision-makers and

10 the public in the manner CEQA requires, Ventura undermined the ability of its FEIR to
serve CEQA's purposes of informed self-government and public accountability. 11 12 8. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure sections
13 1085, 1094.5, or both, directing Ventura to vacate its EIR certification and approval of the 14 project, and to revise its findings to comply with the law. 5225°9 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9. Petitioner California Water Impact Network ("CWIN") is a California non-profit
public benefit organization with its principal place of business in Santa Barbara, California.
CWIN's organization purpose is the protection and restoration of fish and wildlife

20 resources, scenery, water quality, recreational opportunities, agricultural uses, and other
natural environmental resources and uses of the rivers and streams of California, including
21 the Bay-Delta, its watershed and its underlying groundwater resources. CWIN has members
22| residing and utilizing water and environmental resources in the City of Ventura and the
23 County of Ventura, as well as elsewhere in California. CWIN's members use and enjoy the
24 Bay-Delta and inhabit and use its watershed. They use the rivers of the Central Valley and
25 the Bay-Delta for nature study, recreation, and aesthetic enjoyment.
26
27 10. Respondent City of San Buenaventura ("Ventura") is a municipal corporation

28 located within the County of Ventura in the State of California, as identified in section 100

6
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

of the Ventura Municipal Code. Ventura served as the CEQA lead agency for the project.
Ventura certified the FEIR on or about August 5, 2019. Ventura filed its Notice of
3 Determination recording its final approval of the project on August 6, 2019, which was also
filed in the State Clearinghouse on August 12, 2019. The FEIR prepared by Ventura as
CEQA lead agency must also serve as a legally adequate decision-making document for
any discretionary determinations of responsible and trustee agencies subject to the
requirements of CEQA.

11. Real Party in Interest United Water Conservation District (*United"), which has its
headquarters in Santa Paula, California and serves an area in central Ventura County, is a
10 water conservation district formed under the Water Conservation District Law of 1931.
11 (Wat. Code, §§ 74000, et seq.) United manages groundwater use in eight basins along the
12 Santa Clara River in Ventura County, and provides imported water and other water
13 services. In approving the project, Ventura sought, in part, to enable direct delivery of SWP 14 water to United.
15
16 12. Real Party in Interest Casitas Municipal Water District ("Casitas") is a municipal
17 water district formed under the California Municipal Water District Act of 1911, with its
18 headquarters in Oak View, California, an unincorporated community located in Ventura
19 County along the Ventura River between the towns of Casitas Springs and Mira Monte.

20 Casitas is a publicly owned water utility with a service area in western Ventura County. In

21 2017, Casitas also began operating and maintaining the City of Ojai's water system. In

22 approving the project, Ventura sought, in part, to enable direct or in-lieu delivery of SWP
water to Casitas.
23

24 13.
25 Real Party in Interest Calleguas Municipal Water District (*Calleguas") is a
municipal water district formed under the California Municipal Water District Act of 1911,
26
27 with its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California in Ventura County, which serves a
service area in southern Ventura County. Calleguas imports and distributes water from the
28 Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("MWD"), which arrives via the SWP

VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

from northern California. Deliveries through the pipeline proposed in Ventura's project
2 would require a wheeling agreement with Calleguas.

14. Real Party in Interest Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ("MWD")
is a state-chartered metropolitan water district, formed and subject to statutory authority
pursuant to the Metropolitan Water District Act (Stats. 1927, ch. 429, and amendmentsl
thereto), codified at Water Code App., Ch. 109. MWD membership consists of 14 southern
California cities and 12 southern California water agencies. MWD, whose headquarters is
in the City and County of Los Angeles, a has a service area including parts of Ventura, Los

10 Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Deliveries through
the pipeline proposed in Ventura's project would require a wheeling agreement with MWD.
11

12 15. Does 1 through 50, inclusive, may have an interest or claim to the project whosel
13 specific details are not presently known to the petitioner and plaintiffs. Their true names
14 and capacities, whether in individual, corporate, associate, governmental, or other
15 designations, are not presently known to plaintiffs and petitioner, and are thereforel
16 referenced here by fictitious names. Should their true names and capacities later be
17 ascertained, petitioner will seek to amend this petition and complaint to identify their true

18 names and capacities.

19
20 16. Ventura's NOD did not specifically identify any real parties in interest pursuant to

21 Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5. Nonetheless, to avoid any unnecessary dispute

22 over which, if any, entities identified in the NOD's project description may fall within that

23 statutory definition, petitioner in an abundance of caution has named each the entities
identified herein in this petition (United, Casitas, Calleguas, and MWD) as real parties in
24 interest.
25

26 17. This civil action is brought pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, and 1094.5; and
27 CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.
28

8
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

1 18. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 394 and 395, venue for this action
2 is appropriate in Ventura County Superior Court. The City of San Buenaventura is a
3 municipal corporation located within Ventura County, in which its principal offices are also
located. The affirmative acts the City recorded in its Notice of Determination resulted in

5 wrongs that were felt, at least in large part, in Ventura County.

19. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written comments |

8 during the project approval and EIR processes preceding Ventura's certification of the EIR
and approval of the project. All issues raised in this petition and complaint were raised by

10 petitioner, or by public entities, members of the public, or both, prior to Ventura's final
decision on the project recorded in the Notice of Determination.
11
12 20. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior
13 service of a written notice upon Ventura indicating its intent to file this petition.
14
15 21. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
16 Civil Procedure section 388 by serving a copy of this petition on the Attorney General.
17 Petitioner brings this action on behalf of its members and members of the public, to enforce
18 important rights affecting the public interest.
19

20 22. Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned

21 proceeding or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public

22 Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2).

23 PROCEDURAL HISTORY
24
25 23. On January 23, 2017, the Ventura City Council approved an agreement with
26 Kennedy/Jenks Consultants to prepare an alignment study and corresponding documents
27 for the State Water Interconnection Project.
28

VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

24. Ventura issued its Notice of Preparation (NOP) of its Environmental Impact Report
for the State Water Interconnection Project on February 28, 2018. Ventura held a public
scoping meeting on March 15, 2018 and received oral and written scoping comments in
response to the NOP.

25. Kennedy/Jenks consultants completed its State Water Interconnection Alignment
Study during June 2018.
0
9 26. On February 19, 2019, Ventura filed its Notice of Availability of its Draft EIR for
the State Water Interconnection Project. The Draft EIR failed to address significant
10 concerns about the project raised during scoping review, and raised additional concerns
11 about the project's environmental consequences and areas of additional work still needed to
12 ensure compliance with CEQA and other laws. Ventura presented its Draft EIR to the City
13 Water Commission on February 26, 2019.
14
15 27. On February 19, 2019, Ventura initiated a public review and comment period with a
16 closing date of April 5, 2019. During the public comment period, CWIN and other
17 commenters raised major additional concerns about the project and its environmental

18 review, which Ventura failed to address as required by CEQA when it certified the EIR and

19 rendered its final project approval.

20

21 28. On April 3, 2019, CWIN submitted detailed comments on Ventura's Draft EIR for

22 the project. Among other deficiencies, CWIN's letter analyzed the Draft EIR's faulty

23 analysis of direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of the State Water Interconnection
Project. Those problems were compounded by the Draft EIR's avoidance of much of the
24 SWP and Delta context surrounding the proposed project, including failure to confront|
25 chronic problems such as oversubscription of the SWP and the Central Valley Project, and
26 the resulting decimation of the Delta ecosystem.
27
28

10
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

1 29. CWIN's comment letter on the Draft EIR also provided detailed analysis criticizing
2 other deficiencies, such as the evasion of meaningful analysis of growth-inducing impacts
and the refusal to study project alternatives including local water supply and conservation
options. CWIN concluded that an integrated approach to local water supply and
conservation would "prove less expensive and more reliable than the financial burdens of
SWP management/maintenance and its inability to deliver water in times of drought."
Reinforcing its criticism of the project and its EIR analysis, CWIN assessed other
8 experiences with SWP-related overruns in infrastructure costs. CWIN also concurrently
submitted its own detailed study, The Santa Barbara Report, detailing analogous major

10 problems with excessive SWP costs and poor reliability in Santa Barbara County, which
followed after that county approved infrastructure physically connecting to SWP resources

12 and facilitating reliance on the SWP for local water supply.

13l 30. Ventura released its proposed FEIR on June 18, 2019, and held a public meeting in 14 which staff presented the Draft EIR to the City's Water Commission on June 25, 2019.1 15 Ventura's FEIR, with a published date of July 2, 2019, failed to correct major deficiencies
16 CWIN and other commenters identified in the Draft EIR, including those detailed earlier in
17 this petition.
18
19 31. In a letter to Ventura dated July 15, 2019, CWIN explained that due to serious

20 deficiencies in the FEIR and major unstudied risks, EIR approval of the SWP project must

21 be denied, or at minimum delayed. Critical deficiencies in the EIR included the following,

22 among others:

23 The FEIR failed to mention that in a related environmental review of a project the

24 City segmented from review of the SWP interconnection, Ventura had already conceded

25 the unreliability of the proposed SWP interconnection. In its March 2019 Draft EIR for
the Ventura Water Supply Project, Ventura recognized that, although "pursued in parallel"
26 with that local supply project, the SWP Interconnection "is not considered a reliable,
27 consistent water supply." Id. at 5-4 (emphasis added).
28

11
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

The FEIR tautologically defined project objectives to exclude alternatives not
2 requiring dependence on vulnerable water imports from the Delta.
The FEIR failed to disclose that the SWP interconnection project failed to meet one
or more of own project objectives, basing water reliability and quality on hardened reliance
on "paper water" from the SWP.
The FEIR did not disclose that risks and costs from the interconnection project
depended heavily on controversial "contract extension" amendments, whose broad
relationship to project objectives and impacts remained unstudied.
The FEIR deficiently analyzed other project impacts, such as growth-inducing
impacts and impacts on protected species.
10 The FEIR circumvented analysis of economic dislocation linked to the physical
11 changes required under the project, and compounded by the high likelihood of cost
12 overruns. These connected changes posed important and still-unanalyzed risks for
13 disadvantaged communities.
14
15 32. In its July 15, 2019 letter, CWIN noted the irony that, as other southern California
16 communities, including Santa Monica, have reduced SWP dependence and taken
17 substantial steps forward to improve local water supply resilience, Ventura's SWP

18 interconnection project would "place the city a on a retrograde and dangerous path toward

19 increasingly unsustainable import dependence. Nothing in the City's review of the project,

20 however, remotely suggests that they can afford to pay for both." Prior to the Ventura's

21 final decision to certify the EIR and approve the project, CWIN also submitted to the City

22 three articles authored by a CWIN member, respectively published in the Ojai Valley News

23 on February 1, 8 and 15, 2019. The articles were entitled (I) State Water Project is the

24 wrong solution for the Ojai Valley; (2) Ojai can learn from Santa Barbara's mistakes with
state water; and (3) Connecting to state water does not guarantee Ojai any new water.
25

26 33. On August 5, 2019, the Ventura City Council held a public hearing to consider
27 certification of the EIR and final approval of the project. A member of CWIN spoke at the
28

12
VERIFIED PETITION OF CALIFORNIA WATER IMPACT NETWORK

hearing, noting continuing deficiencies in the FEIR and recommending rejection of EIR
certification and the project.

34. Without addressing the criticisms provided in CWIN's July 15, 2019 letter or in the
three Ojai Valley News articles, and without addressing earlier deficiencies CWIN and
others had identified, Ventura certified the FEIR on August 5, 2019. The City recorded its
final approval of the project and all related approval documents in its Notice of
Determination, which Ventura filed on August 6, 2019. That notice was also marked as
filed in the State Clearinghouse on August 12, 2019.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:
11 VIOLATIONS OF CEQA
