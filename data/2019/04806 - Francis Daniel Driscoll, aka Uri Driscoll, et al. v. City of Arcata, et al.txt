STURGES, Trustee of the 1986 Alice A. Sturges Revocable Trust, u.a.d. August 18, 1986

8 (hereinafter referred to collectively as "Petitioners"), allege as follows:
I. INTRODUCTION.

10 2. Petitioners possess legal rights and interests in a historical spring-fed water
11 complex' (the "Spring Complex") which is located in the City of Arcata (the "City") in close
12 proximity to a trail the City is working to develop (the "Trail"). This Spring Complex has served
13 the neighboring residences and other water users for more than 120 years without risks of
14  contamination like the City is generating with its Trail.2
15 3. The City purchased the land containing this historical Spring Complex with funds
16 from the State of California "Clean Water" Propositions (Proposition 40, Proposition 50, and
17 Proposition 84). After buying the land with Clean Water funds, the City set about drafting
18 environmental documents in such a way as to shortcut any extensive environmental review
19 and/or permitting process, both of which are required by law. The City drafted its environmental
20 documents to include conflicting information as to the actual location of the Trail and erroneous
21 information as to the existence and/or actual location of the Spring Complex. Environmental
22

23 Petitioners' legal rights in the Spring Complex are not limited to one particular location;
24 rather the Spring Complex is a system or complex within a given area, having a width of about 200 feet (100-foot radius from the source). The arc of the radius of this complex penetrates into
25 the Humphry property past the metal gate, about eighteen feet (18'). See Page 1 of the Declaration of Petitioner RUSSELL JONES filed concurrently herewith and incorporated herein
26 by reference.

27 2 This Spring complex currently supplies water to six families. The Spring Complex was originally developed by the Poinsett family who had built the first house in the area (1578 Fickle
28 Hill Road) in the late 1800s. See Declaration of Petitioner FRANCIS DANIEL "URI"' DRISCOLL (*URI DRISCOLL"), filed concurrently herewith and incorporated herein by reference.

VERIFIED WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF; AND COMPLAINT FOR
PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE
Driscoll, V. et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

1 reviews and permits required by the City's own Municipal Code (the "Code" or "A.M.C."),
2 ordinances, regulations, and policies were simply ignored by the City in its quest to quickly build
3 the Trail using Fedcral Highway Administration Recreational Trails Program funds. Those funds,

4 too, appear to have been obtained via a misstatement by the City that the Trail came within the

5 exemption to Federal Executive Order 11990, which protects wetlands. A review of the City's

6 own environmental regulations leaves the impression that the City applies very strict standards
7 for the protection of the environment in proposed developments by members of the general
8 public, but where the City's own projects are concerned, any threatened potential or actual

9 environmental damage is somehow found exempt from such strict environmental regulation.
10 4. Petitioners seek to protect the Spring Complex and to require the City to complete
11 legally required environmental reviews and permit processes - including those mandated by the
12 City itself, as well as to require the City to comply with multiple laws specifically geared to
13 protect clean water sources: the Clean Water Act Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251, et seq.
14 ("CWA")), and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.3 Petitioners are seeking
15 injunctive and declaratory relief in order to prevent the City of Arcata and all other Defendants
16 from working on construction of the proposed Trail and/or alterations of the areas surrounding
17 the Spring Complex until such time as the City obeys with and enforces all laws and regulations
18 applicable to City operations with regard to the Trail. Specifically, Petitioners seek an order
19 preventing construction work that pertains in any way to the Trail that is referred to in the City of
20 Arcata's California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") Notice of Exemption' ("NOE"), at
21 one point, as the "Arcata Ridge Trail Fickle Hill South Segment."6 The request to restrain the
22 City's Trail activities, however, is not intended to prevent the City from pursuing remediation
23

24 3 California Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, Water Code, § 13000, et seq. (*Porter-Cologne Act")
25 4 CEQA is found at Public Resources Code 21000-21189, and the CEQA
26 Guidelines are found at California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3, Sections 15000-15387).

C

efforts geared toward preventing erosion and correcting the environmental degradation the City's
Trail activities have created. In addition, Petitioners seek to have the City abate the private
nuisance created by its activities associated with the Trail.
5. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents will
continue their unlawful practices regarding the environment surrounding the Trail and will
continue to threaten Petitioners' water supply unless directed and/or restrained by this Court.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 6. The Humboldt County Superior Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant
9 Code of Civil Procedure Section 410.10, in that all parties to this action exist, reside and/or do
10 business in the State of California, or otherwise have the requisite minimum contacts with the
11 State such as to justify this Court exercising jurisdiction over them and, in fact, have transacted
12 substantial business in California, including specifically within the County of Humboldt.
13 7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Humboldt County Superior Court
14 because the subject matter of this litigation arose in Humboldt County, California, and because
15 Petitioners and Respondents of this action reside, are located, and/or operate in Humboldt
16 County, California. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 392, 393, 394, 395, and 395.5.
17 PLAINTIFF AND PETITIONERS' BENEFICIAL INTEREST
18 8. Petitioners possess legal rights and interests in the Spring Complex, which is
19 located within the city limits of the City of Arcata in close proximity to the City's Trail
20 construction. Petitioners' rights and interests are directly and negatively affected by Respondents'
21 failure to comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations, policy, and permitting processes
22 applicable to the Trail and applicable to the disruption of the Spring Complex.
23 9. Petitioners have standing to bring this action as parties beneficially interested in
24 the issuance of the requested injunctive and declaratory relief because Respondents, by their Trail
25 activities without having fully complied with applicable laws and regulations, place in jeopardy
26 Petitioners' only water source, the Spring Complex, which lies within the 100-foot buffer zone

22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
2 sought in this Petition and Complaint. If the Court does not grant the relief prayed herein,
Petitioner will suffer irreparable injury without adequate remedy at law.

4 23. Prior to filing this action, Petitioners requested that Respondents comply with all
applicable laws. Petitioners are informed and believe that Respondents will continue their

6 unlawful practices unless directed and/or restrained and enjoined by this Court.
7 24. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that Respondents have
8 the legal duty to comply with the applicable law and regulations governing such acts in the
construction of the Trail.

10 25. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that at all times
11 material herein, Respondents have, and continue to have, the ability to comply with their legal
12 duties and obligations, including Respondents' ministerial duties.
13 26. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that Respondents have
14 failed and refused to perform those duties, and such failures and refusals are contrary to law and
15 regulations and have adverse consequences on Petitioners unless restrained as requested herein.
16 27. A writ of mandate may be issued by a court to compel the performance of a duty
17 imposed by law. Code Civ. Proc. §1085(a).

18 28. While mandate does not normally lie to control the exercise of discretion, it is
19 nevertheless "appropriate to compel an officer both to exercise discretion and exercise it under a
20 proper interpretation of applicable law." Anderson v. Phillips, 13 Cal. 3d 733, 737 (1975); See
21 also Ballard v. Anderson, 4 Cal. 3d 873, 884-885 (1971).
22 29. A refusal to exercise discretion is itself an abuse of discretion ( Richards, Watson
23 & Gershon v. King, 39 Cal. App. 4th 1176, 1180 (1985)), and a court may command the exercise
24 of discretion - to compel some action upon the subject involved. See also Shepherd v. Superior
25 Court, 17 Cal. 3d 107, 118 (1976); Sego v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., 57 Cal. App. 4th
26 250, 255 (1997), and Los Angeles Count Employees Assn., Local 660 v. County of Los Angeles,
27 33 Cal. App. 3d 1,8 (1973).
28 30. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that Respondents acted
arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and without any or an adequate

PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

1 evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA

2 Guidelines, and the Code, as well as the City's Ordinances, regulations, and policies, as well as,

3 applicable State and Federal law, including Respondents' ministerial duties mandated therewith.

4 31. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that in acting and
5 failing to act in the manner described above, Respondents have failed in their ministerial duties,

6 as well as, prejudicially abused their discretion by allowing construction of the Trail to occur

7 without compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

8 32. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that in acting and
9 failing to act in the manner described above, Respondents have prejudicially abused their
10 discretion by allowing work on the Trail to occur without an environmental review process,
11 required professional reports, and/or required permits as required by law.
12 33. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that City and Staff in
13 charge of producing a comprehensive plan for the Trail has failed to provide Petitioners any
14 relevant plan or verifiable assurances that protect a highly valuable and historic Spring water
15 complex and the associated wetland habitat.
16 34. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there is no
17 provision for any administrative remediation and/or remedies to be exhausted for such a refusal
18 to act to comply with applicable laws by Respondents.
19 35. Even if Petitioner was tasked with the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the
20 doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply when the administrative remedy
21 is unavailable or inadequate, as in this matter, where the City has refused on comply with
22 applicable law, including its own Codes, Ordinances, regulations and/or policies. Tiernan v.
23 Trustees of Cal. State Univ. & Colleges, 33 Cal. 3d 211, 217 (1982).
24 36. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, Respondents, in
25 regards to the Trail, have not conducted any adjudicatory hearings, and so this action is proper
26 under a traditional writ of mandate.

27 37. Petitioner will cause a conformed copy of this Verified Petition for Writ of
28 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Preliminary and Permanent Injunctive Relief
to be furnished to the Attorney General in accordance with Public Resources Code Section
9

7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

8 38. As described above, Petitioners have legal rights in the Spring Complex, which is
9 located in the City of Arcata." See Exhibits C, D, E, F and G; see also Declarations of Petitioner
10 RUSSELL JONES and URI DRISCOLL filed herewith and incorporated herein by its reference.

11 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the City purchased the Trail
12 property with grant fund moneys set aside by the State to ensure "Safe Drinking Water, Water
13 and Quality and Supply. ..."

14 39. Required protections to domestic water supplies under the City's own Code,
15 regulations, and policies are being ignored by the City as the City continues to conduct their Trail
16 activities and associated building (parking lot and driveway in the right of way of the County of
17 Humboldt) without following applicable laws. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

18 40. Petitioners have repeatedly brought to the City's attention" the multiple and
19 legitimate concerns Petitioners have regarding the protection of Petitioners' historic, abundant,
20 and high quality spring water domestic water supply. In addition, Petitioners have continuously
21 requested that they be more informed and involved in the planning process for the Trail,'3 and
22

23 11 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the real property upon
24 which the Spring Complex is situated and over which the Trail traverses has been annexed by the City within the City limits. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL
25 12 These efforts included, soon after the City of Arcata purchased the former Schmidbauer
26 property in 2013, written notification to then City Manager Randy Mendoza that Petitioners wanted their Spring Complex to be fully protected from any activity on this parcel. See 27 Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

28 13 This request to be included in the City's process for the Trail includes the fact that Petitioner URI DRISCOLL was in regular contact with Arcata's Environmental Services Director ANDRE through his involvement and support of local trails and his status as an Open Space and 10

VERIFIED WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF; AND COMPLAINT FOR PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

)

have insisted on the City scheduling neighborhood meetings that would be able to bring to light
2 not only their domestic water concerns, but also unresolved safety issues neighbors might have.
41. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that eventually the first
4 neighborhood meeting was scheduled by the City in January 2018, and that there have since
been three neighborhood meetings with Director ANDRE, all at Petitioners' insistence. See

6 Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL; see also Footnote 13, supra.
42. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Director ANDRE
8 was the only City representative at the first two neighborhood meetings, and at no time did
Director ANDRE provide any written "Project" or plan that would be representative of the Trail
10 Project.

11 43. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in addition, at
12 these meetings, Director ANDRE has expressed the City's desires that the Trail not become
13 involved in any extensive permitting process. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

14 44. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that, to this date, there
15 is no official City "Project" or plan for the Trail, and therefore no official approval given for
16 work on the Trail, for CEQA compliance, or otherwise.14
17 45. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in support of the
18 contention that there is no official "Project" or plan, when City personnel were found clearing
19 brush above the Spring Complex in December of 2018, these workers indicated that they were
20 investigating a route for the Trail and not following any project plan. See Declaration of
21

22
Agriculture Committee member (six years) of which Director Andre was the city liaison. 23 Petitioner URI DRISCOLL regularly checked in with Director Andre regarding the status of the
24 Ridge Trail Project and offered his assistance when it came to trail alignment and development particularly in the arca of Petitioner's Spring Complex.
25 14 Because of the effects the Trail will bring to bear on Petitioners' water source, on or
26 about March 27, 2018, Petitioners submitted a letter to KAREN DIEMER asking for clarifications regarding the planning, notification and enforcement process regarding the Trail on 27 the south side of Fickle Hill Road. It was not until October 2018 that Petitioners received a response from the City in letter form, not from City Manager DIEMER, but instead from 28 Environmental Service Director ANDRE. This response by the City was vague and incomplete. Request for clarifications related to the City's response have been repeatedly ignored by the City. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

1 Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

2 46. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that on February 13,
2019, City Manager DIEMER admitted via email to Petitioner URI DRISCOLL that the City had

4 no official "Project" or plan.'5
47. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that despite not having

6 an official plan, nor a consistent Project description, nor a correct location for the Spring

7 Complex, the City initially focused their Trail activities on the north side of Fickle Hill Road,

8 and eventually brought the Trail to the county road in close proximity to the Spring Complex.
48. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that the City signed
10 that portion of the Trail as an open trail, and the Trail has been in regular use since. See

11 Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

12 49. At no time have wetlands, including the Spring Complex, been marked on any
13 map provided to Petitioners by the City, specifically including documents associated with the
14 City's NOE, which are relied upon by the City to show that the Trail is exempt from a full review
15 under CEQA. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL. The City's NOE does not even
16 mention the existence of a domestic water supply (the Spring Complex) in close proximity to the
17 Trail. See Exhibit A, the City of Arcata's NOE.

18 50. When Petitioner URI DRISCOLL accidently found, in 2017, that Trail alignments
19 had been determined by the City and City work crews were scheduled to begin construction, he
20 became alarmed. This Trail alignment leads trail users directly to the Spring Complex, which
21 was troubling because the Spring Complex had once been previously vandalized by illegal trail
22 construction in 2013, and Petitioners had brought this to the City's attention, and the City had
23

2 51. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that because of

3 Petitioners' objections, Director ANDRE met Petitioner URI DRISCOLL at the site, and the

4 2017 alignment flagging and was removed; it was determined that another route was necessary,

5 and, as such, the City redirected its Trail crews. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

6 52. Despite the City's apparent recalcitrance and broken promises,"7 Petitioners have
continued to try to work out both appropriate Trail alignments and Spring Complex protections

8 with the City with little success. For instance, Petitioners had assurances after a meeting in late

9 December 2019 with the ACTING City manager. Then during a January 3, 2019, neighborhood
10 meeting with Director Andre, Mayor Watson and Supervisor Wilson, Petitioners also received

11 assurances that trail construction would not proceed until all of the Spring Complex water issues
12 and environmental concerns were addressed. Unfortunately, almost immediately after that
13 January 3, 2019, meeting, Director Andre used a CCC crew to construct 1200 additional feet of

15 16 Eventually the City did some logging, which shut down prior rogue trails near the
16 Spring Complex, but this Spring Complex 1S Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL. very vulnerable area for rouge trail building. See

17 17 At one point in a neighborhood meeting in April 2018, Director ANDRE did commit
18 the city to fencing the Spring Complex (including its source) prior to any Trail construction. Petitioners believed the fencing could possibly help alleviate some of their concerns and give the
19 City time to design an appropriate Trail alignment. That commitment by the City has since been

20 broken when Trail construction was started by the City with no fencing of the Spring Complex. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

21 City Manager DIEMER previously agreed to halt all Trail building activities until the City Manger responded to a request by Petitioner URI DRISCOLL for a voluntary injunction to

22 ensure that the Petitioners' water supply was protected and the local and state ordinances and statutes were complied with. However, activities associated with the Trail in the area of the
23 Spring Complex continued even after these assurances by the City Manager in her emails of January 18, 2019, January 22, 2019, and February 13, 2019. These emails state in part: "Until
24 you have further correspondence from me you have my assurance that no addition trail work will take place ... As we have discussed, you will continue to have my assurance that no trail work
25 will commence in this area until you have heard from me to address the areas of concern you have raised ..
26 and "Thanks again, I know you have been a huge trail supporter. I also heard clearly that you are frustrated and you have my continued commitment that there will be no further activity until the planning process is finalized.
27 See Exhibit H for true and correct copies of City Manager Diemer's emails, including true correct copies of emails from City

28 Manager Diemer dated January 18, 2019; January 22, 2019; and February 13, 2019. It was only after Petitioners engaged the services of an attorney that all construction on the Trail ceased, but the City continues to fail to address necessary remediation efforts in regards to erosion of the soils the City crews disturbed. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL. 13

2 53. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that City Manager
3 DIEMER has since only provided to Petitioners a vague suggestion that Petitioners' concerns

4 will be met during an unnamed planning process and that the City Manager will be referring
Petitioners' requests to the City Attorney, along with other unidentified comments. See
6 Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

7 Violation of City Code, Ordinances, Regulations, and Policies

8 54. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents acted
arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and without any or an adequate
10 evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of the Code," City
11 ordinances, policy and regulations (as well as applicable State and Federal law).
12 55. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at this point the
13 City and staff in charge of producing a comprehensive plan for the Trail has failed to provide
14 Petitioners any relevant plan or verifiable assurances that protect a highly valuable and historic
15 Spring Complex and the associated wetland habitat.
16 56. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the Code, City
17 Ordinances, policy, regulations contain a consistent intent by the City to maintain and/or create
18 the most pristine environment possible for its citizens, and that as such, an extensive body of
19 regulations exits - complete with many requirements and permitting processes.
20 57. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in this extensive
21 regulation in favor the environment, there is little-to-no articulation that the City is exempted
22 from these regulatory requirements.

23 Violation of Policy RC-6a (Management of Arcata Community Forest)

2 "[w]ater quality, soil, riparian, and aquatic biological productivity shall be maintained and

3 enhanced through the application of City forest management standards and the implementation of

4 watershed improvement projects." Policy RC-6a(3).
59. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City, however,

6 has admitted it is, and has been for some time, at a loss as to how to prohibit recreational use
7 from impacting watersheds in the area in which the Trail is located. As early as 1994, the City's
8 Forest Management Plan ("FMP")2 recognized the negative effects of recreational use of the
Forest.2' (This FMP was principally authored by Respondent MARK ANDRE, when he was the
10 Deputy Director of Arcata Environmental Services.)
11 60. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that even with this
12 acknowledgment, these historical and expected negative effects from recreational use articulated
13 in the FMP, nowhere in the City's environmental documents for the Trail does the City articulate
14 mediation of negative effects to the Spring Complex and surrounding environment from

17 includes the following poilcies: "1. Recreation and aesthetics resource management . Recreational use shall not be allowed to impact other resources such as fish, wildlife, or
18 watershed. .. Policy RC-6a(1).

19 20 By virtue of the Arcata Creeks Management Plan, and its direction that "[t]he management of creeks in the Community Forest and Jacoby Creek Forest are described in the 20 Forest Management Plan," one of the City documents applicable to management of the Trail in regards to adjacent water resources is the City's FMP.

24 heavily used areas surrounding the Nature Trail #1. significant trampling of hillside vegetation contributes to sedimentation problems in Campbell Creek. This occurs despite signs, re- 25 | vegetation and other efforts to eliminate shortcut trails. FMP at p. 3-3. "Use of non-designated access trails through adjacent private property is also of concern
26 expecially within the upper forest area. Signage and trail blocking has met limited success on these trails that have been developed by use and not design. FMP at p. 3-3. 27 "As recreational use has increased in the Redwood Park vicinity, so has the proliferation of shortcuts and illegal hiking trails. Compaction and obliteration of understory vegetation have 28 reached the point where sedimentation from sheet erosion is causing moderate increased from natural background levels. This is especially a problem in the Campbell Creek drainage east of Redwood Park." FMP at p. 3-23.

1 recreational use of the area, nor for negative effects caused by the construction and/or
2 maintenance of the Trail.

3 61. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that The City's actions

4 associated with the Trail to date in no way maintain or enhance the Spring Complex watershed,

5 and in fact they threaten and negatively affect this watershed, by, without remediation, the

6 removal of plant life and disturbance of soils known to possess a high erosion potential in close
7 proximity to the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault during one of the wettest winters in recent years.22
8 As such, the City's activities associated with the Trail are in violation of the City's Policy RC-6a.
9 Violation of Policy RC-3 (Wetlands Management)
10 62. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that if wetlands of any
11 size are found to exist in the Community Forest, an analysis of potential functional or habitat
12 value of the wetlands shall be provided (Policy RC-3a(4)), and in section 3, mandates that
13 "[w]ater quality, soil, riparian, and aquatic biological productive shall be maintained and
14 enhanced through the application of City forest management standard and the implementation of
15 watershed improvement projects.
16 63. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that instead of
17 complying with Policy RC-6, section 3, the City is in violation thereof by the construction of its
18 Trial adjacent to the Spring Complex, in soils with a high erosion rating on steep slopes, during
19 one of the wettest winters in years, with no remediation measure for erosion in place.
20 Violation of the FMP (Wetland Protection)
21 64. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at page 3-28 of the
22 FMP, the FMP defines springs as important detainers of storm water and filters of sediment that
23 are to be mapped as they are found. At page 3-27 of the FMP, the FMP mandates that wetlands
24 on Arcata's forests shall be protected.
25 65. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that despite this
26 mandate by the FMP, the City's NOE for the Trail does not address any steps taken or to be taken
27

28 22 See the Engineering Geologic Review of Timber Harvesting Plan for 1-06-164 (Mill THP), Morris and Handgaaf which Petitioners are informed and believe the City relied on in its NOE. This Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit H and incorporated herein by reference. 16

to remediate the concerns articulated in the FMP, and, in fact, the City actually worked on the
2 construction of the Trail without having mapped a precise location for the Spring Complex, in
soil known to possess a high erosion hazard rating, on slopes of 30%, and close to the Fickle Hill
Earthquake Fault, during the wettest winter in a very long while, and with no apparent

5 remediation plan for potential erosion of these highly erodible soils. In no way does this activity

6 by the City comply with the FMP's mandate for the protection of wetlands.
7 Violation of the FMP (Prohibition of Winter Operations)

8 66. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in the section of
the FMP regarding Watershed Resource Management (at p. 3-22), the FMP identifies soils in the
10 Arcata Community Forest area as being 90% Empire and Hely soils, which are both rated as
11 having a "high erosion hazard rating especially on slopes of more than 30%. These soil types are
12 derived from weathering sediments of the Falor Formation." The FMP continues on page 3-22
13 articulating a prohibition on winter operations.

14 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that despite these concerns
15 and recommendations of the FMP, the City's NOE for the Trail does not address any steps taken
16 or to be taken to remediate these concerns, and, in fact, the City actually worked on the
17 construction of the Trail in soil known to possess a high erosion hazard rating, on slopes of 30%,
18 and close to the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault, during the wettest winter a in a very long while, and
19 with no apparent remediation plan for potential erosion of these highly erodible soils.
20 Violation of FMP (Policy Requiring Control of Cumulative Effects)
21 67. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in the Watershed
22 Resource Management portion of the FMP, an objective is stated that "[t]he City intends to carry
23 out the watershed policy by preventing cumulative watershed effects."
24 68. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City defines
25 cumulative or adverse watershed effects as "the result of interactions between individual land

26 disturbing activities related closely enough by time and location to produce a significant and
27 often larger response, the impacts of which can be measured or observed both on-site, where non
28 cumulative individual activities occur, as well as off-site in downslope or downstream areas."

1 69. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that The City's
2 development of the parking area and the driveway area with no permit being obtained from the

3 County of Humboldt and no mediation of erosion and/or sedimentation risks, as well as the

4 disturbance of plants and soils in its work on the Trail with no remediation of erosion and/or

5 sedimentation risks, in such close proximity of the Spring Complex, combine to create

6 cumulative and adverse watershed effects to the Spring Complex.

7 70. Petitioners have filed with the County of Humboldt a Complaint of Possible Code
8 Violation. A true and correct copy of this filing and the County's response is attached hereto as
Exhibit I and incorporated herein by reference.

10 71. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon alleged that the risk to the
11 Spring Complex is especially poignant due to the "high erosion hazard rating" on the area's
12 slopes of more than 30%, and the close proximity to the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault.
13 Violation of Chapter 9.52 of the Code (Hillside Development)

14 72. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that via a mandatory
15 permitting process (A.M.C. §§ 9.52.070 and 9.52.030) and the generation of professional reports
16 | regarding assessment and mitigation measures (A.M.C § 9.52.070), the stated purposes of the
17 City's Hillside Development Code23 sections, among other things, are to:
18 A. Preserve the City's environmental and scenic resources by encouraging the
19 retention of natural topographic features and vegetation; B. Recognize that as the slope of a development site increases so does the
20 potential for environmental degradation including slope failure, and increased storm water runoff that will also increase the potential for erosion, and waterway sedimentation; ... and 21 C. Encourage appropriate road construction and grading practices in hillside areas.

2 "follow natural terrain contours to the maximum extent feasible to minimize grading and shall
3 adhere to the hillside development standards found in Policy PS-3c of the Arcata General Plan
4 2020.326

5 74. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that, in addition, a
6 Hillside Development Permit requires "a preliminary geotechnical report that identifies and
7 proposes mitigation measures for any soils or geological problems that may affect site stability or
8 structural integrity. A.M.C. § 9.52.070(C)(2) and (C)(3).

2 78. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City also did
3 not cause to be created a geotechnical report, nor a site constraint analysis for effects of the Trail
4 on the Spring Complex, an "identified, important, biological feature."

5 Violation of Chapter 9.59 of the Code (Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas, or "ESHA")

6 79. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the requirements
7 of the ESHA Protection Preservation Chapter of the Code applies to all ESHA and to adjoining
8 properties within 250 feet in which land use or development(s) on those properties are capable of
affecting ESHA resources, including the Spring Complex.37
10 80. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that no discretionary
11 permit for development within 250 feet that may potentially affect ESHA will be issued except in
12 compliance with all applicable requirements Chapter 9.59 of the Code," and, by the terms of this
13 Chapter of its Code, the City cannot argue that less constraining policy than the ESHA should

23 such as wildlife habitat, water quality, open space and scenic resources, flood control, and opportunities for scientific study and education, the requirements of Chapter 9.59 are intended
24 to: A. Protect the structure, composition, function, and natural processes of ESHA to the same extent as occurs in the least-disturbed natural ecosystems in the City's Planning Area;
25 B. Provide standards for development that will incorporate ESHA into the site design of proposed development without significant impacts to these resources. C. Ensure that any 26 proposed subdivision, land use or development adjacent (within 250 feet) to or capable of affecting ESHA will not degrade these resources or diminish their structure, composition, 27 function and natural processes. In addition, Section 9.59.020 of the Code applies these requirements to Environmental 28 Buffer Areas (EBA).

F the ESHA.32

2 84. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City has

3 complied with none of these requirements applicable to ESHAs and/or EBAs with regard to the

4 Trail, even though, by the City's own definitions, the Spring Complex is an ESHA which would
5 invoke an EBA. See Fn. 33.

6 85. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City failed to
7 obtain any permits for the Trail, has not applied the standards and/or requirements of the ESHA
8 (including without limitation no impairment of the environment) to the Trail project, and has not
9 conducted any adequate biological assessment which specifically includes the Spring Complex.
10 Violation of Conservation and Management Element Goals
11 86. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the Resource
12 Conservation and Management Element ("RCME") of the Arcata General Plan 2020 contains
13 overall goals and policies for forest management,33 and lists the following among its Arcata
14 Community Forest Management Goals, "[m]aintain[ing] the health of the forest system,
15 specifically, maintain[ing] the integrity of the water shed, wildlife, fisheries and plant resources,
16 their relationships, and the process through which they interact with the environment." RCME,
17 at p. 4-13.
18 87. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that in addition the
19 RCME sets out in general "an overarching policy that emphasizes the overall value of biological
20

21 32 1. The proposed land use or development will not degrade the structure, composition,
22 function or natural processes of ESHA to a level below that which occurs in the least-disturbed natural ecosystems in the City's Planning Area; 2. The proposed land use or development has
23 incorporated the ESHA into its site design and does not pose any significant adverse impacts to these resources. 3. The EBA adopted is sufficient in width to maintain the structure, composition,
24 function and natural processes of the affected ESHA. ...

25 33 The "Guiding Principles and Goals" of the RCME include to A) "Ip]rotect, maintain and enhance natural ecosystem processes and functions in the region, in order to maintain their 26 natural ecological diversity"; B) "[r]estore and maintain the physical and biological integrity of Arcata's streams"; C) "[p]rotect, restore, enhance, and maintain riparian habitat on those lands

2 healthy ecosystem," and specifically articulates in Policy RC-1a that "[m]aintaining ecological

3 balance, system function, biological integrity, and natural diversity is the primary focus of the

4 Resource Conservation and Management Element.»34
88. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that RCME at page 4-

6 16, mandates that "[a]n 'adaptive management' approach shall be utilized to maintain ecological

7 and biological integrity, including monitoring the status of ecological systems in the City and

8 adjusting City implementation of this Plan, in order to more closely approximate the conditions
9 provided in the Planning Area's least-disturbed natural ecosystems."

10 89. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's work on

12 90. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's Trail
13 activities, with no "adaptive management," directly threaten the ecological and biological
14 integrity and health of the area containing the Spring Complex - an area which was, before the
15 City's Trail work began, one of the least disturbed natural ecosystems in the City of Arcata.
16 91. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that environmental
17 derogation occurred when the City, without remediation, removed plant life and disturbed soils
18 known to possess a high erosion potential, on steep slopes in the wettest winter in years.
19 Violation of the City's Own Policy RC-2 (Streams Conservation and Management)

20 92. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the objective of
21 Policy RC-2 is to "[e]nhance, maintain, and restore the biological integrity of entire stream
22 courses (headwaters to mouth), and their associated riparian habitats, as natural features in the

26 the same native plant and animal species, in the same relative abundances and proportions, which are found in the least-disturbed natural ecosystems in the Planning Area. 2. The ecological 27 functions performed by ecological systems in the City shall resemble the functions of the least-disturbed natural ecosystems in the Planning Area. 3. Ecological systems and natural 28 processes are not disrupted by exotic organisms to a significant degree. 4. Ecological systems and natural processes are not to be disrupted by land use activities to a significant degree (e.g., a culvert or other drainage device that blocks fish passage).

1 City's landscape."35 See RCME at p. 4-19.

2 93. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that instead of

3 complying with the City's own Policy RC2, the City is, in fact, degrading the Spring Complex

4 and riparian habitat by, in the wettest winter in years, removing plant life and disturbing soils, on

5 steep slopes, known to possess a high erosion potential in close proximity to the Fickle Hill
6 Earthquake Fault.

7 Violation of Policy RC-3 Wetlands Management

8 94. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Policy RC-3's
(Wetlands Management)* objective is "[t]o protect existing wetlands [sic] areas and their
10 functional capacities and values, maintain a standard of 'no net loss' (in area and value) restore
11 degraded wetland areas, enhance wetlands functions, and create additional wetland areas to
12 replace historical losses."

13 95. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege that Policy RC-3a
14 requires that "[a]Il proposed development applications shall include a site plan that shows the
15 precise location of any wetlands that exist on the subject property. Any application for
16 development on a parcel where wetlands may be present shall include a wetland reconnaissance
17 or delineation report. ... RCME at p. 4-21.
18 96. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's Trail
19 has been pursued, in the wettest winter in years, without a correct siting of the Spring Complex,
20

21

22 35 Policy RC-2a designates streams that the provisions of this policy apply to, and includes Grotzman Creek which is adjacent to the Spring Complex and the Trail. See Exhibit L,
23 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference, for a true and correct copy of Figure RC-a to the Arcata General Plan: 2020 • City of Arcata Protected Watercourses (Map).
24 36 See RCME at p. 4-21.
25 37 Per Policy RC-3, this reconnaissance or wetlands delineation and report shall be based 26 upon field investigations and shall be prepared by a professional or technical expert qualified in wetlands biology or plant ecology. Where a reconnaissance indicates the probable existence of 27 wetlands, marsh reeds detailed wetland delineation shall be required, including a map with the best available contour information showing where each of the three factors are present and the 28 precise boundaries of any areas which are determined to be wetlands. If wetlands of any size are found to exist on the property, an analysis of the potential functional or habitat value of the wetlands shall be provided. Policy CR-3a(1-4). See also RCME at p. 4-22.

1 without any reconnaissance or delineation reports, and without any attention to detail important
2 for the prevention of the degradation of the Spring Complex,3 such as erosion stabilization. As
3 such the City's Trail activities are in direct violation of the City's Policy RC-3.
4 Violation of the Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Act

5 97. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the

6 Porter-Cologne Act is the principal law governing water quality regulation in California which
7 establishes a comprehensive program to protect water quality and the beneficial uses of water.
8 98. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that the
9 Porter-Cologne Act applies to surface waters, wetlands, and ground water, and to both point and
10 nonpoint sources of pollution. Porter-Cologne Act, California Water Code, section 13000, et
11 - 39 seq.

12 99. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that anyone
13 discharging or proposing to discharge materials that could affect water quality (other than to a
14 community sanitary sewer system regulated by a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
15 System ("NPDES") permit) must file a report of waste discharge. Water Code § 13260, et seq.
16 100. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the
17 | Porter-Cologne Act also implements many provisions of the Clean Water Act, such as the
18 NPDES permitting program (which includes the Spring Complex per the City's own
19 admission).* Water Code § 13966, et seq.
20

21 38 This detail includes the existence of soils rated as high erosion rating on steep slopes in
22 proximity to the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault, which were disturbed during one of the wettest winters in years.
23 39 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Regional Water Quality
24 Control Boards ("RWQCB(s)") regulate discharges under the Porter-Cologne Act primarily through issuance of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits for
25 point source discharges and waste discharge requirements (*WDR(s)") for NPS discharges. Water Code § 13200, et seq.
26 40 The NOE alleged to be for the Trail, which is the subject of this litigation states, 27 "The objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA, 1977, as amended) is to restore and maintain the
28 chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. In 1987, the U.S. Arm Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a manual standardizing the manner in which wetlands were to be delineated nationwide. To determine whether areas that appear to be wetlands are subject to Corps jurisdiction (i.e., are 'jurisdictional' wetlands), a wetland delineation must be performed

1 101. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the Clean Water
2 Act (CWA) establishes the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters

3 of the United States and regulating quality standards for surface waters. 33 U.S.C. § 1251, et seq.

4 102. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the CWA made it

5 unlawful to discharge any pollutant from a point source into navigable waters, unless a permit

6 was obtained. EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program
7 controls discharges. CWA § 301(a).

8 103. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents'
9 work on the Trail in the proximity of the Spring Complex is in violation of both the Porter-
10 Cologne Act and the Clean Water Act in that with removal, in close proximity of the Trail, of
11 vegetation and disturbance of known highly erodible soils on steep slopes without remediation
12 efforts in proximity, Respondents have created a runoff situation (of siltation and any polluting
13 substances users of the Trail deposit on and/or near the Trail) which discharges into waters that
14 eventually run to Humboldt Bay, a waters of the United States.
15 104. Petitioners further contend that Respondents are allowing City operations in the
16 construction of the Trail in violation of applicable law, including without limitation that
17 Respondents have allowed work on the Trail without adequate compliance with NPDES permits,
18 as required under the CWA and/or permitting required under th Porter-Cologne Act.
19 105. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the by failing to
20 comply with NPDES permitting requirements, the City has violated its own Ordinance 1319
21 (codified at sections 7999.01 et seq. of the Code41), which states as one of its objectives: "4. To
22 protect and enhance the water quality of the water resources, water bodies, and wetlands of the

Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

1 106. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in the Section
2 entitled Required Permits of the Natural Environmental Study allegedly applicable to the Trail,

3 which is appended to the NOE, the City attempts to exempt itself from review by the local

4 RWQCB by making a conclusory statement that: "The project does not involve dredging, filling,
or discharging to waters of the US or Waters of the State and is therefore not subject to a Section

6 404 or 401 Water Quality Certification."

7 107. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's

8 assertions of no discharge to waters of the US or waters of the State ignore the fact that the

9 findings of the City's FMP and the 2008 Botanical Survey Report (relied upon in the City's
10 NOE) conclude to the contrary.42

11 108. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the fact that water
12 from the Spring Complex watershed (by the City's own admission in its FMP and via the
13 Schmidbauer study for the property) makes its way to Humboldt Bay, application of the Clean
14 Water Act, 40 CFR 230.3(s), is invoked.
15 109. In addition, the City has officially acknowledged in its November 2005 Storm
16 Water Management Program of the City of Arcata ("SWMP"),43 at page 44 of the SWMP, that a
17 potential pollutant source of the Community Forest is from "recreational use," with the
18 responsible City "division" being Natural Resources Division of the Environmental Services" -
19 the very City Department/Respondent directly responsible for the City's Trail activities.
20 110. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it is also of note
21

22
42
23 In the section of the City's FMP entitled Watershed Resource Management, it is stated that: "Presently City forests comprise an important upper watershed area of fish bearing streams
24 that flow through urban areas and eventfully into Humboldt Bay." In the July 16, 2008, Botanical Survey Report done for the Schmidbauer NTMP, the property containing the Spring Complex, is
25 noted at page 1 that the "[w]atercourses in the project area are class II and III streams that ultimately drain to Humboldt Bay," which ultimately drain into Humboldt Bay. A true and
26 correct copy of the July 16, 2008, Botanical Survey Report done for the Schmidbauer NTMP is attached hereto as Exhibit M and incorporated herein by reference.
27

28 43 The goal of the SWMP, stated therein was articulated as being "to protect the health and the recreational public and the environment, meeting Clean Water Act mandates through compliance with Phase II NPDES Permit requirements and applicable regulations, and foster heightened public awareness.

that this table also lists "grading" as a potential pollutant source of sediment - precisely what
2 occurred in highly erodible soils, on steep slopes, in close proximity to the Spring Complex
3 without benefit of any remediation efforts by the City during one of the wettest winters in years.
4 111. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that City's Trail
activites in erodible soils on steep slopes, in wet winter times, combined with the City's failure to

6 attend to proper erosion controls on this work, violate the CWA and the Porter-Cologne Act's
7 run off and/or erosion sedimentation prohibition as the run off and/or erosion will directly affect
8 the Spring Complex (a wetland) and the quality of the spring water found thereon (Petitioners'
9 sole water supply) - waters that eventually run into waters of the United States (Humboldt Bay).
10 Violation of Responsibilities Under CEQA as the Lead Agency
11 112. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that for the Trail,
12 Respondents are, and at all times relevant herein have been, charged by law with the performance
13 of all duties of a "lead agency" arising under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines (Title 14, Cal.
14 Regs. § 15000, et seq., "CEQA Guidelines"), including, without limitation, the preparation,
15 circulation and certification of a legally adequate EIR for the Trail unless a legitimate exemption
16 to CEQA is articulated.

17 113. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that, in order for
18 Respondents to bring themselves into compliance with the law, a CEQA process would be
19 required because Respondents will be unable to find, and it is impossible to find, that there is no
20 possibility that the activity associated with the Trail may have a significant effect on the
21 environment. See CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 Cal. Regs. § 15061(b)(3).
22 114. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents'
23 failure to pursue an environmental process for the Trail that satisfies the requirement of CEQA
24 and CEQA Guidelines constitutes an abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to proceed in
25 a manner required by law, and their actions are not supported by substantial evidence in this
26 matter that shows compliance with legally required environmental review and compliance with
27 the Code and Ordinances.

28 115. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that CEQA and the
CEQA Guidelines require that the lead agency make certain written findings and that the findings
28

VERIFIED WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF; AND COMPLAINT FOR
PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE
Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

be supported by substantial evidence in the record. See Title 14 Cal. Regs. Section 15091 of the
2 CEQA Guidelines.

116. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents did
4 not proceed in the manner required by law in that they failed to adopt findings, let alone findings
supported by substantial evidence.

6 117. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents did
not proceed in the manner required by law in that they failed to adopt findings that adequately
8 addressed all significant impacts, failed to make adequate specific findings with regard to the
9 feasability of each mitigation measure and each alternative identified in the EIR, failed to adopt
10 all feasible mitigation measures and/or feasible and environmentally superior alternatives, and
11 failed to adequately identify considerations which would make infeasible or override those

12 mitigation measures and/or alternatives.

13 118. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that most importantly,
14 Respondents are bound to assure that compliance with CEQA is included in the planning process
15 as early as possible in order to allow incorporation of environmental considerations into the
16 design of the project. See CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 Cal. Regs. Section 15004.
17 119. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that had the City
18 complied with CEQA and conducted an environmental review, Petitioners' concerns about their
19 water supply and the effect of the degradation of the Spring Complex, could have, and would
20 have been addressed. Instead the City elected to pursue a "no plan/no project" course of action
21 for the Trail in hopes of avoiding any extensive review and/or permitting process, as admitted by
22 Respondent MARK ANDRE in one of the neighborhood meetings about the Trail (as described
23 in the Declaration of PETITIONER URI DRISCOLL).
24 Non-Compliance with CEQA (No Plans for the Trail)

25 120. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that CEQA and CEQA
26 Guidelines require that Respondents analyze a reasonable range of alternatives. See Cal. Public
27 Resources Code Section 21002. Respondents failed to prepare an adequate EIR by not analyzing
28 a reasonable range of alternatives, including feasible alternatives that are environmentally
superior and consistent with the City's General Plan.

v. Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

1 121. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that not only did the

2 City fail to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to the Trail, the City did not even develop

3 any official plans for the work performed by City crews on the Trail.
122. Petitioners are not specifically pursing this action based upon any violation of the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") resulting from an official "approval," as it is

6 unknown if Respondents' decision to allow work on the Trail with no formal plans and an
uncertain project description constitutes a final decision as contemplated in Code of Civil

8 Procedure section 1085 and an "approval" as defined in CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 Cal. Regs.
9 Section 15352.

10 Non-Compliance with CEQA (No Definite Description of the Trail Project)

11 123. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that CEQA and CEQA
12 Guidelines require that an environmental review include an accurate and stable description of the

13 project and a discussion of alternatives including, but not limited to, a "no project" alternative
14 and alternative methods of accomplishing some of the proposed project's objectives. See Section
15 15124 of the CEQA Guidelines.

16 124. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents have
17 not proceeded in the manner required by law in that they have no certain project description and
18 have elected to treat work on the Trail as some sort of "nonproject" without the benefit of

19 planning documents.

20 125. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Documents which
21 were produced by Respondents associated with CEQA lacked articulated plans, and created

22 confusion as to the actual project description and application of information in the NOE to the
23 actual Trail project.

24 126. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that specifically, the
25 Project Description contained in the Project Location Map44 of the NOE, describes the Project as
26 being located at: "USGS 7.5 Minute Quandrangle: Arcata South Section 34, T.6.N., R.1.E. of H.

B. & M." with 1100 lineal feet of trail. [Emphasis added.] See Exhibit A Project Location (City
2 of Arcata NOE).45

3 127. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the Project
4 Description included in the Categorical Exemption/Categorical Exclusion Determination Form of
5 the NOE posted by the City also describes the project and location, albeit it is at a different
6 project location than that contained in the Project Location map of the NOE: Section 34
7 Township 6N Range 1E of the USGS Arcata South, California 6.5 Minute Quadrangle with
8 1,600 linear feet of recreational trail approximately 1.5 miles east of the intersection of Fickle
9 Hill Rd and Park Ave.46 [Emphasis added.]

10 128. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that because of these
11 disparate descriptions, the City's NOE, upon which the Trail is premised, fails to identify
12 adequately the location of the City's Trail "project" that is intended to be addressed by this NOE,
13 and as such is deficient for CEQA compliance.
14

15 45 This Project Description of Nature, Purpose and Beneficiaries of the Project contained
16 on the cover page of the NOE states: "Installation of a trail road crossing; 1100 lineal feet of trail to provide public access to the southern portion of the Arcata Ridge Trail, a 4.2 mile non-
17 motorized trail that will connect northern Arcata with Sunny Brae neighborhood. It will also provides [sic] access to the Arcata Community Forest Sunnybrae [sic] Tract south of the county
18 road. The forest lands are managed as sustainable forest that includes protection for riparian and other sensitive areas and associated wildlife and are maintained in their natural state. Lands are
19 held as habitat protection, education, research and passive public use. The project benefits residents of Arcata and unincorporated Humboldt County areas as well as visiting tourists. The 20 Trail segment is located within the Arcata City Limits and the crossing is within the County of
21 Humboldt road right of way." [Emphasis added.]

22 46 The second disparate description reads: "California State Parks and the City of Arcata with Funding from Federal Highway Administration Recreational Trails Program, propose the
23 Arcata Ridge Trail Project Phase IlI-Fickle Hill Segment. It involves construction, operation, and maintenance of approximately 1,600 linear feet of recreational trail. The Trail will provide a
24 multi-use trail to include biking, horseback riding and mountain biking. This trail segment provides a critical link in a larger regional five-mile long Trail known as the Arcata Ridge Trail.
25 The Trail will link the Arcata Community Forest with a county-maintained road (Fickle Hill Rd) in order to facilitate a road crossing link to the Arcata Community forest north unit with the
26 south (Sunnybrae) unit. The project is located within the Arcata Community Forest located within Section 34 Township 6N Range 1E of the USGS Arcata South, California 6.5 Minute 27 Quadrangle. The terminus of the project, the Fickle Hill Trailhead, is located on Fickle Hill Rd, approximately 1.5 miles east of the intersection of Fickle Hill Rd and Park Ave. It can be 28 accessed from Fickle Hill Road, or from the north via the existing Trail. It is aprox. 2 miles from the nearest Highway 101 on-ramp. It is owned in fee title by the City of Arcata." [Emphasis added.]

The City's Cited CEQA Exemptions Are Inapposite
2 129. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in the Natural
3 Environment Study attached to the NOE, which is allegedly applicable to the Trail, in the

4 paragraph entitled Required Permits, a conclusory statement is made that: "It is categorically
exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Classes 3(b), 4(a) and

6 11(d) of the State CEQA Guidelines because it consists of construction of small new structures,
7 minor alterations in the condition of the land, and installation of on-premise signs.
8 130. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that none of the
9 exceptions to CEQA exemptions apply to the Trail. See Section 15300.2(a) of the Public
10 Resources Code.

11 131. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in addition,
12 Section 15300.2(c) of the Public Resources Code regarding Significant Effect states: "A
13 categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that
14 the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."
15 132. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that because of the
16 Trail's location next to the Spring Complex and its wetland on soils of high erosion risk, steep
17 terrain, and inclose proximity to the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault, the Spring Complex area
18 cannot qualify for a categorical exemption.
19 133. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as to Classes
20 and 4, the Guidelines state: "Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of
21 where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the
22 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant.
23 134. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that therefore, these
24 classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may impact on an

25 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and
26 officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies."
27 135. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as to the Class
28 3(b) exemption cited by the City as applicable to its Trail, this exemption is for "[a] duplex or
similar multi-family residential structure, totally no more than four dwelling units. .. ." There
32

VERIFIED WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF; AND COMPLAINT FOR PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE
Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

are no duplexes or multi-family residential structures associated with the Trail.

2 136. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as to the City's
3 cited Class 4(a) exemption, this exemption is for "[g]rading on land with a slope of less than 10

4 percent, except that grading shall not be exempt in a waterway, in any wetland, in an officially a

5 designated (by federal, state, of local government action) scenic area, or in officially mapped

6 areas of severe geological hazard such as an Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone or within an

7 official Seismic Hazard Zone, as delineated by the State Geologist."

8 137. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the work on the
9 Trail is being done on steep slopes of 30%, in very close proximity to a wetland (the Spring
10 Complex) and the Fickle Hill Earthquake Fault.
11 138. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as to the
12 cited Class 11(d) exemption, there is no such subsection included in the Class 11 exemption
13 listed in CEQA.

14 Violation of CEQA (Inconsistency With Standards Cited in the City's NOE)
15 139. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in an attachment
16 to a the City's NOE is a description of standards of construction of trail building,47 in which the
17 City asserts: "It [the Trail] will be constructed using the drainage** guidelines in the Handbook
18 for Forest and Ranch Roads ("HFR&R") by Pacific Watershed Associates.49
19 140. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in one of the
20 opening paragraphs of the HFR&R there is in a nutshell version of the root of the issues
21 underlying the threat by the City's Trail to the Spring Complex: "Reading and understanding this
22 manual [and applicable laws] is not enough. It takes the commonsense, intelligent, practical

10 Complex a is a wetland as defined by the City's own definition,5I but the City has simply
11

12 50 "Wetlands should be avoided during road construction and related activities, as they

13 result in special problems that often require expensive construction techniques and may cause continuing land stability problems. More importantly, wetlands require special protective
14 measures and are highly sensitive to disturbance. Fish and wildlife agencies (e.g., the California Department of Fish and Wildlife or the US Army Corps of Engineers) can provide assistance on
15 wetland delineation and protection measures, and can advise you concerning which agency to contact about applicable wetland regulations." HRF&F at page 6.
16 The HFR&R describes the nature of the Spring Complex and recommends avoidance of such subsurface drainage: "I. Subsurface drainage Water held in the soil, or moving through the
17 soil, is called soil water or groundwater. Water that cannot move freely through the soil often emerges on the ground surface as springs and seeps. Even where subsurface drainage (the flow of
18 water through the soil) is good, it can be affected by road construction and, in turn, roads can be damaged by obstructed or disturbed subsurface drainage. Avoidance is the least expensive
19 and most successful method for preventing subsurface drainage problems, and it is almost

20 always best to re-route the road to avoid natural wet areas." [Emphasis added]. HRF&F at page 13.

21 At page 19, the HFR&R stresses that, "Streambeds and wetlands do not make good road locations and should never be used for that purpose." [Emphasis in the original.]
22 In the section entitled "Selecting Favorable Ground for New Roads," at pages 36-37 the HRF&F instructs: 'Avoidance is almost always the best solution to road-building in difficult
23 terrain. Indeed the recognition and avoidance of unstable slopes is without doubt the most effective and cost-effective method of managing landslide-prone terrain. Similar avoidance
24 measures should be taken for highly erodible soils, steep slopes, water bodies, wetlands and other obstacles which are likely to threaten the integrity of the road or degrade environmental
25 conditions. When possible, all serious obstacles to road construction should be avoided though complete realignment or by locally changing grad and circumventing problem spots as they are
26 encountered." [Emphasis in the original.]

27 51 Arcata's Code Glossary refers to the definitions contained in Evironmentally Sensitive

28 Habitat Areas (Chapter 9.59, §9.59.030) for the definition of wetlands which articulates: "An area that is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands are lands where the water table is 34

disregarded this fact and elected not to avoid the Spring Complex wetland area in its Trail work.
2 143. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City has not
3 developed any plans for any review by regulatory agencies or other professionals that could help
4 ensure that Petitioners' sole water supply would be protected.

5 144. Petitioners are informed and believe that instead, the City appears to have ignored

6 the fact that area of the real property where the Trail work has been done, and in which is the
7 Spring Complex located, is a riparian area - an area for which the HFR&R opines is likely to
8 threaten the integrity of the trail.
9 145. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that another caution
10 given by the HRF&R is that roads built on steep or unstable slopes may trigger land sliding.52
11 146. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that to protect the
12 Spring Complex which is the source of Petitioners' Water Supply, all of the geological hazards
13 discussed by the HFR&R should have been analyzed by the City prior to any work being
14 performed on the Trail project.
15 147. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that no geological
16 hazards were discussed by the City, even though the City's own Code mandates at Section
17 9.59.040 that "[w]etlands delineation shall be based upon detailed field investigation of
18 hydrology, soils and biota" conducted by a qualified professional. . . .
19 148. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the need for
20

21

22 at, or near, or above the land surface long enough to promote the formation of hydric soils or to support the growth of hydrophytes, and shall also include those types of wetlands where
23 vegetation is lacking and soil is poorly developed or absent as a result of frequent or drastic fluctuations of surface water levels, wave action, water flow, turbidity or high concentrations of
24 salt or other substances in the substrate. These wetlands can be recognized by the presence of surface water or saturated substrate at some time during each year and their location within, or
25 adjacent to, vegetated wetlands or deep water habitats."

26 52 The HFR&R at pages 8 and 9 warns: "Roads built on steep or unstable slopes may trigger landsliding which deposits sediment in stream channels. Filling and sidecasting increases 27 slope weight, road cuts remove slope support, and construction can alter groundwater pressures,
28 all of which may trigger landsliding. Unstable road or landing sidecast materials can fail, often many years after the materials were put on steep hillslopes."

professional analysis of the area proposed for the Trail before any other work in the Spring
2 Complex Area is conducted is further evident when one reads a November 27, 2006, report by
Certified Engineering Geologist for the California Department of Conservation, James N. Falls,
4 re: timber harvest plan THP 1-06-164 HUM for Morris and Handgraff 4 which discusses an area
directly below where the City's Trail project is proposed.

6 149. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that this report opines
7 at page 4, under the section entitled "Geologic Conditions": "Geologic mapping by Kelly (1984)
8 shows the THP area to be predominantly underlain by melange in the Central Belt of Franciscan
9 Complex. The Quaternary-aged Falor Formation is mapped underlying the southwest portion of
10 the THP. A thrust fault associated with the Fickle Hill Fault Zone is shown as the contact

11 between the two units . . . .$*55

12 150. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at page 17, the
13 HFR&R supports no construction during winter ("seasonal construction limitations").S6
14 151. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as stated above,
15 the City has elected to work on the Trail during the wettest winter in recent history irrespective of
16 the danger to Petitioners Water Supply and irrespective of noncompliance with federal, state and
17 the City's own ordinances.

18 152. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the HFR&R
19 recommends that "[a] sufficient buffer or filter strip of undisturbed soil and vegetation should be
20 left between road building, reconstruction, and road maintenance activities, and nearby streams,

25 The area the Trail will traverse is located in a much closer proximity to the Fickle Hill Fault Zone that the area mapped by Kelly.
26 56 "California's coastal Mediterranean climate is generally one of wet is winters and dry 27 summers, and these extremes limit the time of year when construction activities can be most

28 effective. Although road construction should not occur during wet weather conditions, there are a number of planning and reconnaissance activities that can, and should, take place during wet periods. Indeed, winter is the best period for field reconnaissance and to identify springs, seeps and small streams that might not be visible during the dry season.'

1 lakes and wetlands. Road surface drainage should be dispersed and discharged into a filtering
2 area with enough ground cover and slope distance to infiltrate water and catch any sediment
3 coming from road runoff." HFR&R at p. 19.

4 153. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City has not
5 heeded, and has not stated an intent to heed, the recommendation of the HFR&R that a sufficient

6 buffer filter strip of undisturbed soil and vegetation be left between the Trail and the nearby
7 Spring Complex.

8 154. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that under the
circumstances of the Trail being in such close proximity to the Spring Complex, at page 23 to 24,
10 the HFR&R recommends the involvement of the State Water Resources Control Board and the

11 Regional Water Quality Control Board as these regulating agencies possess jurisdiction to
12 administer and enforce the provisions of California's Porter-Cologne Act, as well as the Federal
13 Clean Water Act.

14 155. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that The Handbook
15 reasons, "Whenever water quality and the beneficial uses of water could be affected, these
16 agencies need to be consulted." HFR&R at p. 24.
17 156. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that it does not appear
18 that the City has engaged any of these regulatory agencies for the Spring Complex which would
19 be difficult to do absent the adoption of formally approved plans. See Declaration of Petitioner
20 URI DRISCOLL.

21 157. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the HFR&R
22 emphasizes the exact risks the City's work on the Trail poses risks that the City has thus far
23 ignored:

24 1. "Improper execution of plans, no matter how well designed, can result in a poorly
25 constructed road that cases serious impact to the watershed and environment."
26 [Emphasis in the original.] HFR&R at p. 163; and
27 2. "Roads should be constructed during the time of year when the best results can be
28 achieved with the least environmental damage."
[Emphasis in the original.] HFR&R at p. 165.

158. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that any analysis of the
2 recommendations of the HFR&R as to drainage issues demonstrates that the City has only give
lip service to heeding the recommendations of the HFR&R, which further calls into question the

4 premise of supporting information upon which the City's NOE is based. This threatens
Petitioners' Water Supply.

6 Violation of Intent and/or Conditions Associated with State and Federal Funding Sources

7 159. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the NOE the City
8 created for the Trail cites funding for development of the Trail as being "from Federal Highway
9 Administration Recreational Trails Program."57

10 160. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Federal Executive
11 Order 11990 (President Carter) of May 24, 1977, 42 FR 26961, 1977 Comp., p. 121 (Executive
12 Order 11990), at Section 1, mandates that Federal agencies take action to minimize the
13 destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands, and to preserve and enhance the natural and
14 beneficial values of wetlands" in carrying out the agency's responsibilities for, among other
15 things, providing federally financed construction and improvement. See Exhibit N for a true and
16 correct copy of Executive Order 11990, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
17 161. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that because, as
18 discussed above, the City of Arcata has, via the definition of wetlands in its Code and Policies,
19 identified the Spring Complex area containing a wetland, and the land in which the Spring as

20 Complex is located was purchased with Federal funds to develop the Trail, the "level of
21 concurrence" required for application of Executive Order 11990 clearly exists (i.e., that the
22 proposed site/project is identified as wetland area).
23

24 57 The Project Description included in the Categorical Exemption/Categorical Exclusion
25 Determination Form of the NOE posted by the City includes in its second description: "California States and the City of Arcata with Funding from Federal Highway Administration
26 Recreational Trails Program, propose the Arcata Ridge Trail Project Phase Ill-Fickle Hill Segment...
27 58 Section 7 of Executive Order 11990 defines "wetlands" as "those areas that are 28 inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support and under normal circumstances does or would support a prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. .. 38

Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

162. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in order to exempt
2 a federally funded project from the "no funding mandate" of Federal Executive Order 11990, the

3 Federal agency head must expressly find: (1) that there is no practicable alternative to such

4 construction, and (2) that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm
to wetlands which may result from such use. Section 2, Executive Order 11990.

6 163. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Section 5 of
7 Executive Order 11990 requires that the Federal agency providing funding must consider factors
8 relevant to a proposal's effect on the survival and quality of the wetlands.
9 164. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the NOE alleged
10 to apply to the Trail states, without discussion of alternatives to the Trail and/or practicable
11 measures to minimize harm to wetlands from the Trail, that "Executive Order 11990 is an overall
12 wetlands policy for all agencies ... providing federal funds to state or local projects.
13 165. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Executive Order
14 11990 requires federal agencies to follow avoidance, mitigation, and preservation procedures
15 with public input before proposing new construction in wetlands.
16 166. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's Trail
17 activities will not be able to completely avoid impacts to wetlands and a Wetlands Only
18 Practicable Alternative Finding is provided in Section 4.1.3.1.

19 167. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that combined with the
20 City's failure to identify alternatives and/or measures to reduce harm to the Spring Complex, this
21 attempt by the City to allege compliance with Federal Executive Order 11990 by reference to
22 "Section 4.1.3.1" utterly fails as no Section 4.1.3.1. is found in the City's NOE for the trail.
23 168. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in addition, the
24 funds used by the City of Arcata to acquire the real property over which the Trail runs were funds
25 from the California Wildlife Conservation Board (the "WCB").59
26 169. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that while the Trail
27 poses an actual threat to Petitioners' clean drinking water, the funds used to purchase the Spring

4 Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002);'' and Proposition 84 Funds (Natural Resource

5 Protection and Restoration via The Safe Drinking Water, Water Quality and Supply, Flood

6 Control, River and Coastal Protection Bond Act of 2006).

7 City Trail Work Caused Harm to Plaintiffs' Spring Complex
8 170. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that in addition to the
9 City's admitted inability to ensure the environmental integrity of the Trail area from rogue trail
10 builders and users, the initial map which was provided to Petitioners by Director ANDRE did not
11 accurately depict the location of the source Spring Complex.
12 171. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as stated above,
13 all potential Trail alignments and encroachments thus far identified by the City would all be
14 within the required 100-foot protection areas, and subsequent maps provided by the City to
15 Petitioners have also been extremely inconsistent and inaccurate.
16 172. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that because of the
17 City's failure to property identify the location of the Spring Complex, the City asserted that it
18 was only clearing vegetation for the construction of the Trail within fifteen to twenty (15-20) feet
19 of the Spring Complex, but what was done by the City was not merely vegetation clearing, but in
20 fact the work by the City created significant ground disturbance and grading and tread

development in the wettest winter in years, with no remediation as to erosion control for the

2 unstable soils present in the area surrounding the Spring Complex.

3 173. Petitioner URI DRISCOLL has found that there is still approximately 1,200 feet
4 of unauthorized Trail construction that has not been decommissioned, and none of this
5 construction by the City has been stabilized for erosion control.

6 174. This construction has taken place on slopes of greater than 30% during winter
7 months and within very close proximity of the Spring Complex's domestic water source, as well
8 as another creek downslope®2.
9 175. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that City Manager
10 DIEMER was made aware of this 1,200 feet of unauthorized Trail construction which had not

11 been decommissioned, and in mid-January 2019, and City Manager DIEMER, in fact, conducted
12 a site visit with Petitioner URI DRISCOLL, but to date no remediation efforts by the City have
13 occurred. See Declaration of Petitioner URI DRISCOLL.

14 176. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that the City took a
15 pristine environment geared for preservation of clean drinking water and has introduced
16 disturbed soils and plant life and resultant siltation risks.

17 Placement of Parking Lot/Gravel Driveway Harms Spring Complex
18 177. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that the County has not
19 received the required encroachment permit application from the City, despite the City's
20 installation of a gated parking area and gravel driveway, which also appear to be within the
21 required 100-foot protection buffer for the Complex. See Declaration of Petitioner URI
22 DRISCOLL.

23 178. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that no assessment of
24 environmental damage and/or remediation has occurred in regards to the parking area and gravel
25 driveway that has been placed by the City in such close proximity to the Spring Complex,
26 increasing the risks of siltation to the Spring Complex.

2 Risk of Harm Created by City's Abuse of CEQA Exemption

179.

3 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the City's CEQA

4 deficiencies translate into an absence of assessment of potential harm to the environment

5 surrounding the Trail, including to Petitioners' Spring Complex which is, in and of itself, a harm.
180.

6 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that deficiencies

7 associated with the Standards articulated in the City's August 2018 NOE includes the following:

8 1) failure to take into account the steepness of the slope (approximately 30 degrees) and the

9 presence of a domestic water system (the Spring Complex); and 2) the absence of any approved

10 plan by the City under which the NOE was filed which suggesting Trail construction was

11 premature and potentially damaging to protected water systems, and the environment, and its

12 absence make impossible review by regulatory agencies normally reviewing such activity.
181.

13 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that the City's ground

14 disturbance and grading associated with Trail construction were directly above and around the

15 Spring Complex, an area which was never correctly identified (and at times not identified at all)
as a wetland in any City documents associated with the Trail.
16 182.

17 Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that there being more

18 than one description contained in the City's NOE - one for the area across Fickle Hill Road from

19 the area proposed for the Trail at issue in this matter, and one for the proposed area of the Trail

20 (See Exhibit A, the City of Arcata's Notice of Exemption) makes assessment by regulatory

21 agencies and/or objection by members of the public difficult and/or impossible.
183.

22 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege, that without an

23 accurately described "project' location and consideration of the steepness and wetness, as well as

24 the poor soil quality of the area affected by the City's Trail efforts, as well as, no remediation as

to

25 erosion for the work already done by the City, the risk of harm and/or harm to Petitioners'

26 clean water supply and Spring Complex is grave with no foreseeable improvement.

11 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

12 [INJUNCTIVE RELIEF]

13 196. Petitioners re-allege paragraphs 1 through 196, incorporating these allegations in

17 unlawfully failed to comply with, as outlined herein, applicable State and Federal laws and
18 regulations, as wells as the City's own Code, Ordinances, regulations and policies applicable to
19 the Trail.

20 198. Beginning in 2013 and continuing through March of 2019, Petitioners have
21 demanded that Respondents comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations and/or policies
22 applicable to the Trail. Respondents have refused and continue to refuse to so comply.
23 199. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents'
24 wrongful conduct, unless and until enjoined by order of this court, will continue to cause great
25 and irreparable injury to Petitioners in that Respondents will continue to work on the Trail
26 without compliance with applicable laws, ordinances, regluations, and policies, putting at risk
27 Petitioners' only water source, the Spring Complex.
28 200. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Petitioners have
no adequate remedy at law for the injuries currently being suffered, in that absent the granting of

2 with all legal requirements for their activities in regards to the Trail. Petitioners have been
3 injured by Respondents' work to date on the Trial, and Petitioners will be further damaged in a
like manner so long as Respondents conduct in regards to the Trail continues without full

5 compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, regulations and policies.

6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

7 [PRIVATE NUISANCE]

8 201. Petitioners re-allege paragraphs I through 201, incorporating these allegations in
this Fourth Cause of Action by this reference.

10 202. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at all times herein
11 alleged, Petitioners were owners and/or possessors of water property rights to the Spring
12 Complex associated with real property located on Fickle Hill in Arcata California which is
13 described in detail above.

14 203. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that at all times herein
15 alleged, the City was and is the owner of the parcel upon which the Spring Complex is located.
16 204. During the time frames discussed in this complaint, Petitioners are informed and
17 believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents began work on the Trail which interfered with
18 the ecological integrity of the Spring Complex, thereby putting the quality of Petitioners' water,
19 and thus their enjoyment of their property, including without limitation their water property
20 rights, at risk.
21 205. The risk to Petitioners' water quality threatens their senses, and depending on the
22 gravity of the impairment of the Spring Complex, Petitioners are informed and believe, and
23 thereupon allege, that this threat could eventually threaten Petitioners' health.

24 206. Petitioners' comfortable enjoyment of life has been negatively affected by
25 circumstances associated with Respondents' Trail being placed in close proximity to the Spring
26 Complex from which Petitioners draw their water.

27 207. Petitioners did not nsent to Respondents' activities associated with the Trial.
28 208. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Respondents' use

and maintenance of the property that houses the Spring Complex constitutes a nuisance under

VERIFIED WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF; AND COMPLAINT FOR PRELIMINARY AND PERMANENT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF; COMPLAINT FOR PRIVATE NUISANCE Driscoll, et al. v. City of Arcata, et al.

Civil Code section 3479. It is injurious to Petitioners' health and offensive to Petitioners' senses,

2 sO as to obstruct the free use of Petitioners' water property rights and interferes with Petitioners'
3 comfortable enjoyment of life.

4 209. On or about April 25, 2019, Petitioners gave notice to Respondents to abate the

5 nuisance by sending the City by certified mail, return receipt requested, a letter requesting the

6 abatement of the nuisance, but Respondents have failed to abate the nuisance. A copy of this
7 letter is attached hereto as Exhibit O and incorporated herein by reference.

8 210. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that as a proximate
cause of the private nuisance created and maintained by Respondents, as described herein,
10 Petitioners' priceless water quality has been damaged, and Petitioners' real property to which the
11 water property rights attach, has been diminished in value, and will continue to diminish in
12 value, unless Respondents' private nuisance is abated.

13 211. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that Petitioners have
14 no adequate remedy at law for the injuries which Petitioners have suffered and will continue to

15 suffer in the future, unless Respondents' private nuisance is abated.
16 212. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the private
17 nuisance maintained by Respondents has and is interfering is with Petitioners' use and enjoyment
18 of their property, including without limitation their water property rights. San Diego Gas &
19 Electric Co. v. Superior Court, 13 Cal. 4th 893, 937 (1996).

20 213. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereupon allege, that the invasion of
21 Petitioners' interests in the Spring Complex for their basic human need for clean water is not
22 only substantial, but is existential, and as such the gravity of harm to Petitioners' water rights
23 outweighs an intent by the City to merely provide recreational use of the Trial.
24 AWARD OF COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES
25 214. Because: 1) The persistent failure by Respondents to act to comply with
26 applicable law, including especially Respondents' own Code provisions, Ordinances, regulations
27 and policies, as to the enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies, a winning
28 plaintiff does confer a significant benefit when the court indicates environmental review needs to

Arcata Ridge Trail Project Phase III - Fickle Hill Segment -- Natural Environment Study (Minimal Impact)

Summary

The City of Arcata (City) proposes to construct approximately 1,600.linear-feet of recreatlonal trails, known... as the Arcata Ridge Trail Project Phase III - Fickle Hill Segment (Project). The Project is located within the City of Arcata's Arcata Community Forest (Figure 1). The trailhead is located on Fickle Hill Road, approximately 1.5 miles east of the intersection of Fickle Hill Road and Park Avenue. The trail continues to the north for approximately 1,600 linear feet.
The project Involves construction, operation, and maintenance of an unpaved recreational trail. The trail will be multi-use and will Include hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking. This trail segment will provide a critical link in a larger regional five-mile long trail known as the Arcata Ridge Trail. It will link the Arcata Community Forest with a county-maintalned road (Fickle Hill Rd) In order to facilitate a future road crossing to connect the Arcata Community Forest north unit with the south (Sunnybrae) unit.
This Natural Environmental Study Minimal Impact (NES(MI)) has been prepared by the City to evaluate the potential effects of implementation of the proposed project, Based upon a literature review, existing data that Includes the biological study area (BSA), and fleld reconnalssance, the BSA may contain suitable habitat for nine special-status plant species and 17 special-status wildlife specios. Of these species, nine are federally-listed species; three are state-listed species; seven are state species of special concern; and nine are sensitive plant species as designated by the California Native Plant Society.
Although suitable habitat for sonsitive species may exist, there are no known occurrences of any listed species within the BSA or project vicinity, with the exception of the Fisher (Martes pennanti • State Threatened). While there are no known occurrences of the Fisher within the BSA, there have been aightings within the project vicinity. Botanical surveys are regularly conducted w|thin the Arcata Community Forest, and none have idontified sonsitive plant spocles. Although the BSA contains potential habitat for federally- and state- listed animal species, no federally designated critical habitat exigts. In addition, none of the special status animal and plant species on the USFWS species list are expected to occur within, or adjacent to, the project area and the project will have no effect on any federally listed specles. With minimization and avoidance measures, there will be no effect on listed plant species.
Jolly Giant Creek, a Class II watercourse is located wlthin the study area, which a pre-manufactured bridge will span. However, because the bridge installation will not require disturbance to the bed, bank, or channel of the watercourse, and the abutments will be set back approximately 10 feet from the top of the bank, there will be no impacts to the watercourse. There will be no discharges to Jolly Glant Creek as a result of project activitles. No Waters of the US, Waters of the State, or other Environmentally Bensitive Habitat Areas will be impacted by the project.

1 - Introduction
Project Purpose and Need The purpose of the Project is to construct a critical link of a regional five-mlle long recreational trait known as the Arcata Ridge Trail. The entire Arcata Ridge Trail will span the City limits from north to south and be fully contalned within sconic redwood forested hillsides. It will provide regional connectivity tò other areas, including residential neighborhoods in the unincorporated Fickle Hill area.
The proposed project, the Fickle HIll Segment, will link the Arcata Community Forest a with a county road (Fickle Hill Rd) and set the stage for the next project phase of a road crossing to link the Arcata Community Forest north unit with the south (Sunnybrae) unit.
Project Description The project is located within the Arcata Community Forest located within Section 34 Township 6N Range1E of the USGS Arcata South, California 6.5-Minute Quadrangle. The terminus of the project, the Fickle Hill

and Park Avenue. The Trailhead, is located on Fickle Hill Road, approximately 1.5 miles east of the intersection of Fickle Hill Road trail continues to the north for approximately 1,600 linear feet. It can be accessed from the south by Fickle Hill Road, or from the north via the existing Ridge Trail. It ls approximately 2 from the nearest Highway 101 on-ramp. It is owned in fee title by the City of Arcata. miles

The trail will
guidelines in be constructed to California State Park Trails Handbook standards (Fig 1) and drainage the Handbook for Forest and Ranch Roads by Pacific Watershed Associates. Construction will be performed with hand tools. The trail will be constructed with numerous rolling or vibrated into sultable drainage. No culverts are proposed. Crushed rock with fines will be applied to the surface and either rolled dips to facilitate compaction in order to create surfacing that enabies closures will be required to construct the trait. Staging will occur on private parcel located on Boynton Prairie year round use. No road Road; landowner permission has been obtalned. Specific project improvements include:
Construct one trailhead kiosk Construct 190-linear feet of redwood split-rail fencing Construct (~600' x 6') new trail Convert (~1,000' x 6') skid/logging road to trail Install one 20' x 6' pedestrian bridge (to Install one bench cross Class Il Watercourse)

2 - Study Methods
A revlow of all avallable pertinent literature, reviow of biological surveys, and a field reconnaissance site visit were conducted to determine the project context and potential impacts to the environment. The limits of the BSA are shown in Figure 2.
The review of pertinent literature Included National Wetlands Inventory; the CNODB (Queried on 8/25/2016); the USFWS IPaC Trust Resource Report (Generated 8/25/2016); Caltrans Table of Air Quallty Conformity; historical aerial imagery; FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Mep; the Arcata General Plan 2020; Arcata Creeks Management Plan; Arcata Forest Managoment Plan; Arcata Community Forest Non- Industrial Timber Management Plan (NTMP). In addition, botany surveys and northern spotted owl surveys are regularly conducted by Michael McDowall (Natural Resources Techniclan) In accordance with the NTMP. Botanical surveys within the project vicinity were most recently conducted in Spring 2010, October 2015, and Spring 2016 (4/2B/2016 5/9/2016, 6/29/2016). 2016 Arcata Community Forest Northern spotted
owl surveys were conducted on March 16, April 6, April 26, May 10, May 11, May 18, and June 9. . These survoys include the projoct area and wore reviawed for potential sensitive plant species or presence of northern spotted owls, Finally, a site reconnalssance field visit was conducted to determine potential impacts assoclated with the project that were not identified in background literature.

Federal Endangered Species Act Section 9 of the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA), prohibits acts of disturbance that result in the "lake" of threatened or endangered species, As defined by the ESA, "endangerod" refera to any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its current range. The

Arcata Ridge Trail Project Phase Ill - Fickle Hill Segment -- Natural Environment Study (Minimal Impact)

term "threatened" is applied to any species likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or significant portion of Its current range. Take ls defined as "harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct." Violation of this section can result in penalties of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. Sections 7 and 10 of the ESA provide a method for permitting an action that may result in "Iincidental take" of a federally listed species, Incidental take refers to take of a listed specles that is incidental to, but not the primary purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity. Incidental take is permitted under Section 7 for projects on federal land or involving a federal action, while Section 10 provides a method for permitting Incidental take resulting from state or private action. The lead federal action agency, Caltrans on behalf of the Federal Highways Administration.in- this case, must prepare an information package on the potential of a proposed action to affect listed species, referred to as a biological assessment (BA), and consuit with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and NMFS, depending on the species affected and respective jurisdictions of these
agencles.

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act
The Magnuson-Stevens Flshery Conservation and Management Act (MSA), as amended by the
Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-267), established procedures designed to identify, conserve, and enhance essential fish habitat (EFH) for those species regulated under a federal fisheries management plan. The MSA requires federal agencies to consult with NMFS on all actions, or proposed actions, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agencies that maÿ adversely affect EFH (MSA section 305[b](2]). A component of this consultation process is the preparation and submittal of an Essential Fish Habitat Assessment (EFHA).
The EFH mandate applies to all species managed under a fisheries management plan. For the Pacific coast (exciuding Alaska), there are three fisheries management plans covering groundfIsh, coastal pelagic
species, and Pacific salmon.

Federal Clean Water Act Section 404 Thé objective of the Clean Water Act (CWA, 1977,'as amended) is to restore and maintaln the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. In 1987, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) published a manual standardizing the manner in which wetlands were to be delineated rationwide. To
determine whethor areas that appear to be wetlands are subject to Corps jurlsdiction (I.e., are "jurisdictlonal"
wetlands), a wetlands delineation must be performed that maps the areas meeting the three-parameter wetland definition (i.e., presence of dominant hydrophytic vegetation, hydric soils, and wetland hydrology) and the resulting map of the wetland boundaries verified in writing by the Corps (compared to the one- parameter wetland definition under the California Coastal Act Section 2.2.6 below). Wetlands generally include riparian, swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.
In addition to verifying wetlands for potential jurisdiction, the Corps is responsible for the Issuance of permits
for projects that propose the filling of wetlands. Any permanent logs of e jurlsdictional wetland as a result of project construction activities is considered a significant impact. Permits under Section 404 of the CWA. as amended, are required for the placement of dredged or fill materials Into all waters of the United States, including wetlands and "other waters." Projects are permitted under either individual or general (e.g., nationwide) permits.

Foderal Clean Water Act Section 401 The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB), North Coast Region, is responsible for enforçing water quality criterla and protecting water resources in the project area. The RWQCB is responsible for controlling discharges to surface waters of the state by issuing waste discharge
requirements.

Section 401 of the CWA requires that a project proponent obtain a water quality certification or a waiver for projects requiring t federal permit to allow for discharges of dredged or fill material (I.e., CWA Section 404 permits).

Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act Migratory birds are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918 (16 USC 703-711). The MBTA makes it unlawful to take, possess, buy, sell, purchase, or barter any migratory bird listed In 50 CFR Part 10, Including feathers or other parts, nests, eggs, or products, except as allowed by implementing regulations (50 CFR 21).

Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands) Executive Order 11990 is an overall stlands policy for all agencles managing federal lands, sponsoring federal projects, or providing federal funds to state or local projects. It requires federal agencles to follow avoidance, mitigation, and preservation procedures with public input before proposing new construction in wetlands. This project will not be able to completely avoid Impacts to wetlands and a Wetlands Only Practicable Alternative Finding is provided In Section 4.1.3.1.
Executive Order 13112 (Invasive Spocies) Executive Order 13112 directe federal agancles to use relevant programs and authoritles to:
prevent the introduction of invasive species; detect and respond rapidly to and control populations of such species in a cost-effective and environmentally sound manner; monitor invasive species populations accurately and reliably; provide for restoration of native species and habitat conditions in ecosystems that have been invaded:
conduct research on invasive species and develop technologies to prevent introduction and provide for environmentally sound control of invasive species; promote public education on invasive species and the means to address them; and not authorize, fund, or carry out actions that it believes are likely to cause or promote the introduction or spread of invasive species in the United States or elsewhere unless, In accordance with guidelines that it has prescribed, the agency has determined and made public its determinatíon thät the benefits of such actions clearly outweigh the potential harm caused by invasive species; and that all feasible and prudent measures to minimize risk to of harm will be taken in conjunction with the actions.

Executive Order 11983 (Floodplain Managemont) Executive Order 11988 requiros federal agencies to avoid the long- and short-term adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and-modification of floodplains and avoid direct and Indirect support of floodplain development.

California Regulatory Requirements
Department of Fish and Game Code Section 2081, California Endangered Species Act Under the Callfornla Endangered Species Act (CESA), the Callfornia Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has the responsibility for maintaining a list of threatened and endangered species (California Fish and Game Code 2070). Additionally, CDFW maintains a list of "candidate species" which are species that CDFW has formally recognized as being under review for inclusion on the state's list of endangered or throatenod species. The CDFW also maintains lists of "species of special concern" which serve as "watch lists." In accordance with the requirements of the CESA, an agency reviewing proposed project within its Jurisdiction must determine whether any state-listed endangered or threatened specles may be present In the project area and determine whether the proposed project will have a potentially significant impact on such species. In addition, the CDFW encourages informal consultation on any proposed project that may impact a candidate species. Project-related impacts to species on the CESA endangered or threatened list would be considered significant and would require avoidance. State-listed species are fully protected under the mandates of CESA. "Take" of protected specles incidental to otherwise lawful management activities may be authorized under Section 2081 of the Fish and Game Code of California,

3 - Results: Environmental Setting
The climate of the project area ls charecterized as cool-summer Mediterranean, with cool, wet winters and cool, foggy summers. Average annual precipitation is approximately 43,41 inches. Most precipitation falls as rain between the months of October and April. -Air temperatures range between an average January high of 55.4 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), and an average September high of 63.8 °F. The year-round average high temperature is approximately 59.5 °F (Western Regional Climate Center 2016).
The project area lies within the North Coast region and the Coast Ranges geomorphic province. The bedrock geology of Humboldt County as whole divides generally into the Klamath Mountains province In the northeast and the Coast Ranges province in the central and southwest parts of the county. The North Coast is the location of numherous fault lines and is near the intersection of three tectonio plates, the Paolfio, Gorda, and North American. Goils in the vicinity are generally coarse to fine alluvium deposits typical of northwest California coastal plains.
The project area, as currently defined, spans 1,600 linear feet of the Arcata Community Forest north of the Fickle Hill Road trailhead. The habitat is characterized as Redwood Forest.
Description of the Existing Biological and Physical Conditions Study Area
The Study Area was defined by the trail footprint and an approximately 5-foot buffer on either side. Because construction will be primarily with hand tools, a 5-foot buffer is more than necessary to construct the trail. Because the proposed bridge will not impact the bed, bank, or channel, of the watercourse, the biological study area does not expand upstream or downstream of the watercourse beyond the 5-foot buffer,
Physical Conditions The project area consists of a portion of the Arcata Community Forest, which is an actively managed multi- use forest. In addition to regular timber harvests, the forest provides a network of trails and recreational opportunities including hiking, biking, and horseback riding.

Arcala Ridge Trail Project Phase III - Fickle Hill Segment -- Natural Environment Study (Minimal Impact)

The slope varies throughout the span of the trall. The trail will be designed to cross slopes to minimize erosion and provide a more level grade for recreationalists. The trail will be a maxlmum a of 8 feet wide. It will be constructed using State Park Trails Handbook standards and drainage guidelines in the Handbook for Forest and Ranch Roads by Pacific Watershed Associates. Construction will be performed with hand tools and no major grading is required.
Biological Conditions in the Study Area This project Is located in North Coast coniferous forest type, dominated by redwood (Sequoia sompervirens), with some small components of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesli var. menziesii), grand fir (Ablos grandis) and Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensls). Generally the BSA Is very uniform in botanical species present and types of botanical habitats. Due to a lack of botanical diversity, the BSA lacks quality habitat for many listed species, The overstory canopy closure is generally closed (~85-90%). Conifers range in dlameter sizes but generally appear to be 12" to 42" with occasional larger trees. The main shrub layer is dominated by salmon berry patches near mapped wet areas and adjacent creek riparian and occesional huckleberry plants scattered throughout. The dominant shrub species are evergreen huckleberry (Vaccinium ovatum), salmon berry (Rubus spectabilis), and salal (Gaultheria shallon). The herbaceous layer also lacks much diversity. Generally, the herbaceous specles were few within the BSA due to a dense cover of sword fern/deer fem. Dominant herbs include sword fern (Polystichum munitum), redwood sorrel (Oxalis oregano), evergreen violet (Viola sempervirens), and Pacific star flower (Trientalis latifolia). All wet areas (mapped and unmapped) were surveyed for listed species.
Much of the trail will be constructed by converting a former skid road. As such, the project footprint has been disturbed with little understory: vegetation remaining. While some underbrush will be removed, vegetation removal will be limited primarily to herbaceous species. No tree remöval will occur. Jolly Giant Creek, a Class II watercourse, is located within the project boundaries. As such, there will be one bridge crossing; a pre-manufactured bridge will be installed to fully span the creek bed, banks, and channel. Because there will be no alteration of the stream bed, bank, or channel, there will be no impacts to listed aquatic species.

Habitat Connectivity The project will not Impact habitat connectivity. It will be a graveled trail which will not preclude use of the area for migration corridors. It will not physically divide natural habitat.
Regional Species and Habitats and Natural Communities of Concern The Redwood forest alliance has a G3S3 ranking, and is considered a sensitive natural community (CDFW, 2010). Much of the trail will be constructed within the footprint of a former skid road.
Based upon' the review of CNDDB database (Arcata 7.5 Minute Quadrangles), USFWS Species List, Community Forest, and knowledge of the flora and fauna Timber Harvest Botanical Surveys in the Arcata of the reglon, nine special-status plant species the potential to occur in the and 15 special-status wildlife species are considered to have project area. Of these species, none are known to exist within or immediately adjacent to the project area. Vegetation within the project area could potentially many common bird species. be used for nesting by

4 - Biological Resources, Discussion of Impacts & Mitigation
Habitats and Natural Communities of Special Concern Habitats are considered to be of special concern based on (1) federal, State, or local laws regulating their development; (2) limited distributions; and/or (3) the habitat requirements of special-status plants or animals occurring on site.
The Redwood forest alliance has a G353 ranking, and is considered a sensitive natural community (CDFW, 2010). The entire project is located within 'a redwood forest alliance. However, much of the trail wilt be constructed within lhe footprint of a former skid road. Furthermore, the extent of the Arcata Community Forest is within a redwood forest, and contains a variety of recreational trails,

Arocua Ridge Trail Project Phase IlI -- Ficide Hill Segment -- Natural Environment Study (Minimal Impaci)
The project will have no effect on this natural community for the following reasons:
The trail will be constructed using hand tools The trail will not have hard surfacing Minimal vegetation disturbance will occur The trail will follow natural land contours All disturbed areas outside of the trail footprint will be revegetated with native vegetation and restored to pre-project conditions The project footprint is small (limited to 1,600 linear feet of trail)
Avoidance and Minimization Efforts/Compensatory Mitigation
The trail will be constructed using hand tools All disturbed areas outside of the -trall footprint will be revegetated and restored to pre-project conditions
There will be no hard surfacing on the trail
Special Status Plant Species The planta listed are considered to be of special concern based on (1) federal, state, or local laws reguleting their development; (2) limited distributions; and/or (3) the plants occurring on slte.

Avoidance and minimization methods will be implemented regardless to ensure there is no i8 presence of special status plant species and ensure there is no to effect to any special status plant species should they be discovered.

Avoidance and Minimization Efforts/Compensatory Mitigation
Prior to trail construction, the project will be surveyed by a qualified botanist, If speclal status plant specles are identified, they will be flagged and avolded.

Special Status Animal Species Animals are considered to be of special concern based on (1) federal, state, or local laws regulating their development; (2) limited distributions; and/or (3) the habitat requirements of special-status animals occurring on site. No speclal status animal species were found to be present within the BSA.
None of the special status animal species are expected to occur within, or adjacent to, the proejct area and the project will have no effect on ainy special status animal species.
Marbled.Murrelet (Braghvramphus marnoratus):.The Marbled Murrelet habitat is within Old growth forests In the Pacjfic Northwest. No marbled murrelets have been detected within the Community Forest or within the asseesment aroa. Furthermore, sevoral pre-timber harvest surveys have been conducted which have not detected marbled murrelets. Therefore, there will be no effect.
Northern Spotted Owl (Strix.ocoidentalis caurinel: Northern spotted owi prefers mature multi layered forest stands, The habltat in the Arcata Community Forest has been classified as feeding and roosting habitat. However, spotted owl surveys within the Arcata Community Forest are conducted annually, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service has verified that no new activity centers were detected during 2016 surveys. . Therefore there will be no effect.

Yellow-billed_Cuckoo (Coccyzus amoricanus):_Yellów-billed Cuckoos prefer wooded habitat with dense cover and water nearby. The project area does not contain and is not part of a large riparian area and does not have the dense understory utilized by this species. Furthermore, if work occurs during bird nesting season, nest surveys will be conducted by a qualified biologist. nesting birds are found, they will be avoided and work that could impact the nests will not commence until all young have fledged. Therefore there will be no effect,

Fishor Mertes (ponnant): Fishers require large areas of mature conifer forest habitat. The project could provide some of the habitat components preferred by fishers. In 1994 the City of Arcata conducted a fisher study which did not yield 'flsher tracks, and prepared an Amendment to the NTMP regarding potential impacts on the Fisher in 2013. One Fisher was detected on 3/14/2015 and 3/15/2015 on a wildlife camera within the Sunny Brae Forest during Flsher baiting camera surveys. Given the project location's close proximity to residential areas, heavy recreational use, and lack of hardwoods and prey species, It is unlikely for the species to occur. Furthermore, because the project does not require tree removal, utilizes an existing skid road for portions of the trall, and requires minimal ground disturbance, it is not expected that the proposed project will alter the habitat enough to have an adverse impact on fishers that may exist or pass through the project area. There are no critical habltats in the proposed project localion. Therefore, there will be no effect to this species.
Çoho salmon - Southern Oregon Northern California Coast (Oncorhynchus kitsutch): Although suitable habitat exists within the BSA, the project will avoid disturbance to the bed, bank, and channel of the watercourse location within the BSA. There is no evidence of anadromy in this watercourse. Furthermore, all work will be during the dry season, BMPs will be employed to minimize erosion and sedimentation, and there will be no discharges to the watercourse. Because there will be no direct or species there will be no effect. indirect Impacts to this

Bank swallow (Riporia riparia): Bank swallows are colonial nesters. Their nests are primarily in riparlan and other lowland habitats west of the desert. Requires vertical banks/cliffs to dig nesting hole. There have been no known occurrences of bank swallows within the project vicinity, Suitable habitat may exist; however since no tree removal is proposed there will be no impacts to this species as a result of the project. If work occurs during bird nesting season, nest surveys will be conducted by a qualified biologist. If nesting birds are found, they will be avoided and work that could impact the nests will not commence until fledged. Therefore there will be no effect to this species. all young have

Northern red-leaged frog (Rana aurora aurorali. Suitable habitat exists within the BSA at the Jolly Giant Creek crossing. However, because the project will not impact the bed, bank, or channel of the stream, and because the project will be constructed using hand tools, it will have no effect on this species.
Foothill Yellow-Leaged frog (Rana bovlgi): Suitable habitat exists within the BSA at the Jolly Giant Creek crossing. However, because the project will not impact the bed, bank, or channel of the stream, and because the project will be constructed using hand tools, It will have no effect on this species.
Southern Torrent Salamander (Rhvacotriton variegalus): The Torrent salamander requires year round springs, seeps or streams with moss covered rocks in the splash zones. Suitable habitat exists within the BSA at the Jolly Giant Creek crossing. However, because the project will not impact the bed, bank, or channel of the stream, and because the project will be constructed using hand tools, it will have no effect on this species,
Coastal.Cutthroat.Trout.(Oncorhynchus clarki); Although suitable habltat exists within the BSA, the project will avold disturbance to the bed, bank, and chennel of the watercourse location within the BSA. Furthermore, all work will be during the dry season, BMPs will be employed to minimize eroslon and sedimentation, and there will be no discharges to the watercourse. Because there will be no direct or indirect impacts to this species there will be no effect.
Steelhead trout (Onserhynchus mykiss): Although suitable habitat existe within the BSA, the project will avoid disturbance to the bed, bank, and channel of the watercourse location within the BSA. There is no evidence of anadromy in this watercourse. Furthermore, all work will be during the dry season, BMPg will be employed to minimize erosion and sedimentation, and there will be no discharges to the watercourse. Because there will be no direct or indirect impacts to this species there will be no effect.

5 - Conclusions & Regulatory Determination Federal Endangered Species Act Consultation Summary
A USFWS Species list was generated on 8/25/2016 and a No a designated critical habltat exists within the BSA.

Marbled Murrelet.(Brachvramphus marnoratus): The project will have no effect on the marbled murrelet because habitat is within Old growth forests in the Pacific Northwest. No marbled murrelets have been detected within the Community Forest or within the assessment area.
Northern Spotted Owl (Strix ocoidentalis caurinal. The project will have no effect on Northern spotted owls because surveys lare conducted annually, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service has verifled that no new activity centers were detected during 2016 surveys.. Therefore there will be no effect.
Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coocyzus amenicanus): The project will have no effect on Yellow-billed because the project area doos not contain and is not part of a large riparian area and does not have the dense understory utilized by this specles. Fuithermore, If work occurs during bird nesting season, nest surveys will be conducted by a qualified biologist. If nesting birds are found, they will be avoided and work that could impact the nests will not commènce until all young have fledged.
Western snowy plover: The project will have no effect on the western snowy plover because no suitable habitat exists within the BSA or project vicinity,
Tidewater goby: The project will have no effect on tidewater goby because the watercourse within the BSA is freshwater and does not support this species. Furthermore, no project activities will impact the watercourse.

Western Lilv: The project will have no effect on western lily because is located within redwood forest and is not suitable habitat.

Essential Fish Habitat Consultation Summary NOAA species Ilst was obtained on June 22, 2016.No Essential Fish Habitat exists within the BSA and the project will not impact any water resources. Therefore, no consultation is necessary.

Wellands

Wetlands in the National Wetlands Inventory
Impacts to NWLwetlands and other aquatic habitats may be subject to regulation under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, or other State/Federal statutes.
For more information please contact the Regulatory Program of the local I.S. Army
Corps of Engineers District.

DATA LIMITATIONS
The Service's objective of mapping wetlands and deopwater habitats is to produce reconnaissance level Information on the location, type and size of these resources. The maps are prepared from the analysis of high eltitude Imagery. Wetlands are identified based on vegetation, visible hydrology and geography. A margin of error is inherent in the use of imagery; thus, detailed on-the-ground Inspection of any particular site may result in revision of the wetland boundarles or classification established through image analysis.
The accuracy of image interpretation depends on the quality of the Imagery, the experlence of the Image analysts, the amount and quality of the collateral data and the amount of ground truth verification work conducted. Metadata should be consulted to determine the date of the source imagery used and any mapping problems,
Wetlands or other mapped features may have changed since the date of the imagery or field work. There may be occasional differences in polygon bounderies or classificalions belween the information depicted on the map and the actual conditions on site.

DATA EXCLUSIONS
Certain wotland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial lmagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include geagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found In the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuarles and nearshore coastal waters. Some deopwater roef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the Inventory. These habitats, because of thelr depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.
DATA PRECAUTIONS
Federal, stale, and local regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over wetlands nay define and describe wetlands in a different manner than that used In this Invontory. There is no attempt, In either the design or products of thie Invontory, to define the lImits of proprietary jurladiction of any Federal, stato, or local govemnment or to establish the geographical scope of the rogulatory programs of government agencios. Persons Intending to ongage In activitles Involving modifications within or adjacont to wetland areas should seek the advice of approptiale lederal, state, or local agencles concerning specified agency regulatory programs and proprietary Jurisdictlons that may affect such activities.

There are no wetlands in this location

CITY OF ARCATA MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION
PROPOSED PROJECT: Arcata Ridge Trail North Project
PROJECT SUMMARY: The proposed Arcata Ridge Trail North Project consists of installation of approximately 950 línear feet of trall surfacing with all season rock/gravel, fabrication and installation of interpretive signage, and installation of trailside benches and a steel 20 foot pedestrian bridge over an adjacent Class II! drainage channel that drains an industrial area to the north.
The proposed project will connect a City owned 22 acre open space parcel to a 150 acre property where the City holds a conservation/recreation easement and then to the City's existing 622 acre Arcata Community Forest. This project not only is a standalone project but it also is part of a larger reglonal trail effort called the Arcata Ridge Trall. The entire Arcata Ridge Trail is 4.5 miles in extent and would span the City limits from north to south and be fully contalned within scenic redwood forested hillsides.
The project also Includes an 8-10 space parking area with access from West End Road within the existing road right-of-way, The parking spaces will be surfaced with packed gravel. The parking areas will be landscaped with native plants including red alder, big leaf maple and red flowering currant, The existing parking lot location is a sloping gravel fill area that is used as a road pullout. The totel area of the parking lot is 3,000 square feet with a net improvement to existing drainage conditions by directing runoff to excavated gravel/sand percolation trenches and native plants. The adjacent creek will be buffered from parking area runoff by a native plant buffer strip. The small parking area will also accommodate two (2) horse trailers.
Application Type: Approval of Mitigated Negative Declaration Location: City of Arcata APN 507-081-034 and 507-071-010 an undesignated right-of-way adjacent to West End Road:
Property Owner: City of Arcata
Applicant: City of Arcata Zoning: Undesignated right-of-way (ROW), Natural Resource (NR) and Residential Very Low Density (RVL). General Plan: Undesignated City right-of-way (ROW), Natural Resource (NR) and Residential Very Low Density (RVL). Coastal Zone: Not within the Coastal Zone. Environmental: An Initial Study and draft Mitigated Negative Declaration has been prepared for the project in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
FINDINGS:
The project proposes a Mitigated Negative Declaration per the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant to an Initial Study Report, the proposed project, as mitigated, is found to not have a significant effect on the environment and a Mitigated Negalive Declaration is adopted in conformance with the Callfornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The project is subject to revlew under the California Environmental Quality recommends a Mitigated Negative Declaration pursuant to Act (CEQA). Staff the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines for this project. A Mitigated Negatlve Declaration can be adopted for this project if it can be demonstrated that signiflcant impact would not result from the build-out of this project. Prior to making a decision on the project application, the Environmental Services Department received, analyzed, and updated the Initial Study and proposed draft Mitigated Negative Declaration, together with all written and oral comments thereon received on or before the established deadline of January 22, 2015. The Mitigated Negative Declaration adopted herein reflects the City of Arcata staff's independent judgment and analysis, such that:

1. The administrative record for the Mitigated Negative Declaration includes the Initial Study Report, the Mitigation and Monitoring Plan and the written comments received, which includes the City's responses to comments received. The Arcata Environmental Services Department located at 736 "F" Street, Arcata, is the custodian of the documents and other materials that constitute the record of proceedings upon which the Arcata City Councll decision Is based.
2. The Initial Study shows that the project could potent|ally cause significant effects on the environment, but that modifications to the project and Mitigation Measures, agreed to by the City are sufficient, in light of the whole record before the Agency, to reduce or avoid the effects or to mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur. To illustrate this Finding, the City incorporated the following mitigations:
AIR QUALITY: Air quality measures will be implemented during earth moving activities to ensure that dust and other loose materials do not impact air quality,
BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES: The project will implement minimization and avoidance measures,
bost management practices, and a mitigation and monitoring plan to protect creek resources. The proposed mitigations reduce potentia impacts to biological resources and creek and wetland habitats to less than significant.
CULTURAL RESOURCES: There is the potential for finding cultural resources on site. Mitigation measures are incorporated in the event that these resources are encountered.
NOISE: Residents within the vicinity of the project will be notified in advance of potential noise from construction activity. All noise-producing equipment will be fitted with mufflers, and the hours of heavy equipment related construction activity will be limited to 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m1. on Saturdays.

3 There is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the Agency, that the project as mitigated may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. To Illustrate this Finding, see the Initiat Study & draft Mitigated Negative Declaration & Mitigation and Monitoring Plan, In light of the whole record before the Agency, there Is no substantial evidence to require further environmental reviews or to dony this project based upon perceived non-compliance with specific development standards or policies embodied within the Arcata General Plan: 2020,
4, The Initial Study Roport is a complete and adequate informational document and the Mitigated Negative Declaration is hereby adopted.

COMMENT PERIOD; January 2, 2015 to January 22, 2015.

Hi Karen

After consultation with competent council we have determined that a letter from the City Manager would likely save the city of Arcata significant attorney fees. That letter should include:

The City agrees to a voluntary injunction of all trail construction activities related to the ridge trail between the proposed trail crossing at Fickle Hill Rd and the rail car bridge in the Sunny Brea tract of the Arcata Community forest, The City agrees to decommission and fully

disguise all indications of new trail construction including flagging in the area mentioned above until such time the City has;

A. Completed all CEQA environmental reviews

B. Obtained all required authorizations including but not limited to County encroachment and State Water Board permits.

C. Presented completed plans and received approval from all deeded water users to fence the established spring on the former Schmidhauer property and all associated domestic water facilities

D. Constructed all approved fencing around the domestic water source and facilities mentioned above.

Thank you and we look forward to your reply

Hi Karen,

The PRA response we received 2/11/2019 confirms there is no provided record of project approval for the segment of trail in question (Fickle Hill Rd into the Sunny Brea tract of the Arcata Community Forest) related to the Notice of Exemption flled with the County Clerk August last year. There are numerous and significant inconsistencies contained in documents provided by the City of Arcata that would need to be addressed prior to any legitimate approval. This would be best done through the CEQA process.
We can either proceed with an immediate appeal of the NOE or the City Manager can issue a voluntary injunction for the project and conduct a withdrawal of the original NOE. Please advise as to how you would like to proceed in your written response by the end of business Feb 14, 2019. We would also appreciate a full response to the letter sent to your office Jan 17 2019 by weeks end.
Thank you very much

Karen,
Thank you for your reply however you have not yet addressed the required CEQA process nor the other significant issues related to the hastily submitted Notice of Exemption. All of the suggestions you provided in this email and the
concerns we have made clear can be vetted through the CEQA process once the NOE is invalidated. It is evident with the lack of an approved Plan or detailed information you reference that sufficient data has not been gathered to support a NOE. As mentioned to you at the site visit the slope of ground exceeds 10% and the presence of a domestic water
source/supply (not even mentioned in the NOE) disqualify the project for an NOE.
As communicated previously you as City Manager have the choice to voluntarily revoke the NOE or we can do that for
you. It would probably be in the City's best interest to revoke it themselves for obvious reasons. Please indicate if that is the course you will be taking by the end of business Thursday Feb 14.

Thank you

Uri,
Thank you for taking the time to review the trail possibilities and constraints as the City works to connect the Ridge trail from Sunny Brae to West End Road. It was very helpful to see it site in person and to hear your concerns directly. I have followed up with staff and would like to provide an update of how think we should proceed based on our meeting and the concerns that you raised,
The City has made good progress in developing base map that includes both survey data and cross referenced deed review for the water structures associated with the private water
system
Engineering staff have been on site and are currently working on road crossing designs to share with the neighbors and submit to the County.
I would like to have Brian Kang meet with you and whoever else has knowledge of the water system and make sure that we GPS in the water system components (some of which you pointed out) based on your knowledge. We will overlay these points with the developed base map to see if there are any discrepancies. If there are, proposed follow up meeting with you (and potentially other neighbors) and myself to discuss. If there are not we can finalize the trail design and map to share at a neighborhood meeting.

From what I have seen this week, I believe there is an alignment that will work to achieve our collective goals. I will have Brian Kang reach out to schedule a time.

Good Morning Karen,

The reason CEQA is in place is to have a vetting process that allows impacts and potential impacts to be reviewed and
mitigated.
What do you see is the process for this project to have transparent review without CEQA?

Hi Karen,

It would be helpful for you to clarify why extensive trail construction was directed by city staff when as you point out, a concept design has yet to be completed. While there are several legal issues that will need to be addressed there are
management issues that you seem to be avoiding.
It is important that all trail building in this area be completely decommissioned until such time the Planning Process is finalized. Much of the trail construction that has taken place under City staff direction has been done within the 100 foot buffers of a known domestic water supply. Those buffers are described in the citles own stream side management plan as you know. Significant ground disturbance conducted under City staff direction has occurred within a few feet of a domestic water source with no erosion control measures in place. We inspected that location on Friday March 9 and found that to remain the case even though the ground disturbance occurred late December last year. Nearly three months ago. The steepness of the areas terrain (approx 30 degree slope) is also a concern particularly during such heavy rains as we have been experiencing this winter.
It would appear that the City's un permitted driveway construction and encroachment onto the County road is also within the 100 foot buffer of the spring complex. The Counties Public Works Director has indicated that will need to be addressed during the application process which as we understand has not even been initiated despite the public and the City's continued use of that constructed access.
We have expressed many times that we would prefer to not take legal action but you as City Manager have failed to outline what the Planning Process is for this proposed project or how past violations will be corrected. Sending such a vague email (February 13) has not instilled confidence that this situation is being adequately addressed by your office.

Regards,

Uri

Air Photo Evaluation:
We reviewed the available aerial photos in our files dated from 1941 to 2000 to evaluate the past land use history relating and local slope stability.
1941 The aerial photographs show the THP area densely forested in large mature trees, suggesting this area might have been first harvested during the early 1900s or late 1800s. The variable height of the trees suggests

William E. Snyder November 27, 2006
THP 1-06-164 HUM Page 3
that the early harvesting occurred over several decades. Scattered trees that were significantly taller than the rest of the stand suggest that some of the old growth trees may have remained into the 1940s.
We observed a linear gap in the tree cover that corresponds with an unidentified dormant landslide mapped by SHN (2001a) near the southwest corner of the property (see Figures 1 and 2). This feature was approximately 400 feet long, 100 feet wide and covered with a dense growth of alders. Alder appeared to dominate the riparian zones of the two main forks of Beith Creek that lie within the Plan. We did not observe evidence of
roads in the property.
1948 The 1948 photographs show that most of the Grotzman Creek watershed had been clearcut and was re- vegetating. Occasional scattered conifers occupied brush-covered slopes.
1954 The Sunny Brae subdivision appears to have been recently completed and the initial grading for the
northeast end of Beverly Drive appears to be underway. Advanced regeneration and dense brush is visible in
the former clearcut area within the Grotzman Creek watershed. No significant operations were noted in the Plan area. A vegetated slide scar is visible as a 50-foot wide, 150-foot long gap in the tree cover approximately 300-350 feet south of Grotzman Creek along the western Plan boundary.
1962 The 1962 photos show that much of the THP area had been harvested sometime after 1954. Only the southwest ¼ section appeared not to have been entered. Operations appeared to have concentrated on the slopes above the roadway. Scattered trees and dense brush remained throughout the THP area. Faint lineaments in the brush indicate the presence of an extensive network of skid trails. The main access road into the lower part of the THP from Fickle Hill Road was present and several landings are visible along its length (see Figure 1). This road traversed the hillsides to the northwest and entered the Plan midway along the western border. A no-cut zone around an RPF-mapped unstable area corresponds with the location of a landing within the East Fork of Grotzman Creek. The 1954 slide scar along the access road south of this landing is not readily visible even though the area was clearcut. We did not observe this feature in the field, nor was obvious in subsequent years of aerial photographs.
Road Point 1100 of this plan appears to be situated on steep ground where the road crosses the head scarp of
a possible rotational landslide scar visible on these photos. The scar has subdued morphology and is
approximately 400 feet long and 200 feet wide. The interior of the feature is relatively uniform with a subtle break in slope below the road. Whatever slide mass may have existed appears to have been largely eroded. The road continued east and south from this point while climbing uphill and crossed two unnamed Beith Creek tributaries at road points 2750 and 3050. The road extends several hundred feet beyond the southern margin of the Plan and ties into another skid trail system.
1965 Additional road construction associated with residential development was observed in the 1965 photographs in the area between the northeast perimeter of the THP and Fickle Hill Road.
1981 Most of the lower access road constructed between 1954 and 1962 between the Plan and Fickle Hill
Road is not readily visible in the photos and is overgrown with dense vegetation. There is a single oblong pond situated on a broad flat where two are presently mapped. It appears to have been built approximately 10 years earlier based on the level of vegetation and a structure is situated nearby to the northeast. The existing "workshop" and another residence appear to be under construction to the southeast. The three houses shown
immediately beyond the north and east margins of the Plan are visible as are the remaining access roads
shown in the Plan.
1984-1988 Vegetation is growing into the central portion of the pond and only the roads accessing the residences and the workshop appear to be open to traffic.
1996-2000 The plan area appears to have been under a light selection harvest within the past few years in the 1996 aerial photographs and a network of overgrown skid trails is visible in those photos. The two residences on the flat near the pond are gone and the pond itself appears to be heavily overgrown. Steady re-vegetation is continuing. Two localized stands of alders are located in the areas of the old Grotzman Creek landing and debris slide scar seen in the 1954 aerial photographs indicating high ground water conditions and possible
slope movement.

Geologic Conditions: Page 4

Geologic mapping by Kelley (1984) shows the THP area to be predominantly underlain by melange in the Central Belt of the Franciscan Complex. The Quaternary-aged Falor Formation is mapped underlying the southwest portion of the THP. A thrust fault associated with the Fickle Hill Fault Zone is shown as the contact between the two units. We noted a topographic lineament in the aerial photographs that closely matches the mapped fault. This feature passes through a saddle west of the plan and Is seen as a break in slope along the southwest corner (see Figure 1). Most of the landslides identified in this and the prior plan to the west (SHN, 2001; this Memorandum) occurred on the steep ground below the break in slope.
We observed what appeared to be in-place fine silty and clayey sand in road and skid trail cut slopes and channels bottoms above the break in slope (see Figure 1) that resembled Falor Formation (Qf) bedrock we have seen elsewhere in the region. However, the slopes below the break in slope were observed to be steep, rocky and underlain by dense, fractured sandstone/greywacke similar to that observed elsewhere within the Franciscan complex (KJf). The break in slope is consistent with the observed presence of relatively soft materials (Falor) atop dense materials (Franciscan complex sandstone). We did not observe evidence of mélange on the portions of the property we visited. Erosional outliers of Falor Formation are mapped in the region immediately north and northwest of the Plan along Fickle Hill, so the materials observed probably represent an unidentified exposure.
Kelley describes mélange of the Franciscan complex as a sheared argillaceous matrix containing individual blocks of graywacke, sandstone, mudstone, conglomerate, chert and serpentinite. The Falor Formation is described as fluvial and shallow water marine sediments consisting of conglomerate, sandstone and silt.
Kelley has also mapped a zone of disrupted ground underlying the southeast corner of the THP and this extends to areas south of the THP. No other geomorphic features related to landsliding were mapped within or adjacent to the THP. During the PHI we evaluated portions of the mapped area of disrupted ground. Based on our reconnaissance, this area is characterized by a higher drainage density and slightly steeper ground. We did not observe evidence of significant mass wasting in this area on the ground or in the historic aerial
photographs.
Prior work: Geologic reports were prepared for a timber harvest plan (THP 1-00-234 HUM) for the adjacent property west and south (SHN, 2000, 2001a, b) of this THP, CGS attended preharvest inspections for this project and prepared three memoranda (Marshall, 2000, 2001a, b). Several small unstable areas were identified near the Plan in the geologic report (SHN, 2000) and three of these landslides are mapped extending slightly into this THP (see Figure 2).
The RPF has mapped two unstable areas at the perimeter of the THP (northwest corner of the THP and along the south property line). During our site visit, we confirmed the presence of these and the SHN slides and identified an additional one.

Review Team Questions: (to be answered by the geologist).
5. Please evaluate the partially failed seasonal road at station +1100'. Is any additional stabilization work
appropriate [ref. Road Reconstruction at the top of page 2212
We evaluated this in the field during the site visit. Please see Site Specific Recommendations for this Point
following.

General Observations:
1. The property already contains a well-located skid trail system that the RPF plans to re-use during the Plan. Little, if any new construction will be needed. We did not observe significant erosion problems associated with the skid trail system in the aerial photographs or during the site visit.
2. Although there are a number of relatively small landslides mapped on the property, they do not appear to be recently active based on the level of vegetation and presence of mature trees growing within them. The property appears to have been relatively stable throughout the aerial photograph record.

William E. Snyder November 27, 2006
THP 1-06-164 HUM
Site Specific Observations: (keyed to Site Map, Figure 2) Page 5

RPF-1: This slide was mapped by the RPF and is approximately 100 feet wide and 150 feet long. It is populated with a dense cover of mature alders and brush. An old truck road crosses the unit surface and this area corresponds with the location of a landing seen in the 1962 aerial photographs. The RPF has designated this as a potentially unstable area and no-harvest zone based on the presence of a split stump within it.
Point CGS-1: This is an oblong patch of alders approximately 100 feet wide and 200 feet long in a broad swale. The feature was first noted in the 1954 aerial photographs and resembled a vegetated slide scar. This area was relatively bare of vegetation in the 1962 aerial photographs and the haul road visible at that time passed directly through this area. We did not observe evidence of a slide in the aerial photographs or on the ground when we traversed this area. The presence of alders may be related to high ground water rather than
mass wasting.
Road Point +1100: This site is located on the old haul road as it crosses the upper centerline of a broad, subdued bowl-shaped depression visible in the 1962 aerial photographs. The RPF describes Point 1100 as an old fill failure involving the outer 1/3 of the 1962 vintage roadway (3-5 feet) and we concur. The failed section extends approximately 30-40 feet and the remainder of the roadway on elther side appears to be intact.
Several feet of talus have collected at the toe of the cut slope since initial use.
The surrounding feature is approximately 200 feet wide and 400 feet long. Slopes within the feature are relatively uniform. If this is an old landslide, the remaining slide mass appears to be largely eroded. Although the road north of 1100 is shown as a roadway, only tractors will use this portion per the RPF. Given the planned operations, the RPF could end the road at +1100 and re-classify the remaining section to the north as a designated skid trail. Approximately 12 feet maximum width would be needed for safe access and this can be achieved by clearing the accumulated talus from the toe of the cut slope.
SHN Point G3: This is a slide not shown on the Plan maps. SHN (2001a) describes this feature as an old debris slide with a steep (100%) swale at the head. As mapped, it is approximately 100 feet wide and 400 feet long. The head of the slide extends into the Plan and we confirmed this while walking the west property line. SHN identified old-growth stumps in the upper portions of the swale and we observed these also. Given the in- place stumps, SHN indicated that the initial harvest did not appear to have triggered the feature. No evidence of recent activity was observed during the PHI. Mature redwoods (~12-18 inch diameter) now occupy the
slope.
Point CGS-2: This is a vegetated debris slide scar not shown in the Plan and was first seen as a vegetated gap in the trees in the 1948 aerial photographs. The feature is 70-80 feet wide and approximately 150-200 feet long. The head of the slide is very steep (~150%) and rocky. Sandstone boulders up to 3 feet in diameter were common in the underbrush at the head. The feature appears to end at an old road beyond the plan boundary (see Figure 2).
SHN Point G4: this feature was first seen as a gap in the trees in the 1948 aerial photographs. SHN described this a as a dormant debris slide chute in a broad swale. A skid trail crossing the slide scar appeared to be intact and we did not observe evidence of recent activity. The head of the feature was mapped as extending approximately 100 feet into the Plan and we confirmed this, but it was not shown on the Plan maps. The feature appears to end at an old road beyond the plan boundary (see Figure 2).
SHN Point G5: This slide corresponds with the RPF's mapped unstable area on the south property line. This area is designated as a no harvest zone and this proposal is appropriate. The feature appears to end at an old road beyond the plan boundary (see Figure 2).
CGS-3: This is a topographic lineament observed in the historic aerial photographs. It is best seen on the ground as a distinct break in slope along the nose of the ridge dominating the southwest portion of the Plan. It appears to pass through a well-defined saddle approximately 500 feet west of the Plan. As discussed earlier, most of the mapped landslides in the Plan occur on the steep rocky ground below this feature.

General Recommendations: None.

Site Specific Recommendations: (keyed to Site Map, Figure 2)
RPF-1: No recommendation.
Point CGS-1: No recommendation.

William E. Snyder November 27, 2006
THP 1-06-164 HUM Page 6 Road Point +1100: the RPF shall re-classify the remaining section of road north of Road Point +1100 as a skid trail. The accumulated talus shall be cleared from the toe of the cut slope to create a minimum width (12 feet maximum) traveling surface. Excavation into the existing cut slope (if needed) should not be greater than 5 feet.
SHN Points G3 and G4; Point CGS-2: These features shall be added to the Plan maps. Please see following recommendations for CGS-3 regarding silviculture in this part of the Plan.
SHN Point G5: No recommendation.
CGS-3: The silviculture on the slopes below the break in slope shall be changed from variable retention to selection because of the mass wasting identified in this area. This is intended to reduce the potential for further landslides and erosion in this portion of the Plan.

The Schmidbauer NTMP is located in Section 34, Township 6 North, Range 1 East, HB&M; Humboldt County, on the Arcata South USGS 7.5' quadrangle. The project area is located near the crest of a northwest running ridge with aspects from south to west. Elevation ranges from 400 to 800 feet. Slopes range from 5 to 25 percent. The timber stand is composed of a mature redwood with dense canopy cover (estimated 90%). Some fir and hardwood stand components are scattered throughout the plan area. Riparian zones adjacent to class II and III streams have higher species diversity and the stand type contains more alder, and maple tree species. Roadsides are similarly species rich. The shrub layer is open to moderately dense and composed of Vaccinium ovatum, Gaultheria shallon and Rhododendron macrophyllum. The herbaceous layer is dominated by Polystichum munitum, and Oxalis oregana in areas away from roads or creeks. Roads in the project area range from paved driveways to seasonal logging roads with skid trails and associated landings. Watercourses in the project area are class II and III streams that ultimately drain to Humboldt Bay.

Methods

Field surveys were conducted on 4 June 2008 by Mr. Nikos Najarian (botanist). A map showing survey routes is included as Attachment B. Surveys were done as an intuitive assessment of potential habitats based on personal knowledge and visible environmental features such as canopy cover, slope, soil texture, aspect, hydrologic features, and associated tree, shrub, and herbaceous plant species (if present). The survey was floristic in nature and seasonally appropriate when possible. This survey protocol is based on Guidelines for Assessing the Affects of Proposed Developments on Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Plant and Plant Communities (CDFG 2000). A list of potential sensitive species is given in Appendix A at the end of this report. This list is the result of a compilation of occurrence data from the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) and California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB). Those species in bold text were not in season during surveys; therefore, potential for occurrence was based on
assessment of habitats present. A complete list of species encountered is found in Attachment C at the end of this report.

Results

No rare or sensitive species were detected during these surveys.
No potential habitat for out of season sensitive species was detected during these surveys.
No further surveys are required for this NTMP.

Executive Order 11990-Protection Of Wetlands

SOURCE: The provisions of Executive Order 11990 of May 24, 1977, appear at 42 FR 26961, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 121, unless otherwise noted.

By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of
America, and as President of the United States of America, in furtherance of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 etseq.), in order to avoid to the extent possible the long and short term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands and to avoid direct or indirect support of new construction in wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. (a) Each agency shall provide leadership and shall take action to minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands, and to preserve and enhance the natural and beneficial values of wetlands in carrying out the agency's responsibilities for (1) acquiring, managing, and disposing of Federal lands and facilities; and (2) providing Federally undertaken, financed, or assisted construction and improvements; and (3) conducting Federal activities and programs affecting land use, including but not limited to water and related land resources planning, regulating, and licensing activities.
(b) This Order does not apply to the issuance by Federal agencies of permits, licenses, or allocations to private parties for activities involving wetlands on non-Federal property,
SEC. 2. (a) In furtherance of Section 101(b)(3) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331(b)(3)) to improve and coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs and resources to the end that the Nation may attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment without degradation and risk to health or safety, each agency, to the extent permitted by law, shall avoid
undertaking or providing assistance for new construction located in wetlands unless the head of the agency finds (1) that there is no practicable alternative to such construction, and (2) that the proposed action includes all practicable measures to minimize harm to wetlands which may result from such use. In making this finding the head of the agency may take into account economic, environmental and other pertinent factors.
(b) Each agency shall also provide opportunity for early public review of any plans or proposals for new construction in wetlands, in accordance with Section 2(b) of Executive Order No. 11514, as amended, including the development of procedures to accomplish this objective for Federal actions whose impact is not significant enough to re-quire the preparation of an environmental impact statement under Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as
amended.

SEC. 3. Any requests for new authorizations or appropriations transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget shall indicate, if an action to be proposed will be located in wetlands, whether the proposed action is in accord with this Order.
SEC. 4. When Federally-owned wetlands or portions of wetlands are proposed for lease, easement, right-of-way or disposal to non-Federal public or private parties, the Federal agency shall (a) ref- erence in the conveyance those uses that are restricted under identified Federal, State or local wetlands regulations; and (b) attach other appropriate restrictions to the uses of properties by the

grantee or purchaser and any successor, except where prohibited by law; or (c) withhold such properties from disposal.
SEC. 5. In carrying out the activities described in Section 1 of this Order, each agency shall consider factors relevant to a proposal's effect on the survival and quality of the wetlands. Among these factors are:
(a) public health, safety, and welfare, including water supply, quality, recharge and discharge; pollution; flood and storm hazards; and sediment and erosion; (b) maintenance of natural systems, including conservation and long term productivity of existing flora and fauna, species and habitat diversity and stability, hydrologic utility, fish, wildlife, timber, and food and fiber resources; and (c) other uses of wetlands in the public interest, including recreational, scientific, and cultural uses.

SEC. 6. As allowed by law, agencies shall issue or amend their existing procedures in order to comply with this Order. To the extent possible, existing processes, such as those of the Council on Environmental Quality, shall be utilized to fulfill the requirements of this Order,
[Note: Sec. 6 amended by EO 12608 of Sept. 9, 1987, 52 FR 34617, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 245]
SEC. 7. As used in this Order:
(a) The term "agency" shall have the same meaning as the term "Executive agency" in Section 105 of Title 5 of the United States Code and shall include the military departments; the directives contained in this Order, however, are meant to apply only to those agencies which perform the activities described in Section which are located in or affecting wetlands. (b) The term "new construction" shall include draining, dredging, channelizing, filling, diking, impounding, and related activities and any structures or facilities begun or authorized after the effective date of this Order.
(c) The term "wetlands" means those areas that are inundated by surface or ground water with a frequency sufficient to support and under normal circumstances does or would support prevalence of vegetative or aquatic life that requires saturated or seasonally saturated soil conditions for growth and reproduction. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas such as sloughs, potholes, wet meadows, river overflows, mud flats, and natural ponds.
SEC. 8. This Order does not apply to projects presently under construction or to projects for which all of the funds have been appropriated through Fiscal Year 1977, or to projects and programs for which a draft or final environmental impact statement will be filed prior to October 1, 1977. The provisions of Section 2 of this Order shall be implemented by each agency not later than October 1, 1977.

SEC, 9. Nothing in this Order shall apply to assistance provided for emergency work, essential to save lives and protect property and public health and safety, performed pursuant to Sections 305 and 306 of the Disaster Relief Act of 1974 (88 Stat. 148, 42 U.S.C. 5145 and 5146).
SEC. 10. To the extent the provisions of Sections 2 and 5 of this Order are applicable to projects covered by Section 104(h) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended

(88 Stat. 640, 42 U.S.C. 5304(h)), the responsibilities under those provisions may be assumed by the appropriate applicant, if the applicant has also assumed, with respect to such projects, all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended.
