VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 1. PTC brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions by the County of Riverside
(respondent and defendant or County) to approve the Toscana Village at Temescal Valley Project

4 (Project) and certify its Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Project consists of a 28-acre
retail center including a gas station, restaurants, supermarket, and 194,000 square feet of office
6 and retail space comprising 15 buildings and 1,138 parking spaces at the northwest corner of
7 Indian Truck Trail and Temescal Canyon Road in the unincorporated area of Riverside County.

8 2. The Project will result in significant environmental impacts on traffic,
9 transportation, biological concerns including wildlife corridors and other impacts without adequate
10 mitigation. The EIR fails to address significant information in its cumulative impacts analysis
€O08-ESE (1S6) : 11 with respect to reasonably probable future projects identified in the County of Riverside General
41593 WINCHESTER ROAD, EWuns 002 JOHNSON MV7 FIRM OdY 39S26 VINHO4NVO 'VIN03WE 6021 68 XOB 30LHO 1SOd 12 Plan (General Plan), including the Temescal Canyon Area Plan and Elsinore Area Plan
13 incorporated therein, one of which is under construction. In performing its cumulative impacts
14 analysis, the County simply chose to ignore all or a vast portion of these future projects by 0008-ESE (I96) 3L 15 determining, without justification, that such projects would not be built.
16 3. The County's certification of the EIR must be vacated because the record lacks
17 substantial evidence in support of the EIR's conclusions and because the EIR fails to adequately

18 describe or disclose relevant information. Also, the Project results in significant and unavoidable
19 impacts but mitigation is ineffective to reduce such impacts. Additionally, the County improperly
20 rejected reasonable alternatives that would lessen some of the Project's harmful effects.

21 4 The members of PTC and a host of others expressed these concerns and credible
22 objections about the Project and the associated environmental review conducted by the County
23 throughout the County's decision-making process. The Project's environmental review document
24 and the County's environmental review process, however, have failed to adequately address these
25| impacts. It is critical that the County do so in full compliance with applicable law before moving
26 forward with the Project.

27 5. On or about April 16, 2019, the County took various actions in finally approving
28 the Project without adequately addressing the impacts raised by PTC's members and others.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

These actions violate the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, codified at
2 section 21000, et seq., of the Public Resources Code (CEQA), and the CEQA Guidelines set forth
3 in title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15000, et seq.

5 general public, and in the public interest, to compel the County to adhere to CEQA's critical 6. As a result, PTC brings this action on own behalf and on behalf of its members, the 4

7 environment for all Californians.

73L (951) 353-800C it 15 circulated it for review between May 24, 2018 and July 9, 2018. Commenters, including
16 members of PTC, submitted detailed comments regarding severe flaws in the DEIR's analyses
17| concerning the failure to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant adverse impacts
18 on traffic and transportation; air quality; biological resources including imperiled, sensitive and
19 endangered species and habitats impacts; and the failure to consider reasonably probable future
20 projects in its cumulative impacts analysis. Commenters identified the need for re-circulation of

21 the a EIR as a result of such inadequate analyses and the document's failure to analyze a reasonable
22 range of alternatives in order to minimize the impacts from the Project's construction and
23 operation.

24 29. The Project's Final EIR was issued in December of 2018. The EIR concludes that
25 the Project will result in significant and unavoidable impacts in the areas of air quality and traffic.
26 In all other areas, the EIR claims that impacts are less-than-significant or less-than-significant with
27 mitigation imposed. At or around that same time, the County also prepared and released for
28 comment a draft Statement of Overriding Considerations outlining the overriding economic, legal,

22 37. PTC is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County violated
23 CEQA by certifying a legally deficient EIR and by approving the Project without adequate
24 environmental review. Such violations include, without limitation, the failure to identify and
25 adequately analyze Project impacts, failure to adopt adequate mitigation measures, failure to
26 adequately respond to comments on the DEIR, failure to adopt legally adequate findings, failure to
27 conduct sufficient environmental review, and failure to adopt an adequate statement of overriding
28 considerations. The County's CEQA violations include, but are not limited to, all of the following:

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

A. Failure to Identify and Adequately Analyze Project Impacts: An agency's 1

conclusions in an EIR must be supported by substantial evidence in the 2

administrative record. In each of the following respects, without exclusion or 3

limitation as to a number of others, the EIR failed to analyze the potential for the 4

Project to impact the environment: 5

. PTC is informed and believes that the Project has undergone various prior

were 6

variations by this and other applicants. The studies and other data 7

compiled from information relating to such prior Project applications 0

commencing in 2012. Such underlying data, studies and information are stale 9

and fail to consider new and additional data reasonably available to Real Party 10

in Interest and the County at the time the DEIR and EIR were prepared. 11

Despite the availability of sufficient information to consider such probable 14
0008-€9€ (I96) TEL project in the DEIR and the Final EIR, the EIR's traffic analysis failed to 15

account for this future project. 16

. The Project will needlessly result in the loss of at least 12 large, mature oak 17

trees that form an "oak woodland plant community" despite inaccurate findings 18

by the County that such is not the case. Such large, mature trees are not 19

scheduled for relocation despite the available mitigation measure to do so. Such 20

trees entail historical and cultural value, and the DEIR identifies the need to 21

"require that the project preserve the oak trees." The County's invocation of its 22

policies and regulations fail to justify the removal of the oak trees, and the 23

planting of very young, near-seedling replacement trees fail to amount to 24

adequate mitigation measures. 25

The placement of traffic signals, power poles and other improvements 26

dealing with the public right of way will fail to achieve the goals of public 27

safety, result in congestion and needless risk, and relocation or reconfiguration

10 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

h would mitigate such risk on traffic, congestion and public safety. The Project

2 fails to accommodate safety and aesthetic policy and goals to place the power
3 lines underground, which could help avoid the risks identified above and in
4 commenters' submittals. Such was required of other area applicants for
5 development including the Terramor Project, and there is no rationale for not
doing so on this Project.
7 The Project will significantly impact traffic flow and safety on Temescal
8 Canyon Road and Indian Truck Trail. The DEIR identified significant impact to
the on- and off-ramps but fails to consider or offer mitigation measures or
10 recommend how to deal with the impact. The current alignment and number of
11 lanes for Temescal Canyon Road and the impact from this Project will result in
JOHNSON MY7 WHI- APC 12 reduced visibility, stopping and reaction time, and dangerous turns. Indian 602169 XO8 301J0 1S0d auns 'aVOU HELSSHONIM C6SIt €OOS-ESE (IS6) XY; 6892 VINHOJTIVO 'VINO3WEL 13 Truck Trail is the only freeway on- and off-ramp for the Project and surrounding

14 uses for at least 2.9 miles. The majority of customers for the gas/service station
0008-ESE (I 96) 731 15 and other on-site uses will enter the Project site by turning left off of Temescal
16 Canyon Road. The EIR's traffic study has not taken this into account, provided

17 data relating to such, or proposed measures to mitigate such traffic load. The
18 project will cause inadequate queuing distance and long traffic lines. The traffic

19 study underestimates the number of vehicle trips. There are other, numerous
20 traffic-related impacts that the EIR has failed to adequately consider or propose
21 measure to mitigate such impacts.

. 22 The EIR fails to properly analyze the Project's impacts to biological
23 species, wildlife, and sensitive habitat. Temescal Wash and its tributaries,

24 branches, feeders, side streams and creeks intersect just to the south of the
25 Project site. This critical riparian area is severely impacted by the project, and
26 critical wildlife crossing/access paths existing in such riparian areas have not

27 been discussed, nor have any protective measures been considered to preserve

28 the wildlife crossing areas, riparian land, or downstream blue-line stream.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- The Temescal Canyon Area Plan portion of the General Plan identify the

2 need to preserve the Temescal Wash and accommodate the Western Riverside

3 County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan affected thereby. Measures
u P must be taken to preserve the wash in its natural state and ensure that wildlife is
not impacted by the Project.
The cumulative impacts analysis was fatally defective in that it omitted
consideration of the reasonably probable future projects as more fully set forth
0o below.

B. Failure to Adopt Adequate Mitigation Measures: "Each public agency shall

10 mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it

11 carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so." (Pub. Resources Code,
JOHNSON MV7 WHI- APC 602169 X08 30L440 1SOd auuns 'IYOM HEISTHONIM EESIP €OOS-ESE (196) XV! • 0009-€9€ (I96) 731 6892€ VINHO!NVO 'VinoaWal 12 § 21002.1, subd. (b).) Mitigation of a project's impacts can be accomplished by
13 (1) Avoiding the impact by not taking a certain action or parts of the action; (2)

14 Minimizing impacts by limiting an activity; repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring
15 the affected environment; (3) Reducing or eliminating an impact over time
16 through preservation and maintenance operations; or (4) Compensating for an

17 impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments, including

18 the payment of fees to provide mitigation for an impact identified in an EIR. (14

19 Cal. Code Regs., § 15370.) Substantial evidence in the record reflects that the

20 County failed to adopt adequate mitigation measures with respect to each of the
21 impacts set forth above and elsewhere in this Petition. The County failed to

22 consider, discuss, or adopt adequate mitigation measures to minimize the

23 Project's significant and detrimental impacts, or otherwise improperly deferred
24 mitigation necessary to minimize the Project's impacts. (Pub. Res. Code, §
25 21002.1, subd. (b); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15021, subd. (a)(I),
26 and 15126.4.) For example, and without limitation, the County failed to require
27 dedication of all land and appropriate monetary contribution by the applicant of
28 the costs necessary for the full General Plan buildout of Temescal Canyon Road,

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

requiring that other future applicants bear such expense. In addition, the EIR -
fails to adopt adequate mitigation measures to adder the Project's traffic impacts 2

and impacts to air quality and public health. The EIR fails to adopt adequate 3

mitigation measures to address the Project's significant impacts to wildlife and
5 biological species.

C. Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments on the DEIR: The Final EIR fails

to adequately respond to comments regarding the Draft EIR's failure to evaluate 7

the Project's impacts as indicated herein, without limitation, pursuant to CEQA. 8

(Pub. Res. Code, § 21100, subd. (b)(5).)
Failure to Adopt Legally Adequate Findings and Adequate Statement of 10 D.

Overriding Considerations: The County failed to base its findings, including the 11

findings made in its Statement of Overriding Considerations, on substantial 12
602 | 68 XO8 30LL0 1SOd OdY WHIH MV7 JOHNSON zwuns *IVOU HEISSHONIM E6SIT COOS-ESE (I96) XY! 0008-€S€ (IS6) 731 evidence, defined as "fact[s], [ ] reasonable assumption[s] predicated upon 13 VINHOJTIVO "VIN03WEI fact[s], or expert opinion supported by fact [which] is not argument, speculation, 14

16 erroneous, or evidence of social or economic impacts that do not contribute to,
or are not caused by, physical impacts on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code, § 17

21080, subd. (e); CEQA Guidelines § 15384.) A number of critical findings are 18

19 based on stale, out-of-date and inaccurate data originating from studies and data
created during prior permutations or variations of the Project dating from 2012 20

or 2013. Such findings are reported as "updated," but in fact the data and 21

information are identical to that generated in 2012 or 2013 and is not, in fact, 22

updated to reflect the conditions occurring in 2017 or 2018. 23

24 E. Failure to Conduct Sufficient Environmental Review: In addition to the impacts

25 for which the County failed to conduct sufficient environmental review as set
forth above, paragraph Nos. 38-44, below, detail the County's failure to conduct 26

a proper cumulative impacts analysis for the Project. An EIR must discuss 27

significant cumulative impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130, subd. (a).) 28

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

38. Prior to Project approval, members of PTC and others submitted evidence and
2 otherwise appeared before the County objecting to its lack of consideration of the full scope of the
3 Terramor Project and the entire Serrano Project in the EIR's cumulative impacts analysis. The

4 County's responses reflected that it completely disregarded the Serrano Project and only
5 marginally considered the Terramor Project.

POST OFFICE BOX 89 1209 ooz auns OVOU HEULSSHONIM €6SIT €OOS-CSE (1 S6) XV4 • 0009-€SS (I S6) 73L 41. The County's 2016 General Plan Update includes a discussion of the Serrano
14 Project and the Terramor Project and their respective importance to the County and the region. It 13

15 is an abuse of discretion for the County to claim that all or any portion of such projects may be
16 excluded from the County's cumulative impacts analysis.

17 42. No part of the Serrano Project was included in the EIR's cumulative impacts
18 analysis, including the traffic resulting from the improvement of 489 acres of commercial and
19 light industrial projects and the construction and occupancy of such projects with thousands of
20 employees. About half of the approved residential units including the resulting traffic from such
21 units was disregarded by the County in the EIR's cumulative impacts analysis. None of such
22  excluded portion of such projects was included in the traffic analyses or otherwise considered in
23 the EIR.

24 43. The members of PTC submitted writings and appeared prior to the final approval of
25 the Project to contest the County's failure to consider cumulative impacts. Agencies have a "need
26 for regional environmental consideration at the earliest stage of a planned development before it
27 gains irreversible momentum." (Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263,
28 284, fn. 28 (*Bozung"). Reasonably probable future projects that are anticipated "beyond the near

14

future" should be included in an agency's cumulative effects analysis. (Citizens Assn. for Sensible
Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 168, quoting Bozung
at p. 284.) Projects that have devoted significant time and financial resources to prepare for
4 regulatory review should be considered as "probable future projects" for purposes of cumulative
impact. (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1127-1128.) Projects listed in
6 a "summary of projections contained in an adopted [general] plan, or related planning document,

7 that describes or evaluates conditions contributing to the cumulative effect" or "in an adopted or
8 certified prior environmental document for such a plan" are properly considered as "probable
future projects" for purposes of a CEQA cumulative impact analysis. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs., §
10 15130, subd. (b)(1)(A)-(B).) Previously approved land use documents including general plans and
11 specific plans may be used in the cumulative impact analysis. (Id., subd. (d).)

Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure states, in subdivision (a): A writ of

19 compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an
20 office, trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or
21 office to which the party is entitled, and from which the party is unlawfully precluded by that
22 inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person." PTC is informed and believes and thereon alleges
23 that the Project fails to adhere to the requirements of and is inconsistent with the General Plan,
24 which requires a width and configuration for Temescal Canyon Road for which Project approvals
25 have not required Real Party's dedication of right-of-way or contribution as to the applicant's full
26 and fair contribution, which is a violation of County ordinance, regulation or law. Such violation
27 would require other applicants for future project approval to bear such expense of acquiring right-
28 of-way and paying for road widening and other costs and expenses without requiring the

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

contribution of Real Party Speedway. This constitutes an unfair and inappropriate deferral of the
2 costs of right-of-way acquisition and improvement to future developers in further violation of
3 applicable law. Consistency with the General Plan is required by the Project approvals including

5 contributions and to further compel that the Project conform in all respects to the General Plan and 4 the EIR. A.clear and present duty exists to compel the County to require such dedications and

6 the County's ordinances, regulations and laws.

7 46. The County, therefore, violated its duties to comply with CEQA and the CEQA
8 Guidelines. Accordingly, the EIR and Project approvals must be set aside. PTC asks this Court
