9. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on

2 Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. The Notice of Commencement

3 of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

4 10. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General

5 not more than ten days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

11. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
9 Section 21168 or 21 168.5, as applicable; Government Code Sections 54960.1 and 65751; and Code of
10 Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq. and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
11 12. Petitioner has satisfied each and every exhaustion-of-remedies requirement that must
12 be satisfied in order to maintain this lawsuit. In particular:
13 A. The violations of law challenged in this lawsuit were identified for Respondents
14 orally or in writing by Petitioner or another person (if not both) prior to the close of the public hearing
15 on the Project, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21177(a).
16 B. Petitioner objected to the Project's approval prior to the close of the public
17 hearing on the Project, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21177(b); and at least one of
18 Petitioner's members objected if Petitioner was formed after the Project's approval, as required by
19 Public Resources Code Section 21177(c).
20 C. Any and all available appeals of the Project's approval were pursued, and
21 Respondents' approval of the Project is now final.
22 13. Alternatively and additionally, Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis
23 alleges that neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies
24 requirement under may be applied to Petitioner.
25 14. Respondents' conduct in approving the Project and purporting to comply with CEQA
26 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, they failed to proceed
27 in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

15. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since its

2 members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondents'
violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondents' approval of the Project also rests on the failure to
satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those laws. Even when Respondents
are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects under those laws, they

6 remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a
manner consistent with those laws. Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability

8 to approve the Project within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Respondents
9 have failed and refuse to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner
is 10 that is not consistent with those laws.

11 16. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all their legal
12 dutics, as alleged in this pleading.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:
14 Failure to Certify Adequate Environmental Impact Report (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
15 17. Paragraphs 1 through 16 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
16 18. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze the
17 significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due consideration to both short-
18 term and long-term impacts, providing decision-makers with enough information to enable them to
19 make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely consequences of their actions, and
20 providing members of the public with enough information to participate meaningfully in the
21 environmental-review and project-approval process. CEQA also requires that every environmental
22 impact report identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to a proposed project. CEQA
23 further requires that every environmental impact report identify and analyze all reasonable mitigation
24 measures for a proposed project's significant adverse environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA
25 mandates that the analyses contained in an environmental impact report and all decisions of the lead
26 agency based on the report be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

27 19. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis of the significant
28 adverse environmental impacts of the Project, including but not limited to the following: (i)

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

inconsistencies between the Project and the applicable land-use plans and zoning ordinances; (ii) traffic
and circulation; (üt) air quality; (iv) water quality; (v) greenhouse gas emissions; (vi) noise; (vii) light

3 and glare; (viif) growth-inducing impacts; and (ix) cumulative impacts. Further, neither the analysis
of impacts in the Project's EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported
by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

6 20. Additionally and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification
7 and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project, Further, neither the analysis of

8 alternatives in the EIR nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by

9 substantial evidence in the administrative record.

10 21. Additionally and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification

11 and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts and fails
12 to eliminate or substantially reduce all such impacts. Furthor, neither the analysis of mitigation
13 measures nor Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported by substantial evidence
14 in the administrative record.

15 22. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that
16 Petitioner, the public, and the decision-makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about
17 the impacts of, mitigation measures for, and alternatives to the Project prior to its approval,
18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION:
19 Failure to Make Adequate Written Findings Regarding Project's Significant Impacts (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
20 23. Paragraphs 1 through 22 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
21 24. CEQA requires every lead agency to identify all adverse environmental impacts of a
22 proposed project that will be significant and determine whether such impacts can be avoided or
23 mitigated. With respect to any such impacts that cannot feasibly be avoided or mitigated, the lead
24 agency must make at least one written finding that there are specific overriding economic, legal, social,
25 technological, or other benefits of the proposed project that outweigh the impacts.
26 25. Respondents approved the Project based on one or more written findings that there exist
27 considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, but there is not
28 substantial evidence in the administrative record to support all such findings. Additionally and

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page

alternatively, Respondents approved the Project based on one or more non-written findings that such

2 considerations exist. Respondents also failed to make all required written findings regarding the
Project's impacts.
26. a As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that
Petitioner and the public will have to endure significant, avoidable, unmitigated adverse environmental
impacts without there being any (or there being insufficient) benefits to outweigh such impacts.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION:

8 Failure to Respond Adequately to Comments on Environmental Impact Report (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

0 27. Paragraphs 1 through 26 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
10 28. CEQA requires every lead agency to provide a good-faith, reasoned analysis in response
11 to comments received on an environmental impact report, to address recommendations and objections
12 in detail, and to explain why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted.
13 29. Petitioner and others commented on, made recommendations about, and objected to the
14 Project and the EIR throughout the process leading up to Respondents' certification of the EIR and
15 approval of the Project.
16 30. Respondents failed to respond adequately to the comments, recommendations, and
17 objections made by Petitioner and others with regard to the Project, the sufficiency of the EIR, and the
18 overall process for considering whether the Project should be approved. Respondents also failed to
19 provide written responses to public agencies on comments made by them with respect to the EIR at
20 least 10 days prior to certification of the EIR.
21 31. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in that
22 Petitioner, the public, and the decision-makers who approved the Project were not fully informed about
23 the impacts of the Project prior to the EIR's certification and about Respondents' reasons for rejecting
24 the various comments, recommendations, and objections.

25 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: Violation of the Planning and Zoning Law 26 (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
27 32. Paragraphs 1 through 31 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 6

P 33. The Project was approved by Respondents without a finding by their legislative body
2 that the Project is consistent with the applicable general plan and other planning policics as required
3 by the Planning and Zoning Law ("PZL"). Alternatively, Respondents made the requisite finding, but

4 it was not supported by sufficient evidence in the record.
34. In approving the Project, Respondents were legally obligated to make the finding and
to support it with sufficient evidence in the record.
35. Petitioner, its members, and other members of the public have been harmed as a result

8 of Respondents' violations of the PZL because they have been denied the benefits and protections
9 provided by compliance with the statutory scheme.
10 Prayer

11 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against
12 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest (and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in
13 this lawsuit):
14 4 A. On the First, Second, and Third Causes of Action:
15 1. A judgment determining or declaring that Respondents failed to comply fully
16 with CEQA as it relates to the Project and that the EIR's certification was illegal in at least some
17 respèct, rendering the EIR null and void;
18 2. A judgment determining or declaring that Respondents failed to comply fully
19 with CEQA as it relates to the Project and that its approval (including all associated entitlements) was
20 illegal in at least some respect, rendering the approval null and void;
21 3. A judgment determining or declaring that Respondents must prepare an
22 environmental impact report and certify it fully in accordance with CEQA before final approval of the
23 Project may be granted;
24 4. Injunctive relief prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in Interest (and any
25 and all persons acting at the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from
26 taking any action on any aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until
27 Respondents comply with all applicable provisions of CEQA, as determined by the Court; and
28

with the PZL as it relates to the Project and that its approval (including all associated entitlements) was

8 the PZL Act before final approval of the Project may be granted;
