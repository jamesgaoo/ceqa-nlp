Plaintiff//Petitioner,
14 VS. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT
15 STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL OF MANDATE UNDER THE BOARD, and DOES 1-10, CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL 16
Respondents/Defendants QUALITY ACT

19 I. INTRODUCTION

20 1. This action challenges a landscape-level regulatory action, the adoption of certain
21 amendments (the "Project" or "Plan Amendments") to a water quality control plan, by the State Waten
22 Resources Control Board (the "Water Board"). The underlying water quality control plan, known as
23 the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary
24 (*Bay-Delta Plan"), is adopted pursuant to a water quality law - the Porter-Cologne Water Quality
25 Control Act (Wat. Code, ยง 13000 et seq.) (*Porter-Cologne"), but the Project would have far-reaching
26 environmental impacts to the agricultural landscape in the Central Valley through its expected
27 constraints on the exercise of long-standing water rights. These environmental impacts will be
28 enormous, and were insufficiently analyzed, insufficiently avoided, and insufficiently mitigated

through either feasible alternative actions or appropriate mitigation measures in the Substitute

2 Environmental Document (the "Final SED") which was adopted alongside the Project, and which
purported to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resourcesl
Code, ยง 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA") and its implementing regulations (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ยง 15000
5 et seq.) (hereinafter "CEQA Guidelines") for environmental review prior to government action.
6 2. Petitioner California Farm Bureau Federation (*Farm Bureau") represents farmers and
7 ranchers throughout the State of California, including members that will be directly and indirectly
affected by the Project. Farm Bureau and Farm Bureau members, along with many other concerned
members of the public, participated directly and extensively in the process of environmental review
10 and public comment that led to the adoption of the Final SED and the Project, raising concerns related
11 to water use and agricultural lands. The Water Board failed to adequately address these concerns in
12 the Final SED, resulting in a legally inadequate Final SED and therefore a flawed Project approval.
13 3. The fundamental failure of the Final SED is that it does not sufficiently analyze the
14 consequences following from the imposition of instream flow standards in the three main tributaries to
15 the San Joaquin River that are identified in the Final SED - the Tuolumne, Stanislaus and Merced
16 Rivers. That flaw results in an insufficient analysis of direct, indirect and cumulative effects to
17 groundwater and agricultural resources.
18 4. As surface water users default to groundwater use for agricultural production, this
19 alternative source of supply is simultaneously coming under regulatory constraint by the passage of the
20 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 (Wat. Code, ยง 10720 et seq.) ("SGMA"), a fact
21 which was not sufficiently considered. In addition, the Final SED fails to properly address probable
22 long-term, cumulative effects of chronic water shortages, particularly in dry and sequential drought
23 years. The result is an environmental document which misrepresents critical aspects of the
24 environmental impacts associated with lost agricultural production.
25 5. As such, the Water Board's consideration and subsequent adoption of the Plan
26 Amendments was without a legally sufficient review of the environmental consequences of its action.
27 The Project will ultimately affect four groundwater subbasins and hundreds of thousands of acres of
28

- 2 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 California's most productive farmland, with significant environmental, economic, and social impacts.
2 This is being done in pursuit of questionable fisheries benefits under a theory of "unimpaired flows"

3 being imposed under a water quality law.

4 6. This action arises, and Farm Bureau asks the Court to declare the Water Board's

5 approval of the Project invalid and void, to vacate and set aside the Water Board's adoption of Finall
6 SED and Project, and to stay any implementation of the Project.
7 II. PARTIES

8 A. Plaintiff and Petitioner

9 7. Farm Bureau is a non-governmental, non-profit, voluntary membership California
10 corporation whose purpose is to protect and promote agricultural interests throughout the state of
11 California and to find solutions to the problems of the farm, the farm home, and the rural community.
12 Farm Bureau is California's largest farm organization, comprised of 53 county Farm Bureaus currently
13 representing approximately 36,000 agricultural, associate, and collegiate members in 56 counties.
14 Farm Bureau strives to protect and improve the ability of farmers and ranchers engaged in production
15 agriculture to provide a reliable supply of food and fiber through responsible stewardship of
16 California's resources.

17 8. Farm Bureau and many of its approximately 36,000 members throughout California will
18 be directly, indirectly, substantially, and irreparably harmed by the Water Board's actions. The Plan
19 Amendments, if implemented, will result in considerable reductions in water supply available to Farm
20 Bureau's agricultural members in particular and their communities, causing Farm Bureau members to
21 suffer direct and concrete injury. Farm Bureau thus has a beneficial interest in preventing the social.
22 economic, environmental, and procedural harm that the Water Board's actions will inflict.
23 9. Farm Burcau also has a strong interest in enforcing the public duty of the Water Board
24 to comply with CEQA; the Water Board has breached an important public duty by failing to comply
25 with CEQA. Many Project-area residents, business owners, farmers, and others who are beneficially
26 interested in this action would have difficulty vindicating their own rights, and issuance of the relief
27

28

- 3 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

requested in this action will confer a significant benefit upon the general public by requiring the Waten
2 Board to comply with CEQA.
3 10. Farm Bureau has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law to redress the actual,
4 concrete, specific, imminent and irreparable harm caused by the Water Board's actions.
5 B. Respondent and Defendant
6 11. The Water Board is an agency of the State of California, constituted by and subject to
7 California law. The Water Board is the lead agency for the Plan Amendments, with responsibility for
8 complying with CEQA.
9 12. Farm Bureau is not currently aware of the true names or capacities, whether individual,
10 corporate, or otherwise, of Respondents/Defendants Does 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore Farm 1
11 Bureau sues them by such fictitious names. Farm Bureau is informed and believes, and on that basis
12 alleges, that Does 1 through 10 will have been or will be responsible in some manner for actions which
13 are alleged in this Petition. Leave of court will be asked to amend this Petition to show the true names
14 and capacities of Does through 10 and the precise nature of their relationship to the actions at issue
15 herein when the same have been ascertained.

16 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
18 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.
19 14. Venue for this action is proper in Sacramento County because Code of Civil Procedure
20 section 401, subdivision provides that actions against the State or an agency thereof may be
21 commenced and tried in the County of Sacramento.
22 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
23 15. The Water Board's adoption of the Final SED and the Plan Amendments is a final
24 agency action, being not subject to further appeal procedures at the administrative level.
25 16. Farm Bureau has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions
26 precedent to the filing of this Petition, including compliance with Public Resources Code section
27 21177, and has fully exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written and oral comments.
28

- 4-
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

17. Farm Bureau provided written comment on the Final SED at several points in the public
2 process, including letters dated March 29, 2013, March 17, 2017, and July 29, 2018.

18. Farm Bureau also appeared before the Water Board at several public hearings relating
4 to the Final SED and the Plan Amendments, including appearances on August 22, 2018, November 7,
5 2018, and December 12, 2018, making oral comments on behalf of its membership.
6 19. In addition, several constituent County Farm Bureaus and numerous individual County
7 Farm Bureau members participated in the public process before the Water Board, making numerous
8 comments on both the Final SED and the Plan Amendments orally and/or in writing.
20. All issues raised in this Petition were raised by Farm Bureau, other members of the
10 public, and/or public agencies prior to the adoption of the Final SED and the Plan Amendments.
11 21. Farm Bureau has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service
12 of notice upon the Water Board indicating its intent to commence this action. The notice and proof of
13 service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.
14 22. Farm Bureau requests preparation of the record of procecdings pursuant to Public
15 Resources Code section 21167.6(a), such request being filed concurrently herewith, and included as
16 Exhibit B.

17 23. Farm Bureau has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
18 Civil Procedure section 388 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General. A
19 copy of the letter transmitting this Petition to the California Attorney General is attached hereto as
20 Exhibit C.
21 24. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167
22 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.
23 V. STANDING
24 25. Farm Bureau has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Farm
25 Bureau and its members are directly and adversely affected by the Water Board's approval of the Final
26 SED and Plan Amendments.
27

1 VI. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE
2 26. Farm Bureau brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
3 Procedure section 1021.5 to enforce important public rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of
4 the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefit on a large class of persons within the
5 area of the Plan Amendments, as well as residents of California generally.
6 27. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make award of
7 attorneys' fees appropriate in this action, and Farm Bureau will seek an award of reasonable attorneys'
8 fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
9 VII. BACKGROUND AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
10 General Background
11 28. The Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and Merced Rivers arise in the Sierra Nevada mountains,
12 and flow downward into the Central Valley, being tributary to the San Joaquin River and the
13 Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. All three rivers support long-vested water rights, perfected and
14 beneficially used under the laws of the State of California. All three rivers are also subject to works of
15 diversion, which impound and divert waters to support a marvelously productive agricultural landscape
16 and the human economy in the region. The surface water of these three rivers is a sine qua non of this
17 landscape, rendering fertile agricultural land into a greenscape of not only crops that produce food and
18 fiber for human consumption, but also a fabric of open space and ancillary habitat.
19 29. Porter-Cologne authorizes the Water Board to develop, implement, and periodically
20 | update water quality control plans to reasonably protect beneficial uses of California's waters,l
21 including the three rivers that are the subject of the Plan Amendments. (Wat. Code, ยงยง 13170, 13240-
22 13244.) In doing so, the Water Board may set water quality objectives to protect those beneficial uses
23 and adopt an implementation plan to achieve those water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, ยงยง 13241,
24 13242.) The Bay-Delta Plan is such a plan, and it covers the beneficial uses of these rivers the
25 Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and Merced Rivers.
26 30. In or about a 2008, the Water Board initiated a review and update process for the 2006
27 Bay-Delta Plan.
28

- 6 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 31. The Water Board divided the review and update process for the Bay-Delta Plan into
2 several "phases," with the portion focused on the adoption of the updated flow standards for the Lowen
3 San Joaquin River (which are the subject of this Petition) designated as "Phase 1.33

4 32. A separate and forthcoming phase, designated as "Phase 2," tentatively targets similar

5 45-to-65 percent unimpaired flow standards for the protection of fish and wildlife on the Sacramento

6 River, its major tributaries, the remainder of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta estuary, and
7 certain East Delta tributaries, with a proposed adaptative starting point of 55 percent.

8 33. A subsequent step or phase in the Water Board's process would entail formal
adjudicatory proceedings or other regulatory action to potentially amend and condition water rights fon
10 implementation of the flow standards adopted in Phase 1 and 2.
11 34. In support of Phase 1, the Water Board issued a notice a of preparation ("NOP") on or
12 about February 13, 2009, to begin the process of environmental review under CEQA which would
13 enable adoption of the Plan Amendments.
14 35. On December 31, 2012, the Water Board released a draft a SED (the *2012 Draft SED").
15 36. On September 15, 2016, the Water Board recirculated for public review and comment
16 a revised SED (the "2016 Revised Draft SED").
17 37. On July 6, 2018, the Water Board released the proposed final SED, which included
18 proposed final Plan Amendments and written responses to comments on the draft versions of the SED
19 (the "Final SED").
20 38. The Water Board held a public hearing on August 21 and 22, 2018, and took oral
21 comments and considered the adoption of the proposed Plan Amendments and the Final SED.
22 39. The Water Board adopted the Final SED and the Plan Amendments on December 12,
23 2018 by its Resolution No. 2018-0059.
24 40. The Plan Amendments include both a narrative element and numeric objectives, as well
25 a as a program of implementation. Critically, it establishes new instream flow objectives on the Lowen
26 San Joaquin River and its three tributaries - the Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and Merced Rivers - for the
27 protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses. The core of those flow objectives is a required range of
28

- 7-
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 "unimpaired flows," being what the Water Board calls "the water production of a river basin, unaltered
2 by upstream diversions, storage, or by export or import of water to or from other watersheds." (Final
3 SED, p. ES-4.)

4 41. These "unimpaired flows" are expressed as a range of 30 to 50 percent of unimpaired
5 flow, with a starting flow of 40 percent, for the annual timeframe of February through June. As

6 proposed by the Water Board, they apply to the Tuolumne, Stanislaus, and Merced Rivers through to
7 the San Joaquin River near Vernalis, though not to the rest of the San Joaquin River watershed.

8 B. The Plan Amendments

9 42. The stated reason for the Water Board's proposed Lower San Joaquin River standards
10 is for the reasonable protection of fish and wildlife as a designated beneficial use of the Bay-Delta
11 system.
12 43. Independent estimates of the water supply impacts of Phase and Phase 2 lie in the
13 range of some 2 million acre-feet per year, representing an enormous proportion of available water
14 supplies throughout the Bay-Delta watershed and beyond. These water supplies serve both broad
15 agricultural regions and major urban areas, including some 2.7 million residents of the San Franciscol
16 Bay Area, some 23 million residents of Southern California, and the agricultural service areas
17 superintended by both the federal Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project.
18 44. The surface water supply impacts of a 40-percent unimpaired flow standard on the three
19 Lower San Joaquin River tributaries is estimated in the Final SED at 242,000 acre-feet a year on
20 average - and at 522,000 acre-feet in critically dry years. (See Final SED, App. G, Table G.2-6a p. G-
21 17; Table G.2-8 p. G-18.)
22 45. Commentors pointed to unacceptable late-season and interannual effects on instream
23 water temperatures, reservoir carryover levels, drought impacts, and other unintended effects of the
24 Water Board's unimpaired flows as presented in the 2012 Draft SED. In the wake of these comments,
25 an "iterative" modeling process was utilized for the 2016 Revised Draft SED to devise certain
26 operational constraints to approximate potential "flow shifting" from the February to June timeframe
27 to other times throughout the rest of the year. However, none of these major changes related to a new
28

- 8 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 year-round objective narrative standard were adequately analyzed and explained in the 2016 Revised
2 Draft SED circulated for public comment, but rather only in the Responses to Comments portion of the
3 July 2018 Final SED.
4 46. The effect of the Water Board's proposed February through June unimpaired flow
5 standard and proposed year-round reservoir constraints is a significant reduction in surface waten
6 formerly available to water users who have historical relied on surface water for a large proportion of
7 their supplies. This will result in a corresponding increase and reliance on groundwater pumping, and
8 more frequent and on-going water shortages, particularly in below normal, dry, and critical dry years
9 and in multi-year droughts.
10 47. Specifics of the Water Board's proposed "flow shifting" strategy for avoidance of
11 unacceptable water temperature, reservoir, and water supply effects are deferred to development in
12 consensus-based "adaptive management" process proposed as part of the Final SED's program of
13 implementation (the "Stanislaus, Tuolumne, Merced ("STM") Work Group" process).
14 48. Analyses of potential fish benefits in the Final SED included model results predicting
15 average fish population increases on the three tributaries of just over 1,000 fish a year at 40-, 50-, and
16 60-percent February through June unimpaired flows-and only modest improvements with additional
17 model runs completed for the 2016 Revised Draft and 2018 Final SEDs, with potential "flow shifting"
18 from the February through June period to late summer, fall, and mid-winter (on the order of some 500
19 to 3,000 fish per year more). (See Final SED, Chapter 19 at 19-84.)
20 49. Despite overwhelming evidence in the record that San Joaquin River Basin salmon
21 population levels are almost largely driven by factors including cyclical changes in ocean conditions,
22 a general lack of suitable habitat throughout the system, Delta predation, and specific biological
23 responses to temperature and the timing of flows at specific times of the year, the Water Board's Lower
24 San Joaquin River flow standards nonetheless focus almost entirely on varying percentages of
25 unimpaired flows.
26 50. In hearings and extensive comments on the Water Board's proposed flow standards,
27 numerous commentors highlighted so-called "non-flow" variables which limit efforts to increase and
28

- 9-
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

maintain fish populations employing unimpaired flows alone. The "non-flow" variables -including,
2 among others, the effect of non-native fish predation - call into question the effectiveness and scientific
basis of the Water Board's singular focus on various percentages of unimpaired flow. Those

4 commenters urged the Water Board to consider balanced alternatives to reduce water impacts, while at
5 the same time support native fish populations, through a combination of targeted "functional flows'

6 and various non-flow measures.

7 51. Commentors also pointed out the disparity between the de minimis fish benefits that are
8 the entire focus of the Water Board's flow standards as compared to the severe environmental, social,
9 and economic impacts of the Water Board's standards. It was in light of this fundamental disconnect
10 that many members of the public urged the Water Board to consider additional alternatives to balance
11 desired benefits for fish against the large impacts on other beneficial uses including irrigation,
12 municipal and domestic, and industrial uses of water as required under the Porter-Cologne Act (Wat.
13 Code, ยงยง 13000, 13241, 13242).
14 52. In public comments, and as part of the on-going efforts to achieve "voluntary
15 agreements" in lieu of the Water Board's proposed standards, affected irrigation districts on the Lowen
16 San Joaquin River tributaries, along with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, described and
17 proposed extensive packages of mixed "flow" and "non-flow" measures in their respective areas.
18 Those packages were based in part on the extensive studies and proposals developed in proceedings
19 before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC'') as to major dams on the Tuolumne and
20 Merced Rivers, and on extensive study and experimentation on the Stanislaus River under the 10-yean
21 Vernalis Adaptive Management Program (*VAMP"), the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Anadromous
22 Fish Restoration Program, and other local fish recovery efforts.
23 53. Despite such comments, available alternative approaches, and evidence of severe water
24 supply and environmental impacts from the Water Board's proposed unimpaired flows, the Waten
25 Board declined calls to consider alternatives other than alternatives in the Final SED which were based
26 on varying percentages of "unimpaired flows." The Water Board suggested only that water from the
27 proposed unimpaired flow standards could be treated as "blocks of water" to be "shaped" in an as-yet
28

. 10 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

undefined manner by means of the proposed consensus-based STM Work Group "adaptive
2 management" process as part of the new standards' statutorily-required program of implementation.
3 54. The affected irrigation districts and other commenters made further suggestions with
respect to potentially feasible alternatives and possible mitigation measures to reduce significant
5 impacts to water supplies, important farmland, and the regional economy, including potential "off
6 ramps" and relaxation of the Water Board's straight percentages of unimpaired flow, including late-
7 season exclusions and certain drought year adjustments. However, such potentially feasible
8 alternatives and mitigation measures were generally dismissed, or otherwise deferred to possible
9 specific treatment under the proposed STM Work Group process and in future water rights proceedings
10 or future change petitions.
11 55. Despite extensive substantive comments raising fundamental and substantive concerns
12 with the Water Board's simplistic and unbalanced "unimpaired flow" approach, the Water Board's
13 I environmental document and basic approached remained essentially unchanged, between the 2012
14 Draft SED through July 2018 Final SED.
15 56. The Water Board did not analyze feasible alternatives and mitigation measures that
16 would reduce severe impacts to water supply and agricultural resources while at the same time more
17 effectively contribute to improving fish populations through a combination of non-flow measures and
18 biologically-targeted functional flows. The impacts of the Plan Amendments will be particularly
19 significant in below normal, dry, critical years and multi-year droughts. Nonetheless, the Water Board
20 instead stuck to the same approach based on a range of differing percentages of unimpaired flows,
21 while merely dismissing as "significant and unavoidable" the severe impacts resulting from that
22 approach to surface water supplies, groundwater resources, and agricultural resources.
23 VIII. GENERAL CEQA AUTHORITIES & ALLEGATIONS
24 57. As a state agency, the Water Board is required to comply with the requirements of
25 CEQA in adopting or amending water quality control plans, including the adoption of the Plan
26 Amendments. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21000 et seq.)
27

28

- 11 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

I 58. Under CEQA, the Secretary of the Resources may certify a regulatory program of a state
2 agency without the adoption of an environmental impact report ("EIR"), so long as equivalent
3 information about environmental effects, project alternatives, and mitigation measures is contained in
4 program documents. (Pub. Resources Code, ยงยง 21080.5(a), (d)(3)(A).) The Water Board's waten
5 quality control planning program under which the Plan Amendments are undertaken -is such a
6 certified regulatory program. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15251(g).)
7 59. The Water Board prepared the Final SED to comply with CEQA and its own
8 regulations. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, ยงยง 3775, 3777.) The Final SED is required to constitute and
9 serve "as a functional equivalent of an EIR." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Comm'n
10 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 113.)
11 IX. STANDARD OF REVIEW
12 60. In an action to challenge and review an agency's decision on the grounds of non-
13 compliance with CEQA, the court's inquiry shall extend only to whether there was prejudicial abuse
14 of discretion. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21168.5.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has
15 not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by
16 substantial evidence. (Id.)
17 X. CAUSES OF ACTION
18 A. First Cause of Action - Inadequate Description of Project Environmental Setting
19 61. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
20 allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.
21 62. CEQA requires the Final SED to set forth an accurate description of the physical
22 environmental conditions existing in the vicinity of the project, in order that the public and
23 I decisionmakers may gain "an understanding of the significant effects of the project and its
24 alternatives." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15125(a).)
25 63. The Final SED's narrow environmental setting only considers environmental impacts
26 on the three affected tributaries, the Lower San Joaquin River, and the South Delta, and fails to consider
27

28

12 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

potential related impacts of the Plan Amendments and of the Water Board's larger Bay-Delta Waten
2 Plan Update within a broader environmental context. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15125(c).)
64. Implementation of the Plan Amendments and of the Water Board's larger Bay-Delta
4 Plan Update will have foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts (including, particularly,
impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources) not only within on the Lower San Joaquin River,
6 its tributaries, the South Delta and certain directly affected area of the San Francisco Bay Area, but
7 throughout Bay-Delta watershed and various water export areas south of the Delta. By narrowly
8 limiting its analysis of environmental impacts to the Lower San Joaquin River and its tributaries, the
9 South Delta, and certain water service areas of the San Francisco Bay Arca, while failing to adequately 10 consider the Project in this broader context, the Final SED ignores various potential reasonably
11 foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the affected environment.
12 65. As such, in adopting the Final SED and the Plan Amendments, the Water Board abused
13 its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
14 B. Second Cause of Action - Impermissible Segmentation of Project
15 66. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every 16 allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.
17 67. CEQA requires a single program SED for an ultimate project which is comprised of one
18 or more phases. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15165.) ยง
19 68. As described above, the Water Board divided its Bay-Delta Plan Update into severall
20 distinct "phases." For purposes of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Estuary, the Plan
21 Amendments address only three tributaries to the San Joaquin River, the Lower San Joaquin River, the
22 South Delta, and portions of San Francisco Bay Area served from the Tuolumne River watershed, 23 without any programmatic consideration of any of the potential reasonably foreseeable direct, indirect,
24 and indirect environmental impacts of the larger Bay-Delta program in the remainder of the Delta, on
25 the Sacramento River Basin, and on Delta export service areas to the south.
26 69. Pursuant to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Reform Act of 2009 (Wat. Code,
27 85000), in a 2010 Delta Flow Criteria Report, the Water Board recommended a "Sacramento River
28

13โข
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

l Inflow" criterion amounting to 75 percent of unimpaired flows from November through June, a "Delta
2 Outflow" criterion amounting to 75 percent unimpaired flow from January through June, and a "San
3 Joaquin River Inflow" criterion consisting of 60 percent of unimpaired flow from February through
4 June. (See 2010 Final SWRCB Report, "Development of Flow Criteria for the Sacramento-San
5 Joaquin Delta Ecosystem" at 131 through 133 (the "Delta Flow Report").)
6 70. In a 2017 Final Scientific Basis Report, the Water Board proposed flow standards for
7 the Sacramento River and eastside Bay-Delta tributaries in a range from 35- to 75-percent. (See 2017
8 Final SWRCB Report, "Scientific Basis Report in Support of New and Modified Requirements for
9 Inflows from the Sacramento River and its Tributaries and Eastside Tributaries to the Delta, Delta
10 Outflows, Cold Water Habitat, and Interior Delta Flows" at 1-18 and 1-19 (the "Final Scientific Basis
11 Report").)
12 71. Finally, in a July 2018 Framework for the for the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-
13 Delta Plan, the Water Board announced a refined unimpaired flow proposal for the Sacramento Riven
14 and the eastside Delta tributaries in an adaptive range of 45- to 65-percent unimpaired flow, with a
15 starting point of 55 percent. (See July 2018 Framework for the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-
16 Delta Plan at 15.)
17 72. In addition to the flow requirements in the Plan Amendments adopted in Phase 1 which
18 will affect the San Joaquin Valley region, the Water Board has planned since 2010 or earlier to take
19 similar approach in Phase 2 of its Bay-Delta Plan Update that would affect the Sacramento Valley
20 region.
21 73. Because it considers only Phase 1 of the Bay-Delta Plan Update, the Final SED
22 segments its programmatic environmental review of the entirety of the Bay-Delta Plan Update, as the
23 entire Bay-Delta Estuary is interconnected and the Water Board's Bay-Delta Plan Update represents
24 the whole of its programmatic action. In doing so, the Water Board foreclosed consideration of
25 reasonable project alternatives and failed to analyze potential foreseeable direct, indirect, and
26 cumulative impacts from Phase 2 that should have been considered during the environmental review
27 process.

1 74. By focusing on Phase 1 impacts on a small portion of the larger Bay-Delta watershed in
2 isolation from related impacts of Phase 2 and other subsequent phases, the Final SED fails to consider
3 the whole of the Water Board's Bay-Delta Plan Update at a programmatic level.
4 75. At the same time, by deferring to implementation and severing from its February
5 through June unimpaired flow standard an adequate consideration of the Water Board's separate year-
6 round narrative standard, the Final SED again segments the whole of the Water Board's proposed
7 action into multiple pieces.

8 76. CEQA requires the Water Board to disclose and analyze foreseeable environmental
9 impacts of all "phases" of the Bay-Delta Plan Update together, and to consider both a reasonable range
10 of feasible of alternatives and potential mitigation measures to reduce, minimize, or eliminate any
11 significant adverse impacts of the entire Bay-Delta Plan Update. By only considering Phase 1, the
12 Final SED improperly segments the environmental review of the Bay-Delta Plan Update.
13 77. CEQA also requires the Water Board to consider alternatives, mitigation, and potential
14 environmental impacts for both its February through June unimpaired flow standard and for the
15 separate but related year-round narrative standard it defers to program implementation.
16 78. Because it failed in to consider potential programmatic environmental impacts of the
17 Bay-Delta Plan Update in their full environmental context, and likewise failed to consider a reasonable
18 range of potential feasible alternatives and feasible mitigation in this same larger context, the Waten
19 Board therefore committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the mannen
20 required by law when it adopted the Final SED and the Plan Amendments.

1 81. Among other environmental impacts, CEQA requires analysis of significant impacts to
2 agricultural resources. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15382; see CEQA Environmental Checklist Form,
3 Appendix G, Section II.) This includes analysis of the project's potential conversion of agricultural
4 land to non-agricultural use, as well as its potential impacts to Williamson Act contracts. (Id., at Section
5 II (a), (b), (e).)

6 82. The Final SED's analysis of impacts to agricultural resources is based on a series of
7 assumptions. Errors in each step established a flawed foundation for the next step, resulting in a
8 cascade of compounding errors. The analysis for agricultural resources suffers from this inadequacy
9 because flawed analysis of the Plan Amendments' impacts to baseline surface water supplies was a
10 faulty foundation for analyzing impacts to groundwater resources. In turn, inadequate analysis of
11 impacts to groundwater resources compounded the errors of this foundation and resulted in flawedl
12 analysis of impacts to agricultural resources, both within the immediate plan area and within the larger
13 Bay-Delta watershed.
14 1. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies
15 83. The Final SED did not accurately or adequately analyze the impacts of the Plan
16 Amendments on surface water supplies, which in turn caused the Final SED to fail to adequately
17 analyze impacts of the Plan Amendments on groundwater and agricultural resources.
18

19 a. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies and Related

20 Effects within the Larger Bay-Delta Watershed and in Delta Export Areas
84.
21 The Final SED fails to adequately consider the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative

22 impacts of its immediate action, in combination with future project and actions including the Waten
Board's proposed Phase 2 standards, on surface water supplies, in turn affecting the SED's conclusions 23

24 on the extent and nature of potential impacts with respect to groundwater and agricultural resources.
Among other impacts, the Final SED fails to appropriately consider: (1) potential foresecable direct,
25
indirect, and cumulative impacts of Phase 1 and Phase 2 Plan of the Plan Amendments on Delta waten
26
exports, including water exported for agricultural use in areas of South of the Delta; (2) potentiall 27

3 potential related direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Plan Amendments on municipal water

4 and domestic supplies; and, (4) direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Plan Amendments and
larger Bay-Delta Plan Update in the context of groundwater regulation under SGMA. In addition to
6 the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the Water Board's Phase 1 flow
7 standards on the Lower San Joaquin River, the affected tributaries, and in the South Delta, all of these
8 impacts should have been analyzed within the larger Bay-Delta watershed and related water service
9 areas at at least a programmatic level of detail.
10

11 b. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supply and Deferred

12 Implementation
85.
13 The Final SED's modeling assumptions for reservoir operations in program

14 implementation, as first written into a year-round narrative standard in the 2016 Revised SED, are

15 wholly different from the February through June unimpaired flow standard actually adopted by the

16 Water Board. The claimed fish benefits and potential environmental impacts of these assumed

17 reservoir operations are substantively analyzed only in the Responses to Comments in the 2018 Final

SED.
18
86.
19 In the Final SED, carryover water, flow shifting, refill criteria, and other operational

20 assumptions arrived at through "iterative" modeling are assumed to occur in an undetermined manner,
through certain as yet
21 undefined processes in program implementation (i.e., the STM Work Group
process).
22
87.
23 The Final SED improperly defers major unknowns relating to these same operational

24 constraints to a process of trial-and-error and "iteration" in "adaptive implementation," without clear
biological goals or any enforceable numeric flow standards in the Final SED or Plan Amendments.
25
88.
26 Because details of the Water Board's program of implementation as developed in post

27 hoc "iterative" modeling are deferred, the full extent of the project's potential related impacts on

28 available surface water supplies cannot be meaningfully evaluated and are likely understated.

- 17-

2 affect the Final SED's analyses of impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources in herein
3 separately alleged.

C.
5 Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies and Drought Impacts

6 90. The Final SED fails to adequately consider the potential long-term water supply effects

7 of chronic water shortages and, especially, of recurring multi-year droughts in several respects.

8 91. The resulting analysis fails to adequately consider foreseeable, acute water supply

9 effects in below normal, dry and ritical years-and, particularly, in extended multi-year droughts.

10 92. These flaws in the Final SED's analysis of potential long-term effects surface waten

11 supplies in times of drought in turn carry over the Final SED's related analyses of groundwater and

12 agricultural resources, as elsewhere herein separately alleged.

13 d. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies and Local
14 Accretions

15 93. The Final SED fails to consider the potential surface water impacts of an on-going trend

16 toward decreasing local accretions.

17 94. During the public comment process, commentors identified that the draft SED's surface

18 water analysis failed to adequately account for observed declines in local stream accretions, likely

19 correlated to a historic trend, since the early 2000s, toward increasing system-level and on-farm water

20 efficiency. This defect is left unaddressed in the Final SED. Thus, the Final SED's final analysis of

21 potential surface water impacts fails to consider the potential significant effect of declining local

22 surface and subsurface contributions to available instream flow in certain important stream reaches.

23 95. As a result, the Final SED miscalculates the Plan Amendment's impacts on available

24 stored surface water that may be needed to compensate for the corresponding loss of local accretions.

25 96. The potential effect of this observed trend was not adequately addressed in the Final

26 SED, yet has potential significant implications for the Project's effects on available surface water,

27 groundwater, and agricultural resources.

1 e. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies - Reasonably

2 Foreseeable Methods of Compliance / Water Transfers
97.
3 An SED for a regulatory program is required to consider "reasonably foreseeable

4 methods of compliance." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21159; CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15187.)
98.
5 The Final SED fails to adequately consider the potential water supply effects on
I groundwater and agricultural resources of water transfers within the immediate Project area, and fails 6

7 to consider foreseeable long-term direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of the Plan Amendments on

8 water markets generally, throughout the Bay-Delta watershed and in Delta-dependent export service
areas to the south.

99.
10 The Final SED fails to adequately consider the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative

11 effects on groundwater and agricultural resources of reasonably foreseeable potential transfers from

12 irrigated agriculture to municipal and industrial use, both locally and in the Bay Area.
100.
13 Conversely, the Final SED fails to adequately consider the potential direct, indirect, and

14 cumulative effects on urban areas, both locally and in the Bay Area, should such transfers from irrigated
agriculture to municipal and industrial use not occur.
15
101.
16 Furthermore, the Final SED fails to adequately consider potential direct, indirect, and

17 cumulative effects of the Water Board's Phase 1 standards on water markets and long-term waten

18 supply reliability outside of immediate project area, including the Delta export areas of federal Central

19 Valley Project and State Water Project and, especially, the potential effects in droughts.
102.
20 The Final SED's failure to adequately consider foreseeable potential direct, indirect,

21 and cumulative impacts on water markets and to consider the potential impacts of water transfers-

22 both within the immediate project area and statewide throughout the Bay-Delta watershed and related

23 water service areas and in droughts-results in flawed analyses of potential related direct, indirect, and

24 cumulative adverse environmental impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources.

25 f. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Surface Water Supplies - Failure to
26 Analyze the Impacts of a 50-Percent Unimpaired Flow Standard

27 103. The Final SED further fails to adequately analyze and thus disclose to the affected public

28 the potential direct, indirect, and cumulative water resource and surface hydrology effects of a 50-

โข 19 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

percent February through June unimpaired flow standard.
2 104. Specifically, although the 2016 Revised Draft SED includes analyses of 30-, 40-percent,
3 and 60-percent February through June unimpaired flow alternatives, it does not include any direct
4 analysis to assess the potential environmental impacts of the upper 50-percent boundary of its adopted
5 30- to 50-percent, February through June unimpaired flow standard.
6 105. The water cost of a 50-percent unimpaired flow standard is significantly higher than the
7 30-percent and 40-percent standards analyzed in the Final SED, and at the same time significantly
8 lower than a 60-percent standard-as are various other characteristics of a 50-percent standard
9 necessarily distinct from the significantly lower and higher 30-, 40-, and 60-percent standards analyzed
10 in the Final SED.

11 106. Because the Final SED fails to directly and sufficiently analyze the potential
12 environmental impacts of a 50-percent unimpaired flow standard in addition to the 30-, 40-, and 60-
13 percent standard analyzed in the Final SED, the Final SED therefore fails to adequately inform the
14 public on a matter of vital interest the affected region-namely, the comparative gravity and extent of
15 various impacts at the upper threshold of the Water Board's adopted 30- to 50-percent "adaptive range.'
16 107. By failing to directly and sufficiently analyze a separate 50-percent standard, in addition
17 to the 30-, 40- and 60-percent standards considered in the Final SED, not only is the public deprived
18 of an adequate understanding of the potential water impacts of the Water Board's action, but in failing
19 to adequately assess the potential water impacts of a 50-percent standard, the public is likewise
20 deprived of an adequate understanding of the action's potential related impacts on groundwater and
21 agricultural resources.
22 g. Insufficient Public Disclosure with Respect to the Extent and Magnitude of

23 Potential Water Impacts

108.
24 In addition to numerous defects in the Final SED's analysis of potential surface water

25 impacts as the described in allegations preceding, the Final SED's core analyses and disclosures of the

26 Plan Amendments' potential surface water impacts unacceptably present and discuss the Plan

27 Amendment's potential effects on surface water deliveries in averages across different year types

28 (without clearly disclosing wide variations across and potential maximal impacts across water years)

โข 20 - Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 and in percentages of reduction below baseline diversions, without the baseline diversion identified in
2 the more readily understood metric of thousands of acre-feet per year. (See, e.g., Final SED at 5-75.)
3 In only one table (see Final SED Table 5-19b at 5-76) does the Final SED present diversion amounts
4 across a range of potential hydrologic conditions in the more common and easily grasped metric of
5 thousands of acre-feet, and then still without a clear presentation of information disclosing not only
6 total diversions across years, but also the amount of reduction in thousands of acre feet per year. The
7 SED's core analyses also make no effort to correlate these amounts of water per irrigable acre within
8 the various irrigation districts, or to translate them into any other metric that might be easily understood
9 by an affected member of the public, including a person farming and irrigating crops in the area. While
10 more detailed water impacts data is buried deep in the Final SED's many thousands of pages of
11 technical appendices and modeling results, this information is by no means readily located or
12 understood by a member of the public. Nor is it is anywhere directly or transparently translated into
13 real world terms of the potential impact on irrigators and farming operations in the region.
14 109. Because the water surface impacts data in the Final SED is poorly presented in terms
15 that are very difficult for a layperson and potential affected member of the public to understand, in this
16 respect as well the SED fails to fulfill CEQA's fundamental purpose to inform reasoned decision-
17 making and apprise the interested public of the potential significant environmental impacts of a
18 proposed project.
19 2. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Groundwater Impacts
20 110. The Final SED was insufficient in its discussion of the impact of the Plan Amendments
21 to groundwater supplies in several respects. First, the Final SED's groundwater analysis unreasonably
22 assumes available pumping infrastructure can be used to simply replace lost surface water supplies year
23 after year. The fundamental flaw in this is that it fails to consider the long-term future effect of SGMA
24 and that statute's likely restriction on groundwater pumping, at even a programmatic level of detail.
25 111. The Final SED's analyses show that the Plan Amendments cause areas that have
26 historically relied on surface water for their irrigation needs to shift toward increased reliance on
27 groundwater supplementation. (See Final SED, Master Response 8.1 at 14; App. G at G-17 through
28

- 21 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 G-19.) The Final SED's analyses also show that this results in a general shift from net positive to net
2 negative average annual groundwater recharge conditions within the affected basins. (See Final SED,
3 App. G at G-36, G-40 through G-42.) While this clearly invites a conclusion that the Final SED's
4 assumed levels of groundwater substitution are likely inconsistent with SGMA's long-term
"sustainability goal," the Final SED nonetheless persists in the assumption that loss surface can be
simply replaced by groundwater.
7 112. Faced with the conclusion that such long-term unsustainable pumping would
8 necessarily lead to significant impacts on groundwater, the Final SED responds that SGMA would
itself "mitigate" these impacts. Thus, the Final SED assumes that SGMA will likely limit the extent to
10 which the affected area may rely on increased groundwater pumping in the future, yet at the same time
11 its impact analysis essentially assumes there is no SGMA constraint.
12 113. As acknowledged by the Final SED, the effect of such artificial replacement of lost
13 surface water is that the Final SED's groundwater impacts analysis either overestimates the potential
14 impact to groundwater (by assuming there are no future limits under SGMA), or it underestimates the
15 potential impacts to agricultural resources (and to the local and regional economy) by failing to account
16 of the long-term lack of groundwater to sustainably replaced lost surface in the future. Accordingly,
17 the Final SED's failure to adequately account for the foreseeable long-term effects of SGMA skew its
18 analyses of both groundwater and agricultural resources.
19 114. Second, the Final SED fails to adequately consider and analyze potential cumulative
20 effects on groundwater effects of chronic surface water constraints across multiple year-including,
21 especially, potential exacerbated effects in dry years and recurring multi-year droughts.
22 115. Third, the Final SED fails to adequately consider the foreseeable long-term effect on
23 groundwater of reduced groundwater recharge as a result of a combination of increased agricultural
24 water efficiency and increased groundwater pumping.
25 116. Fourth, the Final SED's groundwater analysis fails to adequately consider that future
26 surface water limitations under the Plan Amendments will foreseeably impede local efforts to mitigate
27

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 the potential significant and avoidable impacts on groundwater by implementing local conjunctive use
2 and groundwater replenishment projects as proposed in the Final SED.
3 117. Fifth, The Final SED fails to conduct adequate analysis of how the threshold of

4 significance for critically overdrafted basins differs from other basins. Specifically, the Eastern San
5 Joaquin, Merced, and Chowchilla Subbasins are listed as critically overdrafted basins under SGMA. In
6 contrast, the Modesto and Turlock Subbasins are not listed as critically overdrafted. (Final SED 9-
7 32.) Notwithstanding this difference in baseline groundwater conditions, the same threshold of
8 significance is used for critically overdrafted basins as for those which are not critically overdrafted.

9 118. Sixth, the Final SED employs an over-simplistic, technically-defective, and
10 informationally opaque methodology to arrive at an unusual metric of inches of average groundwater
11 impact per year, assumed to occur uniformly throughout the whole of extended groundwater basin.
12 119. As a result, the full extent of potential impacts of increased pumping as a result of the
13 Plan Amendments was insufficiently assessed and analyzed.
14 3. Inadequate Impacts Analysis Regarding Agricultural Resources
15 120. The Final SED concluded that adoption of the Plan Amendments would cause
16 significant unavoidable impacts to agricultural resources. (Final SED at 11-4, 11-5.) The SED's
17 analysis regarding Agricultural Resources is deficient in several respects.
18 121. As separately alleged herein, the Final SED fails to adequately analyze the potential
19 surface and groundwater impacts of the Water Board's Phase 1 Plan Amendments and, at a
20 programmatic level, of its larger Bay-Delta Plan Update. These surface and groundwater impacts bear
21 fundamentally on the question of year-to-year irrigation water supplies for crop production, both on
22 the three affected tributaries and throughout the larger affected Bay-Delta and affected export areas to
23 south of the Delta.

24 122. Because of these flaws with respect to potential effects on surface and groundwater, the
25 Final SED's linked analysis of the impact on agricultural resources underestimates or misrepresents
26 the foreseeable potential direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on agricultural resources, both within
27

28

- 23 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

2 the immediate project area and elsewhere in the Bay-Delta watershed and in affected export areas south
of the Delta.

3 123.

4 The Final SED's analysis of potential significant impacts on agricultural resources is
inadequate in several respects:
5 124.

6 First, the analysis assumes more severe impacts to agricultural resources are avoided

7 through per se unsustainable levels of groundwater use despite the legal requirement that the affected

8 areas achieve sustainable management of groundwater under SGMA over time.
125.

LO Second, the analysis assumes more severe impacts to agricultural resources can be

10 avoided through unrestricted intra-district transfers, theoretical deficit irrigation, and automatic optimal

11 redistribution of available water from lower to higher value crops-all over-broad assumptions that are

12 either belied or called into significant question by the actual on-ground circumstances within the
affected districts.

13 126.

14 Third, in light of the Final SED's faulty assumptions with respect to SGMA and per se

15 unsustainable groundwater replacement in particular, the analysis fails to adequately consider the

16 potential cumulatively significant effects of the Project on agricultural resources over multiple drought
years.
17 127.

18 Fourth, the analysis fails to adequately consider potential indirect and cumulative effects

19 on agricultural resources of the Plan Amendments and of related projects, including Phase 2 of the

20 Bay-Delta Plan Update, within the larger Bay-Delta watershed and in affected Delta export areas south

21 of the Delta, at even a programmatic level of detail.

128.

22 In light of all these deficiencies, the Final SED significantly understates the foresecable

23 potential direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental impacts of the Plan Amendments on

24 agricultural resources, both on the three immediately affected tributaries and within the larger Bay-

25 Delta watershed and affected export areas south of the Delta.

129.

26 As a result of its failure to adequately disclose and analyze the impacts of the Plan

27 Amendments and of the related Bay-Delta Plan Update as a whole on groundwater resources and

6 130. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

7 allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.

8 131. An EIR must evaluate significant cumulative impacts, based on an assessment of the

9 project's incremental effects viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effect of othen
10 current projects, and the effects of probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15130.)
11 132. "Cumulative impacts' refers to two or more individual effects which, when considered

12 together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts.
13 (a) The individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a numben

14 of separate projects.

15 (b) The cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the environment which

16 results from the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present,
17 and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from individually
18 minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time." (CEQA Guidelines,

20 (c) The cumulative impacts from social and economic effects resulting from a physical
21 change in the environment. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15064(e).).

22 133. The Final SED contains a list of projects, which it claims will contribute to cumulative
23 impacts associated with the Plan Amendments. (Final SED, Chapter 17, Table 17-1.) This list of
24 projects is focused on large-scale programs and projects, but fails to adequately consider the potential
25 reach and extent of several major related programs and projects when combined with the effects of the
26 Plan Amendments, particularly within the larger context of the Water Board's eventual Phase 2 process
27 and the extended Bay-Delta watershed and related service areas.

1 134. The Final SED also fails to adequately consider the potential cumulative effects of
2 certain indirect and additional actions as reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance associated with
3 the Water Board's immediate Phase 1 Plan Amendments in a larger Bay-Delta Plan context, in
4 I combination with these other related projects and programs.
5 135. Specifically, although the Final SED identifies Phase 2 of the Bay-Delta Plan 2 Update,
6 SGMA, the NMFS and USFWS biological opinion reconsultations for salmon and smelt, and
7 California Water Fix as reasonably foreseeable programs and projects that may have cumulative
8 impacts, the cumulative impacts analysis fails by considering the cumulative impacts of these programs
9 and projects only within the immediate geographic setting of the Lower San Joaquin, the three affected
10 tributaries, and the South Delta. While the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of these
11 programs and projects extend both into and beyond the areas studied - and vice versa - the Final SED
12 omits any analysis of these potential environmental impacts outside of the immediate project area. The
13 Final SED should have included such analysis throughout the extended Bay-Delta watershed and in
14 affected water export areas south of the Delta.
15 136. Because the Final SED does not fully analyze the cumulative impacts of the Plan
16 Amendments, the Water Board has abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required
17 by law by adopting the Final SED and approving the Plan Amendments.
18 E. Fifth Cause of Action - Failure to Consider Reasonable Range of Project Alternatives
19 137. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
20 allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.
21 138. The Final SED must "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project or to the
22 location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would
23 avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the projectโฆeven if these alternatives
24 would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives or would be more costly."
25 (CEQA Guidelines, ยงยง 15126.6(a)-(b).)
26

27

28

- 26 - Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

139. Importantly, an agency should not approve a project as proposed "if there are feasible
alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which would substantially lessen the environmental effects
of [the project]." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21002.)
4 140. The Final SED did not consider a reasonable range of alternatives. In the Final SED.
the Water Board's approach to project alternatives was narrow, and focused mainly on flows alone for
the protection of fish and wildlife beneficial uses.
7 141. Specifically, the Final SED should have included and fully analyzed non-flow measures
8 of greater effect in rehabilitating fish populations - such as predator control, food supply, and habitat
projects - while at the same time lessening impacts to surface and groundwater users and to agricultural
10 resources as a project alternative.
11 142. Contrary to CEQA's requirement to consider a reasonable range of "feasible"
12 alternatives, all of the Final SED's Phase 1 unimpaired flow standards - under the adopted Plan
13 Amendments, as well as the other flow alternatives actually considered - are infeasible. Accordingly,
14 the Final SED fails to consider a reasonable range of "feasible" alternatives as required by law.
15 143. First, the alternatives for Phase 1 flow standards considered in the Final SED are
16 practically and legally infeasible due because of the Final SED's failure to consider the effect of water
17 rights priorities in implementation.
18 144. Secondly, the Final SED's proposed Phase 1 unimpaired flow standards are practically
19 and legally infeasible due to unrealistic and impractical reservoir operations assumptions developed in
20 "iterative modeling" separate from the Water Board's proposed unimpaired flow standards themselves.
21 145. Thirdly, the range of alternatives considered in the Final SED also does not well satisfy
22 the Water Board's stated objective to reasonably protect (and improve) water quality for fish in light
23 of clear evidence in the Final SED itself that varying percentages of unimpaired flows likely have little
24 effect on actual fish populations when compared to other factors including cyclical fluctuations in
25 ocean conditions, non-native predation, water temperatures outside of the February through January
26 period, available rearing habitat, and targeted flows for specific biological objectives.

1 146. The Final SED further fails to consider any alternative to reasonably balance "all
2 demands" on the state's water through the consideration of "factors" including, but not limited to all
3 "past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water," "water quality conditions that could
4 reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors," and "economic considerations,"
5 as required by the Porter-Cologne Act (Water Code, ยงยง 13000, 13241). (Wat. Code, ยงยง 13000, 13241.)
6 147. Further, the Final SED fails to consider potential feasible lower-water-cost alternatives
7 based on a combination of specific non-flow and functional measures as proposed by the affected
8 districts and many affected members of the public.
9 148. Because the Final SED did not consider a reasonable range of feasible alternatives, in
10 adopting the Final SED and Plan Amendments, the Water Board abused its discretion and failed to
11 proceed in the manner required by law.
12 F. Sixth Cause of Action - Inadequate Mitigation Measures
13 149. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
14 allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.
15 150. The Final SED is required to include a detailed statement of proposed mitigation
16 measures that will minimize significant effects on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code,
17 |21100(b)(3).)
18 151. "Mitigation" is defined by the CEQA Guidelines themselves as:
19
"(a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts 20 of an action.
688 (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation.

(c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the
24 impacted environment.

25 (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action.
26

27 (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute
resources or environments."
28 (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15370.)

I 152. In turn, under CEQA, a public agency "shall mitigate or avoid the significant effects on
2 the environment of projects whenever it is feasible to do so." (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21002.1(b).)
3 153. The Final SED did not consider all feasible mitigation measures. Several of the
4 mitigation measures proposed to mitigate identified significant unavoidable impacts to groundwater
5 and agricultural resources are ineffective, infeasible, uncertain, or insufficient and disproportionate to
6 the Project's potential "significant and avoidable" impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources
as explained.

1. Mitigation Deferred To "Adaptive Implementation"
154.
10 The Final SED improperly defers potential mitigation of identified direct, indirect, and

11 cumulative significant unavoidable impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources to "adaptive
implementation."
12
155.
13 The Final SED fails to consider the effectiveness or certainty of such mitigation
occurring, and ignores the availability of various more certain and more effective means to reduce 14

15 related impacts by means of feasible alternatives and mitigation, including feasible dry-year and

16 sequentially dry-year impacts groundwater and agricultural resources.
156. The Final SED and Plan Amendments describe
17 carryover guidelines, end-of-year refill

18 criteria, "flow shifting," and other reservoir reoperation parameters and constraints to be included

19 through trial-and-error experimentation and "adaptive management" in implementation. All of these

20 measures are vaguely discussed as ways to potentially reduce potential significant impacts on river
temperatures, biological resources, public services, groundwater, agricultural resources, and the like. 21

22 However, the Final SED includes no specific description of any plan for actual implementation of these

23 measures and adopts none of them as enforceable mitigation.

24 2. Agricultural Water Efficiency as a Mitigation Measure

25 157. The Final SED identifies increased agricultural water efficiency as a feasible mitigation

26 measure. However, in so doing it includes no significant analysis of: (1) current levels of agricultural

27 water use efficiency; (2) technical and economic feasibility of methods of increased agricultural water

28 use efficiency; (3) effectiveness of methods of increased agricultural water use efficiency, particularly

29 .
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 in periods of extended drought; and, (4) potential secondary effects of increasing efficiency, including
2 loss of groundwater recharge and related groundwater effects.
3

4 3. Conjunctive Management and Local Groundwater Recharge as a Mitigation Measure

5 158. The Final SED identifies conjunctive management of surface and groundwater and local

6 groundwater recharge projects as two forms of potential mitigation for the Project's significant and

7 unavoidable impacts on groundwater and agricultural resources.

8 159. The Final SED ignores that the increasing scarcity of available surface water caused by
the Plan Amendments, along with nearly certain future groundwater pumping restrictions under

10 SGMA, will render such mitigation far less effective on the scale needed to mitigate for the Project's

11 significant environmental impacts.

12 4. Future Pumping Limits Under SGMA As a Mitigation Measure
13 160. While the Final SED identified the future imposition of local or state limits on pumping
14 as feasible mitigation of the Project's groundwater impacts, this ignores that reliance on such mitigation
15 would in turn create additional impacts on agricultural resources such as, but not limited to, land
16 fallowing, loss of crops, and social and economic losses.
17 161. The Final SED identifies increased agricultural water efficiency as feasible mitigation
18 for the Project's impacts on agricultural resources but fails to consider the effectiveness of such
19 mitigation in light of these probable additional impacts to agricultural resources from future regulation
20 under SGMA.

21 162. In failing to consider reasonable mitigation measures, the Water Board abused its
22 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law. CEQA required the Water Board to
23 decline to approve the Plan Amendments since there are feasible alternatives and/or mitigation
24 measures that can substantially lessen or avoid the significant environmental effects that the Plan
25 Amendments will cause. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21002.)
26 G. Seventh Cause of Action - Recirculation of SED
27 163. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, cach and every
28 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.

- 30 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

164. CEQA requires the recirculation of the SED when significant new information is added
to it. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15088.5.)
165. Despite major changes to the Water Board's Project after circulation of the 2016
Revised Draft SED- including, particularly, changed Project characteristics and changed assumptions
concerning reservoir operations, including carryover, refill, flow shifting, etc.- the SED was not
recirculated.

166. Comments on the SED during the 2016 Revised Draft SED public review period raised
8 major new concerns bearing on core assumptions, analyses, and alternatives in the Final SED, and
9 significant new information warranting major revision and recirculation.
10 167. Instead, significant new information regarding the action and its environmental impacts
11 was relegated to Responses to Comments in the Final SED, which thereafter was adopted.
12 168. As a result, members of the affect public, including Farm Bureau, were deprived of an
13 opportunity to formally submit new comments on the significant new information included in
14 Responses to Comments, and to receive formal responses to the same.
15 169. Because the Water Board did not recirculate the Final SED, or allow additional time fon
16 comments, responses to comments, and potential changes to the SED and the Board's selected course
17 of action, the Water Board abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
18 H. Eighth Cause of Action - Inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations
19 170. Farm Bureau realleges and incorporates herein, as if set forth in full, each and every
20 preceding allegation, inclusive, of this Petition.
21 171. Under CEQA, the Water Board may not approve the Plan Amendments until it makes
22 specific written findings regarding the significant environmental effects identified in the Final SED.
23 (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15091(a).) Those findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the
24 record. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15091(b).) Among those ยง findings which the Water Board may use tol
25 support approval of the Final SED and Plan Amendments is a finding that "specific economic, social,
26 or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the
27 [SED]." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15091(a)(3).)
28

31 - Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 172. With respect to this finding - the adoption of a "Statement of Overriding
2 Considerations," as it is known under CEQA - the Water Board is required to state in writing that the
3 specific reasons to support its action is based upon substantial evidence in the Final SED or elsewhere
4 in the record. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15093(b).) Only under such circumstances may the Water Board
5 approve the Plan Amendments in spite of the fact that the Final SED identifies significant effects,
6 which are not avoided or substantially lessened. (Id.)
7 173. Here, the Water Board's adoption of a Statement of Overriding Considerations was
8 improper, because there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the Water Board's
9 contention that the Plan Amendments will in fact create specific benefits to fish or the Bay-Delta
10 ecosystem, or that those potential benefits outweigh the significant and unavoidable impacts of the Plan
11 Amendments.

12 174. The Water Board's conclusion that significant impacts to groundwater resources and
13 agricultural resources are unavoidable-or, at least, that their extent and significance could not be
14 feasibly reduced further-is unsupported by substantial evidence, because there were specific feasible
15 project alternatives and/or mitigation measures available yet that were not adequately considered or
16 adopted in the Final SED.
17 175. Similarly, the Statement of Overriding Considerations is unable to point to substantial
18 evidence in the record that it considered a reasonable range of feasible alternatives that might have
19 reduced the Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts considered in the Final SED, where there
20 were indeed additional feasible alternatives it might reasonably have considered, yet did not.
21 Specifically, in addition to the alternatives considered based on varying percentages of unimpaired
22 flow, as elsewhere alleged herein, the Water Board failed to consider: 1) any alternative to reasonably
23 balance "all demands" on the state's water through the consideration of "factors" including, but not
24 limited to all "past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water," "water quality conditions
25 that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors," and "economid
26 considerations," as required by the Porter-Cologne Act (Water Code, ยงยง 13000, 13241); or 2) any
27

- 32 -
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Under the California Environmental Quality Act

1 lower-water-cost feasible alternatives based on a combination of non-flow and functional flow
2 measures, as proposed by the districts and many members of the public.
3 176. Accordingly, the Water Board abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner
4 required by law in approving the Final SED and Plan Amendments.
5 XI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
6 WHEREFORE, Farm Bureau respectfully prays for the following relief:
7 1. For a stay, preliminary injunction, and/or permanent injunction enjoining the Water
8 Board's adoption, implementation, and enforcement of the Plan Amendments;
9 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, directing the Water Board to:
10
a. Vacate and set aside its December 12, 2018 adoption of Resolution No. 2018-
11 0059, approving and adopting amendments to the 2006 Water Quality Control Plan for the San
12 Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary and the related Substitute Environmental
13 Document;
14 b. Suspend any and all activity that may result in an adverse change or alteration
15 to the physical environment, including implementation of any portion of the Plan Amendments, until
16 Respondent has complied with all requirements of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section
17 21168.9;
18
C. Comply with CEQA and CEQA Guidelines, the Water Board's certified
19 regulatory program implementing CEQA, and all other applicable laws and regulations as they pertain
20 to this action;
21 3. For attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to law including Code of Civil Procedure section
22 1021.5; and,
23 4. For such further relief as the Court deems just and proper. 24
