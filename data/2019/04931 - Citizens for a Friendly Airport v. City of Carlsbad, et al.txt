CASE NO. 37-2019-00028690-CU-TT-CTL 11 CITIZENS FOR A FRIENDLY AIRPORT,

12 Plaintiff and Petitioner, VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF 13 VS. MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA
14 CITY OF CARLSBAD; COUNTY OF SAN ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AND
DIEGO; and DOES through 100, OTHER LAWS
15 Defendants and Respondents;
16

17 DOES 101 through 1,000,
Defendants and Real Parties in
18 Interest.

19

20

21 Plaintiff and Petitioner CITIZENS FOR A FRIENDLY AIRPORT ("Petitioner") alleges as

22 follows:
Parties 23

24 1. Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State
Petitioner's members resides in or near the County of San Diego, 25 of California. At least one of
26 California, and has an interest in protecting the region's air quality, minimizing and ameliorating traffic,
27 promoting other environment-related quality-of-life ensuring informed and responsible growth, and
28| issues,

2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF CARLSBAD ("CITY") is a "public agency" under

2 Public Resources Code Section 21063. Defendant and Respondent COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO
3 ("COUNTY") is also a "public agency" under Section 21063.
3. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents identified as DOES 1

5 through 100 and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 1,000 are unknown
6 to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to allege the true

7 names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Each of the fictitiously named Respondents 1
8 through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the action that is being challenged in
9 this lawsuit and each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through 1,000 either is a party
10 to the challenged action or has some other cognizable interest in the action.
11 Background Information
12 4. The government action that is the subject of this lawsuit is that certain Mutual
13 Cooperation and Settlement Agreement ("Agreement") between CITY and COUNTY dated March 28,
14 2019, concerning McClellan-Palomar Airport Master Plan Update, and the A greement is a project under
15 Public Resources Code Sections 21065 and 21080 ("Project").
16 5. Petitioner opposes the Project on the grounds that Defendants/Respondents violated
17 CEQA and other laws.

18 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations

19 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges:
20 A. A Notice of Determination for the Project was filed in the Office of the County
21 Clerk for the County of San Diego within the last 35 days.
22 B. Alternatively, no Notice of Determination for the Project has been filed.

23 7. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on
24 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. The Notice of
25 Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

26 8. Petitioner will have caused: copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General
27 not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
28 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 2

Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

2 9. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
3 Section 21168 or 21168.5, as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 1060 et seq., and
1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.
10. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that neither Public
Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement under may be
7 applied to Petitioner.

11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since its
members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
10| Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Defendants/Respondents' approval of

11 the Project also rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with
12 those laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in
13 approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise
wE
14 their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.

15 Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project
16 within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Defendants/Respondents have failed

17 and refuse to do SO and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in manner that is not
18 consistent with those laws.

19 12. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants/Respondents' fulfillment of
20 all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.
21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

22 Illegal Approval of Project (Against All Defendants/Respondents and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest)

23 13. Paragraphs through 16 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
24 14. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
25 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):
26 A. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:
27 1. CEQA requires every "discretionary project" to be subjected to
28 environmental review before it may be approved by the public agency.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

1 2. The Project is a "discretionary project" under CEQA.

2 3. The Project is not exempt from environmental review under CEQA.

3 4. Neither CITY nor COUNTY made a determination as to whether approval
4 of the Agreement was an activity which constitutes a project as required by CEQA.

5 5. Neither CITY nor COUNTY made a determination that the Project was

6 exempt from review under CEQA.

7 6. Neither CITY nor COUNTY conducted an environmental review to
8 assess the potential environmental effects of the Project as required by CBQA.

9 B. The Project violates public policy. In particular:
10 1. The Project involves an agreement that COUNTY is immune from

11 CITY's building and zoning ordinances and requirements pursuant to Government Code Section 53090
12 et seq. However, the COUNTY's immunity as to the McClellan-Palomar Airport property is narrower
13 than the Agreement indicates. For example, notwithstanding Government Code Section 53090 et seq.,
14 COUNTY is required to obtain CITY's approval of any expansion or enlargement plan for the
15 McClellan-Palomar Airport under Public Utilities Code Section 21661.6 and to satisfy other
16 requirements thereunder, which is expressly not addressed in the Agreement.
17 2. The Project involves an agreement that mischaracterizes COUNTY's
18 obligations under that certain conditional use permit no. CUP-172 as voluntary. COUNTY'S
19 obligations under CUP-172 are mandatory and legally enforceable. Even if COUNTY voluntarily
20 commenced the process to obtain the CUP in 1980, the outcome of the process - namely, CITY's

21 issuance of the CUP and imposition of the conditions therein on COUNTY - is mandatory in nature.
22 By characterizing COUNTY's compliance with CUP-172 as voluntary, CITY and COUNTY have
23 effectively amended CUP-172 without following proper procedures.
24 3. The Project involves an agreement that CITY will not adopt the zoning-
25 ordinance amendment that it published for public review on or about January 18, 2019,' or any similar

26 ordinance that purports to create an airport boundary line or restrict the acquisition of interests in
27

28 Petitioner is informed and believes that "January 18, 2019," as used in the Agreement is a typograpbical error and should be "January 18, 2018."

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF ETC. Page 4

property for airspace protection or Airport safety zones. CITY has the right under its general police
powers to adopt zoning ordinances and amendments within its jurisdiction. Such agreement constitutes
an illegal contracting-away of CITY's right to exercise its police powers.

4. The Project involves an agreement that CITY attorneys, officers, agents,
employees, and contractors will not assist, aid, or encourage any litigation related to COUNTY's
approval of the McClellan-Palomar Airport Master Plan Update or its corresponding environmental
impact report ("EIR"). This language in the Agreement is so broad as to prohibit CITY representatives
from interacting with Petitioner's members and other members of the public concerning Petitioner's
separate lawsuit over the Master Plan Update and EIR, despite their constitutional rights to interact with
10 public officials.
11 C. The Project violates the Carlsbad Municipal Code ("CMC"). In particular:
12 1. At all relevant times, CMC Section 21.53.01 5(a) has provided as follows:
13 "The city council shall not approve any zone change, general plan amendment or any other legislative * 14| enactment necessary to authorize expansion of any airport in the city nor shall the city commence any
15 action or spend any funds preparatory to or in anticipation of such approvals without having been first
16 authorized to do so by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the city voting at an election for such
17 purposes."
18 2. The Project's approval by CITY constitutes a "legislative enactment"

19 under CMC 21.53.015.

20 3. The Project involves the taking of action preparatory to or in anticipation
21 of an approval to authorize expansion of McClellan-Palomar Airport, which is located in the City of
22 Carlsbad.

23 4. The Project's approval by CITY has not been subjected to a vote of a
24 CITY's qualified electors.

25 15. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws, Petitioner
26 has been harmed in that Petitioner, the public, and the decision-makers who approved the Project were
27 not fully informed about the impacts of, mitigation measures for, and alternatives to the Project prior

28 to its approval and because the Project is illegal in other respects.

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVR RELIEF ETC. Page 5

1 Prayer

2 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against
3 Defendants/Respondents and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest (and any and all other parties who may

4 oppose Petitioner in this lawsuit):

5 A. On All Causes of Action:

6 1. A judgment determining or declaring that Defendants/Respondents failed to

7 comply fully with CEQA and/or other laws as it relates to the Project and that its approval (including

8 all associated entitlements) was illegal in at least some respect, rendering the approval null and void;
2. A judgment determining or declaring that Defendants/Respondents must subject

10 the Project to environmental review under CEQA before final approval of the Project may be granted;
11 3. Injunctive reliefprohibiting Defendants/Respondents and Rcal Parties in Interest
12 (and any and all persons acting at the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of
13 them) from taking any action on any aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project
14 unless and until Defendants/Respondents comply with all applicable provisions of law, as determined
15 by the Court;

16 4 Any and all other relief that may be authorized by is law but is not explicitly or
17 specifically requested elsewhere in this Prayer;
18 5. All legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with this lawsuit

19 including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure and
20 the Government Code; and

21 6. Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
22 Date: September 20, 2019. Respectfully submitted,
