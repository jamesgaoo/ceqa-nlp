VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner Imperial Irrigation District ("Petitioner" or "TID") files this Verified Petition for

1 2 Writ of Mandate ("Petition") and alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. The primary purpose of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") is to
identify a project's significant effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project,

6 and to indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided. CEQA

7 requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of a project at the agency's

8 earliest commitment to the project, so that the agency's commitment to the project does not

0 foreclose its ability to mitigate or avoid the project's environmental impacts.

10 2. In this case, Respondent The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California

11 ("Metropolitan") violated the foregoing principles of CEQA by committing to enter into

12 agreements that will require Metropolitan to forgo diverting up to hundreds of thousands of acre-
d'IT ONVAE AHNMOG 13 feet of water annually from the Colorado River without considering how Metropolitan will make

14 up the shortfall. In so doing, Metropolitan failed to comply with CEQA's requirements to engage

15 in a review of the environmental consequences of its commitment to forgo deliveries from the

16 Colorado River at the earliest possible time.

17 3. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself and as the governmental agency
18 serving water to the landowners and water users within its boundaries. This Petition challenges

19 approvals by the Board of Directors of Metropolitan that occurred on December 11, 2018 for

20 Board Item No. 8-11 (the "December Approval") and March 12, 2019 for Board Item 8-1 (the

21 "March Approval"), hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Approvals." The Approvals

22 authorized Metropolitan to enter into "the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan" ("LBDCP").

23 Petitioner supports cooperative efforts among all parties diverting water from the Colorado River

24 to comprehensively and prudently manage water supply on the River. However, restrictions on

25 deliveries from the Colorado River create demands for water from other sources, which, in turn,

26 result in other environmental impacts. Metropolitan's Approvals were problematic because, in

27 committing to the LBDCP, Metropolitan improperly deferred consideration of the means by

28 which Metropolitan would obtain water to make up for the reduced deliveries from the Colorado
2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 River, which violates CEQA.

2 4. Cumulatively over the term of the LBDCP, Metropolitan is potentially obligated to

3 contribute over 2 million acre-feet of water to the Colorado River in Lake Mead. Metropolitan's

4 Approvals deferred consideration of the means by which Metropolitan would meet its water

5 demands and, in so doing, Metropolitan did not analyze environmental impacts from acquiring

6 water from other sources to fill this massive new hole in Metropolitan's water supply.

7 5. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing Metropolitan to vacate the Approvals

8 and to engage in a meaningful review of the environmental impacts of a commitment to the

9 LBDCP in full compliance with CEQA's requirements.

10 PARTIES

11 6. Petitioner IID was formed in 1911 and is an irrigation district organized and

12 existing under the California Irrigation District Law, Water Code sections 20500 et seq. IID is

6 LBDCP.

7 11. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents Does 1 through 20, inclusive, and 1 therefore sue

9 said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their true

10 names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the agent

11 or employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the

12 course and scope of such Respondents' agency or employment.
d'TI ONVII AHNMOC 13 12. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

14 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest Does 21 through 40, inclusive, and

15 therefore sue said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

16 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 13. The Los Angeles County Superior Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged

19 herein pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525, 526, 527, 1060, 1085, 1094.5 and Public

20 Resources Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5.

21 14. Venue is appropriate in Los Angeles County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

22 sections 393, 394 and 395 because Respondent is located within the County of Los Angeles.

23 Among other things, Respondent's Project threatens water users, natural resources, and the

24 environment, part of which is located within the County of Los Angeles.

25 BACKGROUND

26 The Upper and Lower Colorado River Basins.

27 15. The Colorado River Basin ("Basin") is a critical source of water and power

28 supplies for seven western states and Mexico. The Basin covers approximately 246,000 square

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 miles, nearly all of which are in the United States. The Basin includes the Colorado River and its

3 tributaries, with the river eventually crossing the southern border of the United States into
Mexico, thence discharging into the Gulf of California.

4 16.

5 The Colorado River is managed and operated under numerous compacts, federal

6 laws, court decisions and decrees, contracts, and regulatory guidelines collectively known as "The

7 Law of the River." Part of The Law of the River, the Colorado River Compact, divided the Basin

8 in 1922 into two areas, the Upper Basin (comprising Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and

9 Wyoming) and the Lower Basin (Nevada, Arizona and California). The compact requires that

10 Upper Basin states not deplete the flow of the river below 7,500,000 acre-feet during any period

11 of ten consecutive years, with the Lower Basin also being entitled to 7,500,000 acre-feet

12 annually. Based on rainfall patterns observed in the years prior to execution of the compact, the

AHNMOC BRAND LLP 13 amounts specified in the compact were assumed to allow a roughly equal division of water

14 between the two basins. The states within each basin were required to divide their respective
7,500,000-acre foot per year

15 share allotment among themselves. Additionally, pursuant to a 1944

16 water treaty with Mexico, an additional 1,500,000 maf per year of Colorado River flows is
committed to Mexico.

17

18 California's Entitlement to 4.4 Million Acre-feet of Colorado River Water

17.

19 The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928: (1) ratified the 1922 Compact; (2)

20 authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and related irrigation facilities in the Lower Basin;

21 (3) apportioned the Lower Basin's annual 7.5 million acre-feet ("maf') among the states of

22 Arizona (2.8 maf), California (4.4 maf) and Nevada (0.3 maf); and (4) authorized and directed the

23 Secretary of the United States Department of Interior to function as the sole contracting authority

24 for Colorado River water use in the Lower Basin. California's annual Colorado River entitlement

was thus established at 4.4 maf.

25 HID Holds Senior Water Rights on the Colorado River

26 18.

27 The allocation of California's 4.4 maf annual entitlement among California entities

28 was subsequently established in the California Seven Party Agreement of 1931. The Seven Party
Agreement established general annual allocations among Palo Verde, Yuma Project, IID,
5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1' Coachella, Metropolitan, and the City and County of San Diego.

2 19. The 1922 Colorado River Compact also provided that present perfected rights to

3 the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River system are unimpaired by the Compact. The

4 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act recognized and protected these rights by providing that

5 Colorado River facilities "shall be used; second, for irrigation and domestic uses and satisfaction

6 of present perfected rights in pursuance of Article VIII of said Colorado River Compact ..."

7 Pursuant to the terms of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, California's annual entitlement of 4.4

8 maf was to be used to satisfy "any rights which existed on December 21, 1928." IID's water

9 rights are exclusive to the Colorado River and IID holds "present perfected rights" of 2.6 maf

10 annually from the Colorado River with a priority date of 1901. IID also holds significant post-

11 1914 water rights pursuant to State Water Resources Control Board Permit 7643, which

12 authorizes IID to divert a maximum of 10,000 cubic feet per second from the Colorado River for
d'TI UNVIE AHNMOG 13 irrigation, domestic, municipal and environmental protection uses.

14 The Long-Term Problem: Supply and Demand Imbalance on the Colorado River

15 20. Over time, water supplies available from the Colorado River have been in decline.

16 Based on observed data from the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation"), average

17 natural Colorado River flow from 1906 through 2012 was approximately 16.2 maf annually. The

18 period from 2000 to 2018, however, was the lowest 19-year period for natural flow in the last

19 century. Based on future conditions and demands, Reclamation has estimated that future

20 imbalances will range from zero to 6.8 maf, with a median imbalance between supply and

21 demand of 3.2 maf.

22 The 2003 Quantification Settlement Agreement

23 21. For decades following the Boulder Canyon Project Act, California was legally

24 allowed to consumptively use more water from the Colorado River than its annual entitlement of

25 4.4 maf because Arizona and Nevada were not yet using their full entitlements. Eventually

26 however, when Arizona and Nevada began to use their full apportionment, California developed

27 the "4.4 Plan" to reduce its annual water diversions to operate within its entitlement established in

28 Arizona v. California. At the same time, Southern California's water needs continued to grow
6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1- and grow.

2 22.

3 The 4.4 Plan was used as the framework for the Quantification Settlement

4 Agreement ("QSA"), which is a complex multi-party series of agreements that include the

5 quantification of entitlements to Colorado River water within California and provides for the

6 nation's largest agriculture-to-urban conserved water transfer. Specifically, the QSA caps IID's

7 consumptive use entitlement of Colorado River at 3.1 maf per year. The QSA also requires IID to

8 transfer conserved water, in annually varying amounts, up to full implementation in some years of
over 475,000 acre-feet per year.

10 Adjusting Basin Diversions Has Resulted in Significant Environmental Impacts
23.

11 Adjusting and reallocating diversions from the Basin is well known to produce

12 significant environmental impacts. It can reduce the water supplied to an area that leads to

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 13 environmental impacts or result in new diversions to service the area, which can result in impacts
in the areas from where the replacement water supplies emanate.

14 24.

15 The Salton Sea is one example. The a Salton Sea is a shallow, saline lake that is

16 approximately 35 miles long and 15 miles wide, located in the lowest elevations in the Colorado

17 Desert of Imperial and Riverside Counties. The Sea is the modern incarnation of Lake Cahuilla, a

18 prehistoric, intermittent freshwater sea that filled and evaporated multiple times over thousands of

19 years as the Colorado River meandered-shifting between emptying into the Gulf of California,
or diverting northwest, into the Salton Trough.

20 25.

21 With nearly 90 percent of California's wetlands lost to development, the Salton

22• Sea over the last century has become a vital stop on the Pacific Flyway for millions of birds,

23 making it one the most significant avian habitats in the continental United States. According to

24 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, over twenty sensitive bird species occupy the

25 Salton Sea and surrounding habitat, or migrate through the Salton Sea in significant numbers.

26 The endangered desert pupfish--a native fish speciesalso currently inhabits the Salton Sea.

27 Introduced tilapia make up the bulk of the Salton Sea's fish population, which has served as a
food source for millions of migratory birds.
28 26. The Salton Sea is primarily sustained by agricultural return flows from the
7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1• Imperial and Coachella Valleys. An effect of the QSA, however, is that less water flows into the

2 Salton Sea as return flows from IID's agricultural water users. Lower inflows to the Salton Sea,

3 in turn, decrease the water elevation and increase the salinity levels of the Sea (thereby harming

4 fish and wildlife) and result in exposed playa causing significant impacts to air quality.

5 27. The Salton Sea experience is an example of the kinds of significant environmental

6 consequences that can result from the implementation of plans affecting water diversions from the

7 Colorado River. CEQA exists to assure that public agencies like Metropolitan identify and

8 address these impacts before committing to such plans.

9 The 2007 Guidelines Coordinated Drought Planning on the Colorado River
10 28. As the Colorado entered its eighth year of drought in 2007, the Lower Basin
11 entities adopted the 2007 Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and
12 Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (*2007 Guidelines") in effort to
LLP INVIA AHNMOC 13 coordinate operations of the two main reservoirs in the Basin.

14 29. The 2007 Guidelines included criteria for "balancing" releases between Lakes
15 Powell and Mead and created a mechanism for storing conserved water in Lake Mead.
16 (https://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/strategies/RecordofDecision.pdf.)The 2007
17 Guidelines also included a schedule of Lower Basin reductions in Colorado River diversions for

18 Arizona and Nevada if Lake Mead drops to an elevation of 1,075 feet or less (i.e., a "shortage

19 condition").
20 30. In light of the ongoing historic drought and in order to prevent reaching critically
21 low elevations in Lake Mead, parties in the Lower Basin developed the LBDCP. The purpose of
22 the LBDCP is to incentivize the creation and storage of additional conserved water in Lake Mead,
23 as well as provide for contributions of water to Lake Mead at certain elevations of Lake Mead
24 from California, and additional contributions of water from Arizona and Nevada beyond what is
25 already required in the 2007 Guidelines.

26 31. The LBDCP comprises of interstate and intrastate agreements. The LBDCP

27 interstate agreement requires that when Lake Mead reaches certain predetermined elevations, the

28

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

V 2 Lower Basin states would make "contributions" to Lake Mead by forgoing deliveries of Colorado

3 River water beyond the volumes agreed to under the 2007 Guidelines or restricting the delivery of

4 conserved water being stored in Lake Mead. The LBDCP is designed to incentivize the voluntary

5 conservation of water to be stored in Lake Mead. It also commits Reclamation to conserving
100,000 acre-feet of water

6 per year to be left in the Colorado River system at Lake Mead. The

7 LBDCP aims to prevent Lake Mead's elevation from falling below 1,020 feet.

32.

8 California's contribution under the LBDCP interstate agreement is, depending on

9 Lake Mead water elevations, up to 350,000 acre-feet annually through December 31, 2026. The

10 responsibilities for making California's contributions are determined among the parties within

11 California through the intrastate agreements. Metropolitan initially proposed one arrangement for

12 the responsibility of California's contributions among the California parties in its December

AHNMOG BRAND LLP 13 Approval, but then drastically changed course in its March Approval. That shifting- -and the

14 total quantity of water Metropolitan has cumulatively committed in the December Approval and

15 March Approval-and the significant and unanalyzed environmental impacts that result, are the
subject of this action.

16 Metropolitan's December Approval

17 33.

18 On December 11, 2018 Metropolitan approved a proposed version of the Lower

19 Basin Drought Contingency Plan Agreement and Exhibit 1 to that Agreement, with California's

20 contributions to Lake Mead from four entities pursuant to intrastate agreements as follows:

21 Pursuant to a proposed agreement between Metropolitan and Coachella, Coachella agreed to contribute 7 percent of California's DCP Contribution for each year that

22 California is required to make a DCP Contribution; and

23 Pursuant to a proposed agreement between Metropolitan and Palo Verde, Palo Verde

24 agreed to contribute 8 percent of California's DCP Contribution for each year that California is required to make a DCP Contribution; and

25 Pursuant to a proposed agreement between Metropolitan and IID, IID agreed to

26 contribute 125,000 acre-feet of California's DCP Contribution per year for the first

27 two years that California is required to make a DCP Contribution; and Metropolitan agreed to contribute any remaining portion of California's DCP Contribution not covered by IID, Coachella or Palo Verde; and

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The California parties' responsibilities under the LBDCP were further defined by a

2 proposed amendment to the California Agreement for the Creation and Delivery of Extraordinary Conservation Intentionally Created Surplus.
3
34. Under the proposed agreement between Metropolitan and IID, IID agreed that

5 "[d]espite its senior priority agricultural water right, IID agrees to assume responsibility for up to

6 250,000 acre-feet of California's DCP Contributions under the LBDCP to support the Colorado

7 River through the duration of the 2007 Interim Guidelines."

35. 8 Thus, pursuant to the LBDCP as approved by Metropolitan in December of 2018,
IID would provide up to 250,000 acre-feet for California's contributions to Lake Mead over two

10 years; Coachella would provide 7% and Palo Verde would provide 8% of the California

11 contribution annually. Metropolitan would make up the balance, up to the cap on California's

12 total annual contribution of 350,000 AF. Under this formula, Metropolitan would provide up to
d'TI ONVAE AHNMOG 13 172,500 acre-feet the first two years and up to 297,500 acre-feet annually for subsequent years,

14 up to a total of 1,832,500 acre-feet-all committed without any environmental review.

15 Metropolitan's March Approval

36. 16 Months after Metropolitan's December Approval regarding the LBDCP,

17 Metropolitan changed course. Specifically, Metropolitan took action to cover an additional

18 250,000 acre-feet of California's contributions to Lake Mead in place of the volumes that would

19 have been supplied by IID. By doing so, Metropolitan increased its responsibility under the

20 LBDCP for California's contribution to up to 2,082,500 acre-feet, creating a potential deficit in

21 its supply to meet its water demands. Where the water supply would come from, and what

22 environmental impacts could result from Metropolitan's need to acquire such water to fill this

23 sizable hole in its water supply, are entirely unknown. The Approvals defer any consideration of

24 the means and measures Metropolitan will take to meet its water supply demands as a result of the

25 commitment the Approvals authorized.

37. 26 Metropolitan's March Approval was bereft of detail, to the point that

27 Metropolitan's Board did not even have the LBDCP agreements they were approving before

28 them. Metropolitan's staff report for the March Approval stated that it requested authority: "to

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 participate in the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan (DCP) on behalf of California if the

2 boards of one or more of the other California Contractors do not authorize their agencies to sign

3 the Lower Basin DCP Agreement" and notes that "conforming revisions" to numerous interstate

4 and intrastate agreements may be necessary, which would be subject to later review and approval

5 by Metropolitan staff.

6 38. Despite the dramatic volumes of water being provided by Metropolitan under the

7 LBDCP, Metropolitan's Approvals fail to recognize that by committing to the LBDCP on the

8 terms of the Approvals, under CEQA Metropolitan has approved the overall project, including the

9 means and measures that will be undertaken as a result of Metropolitan's commitment. In

10 violation of CEQA, Metropolitan wrongly determined that the project is exempt from CEQA

11 review.

12 39. IID participated actively throughout the administrative process that led to
d'TI ANVHI AHNMOC 13 Metropolitan making its December Approval and March Approval and exhausted its

14 administrative remedies pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177.

15 40. Following Metropolitan's December Approval and March Approval, no notice of

16 exemption or notice of determination was filed by Metropolitan and this action is brought within

17 180 days of both Metropolitan's December Approval and March Approval. (Pub. Res. Code §

18 21167.)

19 41. On April 15, 2019, prior to commencement of this action, Petitioner served written

20 notice of commencement of this action on Respondent in accordance with the requirements of

21 Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of this notice and a proof of

22 service is attached hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by reference.

23 42. On April 16, 2019, Petitioner served the Attorney General of the State of

24 a California ("Attorney General") with a copy of the Petition in accordance with the requirements

25 of Public Resources Code section 21167.7. A true and correct copy of the notice to the Attorney

26 General is attached hereto as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by reference.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 [Violation of California Environmental Quality Act]
00 v 43. Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 42 as though they
were set forth in full herein.

5 44. In adopting the December Approval and March Approval, Metropolitan engaged

6 in a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law under

7 CEQA for a number of reasons, including, without limitation:

8 a. The Approvals constitute a commitment to a project that requires

9 environmental review under CEQA, which Metropolitan failed to perform.

10 b. In violation of CEQA, Metropolitan wrongly determined that the

11 Approvals were exempt. The determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the

12 record. By improperly determining the project was exempt under CEQA, Metropolitan has
LLP INVIA AINMOC 13 foreclosed the development of mitigation measures or project alternatives that could have reduced

14 the project's impacts to the environment.

15 C. The project description fails to describe the whole of the activity that

16 would be carried out as a result of the Approvals.

17 d. A complete description of the Approvals was not presented to the

18 Metropolitan board prior to its adoption of the Approvals which precluded informed decision-

19 making.

20 e. The project description fails to contain specific information about the

21 project sufficient to allow a complete evaluation and review of its environmental impacts,

22 including, without limitation, the sources of water that would be necessary to Metropolitan to

23 fulfill its commitment and the environmental effects associated with obtaining water for those

24 sources.

25 f. By failing to adequately identify the project, Metropolitan made it

26 impossible for the public to adequately evaluate the potential environmental impacts of

27 Metropolitan's approvals.

28 45. Metropolitan had a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to approving the
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 discretionary actions at issue in this Petition. Metropolitan's December Approval and March

2 Approval for action related to the LBDCP failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and

3 the Guidelines.

4 46. By failing entirely to engage in any meaningful review under CEQA, Metropolitan

5 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

6 Consequently, Metropolitan's December Approval and March Approval concerning the project

7 are invalid and must be set aside.

8 47. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

9 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing Metropolitan to vacate the Approvals and directing

10 Metropolitan to analyze the environmental impacts of its commitment to the LBDCP under

11 CEQA in connection with any further action to commit to the LBDCP.

12 48. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that unless Petitioner is
dTI INVAE AHNMOC 13 granted injunctive relief, it will suffer irreparable harm in that the implementation of the Project

14 activities described herein will cause permanent harm to Petitioner, its landowners and water

15 users, and will create adverse environmental impacts.

16 49. IID brings this action in the public interest, and is not seeking relief greater than or

17 different from the relief sought for the general public. If successful, this action would enforce the

18 mandates of CEQA and thus enforce the public's right to adequate environmental review under

19 that statute. IID is entitled to receive attorneys' fees from Metropolitan pursuant to Code of Civil

20 Procedure section 1021.5.

21 PRAYER

22 WHEREFORE, IID respectfully prays for the following relief:

23 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Metropolitan to:

24 a. Vacate and set aside Metropolitan's December Approval and March

25 Approval and all related actions and approvals;

26 b. Comply with CEQA and to take any other action as required by Public

27 Resources Code section 21168.9; and

28 C. Suspend any and all activity pursuant to Metropolitan's December

4 Code section 21168.9;

5 2. For an injunction restraining Metropolitan, and all persons working on its behalf,

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION
Dear Chairwoman Gray:
Please take notice that, pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.5, the Imperial Irrigation District ("IID") intends to file a Petition under provisions of the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA") against The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
(*Metropolitan") challenging approvals by the Board of Directors of Metropolitan that occurred on December 11, 2018, for Board Item No. 8-11 (the "December Approval"), and March 12, 2019 for Board Item 8-1 (the "March Approval").
IID's petition will seek, among other things, the following relief: (1) a writ of mandamus directing Metropolitan to cease and desist from implementing the Lower Basin Drought Contingency Plan, including any interstate and intrastate agreements necessary for such implementation, and vacate and set aside the December Approval and the March Approval until Metropolitan has complied with CEQA; and (2) costs of suit and attorneys' fees.
Very truly yours,

David R.E. Aladjem
