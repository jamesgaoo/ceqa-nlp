FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner and LABORERS' INTERNATIONAL UNION OF NORTH AMERICA

2 LOCAL UNION NO. 220 ("Petitioner") petitions this Court on its own behalf, on behalf of its

3 members, on behalf of the general public and in the public interest pursuant to Code of Civil

4 Procedure §1094.5 and Public Res. Code §21168, or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil

5 Procedure $1085 and Public Res. Code §21168.5, for a writ of mandate directed to Respondents

6 CITY OF SHAFTER, a municipal corporation; CITY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF

7 SHAFTER, a municipal corporation; WAYNE CLAUSEN, PLANNING DIRECTOR OF THE

8 CITY OF SHAFTER, in his official capacity; and DOES I - X, inclusive (collectively,

9 "Respondents"); and Real Parties in Interest THE WONDERFUL COMPANY, LLC, a

10 Delaware limited liability company; WONDERFUL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT LLC, a
11 Delaware limited liability company; and ROES I -X, inclusive (collectively, "Real Parties"),
12 and by this verified petition ("Petition"), allege as follows:

13 INTRODUCTION
14 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge unlawful actions by Respondents, in
15 failing to conduct any environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act
16 ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code section 21000, et seq., of a massive warehouse project proposed by
17 Real Parties in Interest in the City of Shafter ("City"): a 1,004,770 square foot distribution

18 warehouse proposed for 4500 Express Avenue, Shafter, known as the Lot 16 Distribution

19 Facility ("Distribution Warehouse" or "Project").
20 2. Petitioner challenges the City's findings that the Project is exempt from CEQA
21 review under the ministerial exemption.

22 3. The City's Municipal Code grants the Planning Director ample discretionary
23 authority. For example, the City's Municipal Code regarding Design Review provides that the
24 Planning Director may impose "conditions as the Planning Director may deem necessary to
25 ensure compatibility with surrounding uses; to preserve the public health, safety and welfare; and
26 to enable the Planning Director to make the findings necessary for approval." (Shafter
27 Municipal Code $2.80.4). This type of authority is the hallmark of a discretionary action. To the
28 extent the City conducted Design Review on the Project, the City had discretionary authority.

2
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I Further, to the extent the City decided not to conduct Design Review on the Project, that decision

2 was also an exercise of discretionary authority. The City also had discretionary authority under

3 other parts of its Municipal Code. Therefore, CEQA's ministerial exemption does not apply to

4 the Project.

5 4. The City's discretionary authority triggers the need for proper review under

6 CEQA to analyze the Project's environmental impacts, and to impose all feasible mitigation

7 measures to reduce those impacts.

8 PARTIES

5. Petitioner Laborers' International Union of North America Local Union No. 220

10 ("LIUNA") is a non-profit laborers' and public service employees' union with thousands of

11 members living in Kern County and many members living in the City of Shafter. LIUNA and its

12 members in Kern County have several distinct legally cognizable interests in this project.

13 LIUNA members enjoy the natural environment of Kern County and the City of Shafter in
14 particular. LIUNA members live in and around the City of Shafter and enjoy clean air, clean

15 water, peaceful repose and diversity of species of plants and animals. As members of the public,
16 moreover, LIUNA members possess an ownership interest in public resources present in the

17 Shafter area including but not limited to the rare and protected species therein. The interests of
18 LIUNA members are unique and will be directly impacted by the project. LIUNA's interests are

19 not adequately represented by other parties.

20 6. Respondent City of Shafter ("City") is the "lead agency" for the Project for

21 purposes of CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for
22 conducting environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply

23 with CEQA.

24 7. Respondent City Council of the City of Shafter ("City Council") is the governing

25 body of the City. The City Council and its members are sued here in their official capacities.

26 8. Respondent Wayne Clausen is the Planning Director of the City of Shafter. Mr.

27 Clausen approved the Project and issued a Notice of Exemption from CEQA review for the

28 Project. Mr. Clausen is sued in his official capacity.

3
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 9. On October 24, 2018, the County of Kern posted a Notice of Exemption for the
2 Distribution Warehouse. The Notice of Exemption identifies Real Party The Wonderful
3 Company as the applicant for the Project and the only real party in interest pursuant to Public
4 Resources Code $21167.6.5.

5 10. Real Party in Interest The Wonderful Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability

6 company, is listed on the City's Notice of Exemption as the applicant for the Project. Real Party
7 has a principal place of business at 11444 West Olympic Boulevard, 10th Floor, Los Angeles,
8 California, 90064.

9 11. Real Party in Interest Wonderful Real Estate Development LLC, a Delaware
10 limited liability company, is the Project applicant and a recipient of the approvals granted by
11 Respondents for the Project. Real Party has a principal place of business at 11444 West Olympic
12 Boulevard, 10th Floor, Los Angeles, California, 90064. Real Party has a place of business at
13 4805 Centennial Plaza Way, Bakersfield, CA 93312.
14 12. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities
15 sued as Respondents DOES I through X, inclusive, nor of Real Parties in Interest ROES I
16 through X, inclusive, and therefore sues these respondents and real parties by their fictitious
17 names. Petitioner will amend the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of the Doe
18 respondents and Roe real parties in interest along with appropriate charging allegations when
19 such information has been ascertained.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 13. This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Government Code
22 section 11523, Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

23• Alternatively, this Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
24 section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

25 14. Venue is proper in this court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393,
26 394, and 395 because Respondents include a city and public officers of a city, the proposed
27 Project is located in Kern County and Petitioner's cause, or some part of that cause, arises in that

28 county.

4
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 15. This action is timely filed under Public Resources Code section 21167(d) and

2 CEQA Guidelines section 15112(c)(5).

3 16. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying

4 with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5 by serving prior notice of the

5 complaint in this action.

6 17. Petitioner has provided notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State

7 of California, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

8 Procedure section 388.

9 18. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
10 21167.6 by filing a notice of its election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings
11 relating to this action.

12 19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

13 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

14 exemption determination and approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies,
15 Respondents' decision will remain in effect in violation of state law.

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 20. On information and belief, in October 2018, the City issued building permits to

18 Real Party The Wonderful Company, LLC, and/or Wonderful Real Estate Development LLC, for

19 the Distribution Warehouse.

20 21. The Distribution Warehouse includes a massive one million (1,004,770) square

21 foot distribution warehouse proposed for 4500 Express Avenue, Shafter, known as the Lot 16

22 Distribution Facility.

23 22. The Building Permits were issued by the Planning Director without any public
24 hearing and without any public notice.
25 23. On October 24, 2018, the County of Kern posted a Notice of Exemption (NOE)

26 for the Distribution Warehouse Project.

27 24. The NOE states that the Project applicant and owner is The Wonderful Company,
28 LLC.

5
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

25. The NOE states that the Distribution Warehouse is exempt entirely from all
2 review under CEQA as a "ministerial" project.

3 26. No public hearing was held prior to the issuance of the Notice of Exemption.

4 27. The Shafter Municipal Code ("Shafter Code") makes clear that the City has ample
authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project.

6 28. The City has authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project pursuant

7 to Shafter Code section 2.80, Design Review. The purpose and intent of Design Review includes

8 to "[rJeasonably ensure that construction ... including ... industrial development" does not have
an adverse impact. (Shafter Code section 2.80.1.a). Pursuant to section 2.80, the City Planning
10 Commission may impose conditions on the Project "to preserve the public health, safety and

11 Welfare" (Shafter Code section 2.80.3.b). The Planning Director may impose "such other
12 conditions as the Planning Director may deem necessary to ensure compatibility with
13 surrounding uses; to preserve the public health, safety and welfare; and to enable the Planning

14 Director to make the findings necessary for approval." (Shafter Code section 2.80.4).
15 29. Design Review affords the City discretionary authority over the Project. If the
16 City decided not to conduct Design Review on the Project, that decision was also an exercise of
17 discretionary authority.

18 30. The City has authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project pursuant
19 to Shafter Code section 10, General Development Standards, which applies to "any land division
20 or land use application which authorizes, or would authorize by its approval, new construction
21 ..." (Shafter Code section 10.20). "It is the purpose and the intent of the general development
22 standards to ensure that new land uses and development will contribute to and be compatible

23 with existing and future development in the surrounding vicinity in a manner which will enhancel
24 the quality of life for City residents, employers and visitors. It is further intended, that all
25  proposed development is consistent with the goals, policies, objectives and implementation
26 programs of the General Plan." (Shafter Code section 10.10).
27 31. The City has authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project pursuant
28 to Shafter Code section 10.40, Circulation, Transportation, and Trails Facilities. Section

6
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10.40.2.b provides: "The design of any new street system proposed as part of any new

2 development shall, in the opinion of the City Engineer, relate to the established street pattern in

3 the area adjoining the proposed development." Shafter Code Section 10.40.2.e, provides,

4 "Additional rights-of-way or easements shall be provided when the City Engineer determines

5 that such additional rights-of-way or easements are necessary to accommodate roadway slopes,

6 drainage structures, and other facilities related to improvements required for a development."

7 32. The City has authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project pursuant

8 to Shafter Code section 10.100, Grading. Section 10.100 provides, "Whenever a tentative map

9 or other residential, commercial or industrial development is approved, which will require

10 grading or other preparation of the soil, the City may impose conditions relating to grading on

11 the approval of the development. Such grading conditions shall be in addition to any other

12 provisions of the Building Code applicable to the project. Such conditions shall be included by

13 the Building Official or City Engineer in any grading permit thereafter issued. Such conditions
14 may include, but are not be limited to, the following: 1. A requirement that lands slope toward

15 rather than away from the street. 2. Requirements for planting and landscaping of slopes. 3.

16 Requirements for the irrigation of slopes. 4. Limitations on the amount of soil to be imported or

17 exported from the site. 5. A designation of the streets over which trucks or equipment may travel

18 for the purpose of importing or exporting soil. 6. A limitation on the periods during which

19 grading operations may occur. 7. Such other conditions as will facilitate an orderly development

20 of the property in accordance with the provisions of the General Plan and the project's approval."
21 (emphasis added).

22 33. The City has authority to impose discretionary conditions on the Project pursuant

23 to Shafter Code section 12.30, Air Quality, which provides, "No operation or activity shall cause

24• the emission of any smoke, fly ash, dust, fumes, vapors, gases or other forms of air pollution

25 which can cause material damage to health, or property, or which can cause excessive dirt on any

26 other lot. No emission shall be permitted which exceeds the requirements of the San Joaquin

27 Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District and/or the requirements of any Air Quality Plan

28 adopted by the City."

7
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. The City had discretion to require a conditional use permit ("CUP") for the

2 Project pursuant to Shafter Code section 2.50, which provides that a CUP may be required for

3 any project having "some special impact or uniqueness, such that their effect on the surrounding

4 environment cannot be determined in advance of the use being proposed for a particular

5 location." (Shafter Code 2.50.1). Section 2.50 requires a hearing before the Planning

6 Commission and the Commission may impose conditions "deemed necessary to protect the

7 public health, safety, and general welfare." (Shafter Code 2.50.6).

8 35. The City exercised its discretion not to impose conditions of approval despite
having ample authority under the above and other provisions of the Shafter Code.

10 36. Respondent City has not described or analyzed the proposed Project's potential

11 environmental impacts in an environmental review document prepared and circulated pursuant to

'12 CEQA.

13 37. Cities and Counties throughout California analyze similar warehouse projects
14 pursuant to CEQA to analyze and mitigate project impacts prior to construction. See, e.g.,

15 Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408 (CEQA review for
16 500,000 square foot warehouse project).
17 38. The Project will have highly significant environmental impacts, including impacts
18 on traffic, air pollution, greenhouse gases, and other impacts. This is apparent from the fact that is

19 the Project vastly exceeds the size requiring permits to reduce air pollution pursuant to the San

20 Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District Rule 9510 - Indirect Source Rule. See, e.g.,

21 Coalition for Clean Air v. VWR International, LLC, (E.D.Cal. 2013), 922 F. Supp. 2d 1089.
22 39. The San Joaquin Valley APCD has adopted an air pollution control regulation for
23 indirect sources of particulate matter (PM-10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the Central Valley.
24 The rule applies to any development project which upon buildout will include greater than

25 100,000 square-feet of heavy industrial space or greater than 25,000 square-feet of light
26 industrial space. Rule 9510, §2.1. "Indirect sources" include any facility, building, structure, or
27 installation, or combination thereof, which attracts or generates mobile source activity that results in

28 emissions of any pollutant, or precursor thereof, for which there is a state ambient standard. Id.,

8
FIRST AMENDED PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 §3.17. Rule 95i0 would significantly reduce air pollution from the Project. Rule 9510 requires

2 implementation of site-specific discretionary measures to reduce operational emissions by 33% for
nitrogen oxides and 50% for particulate matter. (Rule 9510, Sect. 6.2)

40. Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court vacate any and all Project approvals

5 issued by the City for the Project unless and until the City fully complies with CEQA, declare

6 any initiation of construction by Real Parties to be in violation of CEQA, and stay Respondents

7 and Real Parties from undertaking any further approvals or ground disturbing activities pending

8 their full compliance with CEQA.
41. This action was timely filed. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate
10 remedy in the ordinary course of law. Money damages cannot be ascertained. If the approval is

11 not set aside, Real Parties will significantly and unlawfully erect a massive warehouse with no

12 environmental analysis, causing immediate and irreparable harm to area residents and Petitioner.

13 The Respondents have the ability to correct their violations of environmental law, but have failed

14 and refused to do so.

15

16 LEGAL BACKGROUND

17 The California Environmental Quality Act

18 42. CEQA is intended to provide the fullest possible protection to the environment.

19 CEQA requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any discretionary project that

20 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. (PRC §§ 21002.1(a), 21100(a),

21 21151(a); 14 CCR $§ 15064(a)(1), (f)(1), 15367 ("lead agency" is the "public agency which has

22 the principal responsibility for carrying out or approving a project").) "[CEQA] requires the

23 preparation of an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that

24 the project may have a significant environmental impact." (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles

25 (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75; Communities for a Better Environment v. South Coast Air Quality

26 Management District (2010) 48 Cal. 4th 310, 319; PRC § 21080(c)-(d).) The "fair argument"

27 standard establishes a low threshold for requiring the preparation of an EIR. (No Oil, Inc., supra,

28 13 Cal.3d at 75; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 310.)

9 FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 43. "The purpose of an [EIR] is to provide public agencies and the public in general

2 with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the

3 environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized;

4 and to indicate alternatives to such a project." (PRC § 21061; see also § 21002.1.) An EIR

5 "serves not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the public that it is being

6 protected." (14 CCR 15003(b).) "The requirement of a detailed statement helps insure the
7 integrity of the process of decision by precluding stubborn problems or serious criticisms from

8 being swept under the rug." (Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 122

9 Cal.App.3d 813, 820.) "The EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed

10 self-government." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California
11 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) "The EIR process will enable the public to determine the

12 environmental and economic values of their elected and appointed officials thus allowing for

13 appropriate action come election day should a majority of voters disagree." (People v. County of

14 Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 842.)

15 44. The CEQA Guidelines define "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a

16 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

17 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. . . ." (14 CCR § 15378(a).) Projects

18 include "[a]n activity undertaken by person which is supported in whole or in part through

19 public agency contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more

20 public agencies." 14 CCR § 15378(a)(2). Projects also include "[a]n activity involving the
21 issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or

22 more public agencies." 14 CCR § 15378(a)(3). "Project" is given a broad interpretation in order
23 to maximize protection of the environment. (McQueen v. Bd. of Dirs. (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d

24 1136, 1143. A local agency's entering into an agreement-to vacate a street that would serve as an

25 access road to a proposed project is itself a project triggering review under CEQA. (County of
26 Amador v. City of Plymouth (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 1089.)

27 45. CEQA applies to discretionary projects and approvals. (§ 21080, subds. (a),

28 (b)(1); Guideline 15268, subd. (a); Health First v. March Joint Powers Authority (2009) 174

10
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Cal.App.4th 1135, 1142-1143.) "The statutory distinction between discretionary and purely

2 ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a

3 way that would respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional equivalent, environmental

4 review would be meaningless exercise." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
(1997) 16 Cal.4th 105.)

6 46. The CEQA Guidelines describe "discretionary" projects as those requiring "the

7 exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or

8 disapprove a particular activity, as distinguished from situations where the public agency or body
9 merely has to determine whether there has been conformity with applicable statutes, ordinances,

10 or regulations." (Guidelines, § 15357). A decision is discretionary when it involves relatively

11 personal decisions addressed to the sound judgment and enlightened choice of the administrator.

12 (People v. Department of Housing & Community Dev. (1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 185, 193). A

13 project only qualifies as ministerial "when a private party can legally compel approval without
14 any changes in the design of its project which might alleviate adverse environmental
15 consequences." (Friends of Westwood, at 267; accord, Miller, 13 Cal.App.4th at 1141-1142.)

16 "Conversely, where the agency possesses enough authority (that is, discretion) to deny or modify

17 the proposed project on the basis of environment consequences the EIR might conceivably

18 uncover, the permit process is 'discretionary' within the meaning of CEQA." (Friends of

19 Westwood, at 272.)

20 47. The Guidelines treat projects of a mixed nature as discretionary. "Where a project
21 involves an approval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary

22 action, the project will be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of

23 CEQA." (Guidelines, § 15268, subd. (d); Miller v. City of Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal.App.4th

24 1118, 1139, Friends of Westwood, 191 Cal.App.3d at pp. 270-271; Friends of Gill, 121

25 Cal.App.3d at 211.) Furthermore, "where there are doubts whether a project is ministerial or

26 discretionary, they should be resolved in favor of the latter characterization." (Citizens for Non-

27 Toxic Pest Control, 187 Cal.App.3d at 1583.)

28

11
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

16 finding that the project is ministerially exempt from CEQA.

21 pursuant to CEQA to characterize any significant environmental, traffic,

22 air quality, hazardous material, cumulative, growth inducing, or land use

23 impacts of the project;

24 C. The City erroneously made no effort pursuant to CEQA to analyze and

25 adopt reasonably feasible mitigation measures to reduce the significant

26 environmental impacts of the project.; and

27

28

Or in the alternative CCP §1094.5.
