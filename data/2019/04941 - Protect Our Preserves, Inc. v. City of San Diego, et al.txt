MANDATE UNDER PROPOSITION A,

15 Defendants and Respondents; THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, AND OTHER LAWS

16 THE PRESERVE AT TORREY HIGHLANDS

17 LLC; and DOES 101 through 200,

18 Real Parties in Interest.

19

20 Plaintiff and Petitioner PROTECT OUR PRESERVES, INC. ("Petitioner"), alleges as follows:

Parties

21 1. Petitioner is a not-for-profit corporation formed and operating under the laws of the State
22 of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in, or near, the Torrey Highlands community

23

24 of the City of San Diego, California, and has an interest in, among other things, protecting Torrey
Highland's environment and quality of lifc.

25 2.

26 Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO ("CITY") is "public agency" under
Section 21063 of Public Resources Code and a "local government" under Section 30109 of the Public
27 Resources Code. As a "public agency," CITY is required to comply with California environmental
28 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.

3. Defendant and Real Party in Interest The Preserve at Torrey Highlands, LLC, is the

2 applicant for the project that is the subject of this lawsuit.

3 4. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents/Real Parties in Interest
identified as DOES 1 through 200 are unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to
amend this pleading in order to allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.
Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of the fictitiously named
Defendants/Respondents has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the project that is the

8 subject of this lawsuit and that each of the fictitiously named Defendants/Real Parties in Interests is an
9 applicant for the project has some other cognizable interest in the project.
10 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

11 5. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
12 section 21168 and/or 21168.5, as applicable; Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060 et seq. and 1084
13 et seq.; the California Constitution; and the common law, among other provisions of law.
14 6. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law; by way of
15 example and without limitation, one or more of Petitioner's members submitted written comments to
16 Defendants/Respondents prior to the close of the August 5, 2019 public hearing on the Project.
17 7. Defendants'/Respondents' conduct in approving this Project without complying with

18 CEQA and other applicable laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this
19 pleading, they failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
20 8. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since
21 its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
22 Defendants'/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other applicable laws. Defendants'/Respondents'

23 approval of the Project also rests on their failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in
24 accordance with applicable laws. Even when Defendants/Respondents are permitted or required by law
25 to exercise its discretion in approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear, present, a
26 ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and a in a manner consistent with those
27 laws. Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the
28 Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 2

1 Defendants/Respondents have failed and refused to do so and have exercised its discretion beyond the
2 limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

3 8. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants'/Respondents' fulfillment of

4 all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.

5 9. Venue in this Court is proper because the obligations, liabilities, and violations of law

6 alleged in this pleading occurred in the County of San Diego in the State of California.

7 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations

8 10. This lawsuit is being commenced not more than 30 days after the notice authorized by
9 Public Resources section 21152(a) was and could lawfully have been filed with the County Clerk,

10 11. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on

11 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct
12 copy of the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

13 12. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General

14 not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
15 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

16 Background Information
17 13. In November 1985, CITY's electorate approved Proposition A. Known as the Managed
18 Growth Initiative, it gave voters a say in the future of the North City Future Urbanizing Area with the
19 goal of saving "our shining city by the sea" from becoming "a city with runaway growth, traffic jams,
20 [and] overcrowded schools and parks." A true and correct copy of Proposition A is attached to this
21 pleading as Exhibit "B."

22 a. Specifically, Section 1 of Proposition A stated: "No property shall be changed

23 from the 'future urbanizing' land use designation in the Progress Guide and General Plan to any other

24 land use designation and the provisions restricting development in the future urbanizing area shall not
25 be amended except by a majority vote of the people voting on the change or amendment at a City wide
26 election thereon."

27

28

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

b. Section 2(a) of Proposition A stated: "Progress Guide and General Plan shall

2 mean the Progress Guide and General Plan of the City of San Diego, including text and maps, as the
3 same existed on August 1, 1984."

C. Section 2(b) of Proposition A stated: ''Change in Designation' or 'change from
5 Future Urbanizing' shall mean removal of any area of land from the future urbanizing designation."

6 14. Heeding the voters' will, in 1996 CITY's leaders brought forward and approved the
7| Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan ("THSP"), through which the community negotiated changes that
8 allowed some developments to proceed in parts of the area protected by Proposition A while imposing
9 tighter development restrictions in other parts. The THSP compromise was memorialized in Ordinance
10 no. 0-18333 (New Series): An ordinance submitting to the qualified voters of the City of San Diego
11 at the Special Municipal election to be held on November 5, 1996, one proposition amending the
12 official phased development map in the City's Progress Guide and General Plan within Subarea IV of
13 the North City Future Urbanizing Area to change the designation of the 1,134 acres known as Torrey
14 Highlands from "Future Urbanizing" to "Planned Urbanizing." According to Ordinance no. 0-18333,
15| "approval of this change of designation in no way permits any other portion of the North City Future
16 Urbanizing Area to have a change of designation without a separate vote of the people." A true and
17 correct copy of Ordinance no. 0-18333 (New Series) is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "C."
18 15. As submitted to CITY's voters, the ballot proposition for Ordinance no. 0-18333 was
19 known as Proposition H. In November 1996, CITY's electorate approved Proposition H and the THSP
20 became effective.

21 16. On or about August 5 and September 10, 2019, CITY approved Item 202: The Preserve
22 at Torrey Highlands - Project No. 442880 ("Project").
23 a. The Project was approved in four sub-parts:
24 i. Subitem-A (0-2020-29) Introduced August 5, 2019; To be adopted
25 September 10, 2019: Introduction of an Ordinance changing 11.10 acres located approximately
26 one-quarter mile south of State Route 56 along the west side of the future planned extension of Camino
27 Del Sur, within the Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan, in the City of San Diego, California, from the
28 AR-1-1 Zone to the IP-3-1 Zone, as defined by San Diego Municipal Code Chapter 13, Article 1,

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

Division 6 and repealing Ordinance No. 0-18691(New Series), adopted December 9, 1997, insofar as
2 Ordinance No. 0-18691 (New Series) conflicts with this ordinance.
ii. Subitem-B (R-2020-37) Adopted as Resolution R-312612: Approving
an amendment to the Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan to re-designate land located approximately
one-quarter mile south of State Route 56 along the west side of the future planned extension of Camino

6 Del Sur from Commercial Limited to Employment Center.

7 iii. Subitem-C (R-2020-38) Adopted as Resolution R-312613: Resolution
8 certifying the Environmental Impact Report No. 442880 and adopting the Mitigation, Monitoring, and
9 Reporting Program for the Preserve at Torrey Highlands, Project No. 442880; Directing the Clerk to
10 file a Notice of Determination with the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors for the County of San Diego
11 regarding the project.
12 iv. Subitem-D (R-2020-39) Adopted as Resolution R-312614: Resolution
13 granting Planned Development Permit No. 2161983 and Site Development Permit No. 1689641 for the
14 Preserve at Torrey Highlands Project No. 442880 (recession of Conditional Use Permit No. 4915, Site
15 Development Permit No. 49156, and Planned Development Permit No. 10965).
16 17. In response to Petitioner's written comments and other public comments at the August
17 5, 2019 City Council Meeting, a representative of the CITY's Planning Department summarily
18 dismissed Petitioner's concerns without discussion.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

20 Illegal Approval and Adoption of Project (Against All Defendants/Respondents)
21 18. The preceding allegations in this pleading are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

22 19. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
23 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):
24 a, The Project violates Proposition A and/or Proposition H. In particular:
25 i. Proposition A was approved by voters in November 1985 and amended
26 the City of San Diego Progress Guide and General Plan, as it existed on August 1, 1984, to require that

27 certain land areas which are designated as "future urbanizing" not be re-designated without voter

28 approval,

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 5

ii. Proposition H was approved by voters in November 1996 and amended

2 the official phased development map in the City's Progress Guide and General Plan within Subarea IV

3 of the North City Future Urbanizing Area to change the designation of 1,134 acres known as Torrey
Highlands from "Future Urbanizing" to "Planned Urbanizing" while preserving the right of the voters
to approve future changes in designation, consistent with requirements of Proposition A.

6 iii. On or about August 5, 2019, the City Council approved the Project and,

7 inter alia, approved an amendment to the THSP to re-designate certain land within the THSP from
"Commercial Limited" to "Employment Center" without seeking a majority vote of the people at a City-
9 wide election.

10 iv. The re-designation of certain land under the Project is not neutral or more

11 restrictive in terms of permitting development.

12 V. The re-designation of certain land under the Project from "Commercial

13 Limited" to "Employment Center" represents an increase in use intensity.
14 vi. The subject matter of the Project falls squarely within the THSP and

15 within the scope of Proposition A's prohibition against changes and amendments made without voter
16 approval.

17 V. As a result of Defendants'/Respondents' violation of Proposition A and/or
18 Proposition H, CITY's voters have been denied their right to vote on a development proposal that the
19 law requires them to approve for the proposal's approval by Defendants/Respondents has any legal •*
20 force or effect.

21 b. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:
22 i. CEQA requires that every environmental impact report ("EIR") identify
23 and analyze the significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project, giving due
24 consideration to both short-term and long-term impacts, providing decision-makers with enough
25 information to enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely
26 consequences of their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to
27 participate meaningfully in the project-approval and environmental-review process. CEQA also requires

28 that every EIR identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives to a proposed project. CEQA

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC, Page 6

further requires that every EIR identify and analyze all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed
2 project's significant adverse environmental impacts. In each respect, CEQA mandates that the analyses
3 contained in an EIR and all decisions of the lead agency based on the report be supported by substantial

4 evidence in the administrative record.

ii. The Project's EIR fails to provide adequate identification and analysis
6 of the significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project. Further, neither the analysis of impacts
7 in the Project's EIR nor Defendants'/Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported
8 by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
9 ili. Additionally and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate
10 identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project. Further, neither the
11 analysis of alternatives in the EIR nor Defendants'/Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect
12 is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

13 iv. Additionally and alternatively, the Project's EIR fails to provide adequate
14 identification and analysis of measures to mitigate the Project's significant adverse environmental
15 impacts and fails to eliminate or substantially reduce all such impacts. Further, neither the analysis of
16 mitigation measures nor Defendants'/Respondents' certification of the EIR in this respect is supported
17 by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

18 V. Defendants'/Respondents' failure to provide adequate identification and
19 analysis of the significant adverse environmental impacts, reasonable range of alternatives, and
20 mitigation measures for the Project constitutes multiple violations of CEQA.
21 vi. CEQA requires every lead agency to identify all adverse environmental
22: impacts of a proposed project that will be significant and determine whether such impacts can be
23 avoided or mitigated. With respect to any such impacts that cannot feasibly be avoided or mitigated,
24 the lead agency must make at least one written finding that there are specific overriding economic, legal,
25 social, technological, or other benefits of the proposed project that outweighs the impacts.
26 vii. Defendants/Respondents approved the Project based on one or more
27 written findings that there exist considerations outweighing the Project's significant adverse
28 environmental impacts, but there is not substantial evidence in the administrative record to support all

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 7

such findings. Additionally and alternatively, Defendants/Respondents approved the Project based on

2 one or more non-written findings that such considerations exist. Defendants/Respondents also failed
to make all required written findings regarding the Project's impacts as required by CEQA.
vili. Defendants'/Respondents' approval of the Project based on one or more
written findings unsupported by evidence in the administrative record and their failure to make all
written findings required regarding the Project's impacts constitute multiple violations of CEQA.

7 ix. As a result of Defendants'/Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioner,
8 its members, and the general public have been harmed insofar as the responsible decision-makers were
9 not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project, and insofar as
10 Petitioner, its members, and the general public did not have an opportunity to participate meaningfully
11 in the analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.
12 20. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Defendants/Respondents over the
13 Project's legal force and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because
14 it violates CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws. Defendants/Respondents dispute
15 Petitioner's contention. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's legal force
16 and effect (if any).
17 Prayer

18 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against all
19 Defendants/Respondents/Real Parties in Interest (and any and all persons who oppose Petitioner):

20 A. A judgment determining or declaring that Defendants/Respondents have not promptly

21 and fully complied with the requirements of the CEQA, Proposition A, the California Constitution,
22 and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to the Project, that there must be full compliance
23 therewith before final approval and implementation of the Project may occur, and/or that the Project's
24 approval has no legal force or effect until there has been full compliance therewith;
25 B. A writ of mandate ordering Defendants/Respondents to promptly and fully comply with
26 all applicable laws with regard to the Project; and

27 C. Preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants/Respondents (and
28 any and all persons acting at the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them)

2 from taking any action on any aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and

3 until Defendants/Respondents have complied with all applicable laws, as determined by the Court.

CITY OF SAN DIEGO
Proposition A
(This proposition will appear on the ballot in the fallowing tarm.)

CITY OF SAN DIEGO INITIATIVE MEASURE, AMENDS THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO PROGRESS GUIDE AND GENERAL PLAN. Shall the City of San Diego Progress Guide and General Plan be amended by adding restrictions requiring that land areas which are designated as ''future urbanizing' not be redesignated without voter approval?

•This proposition requires a majority vote.
Add. to the Progrèss Guide and General Pian for the City of San Diego, Document

i Number 764585, at page 35 immediately following the caption "Future Urbanizing Areas" the language of the proposed initiative measure.which is underlined.
Future Urbanizing Areas *
Land within the future Urbanizing designation which is zoned agricultural or low density residential-recreational use for extended periods of time should be given tax relief through preferential tax assessments. This can be accomplished through the use of the Williamson Act which requires the designation of land as an "agricu|tural preserve" or as open space pursuant to the General Plan or specific plans based on the overall program to guide.growth. The designation of land in this category is not permanent,; it is an interim or urban reserve de signation. Its purpose is to preclude premature develop- ment and to guide urbanization.
Sectlon 1. "'No property shall be changed from the "future urbanizing" land use
designation in the Progress Gulde and General Plan to any other' land use•designation
and the provisions restrictinig development in the future urbanizing area shall not be
• amended except by majority vote of the people voting on the change or amendment at •.

i a City wide election thereon."
Section 2. Definitions. "For purposes of this Initiative measure, the following words
and phrases shall have the following meanings:
(a) "Progress Guide and General Plan shall mean the Progress Guide and General

1, 1984". Plan of the Çity.of San Diego, including text and maps, as the same existed on August

(b) "Change in Designation" or "changed from 'Future Urbanizing" shall mean the ..•

removal of any area of land from the future urbanizing designation".
(c) "Amendment" or "amended" as used in Section 1 shall mean any proposal to
amend the text or maps of the Progress Guide and General Plan affecting the future
urbanizing' designation as the same existed in the Progress Guide and General Pian on
August 1, 1984 or the land subject to said designation on August 1, 1984, except
amendments which are neutral or make the. designation more restrictive in terms of
permitting development".

ARGUMENT* IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION
SUPPORT THE CITIZEN'S RIGHT TO DÉCIDE
San Diego is at a crossroads: a shining city by the sea or a city with rünaway growth, traffic jams, overcrowded schools and parks.
Influenced by narrow. special Interesta a City Council majority has conaistently 5

violated our adopted Growth Management Plan. Unable to say "no" to powerful development interests, the Councll has allowed the exception to become the rule.
Oür current Growth Management Plan sets aside thousands of acres to provide job opportunities and housing as they are neéded • both now and In the tuture. Yet, since 1979 the City Council has aquandered more than half of this precious resource.

These irresponsible actions will result in: RUNAWAY GROWTH
TRAFFIC JAMS
POLLUTED AIR
OVERCROWDED SCHOOLS •
HIGHER SERVICE COSTS The citizens must regain control of San Diego's futurel
PROPOSITION A provides needed checks on the influence of special Interests and assures accountability of our elected representatives. Just as government was unwill- ing to curb spending prior to Proposition 13, government is now unwilling to prevent the "Los Angelization" of San Diego.
Don't be misled by the expensive media campaign waged by our opponents who seek to bulldoze precious canyons and Increase traffic congestion, The fact is, San Diego's current community plans provide for a surpius of housing beyond the year 2000, and the Chamber of Commerce confirms that thousands of acres of land for job producing industry are currently avallable in our city.
PROPOSITIÓN • A •does not chänge the existing public review process. The City Council could still say "no" to requests to violate.our Growth Management Plan but if they say "yes", YOU WILL HAVE THE FINAL VOTE. The undersigned represent bipartisan citizen's ettort to save our neighborhoods and•prevent urban sprawl.

We'll Pay Higher Taxes
New houses mean higher taxes.
Overcrowded neighborhoods mean we must pay for more parks, streets, sewers, traffic lights, police and fire protection. The Mayor's own Task Force Report on Growth Management says San Diego will get 100,000 new homes over the next 15 years. If'A' passes, almost all new housing will be forced into existing neighborhoods.

There's a Better Way Than 'A'
• Proposition A tries to offer solutions, but in the process it causes far bigger problems, problems its supporters never even thought about.
Says the TRIBUNE: "It goes too far. It is not reasonable and responsible. It may not be constitutional._It will certainly lead to a court battle and could be nullified,"
The TIMES' San Diego edition, In opposing 'A*, calls it "cumbersome" and suggests, other solutions for managing growth.
