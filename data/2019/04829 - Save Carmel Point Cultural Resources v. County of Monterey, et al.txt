22 Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources petitions this Court for a writ a of mandate.

23 Introduction

24 Petitioner alleges as follows:

25 1. Carmel Point is a small area with a rocky coastline that separates the

26 main Carmel Beach from the smaller Carmel River State Beach. Carmel Point is rich

27 with archeological resources and tribal cultural resources. The resources are protected

28 by the California Environmental Quality Act and by the Carmel Area Land Use Plan

1
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. County PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 policies applicable to Carmel Point. A map generally showing the area is attached as

2 Exhibit A to this petition.

3 2. This action challenges the actions of the County of Monterey Board of

4 Supervisors to approve development of three houses with three underground habitable

5 spaces that require extensive excavation without first complying with California laws

6 that protect for all citizens the archeological resources and tribal cultural resources.

7 The projects are proposed for three vacant contiguous lots on Carmel Point.

8 3. This action is brought under the California Environmental Quality Act

9 (CEQA) and the Coastal Act. CEQA protects tribal cultural resources and archeological

10 resources. Carmel Point is in the coastal zone. Respondents adopted the Carmel Area

11 Land Use Plan (LUP) under the Coastal Act. The Carmel Area Land Use Plan contains

12 mandatory protections for the archaeological resources. The County in approving the

13 projects did not take adequate steps under the laws to determine and protect the
14 resources and to comply with CEQA and to ensure that the projects would be
15 consistent with the Carmel Area Land Use Plan.

16 4. The three projects are located in recorded archaeological site

17 CA-MNT-17. CA-MNT-17 is the oldest archaeological site in Monterey County, and is

18 among the oldest on the central California coast. The earliest radio carbon date for an

19 item found in CA-MNT-17 is in excess of 9,400 years before present. The County initial

20 studies state that "The record shows clear evidence of the archaeological significance

21 CA-MNT-17 holds. Breschini and Haversat, arguably the most knowledgeable,

22 contemporary archaeologists on the [Carmel] Point, a have made a case for the site's

23 significance and its inclusion in the National Register." The County records state that

24 "Significant archaeological resources have been found, including human remains at

25 multiple sites" in the neighborhood.

26 5. The three vacant lots at issue have never been developed. The three

27 projects, as approved, include extensive excavation for large habitable spaces below

28 ground level. The below-ground development would be in addition to the ground floors.

2
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The below-ground spaces are proposed for wine cellars, movie theatres, additional
2 bedrooms and bathrooms, and other discretionary uses. The enclosed below-ground
3 areas of the houses would be 2,413, 1,687, and 1,366 square feet, respectively,
4 according to the plans.

5 Jurisdiction

6 6. The three projects are located in the County of Monterey and the County
7 of Monterey is a local agency in the County of Monterey. Venue is appropriate in the

8 Superior Court of the County of Monterey and this Court has jurisdiction over this writ
action under section 1094.5 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, and under sections
10 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

11 Parties

12 7. Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set
13 forth above as if fully set forth herein.

14 8. Petitioner SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES is an
15| unincorporated association under California law. Petitioner and its members are
16 beneficially interested in the way and manner that land use decisions are made and in
17 the environmental consequences of development at Carmel Point, including the
18 impacts of excavation on archeological resources and tribal cultural resources.

19 Petitioner participated in the administrative proceedings of the County in writing and in
20 person and has standing to pursue this action.

21 9. Respondent COUNTY OF MONTEREY is a political subdivision of the
22 State of California that is the lead agency under CEQA for the three combined
23 development permit applications at issue and is responsible for ensuring that the
24 approved project are consistent with the Carmel Area Local Coastal Plan. Respondent
25 MONTEREY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is the governing board of the
26 County that approved board resolutions 19-121 and 19-122 that adopted the mitigated
27 negative declarations and approved the three projects at issue.

SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 10. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that PIETRO

2 FAMILY INVESTMENTS LP is a limited partnership registered with the State of

3 California and was the owner of the property at the time the three project applications

4 were submitted to the County. Pietro Family Investments, LP is named as "Project

5 Title" for two projects on the County notices of determination filed for the three projects,

6 and is named herein as one of the real parties, potential parties and/or recipients of the

7 approvals by the County in that capacity. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167.6.5.)

8 11. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that VALLEY

9 POINT LLC is a limited liability company registered with the State of California and is

10 named in the "Project Title" as "Valley Point LLC (26346 Valley View Ave.)" on one of

11 the County notices of determination filed for the three projects, and is a property owner

12 of one of the project sites having acquired it from Pietro Family Investments LP during

13 the County review process. The entity is named herein as one of the real parties,

14 potential parties and/or recipients of the approvals by the County in that capacity. (Pub.

15 Resources Code, § 21167.6.5.)

16 12. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that CHRIS

17 ADAMSKI is an individual and is named as the project "applicant" on the Countys

18 original and revised initial studies which say "Name of Applicant: Chris Adamski,

19 Emerson Development Group Inc." for PLN170611 and "Name of Applicant: Chris
20 Adamski" for PLN170612 and PLN170613. Board resolution no. 19-121 states

21 "PLN170611 PIETRO FAMILY INVESTMENTS LP (CHRIS ADAMSKI)" and describes

22 a "Combined Development Permit (CDP). . . at 26307 Isabella Avenue [PLN170611 /

23 Pietro Family Investments LP (Chris Adamski)" and the attached plans state the

24 "owner" of 26307 Isabella Avenue is "Chris Adamski [1I] Emerson Development Group,

25 Inc." The plans attached to board resolution no. 19-122 state the "owner" of 26346

26 Valley View is "Chris Adamski [1I] Emerson Development Group, Inc." Mr. Adamski is

27 named herein as one of the real parties, potential parties and/or recipients of the

28 approvals by the County in that capacity. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167.6.5.)

SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDA TE

1 13. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
2 EMERSON DEVELOPMENT GROUP, INC. is a corporation registered with the State of
3 California and is named as the applicant for the projects on the County's original and
4 revised initial studies for PLN170611 which say "Name of Applicant: Chris Adamski,
5 Emerson Development Group Inc.," and the plans attached to board resolution no.
6 19-122 for PLN170612 and PLN170613 state the "owner" of 26338 Valley View Ave. is

11 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
12 ANTHONY LOMBARDO AND ASSOCIATES, INC. is a corporation registered with the
13 State of California. The County notice of determination for PLN170612 and
14 PLN170613 states the "Project Applicant: Anthony Lombardo & Associates, Inc., Agent"
15 and the County notice of determination for PLN170611 states the "Project Applicant:
16 Anthony Lombardo & Associates, Inc[.I" Because of the statements on the County
17 notices of determination naming that entity, the entity is named herein as one of the real
18 parties, potential parties and/or recipients of the approvals by the County in that
19 capacity. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167.6.5.)
20 15. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of
21 the fictitiously named real parties in interest DOES through 200 either claims an

22 ownership interest in the proposed project or has some other cognizable interest in the
23 proposed project such that they may be real parties in interest. Petitioner does not

24 know their true names and therefore names them by such fictitious names. Petitioner
25 will seek leave from the Court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and
26 capacities 1 of DOES 1 through 200 once they are ascertained.

SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Background and Statement of Facts

2 16. Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set

3 forth above as if fully set forth herein. Upon information and belief, Petitioner further

4 alleges as follows:

5 17. The Carmel Point area contains significant resources due to its past use

6 by early occupants and by tribal peoples. The Carmel Point area is eligible for the

7 National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical Resources,

8 according to County records and expert archeologists.

9 18. In approximately 1982, the County of Monterey adopted the Carmel Area
10 Land Use Plan. The plan places a priority on preserving archaeological and cultural
11 resources in place. The plan's archaeological Key Policy 2.8.2 says this:
12 Carmel's archaeological resources, including those
13 areas considered to be archaeologically sensitive but

14 not yet surveyed and mapped, shall be maintained
and protected for their scientific and cultural heritage
15 values. New land uses, both public and private,
16 should be considered compatible with this objective

17 only where they incorporate all site planning and
design features necessary to minimize or avoid
18 impacts to archaeological resources.

19 19. The Carmel Area LUP Key Policy 2.8.2 is implemented through General
20 Policies in the plan. The general archaeological policy 2.8.3.1 says this:
21 Monterey County shall encourage the timely
22 identification and evaluation of archaeological,

23 historical and paleontological resources in order that
these resources be given consideration during the
24 conceptual design phase of land-use planning or
25 project development.

26 20. The Carmel Area LUP general archaeological policy 2.8.3.3 says this:

27 All available measures, including purchase of

28 archaeological easements, dedication to the County,

6
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 tax relief, purchase of development rights, etc., shall
2 be explored to avoid development on sensitive
prehistoric or archaeological sites. 3
21.
4 The Carmel Area LUP general archeological policy 2.8.3.4 says this:

5 When developments are proposed for parcels where
archaeological or other cultural sites are located,
6 project design shall be required which avoids or
7 substantially minimizes impacts to such cultural sites.

8 To this end, emphasis should be placed on
preserving the entire site rather than on excavation of
9 the resource, particularly where the site has potential
10 religious significance.

11 22. In 2015, Pietro Family Investments LP (Pietro) purchased a Carmel Point

12 property composed of four contiguous parcels. One of the four parcels was developed

13 with a house.

14 23. Pietro applied to the County (application PLN150598) to remodel the
15 existing house and add a second-story master bedroom and bath and a below-ground

16 garage. The construction was performed by Chris Adamski (Adamski) and Emerson

17 Development Group, Inc. (Emerson). During construction, the County redtagged two

18 vacant Pietro parcels because the applicant had graded them and was using them as a

19 construction yard.

20 24. In 2017, Pietro sold the single redeveloped parcel. Pietro retained

21 ownership of the three undeveloped parcels. By then the three parcels were flat or

22 gently sloping land with no vegetation except around the perimeter.

23 25. Later in 2017, Pietro submitted three applications to the County to develop

24 the three vacant parcels with single family residences. The three applications are at

25 times referred to collectively in this petition as "projects" and "project." Pietro, Adamski

26 and Emerson are referred to in this brief collectively as "applicant or "applicants."

27 26. The ground floor of each the proposed houses include living, dining and

28 kitchen space, plus at least three bedrooms and three bathrooms. Each house also

7
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

includes below-ground habitable development that contain more bedrooms and

2 bathrooms, wine cellars, movie theatres, laundry rooms, garages, and other uses. The

3 below-ground floors would have access to daylight, fresh air, and the gardens via

4 excavated light wells, stairs and terraces.

5 27. County planning documents refer in different ways to below-ground

6 development for usable interior space. The County often refers to below-ground

7 enclosed space as a "basement," and at times as a "level" and a "story." County

8 planning documents regularly identify the square footage of a proposed garage but do

9 not state whether the garage is below-ground or whether the below-ground garage

10 square footage is included in the "basement" square footage.
11 28. Basements and other below-ground excavation are known areas of
12 controversy and potential impacts at Carmel Point, according to County records,

13 because Carmel Point has a high sensitivity for archaeological resources.
14 29. The applicant's estimates of cut for the three Pietro Project basements is

15 more than 2,700 cubic yards total. The County did not do an independent review of the

16 excavation amounts, including the footprints and volume encompassed in the

17 estimates. The actual total excavation may be significantly more because the
18 applicant's excavation calculations did not appear to take into consideration all
19 proposed excavation, including for retaining walls to support the below-ground

20 development, garages, trash enclosures, exterior stairs to lower level floors, light and

21 access wells, terracing, sunken patios, and more.

22 30. In September 2018, the County circulated for public comment two

23 proposed mitigated negative declarations and initial studies for the three Pietro

24 Projects. One initial study was for PLN170611 at 26307 Isabella Avenue. The second

25 initial study was for PLN170612 at 26338 Valley View Avenue and PLN170613 at

26 26436 Valley View Avenue. The initial studies discussed some of the Carmel Area

27 Land Use Plan policies regarding architectural and tribal cultural resource protections,

28 and concluded that for the three projects "a basement cannot be supported as

8
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

proposed and mitigation measures have been incorporated to reduce impacts of the
2 development of the first single family dwelling to a less than significant level." The initial

3 studies imposed a mitigation that eliminated the below-ground floors of the three
4 projects. The initial studies stated that the mitigation was necessary in order to reach a
5 finding of less than significant impacts to archaeological and tribal cultural resources.

6 The initial studies also stated that "a larger policy issue exists on the treatment of
7 archaeological sites as opposed to individual parcels."

8 31. The California Coastal Commission coastal planner commented that "the
analysis of project impacts is incomplete" because it did not evaluate the "entire"

10 projects including the basements. He said a complete investigation would include "how
11 the additional excavation for the basements might impact cultural resources."
12 32. On October 31, 2018, the County planning commission received a report
13 a and a presentation on Carmel Point archeological and cultural resources from the
14 County planning staff. Senior planning staff explained that Native American human
15 remains had been uncovered at Carmel Point. Staff stated its opinion that the County's
16 past actions had not protected the resources consistent with and as required by the
17 Carmel Area LUP. The planning commission asked for further information and
18 continued the item.

19 33. The next item on the October 31, 2018 planning commission agenda was
20 a public hearing on the three Pietro Projects. The County's planning staff explained its
21 analysis and recommended mitigations. The Project applicant stated he wanted the
22 basements. The planning commission's legal counsel stated that if the planning
23 commission continued the hearing to December, "staff would do an analysis of the
24 impacts with the basements" and staff then would determine whether those impacts
25 were mitigated adequately. The planning commission discussed the matter and
26 continued the hearing to December 5, 2018.

27 34. On Friday, November 30, 2018, a different County planner distributed
28 revised initial studies that contained material revisions. The material changes included

9
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 deleting the mitigation that disallowed the basements, and striking out the previous

2 conclusions that did not favor the basements.• The revised document also reversed the

3 original initial studies' determination that the projects were "INCONSISTENT" with the

4 Carmel Area Land Use Plan, and made other edits to the proposed mitigations. The

5 revised initial studies did not contain an analysis of the impacts of the basements and

6 the excavation. The planning department did not recirculate the revised initial studies.

7 35. On December 5, 2018, the planning commission heard the continued

8 presentation on archeological resources at Carmel Point. The longtime chief of

9 planning described how resources can be and have been uncovered during

10 construction, such as with a backhoe hitting a femur. "But at that point, the resources

11 are already impacted. Once we give permission, we don't get report on resources until

12 AFTER the project is over." A senior planner testified that the level of proposed below-

13 ground development at Carmel Point in recent years has increased. She stated, "What

14 is coming before us now is a different level of development - much more excavation

15 beyond the levels" previously seen.

16 36. The planning commission then considered the continued agenda item on

17 the Pietro Projects. Commissioner Diehl said, "We can only approve a mitigated

18 negative declaration where there is no possibility of significant impacts. Three people

19 have been dug up [at Carmel Point]. That is significant. Until we have something that

20 prevents that from happening, I cannot agree there is not a chance of a significant

21 impact as project is proposed." Commissioner Diehl also said, "I am not convinced we

22 are minimizing or avoiding the potential for damage when we approve 800 cubic yards

23 of grading for a discretionary basement. A basement is not a necessity. We are saying

24 it is more important for people to have a basement than to follow the land use plan."

25 37. The planning commission on a split vote adopted the revised initial studies

26 and approved the Pietro projects. The votes were six to two on PLN170611 and five to
27 three on PLN170612/170613. The two longtime planning commissioners from the

28 supervisorial district that includes Carmel Point were two of the no votes.

10
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 38. On January 14, 2019, Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources and The

2 Open Monterey Project jointly filed a timely appeal from the planning commission
3 actions. The appeal nullified the commission actions on the Projects.
4 39. In late January 2019, while the appeal was pending, the Project applicant
5 trenched and excavated large amounts of soil along the two vacant Valley View
6 properties and excavated a protected oak tree without benefit of permit and prior
7 approval. No archeological monitor or tribal cultural monitor was present during the
8 excavation. The County issued a second red tag and stop work notices to Pietro. No
g archaeologist or tribal monitor inspected the deep open trenches before they were
10 covered up, or the cut materials, or the large hole excavated to replant the oak tree.
11 40. By February 2019, the planner who had prepared the original initial
12 studies, the senior planner who had reported on archeological resources at Carmel

13 Point, and the chief of planning had left County employment.
14 41. In March 2019, Gayle Totton, Ph.D., a program analyst with the California
15 Native American Heritage Commission, stated that the best mitigation practices
16 included avoidance as "always the first and preferred method of protecting Cultural
17 Resources." She stated that it is better to avoid finding and uncovering resources "at all
18 if that is possible." She offered to assist the County in the protection of tribal cultural
19 resources, and she offered to review a revised initial study if the County prepared one.
20 42. Linda Yamane is an Ohlone scholar and basket weaver who traces her
21 heritage to the Rumsen Ohlone. She has been a tribal cultural observer on excavation

22 sites. For 25 years she served as a Most Likely Descendant ("MLD") of deceased
23 Native Americans whose remains were discovered. (See Pub. Resources Code,
24 § 5097.98.) Ms. Yamane wrote a letter in opposition to the three Pietro Projects:
25 Working alongside archaeologists, I learned a lot
26 about the cultural resources present on Carmel Point.
I also witnessed first-hand
27 the misleading and
hopefully unintentional disservice that can be
28 rendered by a "mitigated negative declaration."

11
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

From one lot, I witnessed massive truckloads of

2 culturally-rich/archaeologically-rich midden soil being
hauled away from Carmelo Street in order to 3 excavate for an underground garage. Artifacts,
4 human remains, and ancient cooking-related

5 materials were excavated, including samples that

6 dated as old as 9,000-plus years - the oldest date
SO far to be identified in Monterey County!
7 43. Louise Miranda Ramirez, as tribal chairwoman of the Ohlone-Costanoan-
8 Esselen tribe (OCEN), opposed the basements on behalf of OCEN and objected to the
a County's failure to reopen AB 52 consultation after the County changed its position
10 regarding the basements. (See Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21082.3, 21084.3.)
11 44. On April 23, 2019, the County board of supervisors held a public hearing
12 to consider the appeal. A few days earlier, the planning department had released a
13 second revision of the initial studies that contained more stricken text and more added
14 underlined text. Public comment was in support of the appeals and against the
15 projects. Opposition in writing and in person was presented by OCEN, several other
16 Native American tribal officers and speakers, the Alliance of Monterey Area
17 Preservationists, and numerous individuals. The only persons who spoke in favor of
18 the projects were the applicants and their representatives. The board voted three to
19 two to certify the mitigated negative declarations based on the second revisions of the
20 initial studies, and to approve the three Projects. The board also approved after-the-
21 fact permits for the red-tagged excavation and tree removal.
22 First Cause of Action
23 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
24 45. Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set
25 forth above as if fully set forth herein, and further alleges on information and belief as
26 follows:
27 46. The County analysis in the adopted initial studies for the Pietro Projects
28 was inadequate both at a project level and at a cumulative level.
12
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDA TE

1 47. Tribal cultural resources and archeological resources are protected under
2 CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21074, 21080.3.2, 21082.3; CEQA Guidelines,

3 App. G, § XVII.) A lead agency is not authorized to approve a mitigated negative
4 declaration unless there is an adequate cumulative impacts analysis and the cumulative
5 impacts are not cumulatively considerable. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083(b)(2),
6 CEQA Guidelines, § 15065(a)(3).) The environmental impacts of other projects are
7 relevant to the determination of cumulative impact analysis required in the initial studies
8 for the Pietro Projects. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(h)(1)-(3).)
9 48. CEQA requires the evaluation of cumulative impacts. Cumulatively
10 considerable means the incremental effects of a project are considerable when viewed
11 in connection with the effects of other closely related past projects, present projects,
12 and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result
13 from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of
14 time. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.) In October 2018, County planners stated that at
15 least six applications for houses with large basements at Carmel Point had been made
16 to the County within the previous year. The six plus the three Pietro Projects made at
17 least nine known signifi cant proposed excavations. When considered with other past,
18 present, and reasonably foreseeable excavation projects at Carmel Point, the three
19 projects as approved would have cumulative impacts not yet analyzed and mitigated
20 under CEQA and that are inconsistent with the Carmel Area Land Use Plan.

21 49. The County initial studies did not include a cumulative impacts analysis.
22 Instead, the County adopted initial studies that state that the County "has not analyzed
23 the cumulative impacts resulting from other development proposals, especially
24 basement proposals, on the Point." (Underlining added.) The County's adopted initial
25 studies state that "other projects being proposed within the vicinity of this property are
26 being similarly proposed (e.g... . development including basements within 750-feet of a
27 known archaeological resource)." The adopted initial studies state that "The County's
28 practice has been to review project proposals discretely and has not evaluated the

13
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDA TE

-

1

2 cumulative effects of maximizing the development potential of parcels on Carmel Point."

3 The initial studies state that the County "has also not... taken action to preserve the

4 remaining resource(s)" of archeological and tribal significance that exist.

50.

5 During the public hearing before the board of supervisors' on April 23,

6 2019, Supervisor Adams asked the planning staff whether a cumulative impacts

7 analysis had been performed, and if so, where in the initial studies the analysis could

8 be found. A County planning manager requested and was granted time to look into

9 Supervisor Adams' question. He then responded publicly that "cumulative impact was

not studied."

10 51.

11 The Pietro Projects are part of a trend: applications for below-ground

12 floors and garage development on Carmel Point. Numerous other known nearby

13 projects nearby add to the cumulative impacts. The County recently approved a new

14 three-level house at 26339 Isabella Avenue, which is one parcel away from the Pietro

15 projects, including a below-ground floor of 1,369 square feet; the project (PLN170246)

16 has a pending request for another 157 square feet of below-ground development.

17 PLN180523 is a pending application for a 2,968 square foot three-story single family

18 dwelling at a never-developed parcel at 26308 Isabella across from Pietro Project

19 PLN170611; it would require 866 cubic yards of excavation.

52.

20 The County initial studies also did not contain an adequate analysis of the

21 project-level impacts of the Projects including the basements, and thus the County did

22 not have an adequate basis to determine whether the impacts were mitigated
adequately.

23 53.

24 The Pietro Projects are within 750 feet of known archeological and tribal
cultural finds and are within or in close proximity to three recorded prehistoric
25 archeological sites: CA-MNT-16, CA-MNT-17, and CA-MNT-1286. According to the

26

27 County and to the applicant's archeologist, Breschini considered these three

28 archeological sites to be associated. "These three sites have different components and
were established in differing time periods, yet are significant in that all have provided

14
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 data and important information on the regional prehistory." According to one of the
2 applicant's archeologists in report for the immediate area, "Several Native American

3 burials have been encountered in this neighborhood, as well."

4 54. The boundary of prehistoric site CA-MNT-17 includes the Pietro parcels.
5 Buried cultural materials associated with CA-MNT-17, have been identified on parcels
6 within two hundred feet of the Pietro Projects. These prehistoric archaeological
7 materials, including ground and battered lithic artifacts, "were found at considerable
8 depth during basement and cistern excavations." Another parcel within this nearby
9 area also produced evidence of cultural resources, including shell and fire-affected
10 rock, during construction excavations.

11 55. The initial studies for the Pietro Projects failed to discuss, much less
12 disclose the existence of, recorded archeological site CA-MNT-1286. The redeveloped
13 Pietro parcel is within the reported boundaries of CA-MNT-1286. CA-MNT-1286 has
14 yielded evidence of prehistoric occupation dating from 8,000 years before present from
15 a parcel a few hundred feet from the three vacant Pietro parcels, according to County
16 records. (E.g., County initial study for PLN110632, p. 20.) Breschini (2008) and
17 Bourdeau (1985) have conducted studies at CA-MNT-1286 that provided data that are
18 applicable to regional research questions, and CA-MNT-1286 has produced a
19 significant amount of lithics in the form of obsidian and a charmstone that is unique for
20 Monterey Bay, according to County records.

21 56. The opportunity for a coordinated investigation of the presence of
22 archeological and tribal cultural resources at three contiguous never-developed sites at
23 Carmel Point is invaluable. Petitioner alleges that the County has a not had a previous
24 opportunity to review three such sites contemporaneously on Carmel Point since the
25 adoption of the Carmel Area Land Use Plan policies protecting the resources. One of
26 the applicant's archeologists has stated, in a report for another Carmel Point project,
27 "Archaeologists only have the opportunity to investigate the sites when construction
28 a permits are sought. This is a piecemeal method because we only have the opportunity

15
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to look at portions of sites, which provides a jigsaw puzzle like map of parcels where

2 there is presence/absence of cultural resources." Three contiguous vacant sites

3 present a remarkable opportunity for the County and for researchers to investigate the

4 entire sites to fill in the picture and to ensure preservation of these protected resources,

5 and to provide information that would be lost forever once the sites are developed.

6 57. The County approvals do not adequately protect the potential resources in

7 this archaeologically sensitive location. The proposed excavation below grade does not

8 comply with the LUP policies and objectives and its implementing ordinances. The

9 County approvals do not incorporate all available site planning and design features

10 necessary to minimize or avoid impacts to archaeological resources and cultural sites,

11 as required by the LUP policies and the implementing policies. The applicant stated

12 that the size of one of more of the below-ground floors could be reduced. The County

13 did not require the reduction of the proposed below-ground development or otherwise

14 modify it. The County did not perform or obtain an adequate investigation to determine

15 the presence of sensitive prehistoric or archaeologic resources and tribal cultural

16 resources, and the impacts on the resources have not been adequately disclosed,
17 | evaluated, or mitigated. The County's actions did not adequately consider the projects'

18 lack of consistency with the LUP policies. The County approved the projects based

19 upon inadequate environmental review. The County shortchanged the inquiry to the

20 presence of resources at the three project sites. The County's adopted mitigations do

21 not comply with CEQA's requirement to seek to avoid damaging archeological

22 resources, and that preservation in place is the preferred mitigation. The County did

23 not adopt a data recovery plan. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(b)(3).)

24 58. Instead, the County considered three sets of archeological reports

25 submitted by the applicant. The reports were based on very limited physical
26 investigations of very small portions of the three sites. No testing was done on the vast

27 majority of the land on the three parcels. The amount of testing done was minuscule in

28 light of the size of the three parcels and in light of the fact that when resources have

16
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 been found at Carmel Point, they have been found at significant depth, such as when
2 excavating for cisterns.

3 59. One set of the applicant's archeological reports noted shell fragments and
4 refuse from stone tool production across the Project area. The applicant's consultant
5 determined that these cultural materials were part of spoils from another project that
6 had been dumped on the vacant parcels. The reasonable conclusion that cultural
7 materials were excavated from another site, and that the cultural materials had not
8 been identified and protected at the original location from which they were removed,
9 and that the development activity at the other site had not been adequately monitored,
10 and thus the materials and their integrity were lost along with other protected resources.

11 60. Adequate investigation is necessary in light of the acknowledged richness
12 of the buried resources at Carmel Point and the large amounts of excavation proposed
13. by the Projects. The absence of evidence of buried remains, archeological resources
14 and tribal cultural resources, is not evidence that the resources are not present. Until
15 and unless the County has performed an adequate investigation to determine the
16 presence or absence of resources at the project sites, the County reasonably cannot
17 find that the projects are consistent the County with the Carmel Area LUP policies,
18 including key policy 2.8.2 that mandates that "New land uses .. . should be considered

19 compatible with this objective only where they incorporate all site planning and design
20 features necessary to minimize or avoid impacts to archaeological resources." The
21 Pietro Projects propose new land uses. The County did not adequately investigate and
22 consider site planning options and design features, such as reduction in the sizes of the
23 basements as mitigation to avoid potential impacts to the resources.
24 61. The County for the Pietro Projects adopted a mitigation requiring that work
25 be stopped within 50 meters "on the parcel" where the find was uncovered. The three
26 project sites are within 50 meters of each other. A find on one parcel could be within 50
27 meters of one or both other parcels. The mitigation means that even if a significant find
28 is uncovered on one parcel, excavation could continue at the other two Pietro parcels

17
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

even if the find is only a few feet away. It also means that other excavation at nearby

2 non-Pietro projects could continue. The mitigation is not consistent with CEQA's
mandates. (E.g., Guidelines, § 15064.5(e)(1).) The County did not make findings or

4 determine this issue which was one of the grounds for Petitioner's appeal to the board.

5 62. An important purpose of OCEN's consultation request was to require the

6 protection of tribal cultural resources, and an understood element of the consultation

7 was the County mitigation that the basements not be approved. (See Pub. Resources

8 Code, §§ 21080.3.1, 21080.3.2.) The County deleted that mitigation after the closure of

9 the consultation and the comment period. OCEN later commented that the County had

10 reneged on its agreement with the tribe and should have re-opened consultation. (See

11 Pub. Resources Code, 21082.3(d)(1), (e).) In January 2019, OCEN reported that the
12 County wanted OCEN to identify why the site was sacred to the OCEN people. OCEN
13 said it wants to keep the information confidential. The demand by the County was

14 inconsistent with the CEQA protection that "Consultation shall also recognize the tribes'

15 potential needs for confidentiality with respect to places that have traditional tribal

16 cultural significance. (Gov. Code, § 65352.4.)." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.3.)

17 63. The County's circulation of the mitigated negative declarations and initial

18 studies was improper because the County is authorized to circulate a mitigated

19 negative declaration only after the applicant has agreed to the mitigations. (Pub.
20 Resources Code, § 21064.5; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15065(b)(1), 15070(b)(1).) Here,

21 the applicants had not agreed to the mitigations requiring elimination of the basements.
22 64. The County made material and substantial revisions to the initial studies

23 after the studied were circulated, and the revised documents should have been

24 recirculated. The substitute measures were not equivalent and were not more effective

25 than the previous mitigation to eliminate the basements. The County decisions are not

26 supported by the evidence. The County findings are not supported by the evidence and
27 the County did not adopt certain required findings. (E.g. CEQA Guidelines,

28 15074.1(b)(2).) The adopted findings inaccurately claim that the revised initial studies

18
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDA TE

1 "amplified" the original mitigations. The County approved the basements despite
2 substantial evidence in the record of the potentially significant impacts of the excavation
3 and of potential mitigations for the impacts that the County did not adopt. The County
4 did not find that the deletion of the no-basement mitigation would not cause any
5 potentially significant effect.

6 65. The Carmel Area LUP and its implementing ordinances require that
7 development on parcels with an archaeological site "shall be subject" to conditions of
8 approval including that "The applicant shall request to add the combining "HR" zoning
9 district to the existing zoning." The approvals at issue do not contain the conditions.
10 66. The lack of timely and adequate investigation, analysis and mitigation of
11 the excavation means that in addition to potential impacts on archeological and tribal
12 cultural resources, other project-specific and cumulative impacts have not been
13 adequately addressed and mitigated, including drainage and erosion. The County has
14 not adequately addressed the impacts of trucking the excavated soils through Carmel's
15 streets. A typical truck route from Carmel Point passes two elementary schools.
16 Carmel Point does not have sidewalks, curbs, or gutters. It is is a major destination
17 point. Locals and visitors walk in the streets to recreate and enjoy the coastal views
18 and coastal access.

19 67. Petitioner seeks in this action to require Respondents, and each of them,
20 to comply with CEQA and the Coastal Act in their decisions with regard to each of the
21 Projects, to fulfill their statutory obligations under CEQA and the Coastal Act, to provide
22 the information and investigation required by law, and to proceed in the manner
23 required by law. Petitioner is particularly concerned with Respondents' failure to
24 adequately investigate the potential resources at the three sites, and the lack of

25 adequate cumulative impacts analysis, and the harm that could result.
26 68. The policy decisions about the future of Monterey County are required by
27 law to be made by decision makers who are fully informed about the environmental
28 impacts. By avoiding the informational and procedural mandates of CEQA,

19
SAVE CARMEL POINT CULTURAL RESOURCES V. COUNTY PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Respondents have not made informed and accountable decisions, and the protected

2 resources and the physical environment could be harmed as a result.

3 69. On April 26, 2019, the County filed two CEQA notices of determination for

4 the Pietro Projects: one for PLN170611, and one for PLN170612 and PLN170613.

5 This action is timely brought.

6 70. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that as of

7 May 24, 2019, the time for filing an appeal to the California Coastal Commission had

8 not yet begun, or if it has begun, it has not yet elapsed for the three Projects as of the

9 filing of this petition. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 1311.)
10 71. Petitioner performed all required conditions precedent to filing this action
11 by complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

12 mailing on May 22, 2019 written notice of the intent to commence this action to the

13 County of Monterey and its board of supervisors. (See Exh. B to this petition.)

14 72. Petitioner has standing in this action, and has exhausted, or has not yet

15 been able to exhaust, or has been excused from, all administrative remedies

16 reasonably and legally available to Petitioner. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or

17 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as described below.
19 Second Cause of Action
Carmel Area Land Use Plan and
20 California Coastal Act (Pub. Resources Code 30000 et seq.)
21 73. Petitioner incorporates by reference and realleges the paragraphs set

22 forth above as if fully set forth herein.

23 74.. Petitioner alleges that Respondents did not comply with the Carmel Area

24 Land Use Plan and the coastal implementation plan when Respondents approved the

25 three Pietro Projects. Petitioner alleges that Respondents have failed to reasonably

26 determine whether the projects are consistent with the policies protecting resources at
27 Carmel Point and that the projects are not consistent with those policies.

28 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for entry of judgment as described below.

Subject: Notice of intent to commence action or proceeding under CEQA (see

Mr. Bauman and Ms. Ralph:

This is written notice to the County of Monterey and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey that Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources intends to file a petition under the California Environmental Quality Act and other laws to challenge the actions of the board on or around April 23, 2019 to approve the three development projects at Carmel Point known as PLN170611, PLN170612, and PLN170613, in reliance on mitigated negative declarations.

Without waiving any objections, including as to form of the document and
content of the documents, my clients point out flaws with the County's notices of determination. The County did not timely send the notices to me or my clients in spite
of my multiple prior requests. had to ask for them repeatedly. The County eventually provided the notices to me six days after the County had filed them. The County had filed them under the Condition Compliance Form relative to the condition of approval which requires the Fish & Game Fee to be paid. The County had named the files as Fish & Game documents, instead of as notices of determination. The County notices
refer only to the Planning Commission actions of December 2018. The notices do not mention the Board actions of April 2019. The notices name as the "applicant" the lawyer for the developer/owner.

Thank you.

Very truly yours,
