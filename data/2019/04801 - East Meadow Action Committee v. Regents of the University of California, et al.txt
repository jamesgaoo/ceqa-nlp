2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On March 14, 2019, the Regents of the University of California (*Regents"),

4 approved the design of the Student Housing West Project and Santa Cruz campus and Long-

5 Range Development Plan Amendment Number 2 to the University of California Santa Cruz

6 2005 Long Range Development Plan to change the land use designation of 17 acres of Campus

7. Resource Land to Colleges and Student Housing, Certified an Environmental Impact Report

8 ("EIR") (SCH No. 2017092007), adopted California Environmental Quality Act findings and a
statement of overriding considerations, and adopted a Mitigation and Monitoring Reporting

10 Program (*Project") on behalf of the Project Applicant, University of California Santa Cruz

11 ("UCSC"). The Project involves "public-private partnership" between the University of

12 California and two out-of-state Real Parties in Interest from Alabama.

13 2. The UCSC Main Campus is located in the "Westside" neighborhood of the City

14 of Santa Cruz, California. The Project, as approved, includes construction of student housing

15 at two sites on campus, the "Hagar Site" and the "Heller Site."

Meadow. It is impossible to overstate the importance of the East Meadow to the symbolism
and culture of UCSC or its value to UCSC staff, alumni, and visitors. Since the inception of
UCSC, the East Meadow has stood as an iconic gateway to UCSC and embodies the values and
beauty of the UCSC Main Campus. Preservation of the East Meadow was fundamental
consideration of the original design of the campus. Thomas D. Church, the famous landscape
architect who designed the UCSC Main Campus and helped create the original 1963 Long

7 Range Development Plan for this campus stated, "the great meadow toward the south of the

8 campus should not be built upon [and] that the first buildings to be encountered entering the
site would be a the crest of the hill where the trees begin." This driving principle has formed
10 the foundation of UCSC's land use planning and policies since the creation of the first Long

11 Range Development Plan in 1963, and both this quote and policy remain to this day in the
12 2005 Long Range Development Plan. The 2005 Long Range Development Plan further
13 recognizes, "The 'Great Meadow,' stretching between Hagar Drive and Empire Grade, has
14 become a cherished campus symbol; a spectacular foreground to the center campus."

4. In addition to its natural beauty, the UCSC East Meadow serves as important

2 habitat for dozens of coastal plant and animal species. The UCSC East Meadow contains 80

3 acres of rare coastal prairie grassland, including purple needlegrass, which is classified as a

4 rare and sensitive natural community. Many other native coastal plant and animal species rely
on and can regularly be seen in this relatively undisturbed habitat.

6 5. The Project proposes to permanently destroy 17.1 acres-over twenty percent-

7 of the East Meadow and indirectly infringing upon and damaging the remainder of this

8 meadow, to construct a small amount of family-student housing. Adding insult to injury, this
small amount of housing is to be pre-fabricated. The Regents and UCSC (*Respondents")

10 recognized the severe impacts of this choice, while also noting the immeasurable aesthetic

11 value of this location and its importance to life at UCSC, finding that aesthetic impacts to this

12 meadow will be "significant and unavoidable." Sadly, the proposed loss of the East Meadow
13 comes at an absurdly lopsided cost, as development of the currently undisturbed Hagar Site
14 will comprise roughly 57 percent of the total Project area but will only create less than five

15 percent of total Project housing. Specifically, whereas the Heller Site would provide

16 approximately 2,900 beds for student housing on 13 acres of land, the Hagar Site would only

17 provide 140 beds on 17.1 acres of land. Regardless, Respondents elected to bulldoze the East

18 Meadow, choosing to trade this iconic gateway and symbol of UCSC for a few beds that could

19 be placed in a more reasonable location. Cynically, Respondents created a Hobson's Choice,
20 shaping their review of the Project to preordain destruction of the East Meadow, while

21 studiously refusing to truly consider feasible alternatives to the Project that would avoid the

22 destruction of the UCSC East Meadow.

23 6. Petitioner East Meadow Action Committee (*Petitioner") challenges the

24 approval of the Project and certification of the Environmental Impact Report on the grounds

25 that the Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"-

26 Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, the EIR failed to adequately consider
27 feasible alternatives to the Project; the Regents of the University of California failed to
28 consider and make proper findings regarding feasible alternatives that would avoid significant

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

and unavoidable impacts to the iconic East Meadow; the EIR failed to adequately disclose,

2 analyze, or mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the Project, including impacts to
grassland species, such as purple needlegrass; the Project EIR erroneously relies on the 2005
Long Range Development Plan EIR, which did not consider impacts to the East Meadow; the
Project conflicts with the UCSC Physical Design Framework for the UCSC Main Campus; the
EIR failed to adequately evaluate impacts to hydrology and water quality; and, the EIR does

7 not contain a legally adequate cumulative impacts analysis. Furthermore, Respondents failed

8 to provide adequate mitigation to reduce Project impacts to less than significant, and
Respondents did not adequately respond to comments submitted by and on behalf of Petitioner
10 and others.

11 7. On March 29, 2019, Respondent Regents filed a Notice of Determination, and,

12 pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof.
13 UI

14 PARTIES

15 8. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 7 as if fully

16 set forth herein.

17 9. East Meadow Action Committee is an unincorporated association of current and

18 former UCSC staff, students, and alumni, as well as residents and taxpayers of and within the

19 City of Santa Cruz and the County of Santa Cruz. Petitioner East Meadow Action Committee

20 has a strong interest in the preservation of the environment, and, as its namesake specifies,

21 especially the protection of the UCSC East Meadow. Members of Petitioner East Meadow

22 Action Committee reside in the City of Santa Cruz and in the County of Santa Cruz, and

23 include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the

24 violations of CEQA. Petitioner and its members submitted comments on the Project that

25 addressed the inadequacies of Respondents' environmental review.

26 10. Respondent Regents of the University of California is a public trust corporation

27 and state agency established pursuant to Article IX, section 9, of the California Constitution,

28 and is vested with administering the University of California. On March 14, 2019, Respondent

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
5

Regents of the University of California, approved the Project and adopted the EIR.
11. Respondent University of California, Santa Cruz is listed as the Project
Applicant in the Notice of Determination. Respondent Regents of the University of California

4 have created several University of California campuses, including the University of California,
Santa Cruz. Upon information and belief, all University of California Campuses, including the

6 University of California, Santa Cruz, are subsumed entities of Respondent Regents of the

7 University of California.

8 12. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of
Does 1 through 15, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues said Respondents by such

10 fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus when their

11 identities have been ascertained.

12 13. Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Respondents
13 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and
14 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency
15 and employment.

16 14. Real Party in Interest Capstone Development Partners LLC is a limited liability
17 corporation based in the State of Alabama and registered to conduct business in the State of

18 California. Real Party in Interest Capstone Development Partners LLC was identified in the

19 Notice of Determination as one of two parties undertaking the Project. Capstone Development
20 Partners LLC is properly named as a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code
21 section 21167.6.5(a), which states Petitioner shall name as a Real Party in Interest any person

22 or persons identified in the Notice of Determination filed by Respondent Regents.

23 15. Real Party in Interest Collegiate Housing Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3)
24 tax-exempt organization. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest Collegiate Housing
25 Foundation is headquartered and maintains its principal place of business in Fairhope,
26 Alabama. Real Party in Interest Collegiate Housing Foundation was identified in the Notice of

27 Determination as one of two parties undertaking the Project. Collegiate Housing Foundation is
28 properly named as a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

21167.6.5(a), which states Petitioner shall name as a Real Party in Interest any person or

persons identified in the Notice of Determination filed by Respondent Regents.
16. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

4 Does 16 through 30, are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sues said Real Parties in Interest
by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

6 when their identities have been ascertained.

7 17. Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties

8 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real
Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
10 scope of such agency and employment.

11 III

12 STANDING

13 18. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully

14 set forth herein.

15 19. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner East

16 Meadow Action Committee. Petitioner East Meadow Action Committee is an unincorporated

17 association of current and former UCSC staff, students, and alumni, as well as residents and

18 taxpayers of and within the City of Santa Cruz and the County of Santa Cruz. Petitioner East

19 Meadow Action Committee has strong interest in the preservation of the environment, and

20 especially the protection of the UCSC East Meadow. Members of Petitioner East Meadow

21 Action Committee reside in the City of Santa Cruz and in the County of Santa Cruz, and

22 include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the

23 violations of CEQA. Approval of the Project and adoption of the EIR will adversely affect

24 these interests of Petitioner East Meadow Action Committee and its members. Members and

25 representatives of Petitioner East Meadow Action Committee, on behalf thereof, have

26 submitted comments on and objections to the lack of compliance with CEQA during the

27 administrative proceedings where the Project was considered. Accordingly, Petitioner East

28 Meadow Action Committee is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

1 Code ยง 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation
2 in the litigation by individual members is not required.

3 20. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

4 Procedure ยงยง 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code ยง 21167; CEQA Guidelines

5 con 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

6 other applicable laws and regulations.

8 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 21. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 20 as if fully

10 set forth herein.

11 22. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by

12 themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

13 compliance with Public Resources Code ยง 21177, Code of Civil Procedure ยงยง 1085 and

14 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

15 23. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code co.

16 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on April 25, 2019. (Letter and Proof of Service are

17 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

18 V

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.]
21 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully
22 set forth herein.
23 25. Respondents' approval of the EIR constitutes an abuse of discretion because,
24 inter alia, the EIR failed to adequately consider feasible alternatives to the Project; the Regents
25 of the University of California failed to consider and make proper findings regarding feasible
26 alternatives that would avoid significant and unavoidable impacts to the iconic East Meadow;
27 the EIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the significant environmental
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 impacts of the Project, including impacts to grassland species, such as purple needlegrass; the

2 Project EIR erroneously relies on the 2005 Long Range Development Plan EIR, which did not
consider impacts to the East Meadow; the Project conflicts with the UCSC Physical Design
4 Framework for the UCSC Main Campus; the EIR failed to adequately evaluate impacts to
hydrology and water quality; and, the EIR does not contain a legally adequate cumulative
6 impacts analysis. Furthermore, Respondents failed to provide adequate mitigation to reduce

7 Project impacts to less than significant, and Respondents did not adequately respond to

8 comments submitted by and on behalf of Petitioner and others.
26. CEQA requires that Respondents adequately and accurately disclose, evaluate,
10 and mitigate the impacts of the Project. Respondents failed to provide an adequate discussion

11 of the environmental setting of the Project or Project-related direct, indirect, and cumulative
12 impacts and mitigation measures. CEQA requires Respondents to consider the direct, indirect,

13 and cumulative environmental impacts of the Project, and to adopt all feasible mitigation
14 needed to reduce Project-related impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยงยง 15126.2; 15130.) 'The

15 analysis in the EIR failed to accurately disclose the significant direct, indirect, and cumulative

16 environmental effects of the Project, including aesthetic impacts, impacts to coastal prairie
17 plant and animal species, such as purple needlegrass, impacts to hydrology and water quality,
18 impacts to traffic, impacts to geology and soils, and Project-related land use conflicts with the

19 UCSC Physical Design Framework. Furthermore, Respondents failed to accurately describe

20 and implement all feasible mitigation measures, including feasible mitigation measures that

21 would have reduced or avoided impacts Respondents claimed were significant and

22 unavoidable.

23 27. In certain, limited circumstances, CEQA permits "tiering," or reliance on a

24 previously certified "program-level" EIR that evaluated certain impacts that are addressed in a

25 later "project-level" EIR. (Pub. Resources Code 21094.) The Project EIR claimed it tiered
26 from the University of California Santa Cruz 2005 Long Range Development Plan ("LRDP")
27 EIR. However, Respondents' claimed reliance on the LRDP EIR was erroneous, inter alia,

28 because the LRDP EIR did not consider, nor did it address or mitigate, impacts arising from

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
9

siting any development in the UCSC East Meadow. Thus, Respondents' claimed reliance on

2 the LRDP to address these impacts in the Project EIR was erroneous, and Respondents failed

3 to adequately disclose, consider, or mitigate these impacts, in violation of CEQA.

28. CEQA requires Respondents to consider a reasonable range of feasible
alternatives. (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21002.) Far from being an esoteric or academic exercise,

6 the alternatives analysis is supposed to serve both the informational and substantive purposes

7 of CEQA. In particular, it is impermissible for Respondents to approve the Project if there are

8 feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that serve to lessen the significant impacts of the
Project. (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21002.) Failure to adequately evaluate Project alternatives
10 violates CEQA. Here, Respondents failed these mandates of CEQA, inter alia, because

11 Respondents narrowly defined the objectives of the Project in a manner that preordained the

12 rejection of all less harmful Project alternatives; Respondents failed to adequately consider a

13 reasonable range of feasible alternatives that would have reduced or avoided the significant
14 environmental impacts of the Project, including to the UCSC East Meadow; Respondents
15 presented only "straw" alternatives to the Project that Respondents designed specifically for

16 rejection; Respondents improperly dismissed environmentally superior alternatives that

17 Respondents determined would meet most all of the Project objectives; and Respondents

18 otherwise skewed and misstated the analysis of Project alternatives in the EIR in a manner that
19 misinformed the public and improperly foreclosed adoption of these less impactful alternatives.

20 29. CEQA and relevant caselaw further mandate that Respondents adopt all CEQA

21 findings prior to the approval of the Project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15091.) Crucially,

22 Respondent Regents, as the lead agency according to CEQA, was required to find whether

23 there were any feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would serve to reduce the

24 significant impacts of the Project on the environment. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15091(a)(3).)
25 However, at the March 14, 2019 meeting wherein Respondent Regents approved the Project,
26 and written findings. However, Respondent Regents deferred review of the evidence until after

27 the findings were already made regarding the feasibility of various Project alternatives. This

28 deferral of review of the evidence, which evidence was never reviewed by the Respondent

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
10

1 Regents, was evaluated during an unnoticed and non-public meeting of a three-member group

2 of Regents that did not, and could not, act on behalf of Respondent Regents. Thus, the Project

3 was approved without adhering to the proper procedure for the adoption of these feasibility

4 findings, and these findings were never properly acted upon, made, or finalized, in violation of

5 CEQA.

6 30. In addition, CEQA requires that Respondents provide adequate responses to

7 comments raised during the comment period for the Project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15088.)
8 Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments raised by Petitioner and others.
9 31. Respondents must prepare an adequate EIR that conforms with all of the
10 procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Certification of the Project

11 EIR, which lacked both procedural and substantive requirements under CEQA, constitutes an
12 abuse of discretion and a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.
13 VI

14 ATTORNEYS' FEES

15 32. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully

16 set forth herein.

17 33. In pursuing this action, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the People

18 of the State of California and therefore is entitled to recover from Respondents and Real Parties

19 in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure

20 00 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

21 VII

22 INJUNCTION

23 34. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully

24 set forth herein.

25 35. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

26 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

27 36. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

28 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
11

a manner required by law in approving the Project.

37. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of
4 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform
their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

6 38. Petitioner is informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents are

7 threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said implementation

8 of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in significant and
unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

10 39. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

11 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,
12 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Santa Cruz, the County of Santa
13 Cruz, the UCSC Main Campus, and the State of California. Petitioner will suffer irreparable
14 and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

15 40. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction
16 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

17 41. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
18 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

19 Project and adoption of the EIR.

20 PRAYER

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

22 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

23 aside any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to, approval of the design of the

24 Student Housing West Project, Santa Cruz campus; approval of the Long-Range Development

25 Plan Amendment Number 2 to the University of California Santa Cruz 2005 Long Range
26 Development Plan to change the land use designation of 17 acres of Campus Resource Land to

27 Colleges and Student Housing; Certification of the Project EIR (SCH No. 2017092007);

28 adoption of CEQA findings and a statement of overriding considerations; and adoption of a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
12

1 Mitigation and Monitoring Reporting Program for the Project.

2 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in

3 any activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review and the Project complies

4 with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of

5 CEQA.

6 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ยง

7 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

8 4. For costs of suit; and

9 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem proper.

Dear Regents, Chancellor Blumenthal, and Ms. Klaus:
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that East Meadow Action Committee (Petitioner) will commence litigation against the Regents of the University of California and University of California, Santa Cruz (Respondents).
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in adopting and approving the Student Housing West Project, Santa Cruz Campus and Long-Range Development Plan Amendment Number 2 to the University of California Santa Cruz 2005 Long Range Development Plan to change the land use designation of 17 acres of Campus Resource Land to Colleges and Student Housing, certifying an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") (SCH No. 2017092007), adopting CEQA findings and a statement of overriding considerations, and adopting a Mitigation and Monitoring Reporting Program on behalf of the Project Applicant, University of California, Santa Cruz.
The litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.).
Very truly yours, ATTWER PARKIN LLP

William P. Parkin
