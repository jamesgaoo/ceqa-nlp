13 To the Attorney General of the State of California:
14 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
15 Civil Procedure section 388, that on November 19, 2019, David Sabih filed an amended
16 complaint and a petition for writ of mandate against the County of Monterey, et al., in the
17 Superior Court of California, County of Monterey.
18 The petition challenges the actions by the County of Monterey and its Board of
19 Supervisors to fail to enforce mitigations that the County had adopted in 2008 as part of 26
20 conditions of approval of a project, styled PLN060735, on the basis of a mitigated negative
21 declaration under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et
22 seq.). The Board approvals, as amended over the years, resulted in the County issuing a building
23 permit in 2018, amended in 2019, to the owners. The most recent amendment was for a project
24 that is larger than allowed by the applicable plans and codes, because the County failed to
25 adequately investigate and improperly relied on the applicant's claims as to the size of the lot.
26 The owners then commenced construction in violation of the mitigations and conditions. The
27 violations included the failure to have an archacological monitor present to monitor the

SABIH V. COUNTY NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL
CASE No.: 19CV003092

1 excavation of more than 750 cubic yards of original soil from the high sensitive archaeological
2 area and the trenching and other earth disturbing activities that occurred for months. The petition

3 arises from the failures of the County to enforce the conditions and mitigations, the failures of the

4 County to adequately remedy the vio lations, and the failures of the County to ensure that the

5 project, as permitted and amended, complies with the Monterey County Local Coastal Program.

6 The petition alleges the County actions did not comply with the California Environmental

7 Quality Act (CEQA), the California Coastal Act, the certified Monterey County Local Coastal

8 Program, California Planning and Zoning Law, the Monterey County Code, and other statutes,

9 regulations, plans, codes and ordinances.

INTRODUCTION
13

14 This case is brought in the public interest. The claims arise from the County of

15 Monterey's approval of a permit to build a multi-level spec house with a very large basement on

16 a previously undisturbed lot on Carmel Point. Carmel Point is an archaeologically important and

17 highly sensitive area and earth disturbance can harm and has harmed untold numbers of Native

18 American artifacts and human remains.

19 The County imposed numerous requirements on the owners as conditions of the

20 permit under CEQA, the California Coastal Act and other law. The owners agreed in writing, in

21 a separate agreement with Mr. Sabih, to abide by those conditions and mitigations. Serious

22 violations have occurred. The violations have not been properly redressed by the
23 County. Therefore, this action seeks to compel compliance with, and enforcement of, each
24 mitigation and condition, and also requests damages for past and continuing violations that have
25 harmed Mr. Sabih.

3 and was, the owner and in possession and control of that certain real property located at 26333

4 Scenic Road, Carmel, in unincorporated Monterey County, California, Assessor's Parcel No.

5 009-442-012-000 (*Sabih Property"). Mr. Sabih has made that his home for decades. At all

6 times mentioned in this Complaint, Plaintiff was an elder as defined in Welfare & Institutions

7 Code §15610.27 and currently is 83 years of age. On or about December 26, 2012, after certain

8 actions that are the subject of this complaint were performed, David S. Sabih conveyed an 80%

9 ownership of the Sabih Property to the Sabih Children Trust dated December 20, 2012 ("*Children
10 Trust"), David S. Sabih, Trustee. On or about May 16, 2013, David S. Sabih conveyed the
11 remaining 20% ownership of the Sabih Property to the David Sabih 2013 Limited Revocable
12 Trust U/D/T dated May 14, 2013 ("Revocable Trust"), David S. Sabih, Trustee. Hereinafter,
13 Plaintiff David S. Sabih is referred to as "Plaintiff" unless it is necessary to distinguish between 14 David S. Sabih in his individual capacity (hereinafter "Mr. Sabih") or in his capacity as Trustee 15
of the Children Trust and/or Revocable Trust (hereinafter "Trustee Sabih"). 16
2. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon
17 alleges that Defendants and Real

18 Parties Dale Skeen and Jo Mei Chang ("Skeen & Chang" or "Defendants" or "Real Parties") are,

19 and at all times mentioned in this Complaint were, the owners and in possession and control of

20 that certain real property located at 26327 Scenic Road, Carmel, Monterey County, California,

21 designated Assessor's Parcel No. 009-442-013-000 ("Skeen & Chang Property"). The Sabih

22 Property and the Skeen & Chang Property adjoin each other with shared property boundary.

23 The Skeen & Chang property shares property boundary with at least three different properties.

24 3. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Defendant and Real Party
25 Monterey Peninsula Properties is a California Corporation licensed as general contractor doing

4. Respondent COUNTY OF MONTEREY is a political subdivision of the State of

3 California that is the lead agency under CEQA for the County approvals at issue, and is

4 responsible for ensuring that its actions, including its land use approvals and its post-approval

5 condition compliance and enforcement, are consistent with the Local Coastal Program, the

6 Coastal Act, the General Plan, and other applicable plans and laws.

7 5. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF MONTEREY is
8 the governing board of the County that approved the project at issue and placed the conditions

9 and mitigations on the project at issue, and that had ultimate responsibility for the County's

10 actions with regard to Skeen and Chang's violations of the conditions and mitigations in 2019.
11 6. Plaintiff is ignorant of the true names and capacities of defendants sued herein as
12 DOES 1-500, inclusive, and therefore, sue these defendants by such fictitious names. Further,
13 DOES 1-500, inclusive, may assert some cognizable interest in the action Plaintiff will amend
14 this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained. 15
7. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the Defendants, 16

17 including the fictitiously named defendants, are in some manner liable and responsible for the

18 acts herein alleged and claim some interest in the real properties that are the subject of this

19 action.

20 8. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the defendants,

21 including the fictitiously named defendants, in doing the things herein alleged were acting as a

22 partner, agent, employee, principal, employer, or joint venturer of the other defendants.

23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

24 9. This action is an unlimited civil case because the amount in controversy is in excess

25 of $25,000.

26 10. This action is properly brought in Monterey County, California because the real
27 property that is the subject of this action is situated in Monterey County. Mr. Sabih and
28 Defendants Skeen & Chang entered into a written contract, more particularly described below,
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 4 of 27

2 designating Monterey County, California as venue for any action to enforce said contract.

3 11. 26327 Scenic Road is located in Monterey County. The County approvals at issue
were taken by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey and the enforcement of the

5 mitigations and conditions is the responsibility of the County of Monterey. Venue is appropriate

6 in the Superior Court of the County of Monterey. This Court has jurisdiction over this writ

7 action under sections 1085 and 1094.5 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure and under sections

8 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

9 SUMMARY OF FACTS

10 12. The Carmel Area Land Use Plan designates Carmel Point, where the Skeen &
11 Chang Property is located, as high sensitivity to archaeological resources. The Carmel Point area
12 is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places and the California Register of Historical
13 Resources, according to County records and expert archeologists. The oldest artifact on the
14 Central Coast was found at the Carmel Point and is estimated to be approximately 9400 years 15

16 old. In approximately 1982, the County of Monterey adopted the Carmel Area Land Use Plan

17 (LUP). The plan places a priority on preserving archaeological and cultural resources in place.
13.
18 The Land Use Plan's key archaeological policy 2.8.2 says this: "Carmel's

19 archaeological resources, including those areas considered to be archaeologically sensitive but

20 not yet surveyed and mapped, shall be maintained and protected for their scientific and cultural

21 heritage values. New land uses, both public and private, should be considered compatible with

22 this objective only where they incorporate all site planning and design features necessary to
23 minimize or avoid impacts to archaeological resources."

24 14. The Carmel Area LUP key policy 2.8.2 is implemented through general policies.
25 General archaeological policy 2.8.3.1 requires the County to "*encourage the timely identification

26 and evaluation of archaeological, historical and paleontological resources in order that these
27 resources be given consideration during the conceptual design phase of land-use planning or
28 project development."
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 5 of 27

1
15.
2 The Carmel Area LUP general archaeological policy 2.8.3.3 requires that "All

3 available measures, including purchase of archaeological easements, dedication to the County,

4 tax relief, purchase of development rights, etc., shall be explored to avoid development on

5 sensitive prehistoric or archaeological sites."

6 16. The Carmel Area LUP general archeological policy 2.8.3.4 requires avoidance or

7 substantial minimization of impacts to protected resources. "When developments are proposed

8 for parcels where archaeological or other cultural sites are located, project design shall be
9  required which avoids or substantially minimizes impacts to such cultural sites. To this end,

10 emphasis should be placed on preserving the entire site rather than on excavation of the resource,
11 particularly where the site has potential religious significance."
12 17. In 2008, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey approved a
13 combined development permit applied for by Skeen & Chang for a coastal development: a three-
14 story single-family home on a vacant lot at 26327 Scenic Road on Carmel Point. On or about
15
July 22, 2008, the Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 08-251 that, among other things, 16

17 set forth specific findings and conditions applicable to Skeen & Chang's Combined

18 Development Permit.

19 18. On or about August 22, 2008, Mr. Sabih filed an action challenging the County of

20 Monterey's approval of Skeen & Chang's project application, Monterey County Superior Court

21 Case No. M93135.

22 19. In or about November of 2011, Mr. Sabih, Skeen and Chang, and the County of

23 Monterey entered into a "Settlement Agreement" (*Settlement Agreement"), a copy of which is

24 attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated fully herein.

25 20. In or about March of 2012, Mr. Sabih dismissed Case No. M93135 pursuant to the
26 Settlement Agreement.

27 21. Skeen & Chang contractually committed to abide by the negotiated terms and
28 conditions set forth in the Settlement Agreement for the construction of a residence on the Skeen
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 6 of 27

2 & Chang Property.

3 22. In approving the development permit for Skeen & Chang, the Board approval

4 relied on a mitigated negative declaration prepared under the California Environmental Quality

5 Act ("CEQA"). The approval required 26 conditions, including three mitigations to address the
6 potential harm to the archacological resources and the neighboring properties.

7 23. At various times between 2011 and mid-2019, Skeen & Chang applied for and

8 received approval to modify the Combined Development Permit (hereafter "Combined
9 Development Permit as Modified") Plaintiff is informed and believes that the Monterey County
10 file numbers include PLN060735, PLN110448, PLN150766, PLN190003, DA190217,
11 17CP01689, 17CP01689-REV1, and 17CP01689-REV2.
12 24. In or around March 2019, Skeen & Chang started construction and excavated more
13 than 700 cubic yards of soil without an archaeological monitor present as required by a Board
14 condition and mitigation, and without notifying Mr. Sabih. In doing so, Skeen & Chang violated 15 multiple Board conditions and mitigations and laws. On June 7, 2019, Mr. Sabih alerted the 16

17 County, and that day the County red-tagged the site due to violations.

18 25. The excavation work is a breach of the Settlement Agreement in numerous respects|

19 including but not limited to the following:

20 a. Skeen & Chang agreed to provide Mr. Sabih and his attorney with a courtesy copy

21 of detailed construction shoring plans prepared by a California licensed structural

22 engineer at least two weeks prior to the initiation of excavation. Skeen & Chang violated

23 Settlement Term No. 3a and 3(b) of the Settlement Agreement by failing to give Plaintiff

24 prior notice or to provide Plaintiff and Plaintiff's attorney with construction drawings.

25 Skeen & Chang violated Settlement Term No. 3c because the engineer who supervised
26 the excavation and installation of the soldier piles at the Skeen & Chang Property had
27 less than a year's experience.

28 b. Skeen & Chang agreed to use the best practices in construction, including
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 7 of 27

2 specifically those practices that prevent dust or other construction material from

3 leaving the site. Skeen & Chang violated Settlement Term 5 of the Settlement
Agreement by, among other things, hitting a water main and requiring all water in
the neighborhood to be turned off for hours; failing to ensure the use of fine mesh

6 netting against a construction fence surrounding the job site; failing to make the

7 netting high enough; failing to make the netting continuous adjacent to the Sabih

8 Property and instead leaving a gap of approximately 10 feet with no netting whatsocver;
failing to ensure the use of impermeable covers for piles of excavation and construction

10 materials; failing to immediately remove excavated dirt and debris from the construction

11 site; and otherwise failing to reduce the impact on Plaintiff's use and peaceful enjoyment
12 of the Sabih Property.
13
C. Skeen & Chang agreed that construction, including deliveries, would be limited to
14 the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday only. Skeen & Chang
15 violated Settlement Term 6 of the Settlement Agreement by allowing construction 16

17 from 7:30 until 5:30 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, with trucks arriving on-site as

18 early 7 as 7 a.m.

d. 19 Skeen & Chang agreed to procure additional liability insurance naming Plaintiff as

20 an additional insured with a certificate of insurance provided to Plaintiff and a

21 courtesy copy to Plaintiff's attorney at least two weeks prior to the beginning of

22 excavation. On information and belief, Skeen & Chang failed to do so in violation

23 of Settlement Term 7 of the Settlement Agreement.

24 C. Skeen & Chang agreed that the engineering firm of Haro Kasunich or its successor

25 would remain involved as engineers throughout construction. Skeen & Chang

26 breached Settlement Term 8 of the 8 Settlement Agreement by not retaining Haro
27 Kasunich or its successor and further by failing to inform Sabih and Sabih's
28 attorneys of the release of Haro Kasunich and the identity of the new engineer of
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION
FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 8 of 27

record.

26. Skeen & Chang have violated the terms and conditions of the County Resolution

4 (Exhibit B hereto) and the Coastal Development Permit as Modified in numerous respects
5 including but not limited to the following:

6 a. Failure to have an archeological monitor present during the excavation of hundreds

7 of acres of cubic yards of soil in highly sensitive archeological area. The

8 requirement for an archeological monitor is shown in mitigations 1, 2 and 3 and are set

9 forth in Conditions 3 and 24 and 25 of the County Board Resolution. The unexamined
10 excavated soils were reportedly trucked to the dump by Defendants or their agents.
11 b. Failure to construct temporary shoring as required by Condition 25 of the County
12 Resolution in order to reduce potential impacts to neighboring structures including the
13 Sabih Property. The shoring was required to be installed by a licensed contractor under
14 the supervision of a licensed geotechnical engineer and the archeological monitor who, as 15 stated in the preceding paragraph, has not supervised any of the excavation to date. In 16

17 response to Plaintiff's concerns that "extreme care must be taken in engineering,

18 planning, and execution of the underpinning, shoring and retaining wall." the County

19 Board of Supervisors stated: "Conditions of approval require this extreme care, adherence

20 to plans and reports, and other measures to ensure no impact." (County Resolution at p.

21 17.) On information and belief, Sabih alleges that on about June 3, 2019, Skeen & Chang,

22 through their general contractor, Cristofalo, fired American Drilling and Daedalus

23 Structural Engineering (*Daedalus"), with which the defendants contracted to design and

24 perform shoring work at the Property. Sabih does not know whether the drilling

25 contractor that has replaced American Drilling has or intends to implement the specific
26 monitoring requirements delineated by American Drilling and Daedalus. These detailed
27 monitoring requirements obligate Skeen & Chang and Cristofalo to make specific and
28 frequent observations and measurements at each stage of the shoring process in order to
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 9 of 27

I

2 prevent horizontal or vertical soils movement during that process. Failure to comply with

3 the monitoring requirements would pose a serious risk that the project site, and in

4 particular the Sabih property, could be destabilized. To Sabih's knowledge, the County

5 has not adopted these monitoring requirements as a condition of the permits issued to

6 Skeen & Chang. Sabih will seek leave of court to amend this Complaint in the event the

7 monitoring requirements are not implemented and strictly complied with by the

8 Defendants. The shoring elements such-as soldier piles constructed to date were not

9 constructed under the supervision of a licensed geotechnical engineer and the

10 archeological monitor.

11 d. Failure to comply by the construction hours set in Condition 14 of the County
12 Resolution. The permitted hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on weekdays only. Actual
13 construction noise and related activity has started as early as 7:00 a.m. and gone to 5:30
14 p.m. on weekdays and Saturdays.
15
C. Failure to comply with Condition 26 of the County Resolution by ensuring that all
16
general contractors and subcontractors involved in shoring, excavation and
17

18 foundation construction maintained liability insurance of not less than $4 million

19 per occurrence starting from the commencement of construction, and that the

20 insurance named Mr. Sabih as an additional insured during the entire time.

21 27. In addition to the harm caused to Mr. Sabih as an individual and to the Sabih

22 Property, the Defendants' breaches and violations have caused harm to other residents of Carmel

23 Point, the general public, the descendants of the original native peoples of California, and to the

24 public at large. Scenic Road is used and enjoyed as significant recreational resource by

25 thousands of visitors from other parts of the country and around the world as well as local
26 residents. By their unannounced and unmonitored removal of massive amounts of native soil,

27 Defendants potentially have harmed Native American human remains and deprived native
28 peoples and the people of the State of California of a rich and irreplaceable resource of great

2 archaeological and spiritual significance.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Breach of Contract - Against Defendants Skeen & Chang)

5 28. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of 1 through 27 Paragraphs herein by this

6 reference.

7 29. Plaintiff has fully performed all obligations to Defendants pursuant to the

8 Settlement Agreement (Exhibit A) except those obligations Plaintiff was prevented or excused

9 from performing.

10 30. Defendants Skeen & Chang have breached the Settlement Agreement as set forth
11 above.

12 31. As a result of Skeen & Chang's breach of the Settlement Agreement, Trustee Sabih
13 has suffered damage to the Sabih Property, and continues to suffer damages, in an amount to be
14 proven at trial in excess of $25,000.
15
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
16

17 (Declaratory Relief- Against Defendants Skeen & Chang)

18 32. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 27 and 29 through 31

19 herein by this reference.

20 33. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiff and Defendants

21 Skeen & Chang concerning their respective rights, duties and liabilities under the Settlement

22 Agreement and the Combined Development Permit as Modified. Plaintiff contends he is entitled

23 to full performance of the Settlement Agreement by Skeen & Chang. On information and belief,

24 Skeen & Chang appear to contend their actions are consistent with Combined Development

25 Permit as Modified, which conditions offer less protection to Plaintiff and to the Sabih Property
26 than does the Settlement Agreement. Plaintiff contends Skeen & Chang are not in compliance
27 with the Combined Development Permit as Modified.
28 34. Plaintiff desires a judicial determination and declaration of Plaintiff's rights and
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 11 of 27

1

2 Defendant Skeen & Chang's duties and liabilities pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the

3 Combined Development Permit as Modified.

4 35. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time in order that the

5 parties may ascertain their respective rights, duties and liabilities and minimize the detriment and

6 damages to Plaintiff and the Sabih Property as a result of Skeen & Chang's violations of the

7 Settlement Agreement and the Combined Development Permit as Modified. Such a declaration is

8 especially necessary in that the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey is currently
9 considering lifting the red tag imposed on the Skeen & Chang Property, despite the unresolved

10 issues enumerated in this complaint, and associated threat of increased injury to the Sabih
11 Property.
12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
13 (Negligence - Against Defendants Skeen, Chang, Cristofolo and DOES 1-500)
14 36. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 27 and 29 through 31
15
herein by this reference.
16
37. At all times prior to March 2019, the Sabih Property, in its natural state, was 17

18 receiving lateral support from the Skeen & Chang Property.

19 38. Beginning in or about March 2019, excavations were conducted on the Skeen &

20 Chang Property, on information and belief, by Defendant Cristofalo or one or more of

21 Cristofalo's agents, employees and/or subcontractors.

22 39. On information and belief, Defendant Cristofalo did not supervise the agent(s),

23 employee(s) and/or subcontractor(s) in the performance of the excavation work on the Skeen &

24 Chang Property because Defendant Cristofalo was reported to be in Europe on vacation.

25 40. On information and belief, the excavation work was performed with Skeen &

26 Chang's knowledge, consent and direction.

27 41. Defendants, and cach of them, failed to comply with the Settlement Agreement,
28 Combined Development Permit as Modified and California Civil Code section 832 subsection
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 12 of 27

1

2 (3) and possibly other laws and regulations by, among other things, not giving Plaintiff advance

3 or any notice stating when the excavation would begin and/or the depth to which the excavation

4 as intended to be made.

5 42. Defendants, and each of them, not only failed to use "best practices" required by the

6 Settlement Agreement or "extreme care" required by the County Resolution at p. 17, but also,

7 Defendants failed to exercise "ordinary care and skill" in making the excavations and failed to

8 take reasonable precautions to sustain and support the Sabih Property in its natural state.

9 43. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' negligence, including the
10 excavation conducted without notice and in the negligent manner alleged, the Sabih Property was
11 deprived of its lateral support and the Sabih Property's earth and soil are at risk of subsiding and
12 slipping into the excavation, causing damage to the Sabih Property. The value of the Sabih
13 Property has been diminished and Plaintiff has been and will continue to be forced to incur costs
14 to investigate, mitigate and abate Defendants' conduct in performing the excavation in an 15
amount to be proven at trial.
16

17 44. Plaintiff is informed and believes that on or about June 7, 2019, the Monterey

18 County Resource Management Agency issued a Stop Work Notice in response to Plaintiff's

19 complaints regarding the work at the Skeen & Chang Property.

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Private Nuisance - Against Defendants Skeen, Chang, Cristofalo and DOES 1-500)

22 45. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 27 herein by this

23 reference.

24 46. The aforementioned actions of Defendants set forth in Paragraphs 25 and 26
25 constitute a nuisance within the meaning of Civil Code section 3479 in that it is injurious to Mr.
26 Sabih's health and safety, threatens the Sabih Property, and interferes with Plaintiff's
27 comfortable use and enjoyment of the Sabih Property.
28 47. Each and every act by Defendants, and each of them, has been without the consent,
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 13 of 27

1

2 against the will, and in violation of the rights of Plaintiff pursuant to the Settlement Agreement,

3 the Combined Development Permit as Modified and/or California law.

4 48. a As a direct and proximate result of the nuisance created by Defendants, and each of

5 them, Plaintiff has been and will continue to be forced to incur costs to investigate, mitigate and

6 abate Defendants' work on the Skeen & Chang Property in an amount to be proven at trial.

7 49. As a further direct and proximate result of the nuisance created by Defendants, and

8 each of them, the value of the Sabih Property has been diminished in an amount to be proven at
9 trial.

10 50. As a further direct and proximate result of the nuisance created by Defendants, and
11 cach of them, specifically the dust, excavation materials, noise and noxious odors that
12 Defendants, and each of them, allowed to escape from the Skeen & Chang Property, Mr. Sabih
13 has been hurt and injured in his health, strength and activity, sustaining injuries and irritation to
14 his eyes and respiratory system which have caused, and continue to cause, Plaintiff irritation,
15
physical pain and suffering. As a result of such injuries, Mr. Sabih has and will continue to incur 16

17 medical bills and related expenses and suffer general damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
51.
18 As a further direct and proximate result of the nuisance created by Defendants, and

19 each of them, Plaintiff's peaceful enjoyment of the property has been violated by work

20 conducted outside the weekday hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. (to which Skeen & Chang agreed

21 in the Settlement Agreement) causing noise, odors and vibrations that are offensive to the senses

22 and obstruct Plaintiff's free use and enjoyment of the Sabih Property between 7:30 and 8 a.m. on

23 weekdays, between 4:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on weekdays and from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on

24 Saturdays.

25 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Unfair Business Practices - Violation of Business & Professions Code §17200 et seq.
27 Against Defendants Skeen, Chang, Cristofalo and DOES 1-500)
28 52. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 27 and 29 through
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 14 of 27

1

2 31 herein by this reference.

3 53. By their violations of the Settlement Agreement and of the conditions stipulated

4 in the Combined Development Permit as set forth hereinabove, the Defendants have engaged in

5 unfair business practices, in that they have negligently or intentionally caused or permitted such

6 violations to occur and to continue, and have gained thereby an unfair advantage in the

7 development and construction of the Project relative to other property owners in Monterey

8 County who are similarly situated.

9 54. Unless restrained and enjoined from such violations, Mr. Sabih will suffer
10 irreparable harm in that he will continue to suffer injury to his health and strength as a proximate
11 result of the defendants' unlawful acts, and irreparable injury will occur to the Sabih Property.
12 Monetary damages are inadequate to compensate Mr. Sabih for such irreparable harm.
13 55. Mr. Sabih is entitled to restitution, of a kind and amount to be determined at trial,
14 of such amounts or property, real or personal, that the Defendants may have acquired by means 15 of such unfair competition.
16
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 (Fraud - Promise Made Without Intent to Perform - Against Defendants Skeen & Chang)

19 56. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 27, 29 through 31

20 and 53 through 55 herein by this reference.

21 57. On information and belief, when Skeen & Chang entered into the Settlement

22 Agreement with Mr. Sabih, said Defendants had no intention of performing those terms that were

23 intended to protect and safeguard Mr. Sabih and the Sabih Property from the negative and

24 injurious effects of the project being constructed over many months within 10 feet of the Sabih

25 Property.

26 58. On information and belief, Skeen & Chang deliberately withheld from Cristofalo
27 the terms of the Settlement Agreement, including the limits on construction hours specified in
28 Term No. 6 of the agreement.
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 15 of 27

59.
2 The parties intended for the Settlement Agreement to serve as a full and final

3 resolution of Mr. Sabih's claims against Skeen & Chang relating to the Project, and in fact, after

4 the Settlement Agreement was fully executed by the parties, Mr. Sabih dismissed his lawsuit

5 with prejudice.

6 60. At the time Mr. Sabih entered into the Settlement Agreement, he did not know,

7 and could not have ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, Skeen & Chang's true

8 intentions not to comply with its terms, and Skeen & Chang were aware of Mr. Sabih's

9 ignorance of their intentions.

10 61. Reasonably relying on Skeen & Chang's representations as set forth in the terms
11 and conditions of the Settlement Agreement, and on Skeen & Chang's full execution of the
12 agreement, Mr. Sabih dismissed his lawsuit with prejudice. If Mr. Sabih had known Skeen &
13 Chang's true intentions, he would not have entered into the Settlement Agreement or dismissed
14 his lawsuit with prejudice.
15
62. As set forth herein above, Skeen & Chang and their agent, Cristofalo, thereafter 16

17 repeatedly breached, and continue to breach, several terms of the Settlement Agreement that

18 were intended to safeguard and protect the Plaintiff and the Sabih Property from injury and

19 damage.

20 63. As a proximate result of Skeen & Chang's secret intentions, fraud, and breaches

21 of the Settlement Agreement, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer injury to his health,

22 strength, tranquility and quiet enjoyment of his property; and further, Plaintiff has had to employ

23 attorneys, consultants, monitors, and other professionals in order to try to enforce the Settlement

24 Agreement, all to his monetary damage in amounts to be proved at trial.

25 64. Skeen & Chang's conduct as described herein above was willful and was intended

26 to cause injury to the Plaintiff or was done in reckless disregard of the foreseeable injury to
27 Plaintiff. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an award of exemplary or punitive damages.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

3 65. Petitioner seeks in this action to require Respondents, and each of them, to comply

4 with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Coastal Act, and all other applicable

5 law in their actions, to fulfill their statutory obligations under CEQA, the Coastal Act, and other

6 law to provide the information and investigation required by law, and to proceed in the manner

7 required by law. This action is brought in the public interest and challenges the actions of the

8 County of Monterey with regard to its actions in 2019 as to the 2019 violations at the Skeen &

9 Chang Property.

10 66. The Skeen & Chang Project, as approved, includes excavation for a driveway, a
11 motor court, and a habitable floor below ground level. This lower level includes a bedroom,
12 bathroom, laundry room, elevator, two-car garage, wine cellar, and more. Doors, windows, and
13 light wells would provide light and direct exterior access to and from the lower level. The
14 proposed house was 2,950 square feet, which was consistent with the 45% floor-area ratio limit
15 of the County Code, based on Skeen & Chang's claim that the lot size was 4,700 square feet. In 16

17 2008 the Board of Supervisors approved a mitigated negative declaration under the California

18 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and approved Board resolution 08-251 that granted a

19 development permit to Skeen & Chang subject to 26 conditions.

20 First Claim
Violation of California Environmental Quality Act
21 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

22 67. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of the Introduction and of Paragraphs 1

23 through 29 and 65 through 66 herein by this reference.

24 68. The Board adopted specific findings and conditions and mitigations with regard to
25 certain sensitive and controversial aspects of the Project. The adopted initial study for the
26 mitigated negative declaration had identified significant adverse impacts on the development that
27 required mitigation. The Board resolution adopted a total of three CEQA mitigations.
28

FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 17 of 27

2 69. CEQA mitigations 1 and 2 (CDP 1 conditions 3 and 24) addressed the discovery

3 during construction of archaeological resources and human remains. The mitigations required

4 the presence of an archaeologist on site during all earth-disturbing activities. The monitor was

5 given the authority to halt work in order to examine any potentially significant cultural materials

6 and features. The two mitigations regarding the archeological monitor were critical to protectingl

7 the resources as required by the Carmel Area Land Use Plan and CEQA. When archeological

8 resources are lost, the information they contain are lost to science and history. When Native

9 American remains and artifacts are destroyed or harmed through excavation, the impacts are

10 significant. These impacts are avoidable.

11 70. CEQA mitigation 3 (CDP condition 25) required all temporary shoring to be
12 installed by a licensed contractor according to plans approved by the RMA and under the direct
13 supervision of a licensed geotechnical engineer along with supervision from the archaeological
14 monitor . . . The engineer shall have the ability to make adjustments as necessary to provide
15
maximum protection of life and surrounding structures."
16
71.
17 Between 2010 and 2018, the County staff signed off on various conditions and

18 approved several different modifications to the original approved project PLN060735. The

19 County assigned several different project numbers (starting with the preface PLN or DA) to the

20 project modifications.

21 72. In June 2017 Real Parties submitted building plans and in April 2018 the County
22 issued permit 17CP01689.

23 73. On or around late March 2019, Real Parties started construction at the site. The

24 owners disturbed the earth for weeks by grading, removing vegetation, excavating for retaining

25 walls, and using large metal drills to drill deep into the earth to make large holes and to place

26 massive metal soldier piles to a depth of some 15 feet deep or more below the level of the street.

27 The owners posted signs stating the hours of construction were 8 am to 5:30 pm Monday through
28 Friday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays. Actual construction activities often began around 7:30
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION
FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 18 of 27

*

* 2 a.m. with trucks often idling at the site from 7 a.m. These hours materially exceeded the County

3 CDP condition 14 that limited the hours to 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through 4 Friday only. The

4 longer construction hours impacted the public due to the increased traffic and noise and dust on

5 Scenic Road, which is heavily used by the public as a walking area and is identified in the

6 Carmel Area LUP as a scenic and recreational area. The longer hours also impacted the

7 neighbors.

8 74. In February 2019 Skeen & Chang and their agents submitted an application that

9 proposed changes to the project including a reduction in the size of the house by 39 square feet.
10 The revised site plan contained one or more materially different lot line dimensions from the site
11 plan approved in 2008. The changed dimensions reduced the lot area to materially less than
12 4,700 square feet, but Skeen & Chang and their agents failed to call the County's attention to the
13 changed lot dimensions and the reduced lot area, and instead continued to represent that the lot
14 area was 4,700 square feet.
15
75. In considering the February 2019 application, the County again relied on the 16

17 Skeen & Chang representation and again failed to correctly determine the lot area. The County

18 in April 2019 approved permit 17CP01689-REV1, which included revised house plans that

19 exceed the maximum 45% floor-area ratio allowed by the Coastal Implementation Plan section

20 20.12.060.F. Therefore, the 2019 permit is null and void under Coastal Implementation Plan

21 section 20.90.010 [*CONFORMANCE TO PROVISIONS REQUIRED. "permits ... shall

22 conform to the provisions of this Title and the remaining parts of the Monterey County Coastal
23 Implementation Plan, ... and any such permits or licenses, if issued in conflict with the provisions

24 of this title, shall be null and void.") Reducing the house size by approximately 30 to 40 square

25 feet to comply with the maximum FAR is feasible since constructed of the house has not yet

26 commenced.

27 76. Real Parties did not have the required archeological monitor present for the many
28 weeks of earth disturbance. Even after the neighbors brought the lack of an archaeological
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 19 of 27

1

2 monitor to the County's attention, the County failed to require the Real Parties to recover the

3 dumped soils or inspect them for archeological resources. When Petitioner's counsel asked

4 where the soils went, senior County planning managers said they did not know. They were not

5 aware of the Project's construction management plan, a plan that the County had required (CDP

6 condition 14) and on which the County had signed off. The County failed to enforce mitigations

7 and 2.

8 77. In its actions, the County violated its stated policy of protecting and preserving
9 archaeological resources and monitoring of earth-disturbing activities likely to harm such

10 resources. The County's actions are incompatible with the Carmel Area LUP policy to avoid or
11 minimize earth-disturbing activities in order to prevent such harm.
12 78. Skeen & Chang's violation of CEQA mitigations 1 and 2 drew only a small tap on
13 the wrist from the County in the form of a $4,300 fine one-tenth of the cost of an
14 archacological monitor. The RMA staff decided to use an administrative remedy in title 1 of the.
15 County Code in imposing the fine for the failure to have a monitor present. - Title 1 is not the 16

17 correct remedy because it is not part of the Monterey County Local Coastal Program and because

18 it was not intended to remedy violations of CEQA/LCP mitigations. The fine was improperly

19 calculated and woefully insufficient to address Skeen & Chang's serious CEQA/LCP violations

20 or to deter future violations,. Mr. Sabih and Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources objected to

21 the decision and to the fine as insufficient under relevant codes, plans, and laws. The Board of

22 Supervisors has taken the matter under consideration, and it is not clear whether the Board has

23 taken final action; thus, Petitioner files this litigation out of an abundance of caution.

24 79. After: project has been approved and while it is still being developed a mitigation

25 measure or condition of approval may be changed or deleted if the measure has been found to be

26 impractical or unworkable. Here, there was no evidence before the County that Mitigation

27 Measures and 2 as adopted by the County in 2008 were impractical or unworkable. Thus, the
28 County's failure to adequately address Skeen & Chang's violation violated California law.
FIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEFANDVERIFIED PETITION
FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Page 20 of 27

Further, the actions of Skeen & Chang contributed to the ongoing destruction of cultural and
archaeological resources by development at Carmel Point. In July 2019 four more sets of human

4 remains were uncovered at Carmel Point through earth-disturbing activities where no

5 archeological monitor and no tribal monitor was present. Starting in 2015, County discretionary

6 approvals in the Carmel Point area have included the requirement for tribal monitors pursuant to

7 AB 52, which amended the Public Resources Code.

8 80.: The environmental impacts of past and proposed projects are relevant to the

9 determination of cumulative impact analysis required for the environmental review of the

10 County's and the Owners' actions. § (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(h)(1)-(3).) CEQA requires
11 the evaluation of cumulative impacts. Cumulatively considerable means the incremental effects
12 of a project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of other closely related
13 past projects, present projects, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative
14 impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over
15 period of time. (CEQA Guidelines, §15355.) The same argument applies to impacts of 16

17 individual and collective violations of mitigations taking place over a period of time.

18 81. There is extensive activity at Carmel Point, including new development, major

19 remodels of existing homes and possibly minor work on existing homes, including landscaping

20 work. Any earth disturbance can affect existing archeological and tribal cultural resources. This

21 risk was recently demonstrated by the gardeners digging at an existing residential property to put

22 in a gas pipeline for an exterior fire pit, which uncovered the remains of Native Americans.

23 82. Petitioner, though his counsel, has engaged in extensive efforts to encourage the

24 RMA to address the Defendants' multiple violations of CEQA requirements, LCP requirements,

25 and permit conditions, to no avail. The County RMA staff eventually decided to give the owners

26 a free pass on all of the violations except for the failure to have an archaeological monitor
27 present.

83.
2 The County's mandated, statutory obligation to implement and enforce mitigation

3 measures is continuing one, such that the statute of limitations has not run, and the County has

4 an ongoing duty to implement and monitor the mitigations and conditions because the project is

5 in the early stages and is not yet completed. Where a public agency fails to perform a mandatory,
6 statutorily imposed duty, a writ of mandate commanding performance is appropriate. (See Code

7 Civ. Proc., §1085.)

8 84. Respondents did not proceed in a manner required by law and have not
9 scrupulously enforced all legislatively mandated CEQA and Coastal Act requirements. CEQA

10 and the Coastal Act do not allow public agency in connection with any development project to
11 make promises during the environmental review process that certain, specified environmental
12 mitigation measures will be implemented in connection with that project; to enact those
13 mitigation measures and rely on and incorporate them into the project approvals; and then simply
14 neglect or disregard its statutorily-imposed obligation.
15 85. Petitioner performed all required conditions precedent to filing this action by
16

17 complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by, on November 18,

18 2019, emailing and mailing a letter stating his written notice of intent to commence this action to

19 the County of Monterey board of supervisors and its Clerk and County Counsel. A proof of

20 service of the letter is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by such attachment

21 and reference.

22 86. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that as of November

23 18, 2019, the time for filing an appeal to the California Coastal Commission had not yet begun,

24 or if it has begun, it has not yet elapsed for the County ordinance as of the filing of this petition,

25 if an appeal lies; the County has denied that an appeal lies. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 1311.)

26 87. Petitioner has standing in this action, and has exhausted, or has not yet been able to

27 exhaust, or has been excused from, all administrative remedies reasonably and legally available
28 to Petitioner. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

2 Second Claim
Violation of Violation of California Coastal Act
3 (Pub. Resources Code, § 30000 et seq.)
88. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of the Introduction and of Paragraphs 1
5 through 29, 65 through 66, and 68 through 87 herein by this reference.

6 89. Under the Coastal Act, a Local Coastal Program includes a county's: (a) land use
7 plans, (b) zoning ordinances, (c) zoning district maps, and (d) within sensitive coastal resources
8 areas, other implementing actions. (Pub. Resources Code, § 30108.6.) Changes in a coastal
county's zoning laws that effectively amend a county's Local Coastal Program, and which
10 constitute a "development," require approval from the California Coastal Commission, which
11 oversees land use in California's Coastal Zone. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 30108.6, 30510.)
12
90. The County actions here apply to a lot of record a in the Coastal Zone. Respondents, 13 have not complied with the Coastal Act, the adopted Monterey County Local Coastal Plan or the 14

15 coastal implementation plan. The County actions here would set a precedent for all lots of

16 record in the coastal zone in the County.

17 91. The Monterey County Local Coastal Program includes the Coastal

18 Implementation Plan, which is title 20 of the Monterey County Code. Title 15 of the County

19 Code addresses public services. Coastal Implementation Plan section 20.96.010 states that

20 County Code chapter 15.04 is adopted and incorporated into title 20 by reference. (County

21 Code, § 20.96.010.C.1.)

22 92. For each and every one of the issues and reasons stated, Respondents have not
23 proceeded in the manner required by law with regard to the Monterey County Local Coastal
24 Program and the Coastal Act.

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as described below

2 93. Plaintiff incorporates the allegations of the Introduction and of Paragraphs 1

3 through 30, 65 through 66, 68 through 87 and 89 through 92 herein by this reference.

4 94. Respondents did not comply with policies in the 2010 Monterey County Code and

5 did not enforce conditions of approval as required by the Code, including Title 20. County CDP

6 condition 1 stated, "Any use of construction not in substantial conformance with the terms and

7 conditions of this permit is a violation of County regulations and may result in modification or

8 revocation of this permit and subsequent legal action." Skeen & Chang violated this condition as
9 described above and in the records before the County.

10 95. The County issued at least two land use permits and approvals (DA190217 and
11 17CP01689-REV2) during the pendency of the stop work notice, which is inconsistent with
12 County Code sections 20.90.130 and 20.90.120.
13 96. For each and every one of the issues and reasons stated in this pleading and in the
14 correspondence to the County, Respondents have not proceeded in the matter required by law as
15

16 to the County Code and California Planning & Zoning Law.

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as described below.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
18

19 WHEREFORE, Plaintiff requests relief as follows:

20 On the Complaint as to Skeen, Chang, Cristofalo, and Does 1-500:

21 1. For damages in excess of $25,000 in an amount to be determined at trial;

22 2. For a declaratory judgment setting forth Plaintiff's rights and Defendants' duties

23 and liabilities pursuant to the Settlement Agreement and the Combined Development Permit as

24 Modified;

25 3. For general damages according to proof;

26 4. For a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction
27 enjoining the Defendants, and each of them, from continuing violations of the terms of the
28 Settlement Agreement and the Combined Development Permit as Modified;

7 On the Petition as to The County of Monterey:

8 1. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents, and each

9 of them,

10 (a) to vacate and set aside their decisions as to the violations of the conditions and
11 mitigations for the Skeen/Chang project and the remedies for the violations,
12 (b) to set aside the building permits that Respondents issued to Real Parties for the
13 project, and
14
(c) in the future to follow California regulations and statutes in complying with 15

16 CEQA and the Coastal Act in any subsequent action taken to consider the project, the

17 mitigations and conditions, the violations, and the remedies;

2.
18 For a judgment determining or declaring that Respondents failed to fully comply

19 with CEQA, the Coastal Act, Planning and Zoning law, the Local Coastal Program, as

20 they relate to the Project and the past Project approvals and that Respondents' actions in

21 2019 were illegal in at least some respect, rendering their actions and approvals null and

22 void;

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

This Agreement is entered into by and between David Sabih ("Sabih") and Dale Skeen and Jo Mei Chang (collectively "Skeen") and the County of Monterey ("County").
This Agreement is intended to resolve the entire case entitled Sabih V. County of Monterey, Monterey County Superior Court case number M93135, arising out of the project application (Monterey County PLN 060735) and approvals for the property owned by Skeen located at 26327 Scenic Road, Carmel, which property is adjacent to the Sabih residence located at 26333 Scenic Road, Carmel.

The parties agree as follows:

1. Setback. The Skeen house, at the lower level portion of the structure, will be set back at least 8 feet along the property line shared with Sabih, as shown on the amended design drawings dated August 19, 2011, attached hereto as Exhibit A. As to the shared property line and the rear (east) property line, the Skeen house will be located as shown in the attached amended design plans (i.e., not moved west a further 18 inches as tentatively sketched in the plan versions dated April 5
and April 6, 2011).

2. Cypress tree. Skeen gives Sabih permission to trench the area on Skeen property between the location of the Skeen house and the Sabih property line at Sabih's expense. Sabih shall give Skeen at least 10 days-notice of when the trenching will occur and Skeen may have his arborist present, if he wishes. The
trenching may be up to 4 feet deep and will be done at the perimeter of the area of proposed excavation for the project as shown on the County Planning Department's approved revised site plan for the project. The trenching shall occur within 60 days of Skeen's written notification to Sabih of County Planning Department approval of the revised site plan and house design and shall be done prior to excavation procedures for the house construction. The purpose of the trenching is to identify any significant roots from the Sabih cypress tree and to assess the roots at the trenched locations. If any root two (2) or more inches in diameter is found during the exploratory trenching, or any time thereafter once construction begins, the contractor shall promptly implement the root mitigation measures set forth in the letter of arborist Rob Thompson, a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit B. Sabih agrees to indemnify and hold Skeen harmless from any claims or damages made by third parties, their agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors retained by Sabih, or other third parties invited onto the property by Sabih, resulting from any accident or injury occurring on Skeen's property related to the exploratory trenching. In addition, Sabih agrees to indemnify and hold Skeen harmless from any liens incurred in regard to the costs of the trenching itself.

3. (a) Shoring. Detailed construction shoring drawings will be prepared by a California licensed structural engineer, and a courtesy copy will be provided to Sabih and to Sabih's attorney at least two weeks prior to the initiation of
excavation. The shoring drawings also will address the issue of how the project will handle any water that is discovered during construction.

(b) Load. Construction drawings prepared by a California licensed structural
engineer that show how the Skeen property will be designed to withstand the
load from the Sabih property (including structures) will be provided to Sabih and to Sabih's attorney, as a courtesy, at least two weeks prior to the initiation of excavation.

(c) Expertise. All contractors (including subcontractors) involved with excavation, shoring and underground construction will have significant expertise in those areas, and will be skilled and experienced in such work.

4. Stone Wall. Sabih's existing stone wall at the shared property line will be protected in place throughout construction.

5. Best Practices. Contractors at the site shall use best practices in construction, including specifically those practices that prevent dust or other construction material from leaving the site. These practices shall include the use of fine mesh netting against a construction fence surrounding the job site, and the use of impermeable covers for piles of construction materials, including excavation materials. Skeen shall use reasonable efforts to reduce the impact upon Sabih's use of his property during construction, including the managing of parking and traffic as necessary.

6. Hours of Construction. Consistent with County Condition 14, the hours of
construction (including deliveries) shall be limited to 8 a.m. to 4 P.M. Monday
through Friday only.

7. Insurance. Consistent with County Condition 26, which requires additional liability insurance naming Sabih, the policy and additional named insured certificate will be provided to Sabih, with a courtesy copy to Sabih's attorney, at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the excavation.

8. Haro Kasunich. Skeen represents that the engineering firm of Haro Kasunich, or
its successor, will remain involved as engineers throughout the construction.

9. Point of Contact. Skeen will a provide a person who will be the single point of contact for Sabih during construction. Skeen agrees that the contact person will respond promptly and in good faith to concerns raised by Sabih.

10. Water Availability Sabih does not contest, and will not contest, Skeen's claim that the project, as substantially shown on Exhibit A, has a legal water supply from Cal-Am for the project.

11. Attorney Fees and Costs. Each party shall bear their own attorney fees and costs, except that 1) Skeen will reimburse Sabih his reasonable litigation costs of $810 (comprised of a $320 filing fee and a $490 transcript preparation cost) and 2) Skeen shall pay to Sabih's attorney the amount of $20,000 representing a negotiated amount of fees arising from the prosecution of the third and fourth causes of action for declaratory relief arising out of a claim of an unlawful pattern and practice by the County. County and Skeen represent to each other and agree that Skeen's payment of these fees and costs shall fully satisfy any and all
of Skeen's obligations under the County's Indemnification Agreement required by County Condition 4 of the project approval and the subsequent Joint Defense Agreement (made effective August 22, 2008) between Skeen and the County
related to the defense of this action. The check from Skeen should be made
payable to Michael W. Stamp Attorney Trust Account and delivered to the Stamp law office.

12. Skeen shall secure County Planning Department approval of the amended house location and design as shown on Exhibit A, attached hereto. Sabih will support County approval of the amended design as set forth on Exhibit A, and reasonably support any other reasonable amendment to the Skeen permit application that is required by the County to implement this Agreement. Skeen shall advise Sabih when all such County Planning Department approvals have been obtained. Sabih agrees to file the dismissal of the entire action against Skeen and the County within ten business days after receipt of payment of above referenced litigation fees and costs, as described above, and upon written notification from Skeen that all County Planning Department approvals have been given for the revised design.

13. The parties agree to act reasonably and in good faith in resolving any dispute that arises under this Agreement. Venue for any action to enforce this
Agreement shall be Monterey County Superior Court.

Subject: Root protection measures for Skeen property bome development project
Dear Ms. Kemp.
Per your request, the following root protection measures should be implemented in the cvent primary roots of 2 inches or larger in diameter are encountered during proposed excavation and grading opcrations associated with home devclopment al 26327 Scenio Road in Carmel. These recommendations address concerns expressed by a neighboring property owuer regarding potential construction impacts on a mature Monterey Cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) tree that is located on their property. Root protection protocol and recommendations are as follows: :
ra

I) If primary roots 2 inches or larger in diameter are cncountered stop excavating with heavy mechanized equipment and carefully ciear area around tree roots whh band digging tools. 2) Clcanly cut damaged or severed roots so they are not protruding out from cut slope. 3) Cover exposed roots with moist burlap fabric or equivalent until roots are permanendy covered with backfill material.
4) Have a certified arborist or tree care professional monitor and inspect trees that have sustained

years. damage to primary roots 2 inches or larger in diameter at least once a year for a period of five

Please let me know if you have any questions or if additional infortsation is nceded.
Thank you and bost regards,...

Resources Code, § 21167.5), Coastal Act, Callfornia Planning & Zoning Law, and other laws

Chair Phillips and members of the Board of Supervisors, Ms. Ralph, and Mr. Girard:
I represent David Sabih and Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources in this land
use matter involving the Skeen/Chang property at 26327 Scenic Road.

Current status.

My clients have raised issues to the Board challenging the staff-proposed remedy and the County's actions regarding the accountability of Skeen/Chang for their multiple violations of the County's Combined Development Permit, the County's 2011
Settlement Agreement, and other laws, codes and plans. I have been informed that the Board of Supervisors is continuing to consider my clients' challenges to the County RMA staff proposal to let off the property owners scot-free with only a $4,300 fine for one of the several material violations of County conditions, codes and plans. The violations, the staff proposals and my clients' complaints and objections are before the
Board for review and action. The most recent information provided to me by the County was that there was no time frame for Board action on this issue and the Board has not
made a final determination as to my clients' objections to the inadequate remedies that
the RMA staff had proposed for the violations. My clients continue to object in the strongest terms to the lifting of the red tag on the Skeen/Chang property at this time.

Violations.

The violations and issues have been described in detail in my previous correspondence. The Board-adopted permit condition requiring an archaeological
monitor is a CEQA mitigation. There is no dispute that the condition/mitigation was
disregarded. There was no archaeological monitor present for the earth-disturbing activities. Failure to comply with an adopted mitigation is a very serious CEQA violation, and the County has not complied with CEQA to date. The RMA staff has

EXHIBIT B Page 002

Board of Supervisors, Clerk of the Board, County Counsel November 18, 2019
Page 2

proposed fine that essentially ignores the harms and the impacts of the property owners' failure to comply with the mitigation.
My clients have challenged the RMA staff decisions to ignore all but one of the violations of the Board conditions and the small fine as to one violation. The public was flabbergasted by the County RMA staff's proposed de minimis fine. If the staff proposal is adopted as the County's final position, it would mean that every developer would be better off financially to violate the County's permit conditions than to comply with them. The RMA staff used the wrong remedy and wrong methodology to propose a $4,300 fine for the violation of the Combined Development Permit condition that required the presence of an archaeological monitor for all earth-disturbing activities to comply with the Local Coastal Program. The RMA staff used a fine authorized in Title of the
County code. Title is not part of the coastal implementation plan and thus is inapplicable. (See County Code, § 20.96.010.) Small fines are not sufficient and not intended to remedy violations of material permit conditions and CEQA mitigations.
Small fines like the one proposed by staff would be an incentive for applicants to violate
all conditions and merely pay the fines, which are minor in comparison with the cost of compliance with conditions. Fines alone do not mitigate for the harm to the resources
and are not compatible with the intent and language of the plans, the policies and the laws. "Paying a fine ... shall not relieve any person from responisibility for correcting any
condition which violates any provision of this Title or the remaining portions of the Monterey County Coastal Implementation Plan." (County Code, § 20.90.080.D.)
Other violations at the site include the impermissible size of the house, the illegally expanded hours of construction, the failure to use a structural engineer for this high-risk construction, and other claims made to the County in the administrative proceedings and in the pending litigation against Skeen/Chang.

Misrepresentation of lot size resulting in FAR violation.

The County failed to perform reasonable diligence in reviewing the claims of Skeen/Chang at the time of the original applicationi and at the time of the recent Skeen/Chang applications for revisions. Skeen/Chang materially misrepresented the size of the lot and in reliance on Skeen/Chang's claim the County approved a larger house than allowed at the site. (E.g., 2008 Board approval, finding 2(c).) In 2019 Skeen/Chang revised the dimensions of the lot on the plans and did not revise the claimed size of the lot area. The County again relied on the claim and again failed to correctly determine the size of the lot. The County approved revised house plans that
exceed the maximum 45% floor-area ratio allowed by the Coastal Implementation Plan section 20.12.060.F. (See 17CP01689-REV1.) The permit is null and void. (§ 20.90.010 "CONFORMANCE TO PROVISIONS REQUIRED. "permits ... shall
conform to the provisions of this Title and the remaining parts of the Monterey County Coastal Implementation Plan, ... and any such permits or licenses, if issued in conflict with the provisions of this title, shall be null and void.") Reducing the house size by 34 square feet to comply with the maximum FAR is feasible. The house has not yet been

EXHIBIT B Page 003

Board of Supervisors, Clerk of the Board, County Counsel November 18, 2019
Page 3

constructed. There is no vested right. The County has no discretion under the circumstances. (§ 20.90.130.)
Impermissible favoritism by RMA staff.
The County staff gave the Skeen/Chang property more favorable treatment than similarly situated properties, and if left uncorrected the resources, the public, the public trust, and the neighbors would be harmed because they would be forced to bear the brunt of impacts of a house that is larger than is allowed under the County Code, and which other properties are denied. The County Code requires strict compliance with the conditions and the code. The harms include visual, excavation, resources, and other impacts. The owner and contractor would benefit from this unfair competition. The County RMA staff decisions would enable and condone unfair competition because they would allow the project to proceed with inadequate remedies, when other applicants are comply with the conditions, mitigations and codes.
RMA staff has issued two permits while the stop-work order is in place.
The County staff has approved and issued at least two discretionary land use permits - DA190217 and 17CP01689-REV2 - while the stop-work order was in place. The County actions are in conflict with the County's duties under County Code sections 20.90.120 (no application shall be deemed complete if there is a grading violation until remedyis in place) and 20.90.130 (refusal to issue permits while violation outstanding).

The County is required to redress violations.

The County is not at liberty to ignore violations of a coastal development permit. The conditions and mitigations must be enforced by the County consistent with the Coastal Act, CEQA, Califomia Planning & Zoning law, and other statutes, regulations
and codes. The public may seek to hold the County accountable if the County refuses to act or acts in a way inconsistent with the law. In this case, some of the conditions and mitigations were adopted as a result of Mr. Sabih's appeal to the Board from the
planning commission approvals and in recognition of the need to mitigate impacts pertaining specifically to the neighboring properties.
My clients intend to seek to hold the County accountable. My clients' options include asking the Coastal Commission and its enforcement staff to step in, and to otherwise take prompt action under the law.
My clients have observed that the County has a pattemn and practice of not enforcing the County codes and plans when Mr. Lombardo's clients ask for something from the County. This includes statements under penalty of perjury by a Lombardo employee that she was the property owner of two Carmel Point parcels, which resulted in the County improperly giving Lombardo's client a permit when no permit should have

EXHIBIT B Page 004

Board of Supervisors, Clerk of the Board, County Counsel
November 18, 2019
Page 4

been issued, and when the client then trenched and dug deeply without an archeological monitor and tribal monitor as required.
The County's actions have fostered unfair business practices because Mr. Lombardo and his clients have benefitted financially from avoiding compliance with the applicable rules, plans and codes. The County actions have resulted in harm to the resources that the County is required to protect under the LCP, the Coastal Act, CEQA, and other laws. The actions have violated the Local Coastal Program protections at Carmel Point. I refer you to and incorporate by reference my communications to the County regarding the property including those dated June 7, July 19, August 2, September 5, September 27, October 7 and October 24, 2019 and the correspondence and pleadings in the Save Carmel Point Cultural Resources matter involving the three basement projects at Carmel Point. If you need copies of any of those documents, please let me know and I will provide them.

The Board can and should have a public review of the issues and the options. These issues have far-reaching implications for accountability, transparency, and special treatment of land use applicants represented by Mr. Lombardo.

Demand.

My clients again make a formal demand to the County to enforce all permit
conditions and mitigations that have been violated.
My clients again make a formal demand that the County determine that the conditional permit is null and void due to misrepresentation of material facts and violation of the conditions and mitigations of the permit.

My clients again make a formal demand that the County impose meaningful and
effective remedies that adequately compensate for the harms and serve as deterrent to this and similar projects.
My clients again make a formal demand that the County comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, California Planning & Zoning law, County plans and the County Code.

To the extent that the County may be considering a claim that a permit condition or mitigation is no longer necessary or unreasonably difficult to comply with, then the County must comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, and California Planning & Zoning law prior in any action to remove or modify the mitigation or condition. An agency may not delete or change a mitigation measure adopted for a significant impact in a way that reduces its effectiveness unless the agency first has prepared legally adequate subsequent or supplemental environmental review to analyze the environmental and cumulative impacts of the change.

Notice.

This is written notice to the County of Monterey and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Monterey that David Sabih intends to file an action under the California Environmental Quality Act, the California Coastal Act, the Monterey County Local Coastal Program, the Monterey County Code, the Califomnia Business and Professions Code, Califomia Planning and Zoning law, and other laws to challenge the actions of the County in 2019 to fail to act in accordance with law with regard to 26327 Scenic Road, including the violations identified on and since June 7, 2019 when the County placed stop-work notice on the property and the treatment of this property that is inconsistent with the laws, the plans and the codes.
