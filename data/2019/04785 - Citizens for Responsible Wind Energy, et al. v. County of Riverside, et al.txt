9 petition and complaint ("Petition"), allege as follows:

10 INTRODUCTION

11 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge Respondents' February 5, 2019 decision to
12 deny Petitioners' administrative appeal of the County of Riverside Planning Commission's
13 ("Planning Commission") November 28, 2018 approval of the Painted Hills Wind Repowering
14 Project ("Project"), and to uphold the Planning Commission's November 28, 2018 Project
15 approvals, including the Planning Commission's adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration
16 ("MND") prepared pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code §
17 21000 et seq.) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.) ("CEQA
18 Guidelines") (collectively, "CEQA"), approval of the Wind Energy Conversion System ("WECS")
19 Permit No. 180001, and approval of Variance Case No. 180003 for the Project.
20 2. The Project is proposed to be located on a 600-acre site in an unincorporated area of
21 Riverside County within the County's Wind Energy Resource Zone. The Project proposes to
22 | decommission and remove approximately 291 existing commercial wind turbines, which range
23 between 100-285 feet tall, and install up to 14 new commercial wind turbines of up to 499-feet in
24 height. The new turbines would be up to six times taller than the existing turbines and have a per-
25 turbine generating capacity of between 2.0 megawatts ("MW") and 4.2 MW, with a total Project
26 generating capacity of up to 58.8 MW. The Project will also install ancillary equipment, including
27 4566-001j - 2-

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

meteorological towers up to 309-feet in height, new access roads, collector circuits, and a

2 substation. The Project site is bounded by State Route ("SR-") 62, Interstate ("I-") 10, single-

3 family residential uses, and the undeveloped Painted Hills foothills.

4 3. Petitioners provided the County with substantial evidence from expert biologist

5 Renee Owens which supported a fair argument that the Project may result in significant,

6 unmitigated impacts to special-status bird and bat species by increasing the risk of fatal collisions

7 between birds, bats, and wind turbines that is potentially far greater than the current levels of

8 mortality for some species associated with the existing wind farm at the Project site. The MND

9 failed to analyze these potentially significant impacts and failed to include any mitigation measures

10 that would reduce the impacts to less than significant levels. The MND also failed to disclose
11 existing levels of avian and bat mortality from the existing wind projects on the Project site and

12 failed to include any studies or analysis estimating the potential mortality levels that are likely to be

13 caused by the Project. The County failed to prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") that

14 analyzes and mitigates the Project's potentially significant impacts to birds and bats, as required by

15 CEQA.

16 4. Petitioners also provided the County with substantial expert evidence from air

17 quality expert Phyllis Fox, Ph.D., PE, which supported a fair argument that the Project may result

18 in significant, unmitigated health impacts to construction workers and other members of the public

19 from Valley Fever. Valley Fever is an infectious disease that spreads through soil disturbance and

20 is endemic to the Project area. Dr. Fox explained that Valley Fever initially affects the lungs with

21 influenza or pneumonia-like symptoms, then can spread beyond the lungs, becoming debilitating

22 and even fatal. Dr. Fox demonstrated that fungal Valley Fever spores may be disturbed during

23 Project construction, exposing workers and sensitive receptors in the Project area to potentially

24 significant health impacts from exposure to Valley Fever.

25 5. The MND completely failed to disclose or analyze this potentially significant public

26 health impact and failed to propose any mitigation measures that would reduce this public health

27 4566-001j - 3 -

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 impact to a less than significant level. The County also failed to prepare an EIR for the project,

3 despite the existence of substantial evidence demonstrating that the Project was likely to have

4 potentially significant public health impacts from Valley Fever, as required by CEQA and the
CEQA Guidelines.

5 6.

6 The MND failed to accurately disclose and mitigate the Project's potentially

7 significant air quality and health risk impacts in several ways. The MND underestimated the

8 Project's total emissions of criteria pollutants and cancer-causing toxic air contaminants (*TAC"),

9 failed to analyze the health risks posed by the air emissions generated by the Project, and failed to

10 require any mitigation for the Project's significant cancer risk. Petitioners provided the County

11 with substantial evidence from Dr. Fox which demonstrated that the unconventional transportation

12 methods that would be required to transport the Project's massive 213-foot-long wind turbine

13 blades, including the use of multiple diesel-powered trucks to transport each blade over long

14 distances, may result in increased exposure of sensitive populations to TACs. Dr. Fox concluded

15 that this TAC exposure may lead to heightened cancer risks to those who live and work along the
Project route.

16 7.

17 Despite this substantial evidence, the County continued to rely on unsupported

18 emissions modeling in the MND that incorrectly assumed, with no supporting evidence, that

19 standard duty trucks (with a maximum length of 65 feet) would be used to haul the 213-foot long

blades.

20 8.

21 In response to Petitioners' comments that the Project would have significant health

22 impacts, the County prepared only a screening-level health risk assessment ("HRA") and, in that

23 HRA, relied on assumptions that are inconsistent with the Project description. Relying on its own

24 underestimated emissions modeling, the County's HRA nevertheless demonstrated the Project will

25 a have a cancer risk that exceeds thresholds of significance established by the Office of Health
Hazard Assessment ("OEHHA"). Despite this substantial evidence from its own study
26 demonstrating that the Project would have a significant cancer risk impact, the County failed to
27 4566-001j

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR - 4 -

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 prepare an EIR to fully analyze all sources of TAC emissions generated or caused by the Project

2 and failed to incorporate necessary mitigation to reduce the Project's significant public health
3 impacts from TAC exposure to less than significant levels, as required by CEQA.

4 9. The MND also failed to mitigate potentially significant impacts from the Project's

5 destruction of habitat for the Coachella Valley Jerusalem Cricket ("CVJC"). Both the MND and
6 | independent studies conducted by the Coachella Valley Association of Governments ("CVAG")

7 concluded that development of the Project will result in violations of habitat conservation
8 requirements for the CVJC that are required by the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat

9 Conservation Plan ("CVMSHCP"). The CVMSHCP is a comprehensive, multi-jurisdictional

10 habitat conservation plan designed to maintain and enhance biological diversity and ecosystem

11 processes within the Coachella Valley region of the County by focusing on conservation of species

12 and their associated habitats. The CVMSHCP mandates conservation of at least 419 acres of

13 CVJC habitat within the County portion of the CVMSHCP area. The Project will reduce this

14 acreage, causing the County to become out of compliance with its required cricket habitat

15 conservation. As a result a of approving the Project, CVAG, in consultation with USFWS and

16 CDFW, was forced to impose a moratorium on approving future projects that have impacts to the

17 CVJC within the Upper Mission Creek/Big Morongo Canyon Conservation Area until suitable
18 replacement habitat can be found to compensate for the CVJC habitat that will be lost to the

19 Project.

20 10. The County also failed to require effective and enforceable mitigation to reduce the

21 Project's significant impacts on CVJC habitat to less than significant levels before approving the

22 Project, in violation of CEQA. Under the CVMSHCP, the County may a seek a Transfer of
23 Conservation Objectives to a different conservation area in order to mitigate the impacts from the

24 loss of conservation habitat caused by the Project. Transfers are subject to discretionary approval

25 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") and the United States Fish and

26 Wildlife Service ("USFWS") and must therefore be requested by the jurisdiction seeking the

27 4566-001j - 5 -

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 Transfer. The MND relied on the County's ability to obtain a Transfer as mitigation for impacts to

3 the CVJC. However, the County failed to initiate a request for a Transfer with either CDFW or

4 USFWS prior to Project approval and failed to determine whether a Transfer would be authorized

5 by the wildlife agencies. Because the Transfer requires separate, discretionary approval from other

6 regulatory agencies, there is no assurance that a Transfer will ever be granted. The MND's
reliance on a Transfer as mitigation for impacts to CVJC was therefore unsupported and
7 unenforceable, because the County lacks jurisdiction to issue the Transfer. As a result, the County

8

9 failed to require effective and enforceable mitigation to reduce the Project's potentially significant

10 impacts to the CVJC to less than significant levels before adopting the MND, as required by CEQA
and the CEQA Guidelines.

11 11.

12 The County prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

13 required by law in adopting the MND and approving the Project in reliance on a legally deficient

14 MND, and by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project, in violation of CEQA.

12.

15 The County also prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a

16 manner required by law in adopting unsupported findings that the Project would have no

17 significant impacts with the mitigation measures incorporated in the MND.

13.

18 Because the manner in which the County reviewed and approved the Project

19 violated CEQA, the County's adoption of the MND and associated Project approvals must be set
aside.

4 Petitioner and Plaintiff CALIFORNIA UNIONS FOR RELIABLE ENERGY

5 ("CURE") is a coalition of labor organizations whose members construct, operate and maintain

6 power plants throughout California. CURE encourages sustainable development of California's

7 energy and natural resources. Environmental degradation destroys cultural and wildlife areas,

8 consumes limited fresh water resources, causes air and water pollution, and imposes other stresses

9 on people and the environmental carrying capacity of the State. This, in turn, jeopardizes future

10 development by causing construction moratoriums and otherwise reducing future employment

11 opportunities for CURE's organizational members. Additionally, CURE's organizational members

12 live, recreate and work in the communities and regions that suffer the impacts of projects that are

13 detrimental to human health and the environment. CURE therefore has a direct interest in

14 enforcing environmental laws to minimize the adverse impacts of projects that would otherwise
degrade the environment.

3 23. Petitioners repeatedly raised concerns during the County's administrative process

4 for the Project about the Project's potentially significant impacts on special-status birds and bats,

5 the health and safety of construction workers and the public from Valley Fever and TACs, and

6 concern about the construction moratorium due to the County's failure to mitigate impacts to the

7 CVJC. Petitioners urged the County to act in accordance with CEQA by preparing an EIR that

8 discloses, analyzes and mitigates potentially significant impacts from the Project. Petitioners bring

9 this action on their own behalf, their members and in the public interest.

13 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project, evaluates its impacts, and if
14 necessary, evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
15 environmental impacts under CEQA.

16 25. Respondent and Defendant Riverside County Board of Supervisors ("Board of
17 Supervisors") is the governing body of Respondent County. As the final decision-making body for

18 the Project pursuant to its authority to grant legislative approvals, the Board of Supervisors was

19 responsible for, inter alia, lead-agency decision making with respect to the Project under CEQA
20 and assuring that the Project complies with all other applicable provisions of federal, State and

1 37. The County has taken final agency action with respect to the subject Project

2 approvals.

3 38. The County has a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to undertaking the
4 discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.

5 39. Petitioners possess no other remedy to challenge the County's failure to proceed in

8 IRREPARABLE HARM

9 40. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
10 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
11 Project approvals. If the Real Party constructs the Project pursuant to Respondents' flawed
12 approvals, Petitioners, the environment and the general public will be irreparably harmed. No
13 money damages could adequately compensate for that harm. A temporary restraining order and
14 preliminary and permanent injunctions should issue restraining Respondents and Real Party in
15 Interest from proceeding with the Project.
16 PUBLIC BENEFIT

17 41. Petitioners also file this action in the public interest. Petitioners seek to enforce
18 important public duties and rights under CEQA. Other members of the public who will be
19 adversely affected by the impacts of the Project would find it financially, practically and/or
20 procedurally difficult to protect their rights in the complex administrative and judicial processes for
21 reviewing the County's actions and enforcing compliance with State and local laws. Thus, this
22 action involves enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest. Petitioners will
23 confer a substantial benefit to the citizens of the County of Riverside, as well as on citizens of the
24 State of California generally. Therefore, Petitioners bring this action to vindicate their own legal
25 rights and to enforce important public rights significantly affecting the public interest, as a private
26 attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and all applicable law.

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 Project Background

3 42. The Project consists of the decommissioning of two hundred, ninety-one existing

4 100- to 285-foot tall wind turbines and the construction, operation, maintenance and

5 decommissioning of fourteen 499-foot tall wind turbines on approximately 600 acres in Riverside

6 County.

7 43. Riverside County supports numerous special-status species, including golden eagles

8 and the CVJC.

9 44. Riverside County is endemic to Valley Fever.

10 45. Project components include 14 499-foot wind turbines, each with 213-foot blades,

11 as well as an electric collection system, two meteorological towers, concrete foundations, and roads

12 and fencing, among other components.

13 46. Project construction will take up to two (2) years to complete and requires soil-
14 disturbing activities, such as grading and road construction.

15 Biological Resources Impacts

16 47. Avian and Bat Collisions: The MND admits that special-status birds are present at

17 the Project site but concluded that the Project is not anticipated to result in a significant effect to

18 avian species due to Project design and its plan to remove existing turbines and replace them with

19 fewer overall turbines. The MND claimed it did not need to analyze impacts on migratory birds
20 due to recent federal reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (*MBTA") that declares that

21 incidental take of species is not covered by the MBTA. The MND did not address bats.

22 48. Petitioners provided the County with extensive and substantial evidence from expert

23 biologist Renee Owens which documented that fully protected golden eagles are at substantial risk

24 of collision with the Project's taller turbines. Ms. Owens' opinion was based on recent, substantial

25 evidence in the form of direct observations and studies demonstrating that golden eagles prefer

26 flying heights that are directly within the rotor-swept area of the Project's proposed 499-foot

27 4566-001j - 15 -

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 turbines. By contrast, Ms. Owens explained that golden eagles are not as likely to collide with the

3 existing 291 turbines at the Project site because golden eagles' flying height is higher than the

4 existing turbines. Thus, Ms. Owens concluded that the Project will create new significant impacts

5 to golden eagles by placing them at a greater risk of collision with the Project's higher turbines
than with the existing turbines.

6 49.

7 Ms. Owens also relied on substantial evidence from USFWS that was submitted on

8 a similar repowering project which demonstrated that the Project's taller turbines increased

9 collision risk for eagles. Ms. Owens explained that the studies cited by the MND to support the

10 MND's conclusions were outdated and invalid, were inapplicable because they were not designed

11 to reach conclusions about levels of mortality associated with collision with Project components,

12 and incorrectly relied on unsupported assumptions, rather than substantial evidence, to reach their
conclusions of no significant impacts. Ms. Owens's comments also provided substantial evidence
13 demonstrating that bats may be present on the Project site and are subject to increased mortality
14

15 risks from taller wind turbines. Petitioners also provided an opinion from Attorney General Xavier

16 Becerra confirming that incidental take of migratory birds is prohibited under California Fish and
Game Code § 3513.

17 50.

18 CDFW submitted comments to the County demonstrating that the Project's increase

19 in turbine height could significantly increase the risk of impacting golden eagles, and that these
impacts were not adequately addressed. CDFW commented that the MND's conclusion that the
20 Project would reduce avian impacts was not adequately addressed. CDFW explained to the County
21

22 that the Project's potentially significant impacts to bats needed to be assessed in the CEQA

23 document, yet the MND failed to include this analysis. CDFW also recommended the County

24 conduct a risk assessment to determine the change in impacts to birds and bats caused by the
Project over an identified baseline.

25 51.

26 The County provided incomplete and inaccurate responses to the comments made

27 by the Petitioners, CDFW, and other stakeholders and members of the public on the MND. The

4566-001j

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR - 16 -

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P County's responses to comments belatedly attempted to support the MND's assumption that wind

2 repowering projects reduce (rather than increase) impacts to special-status species by citing data

3 from other, unrelated repowering projects located outside the Project vicinity. These studies

4 purportedly demonstrated that, while taller turbines increase avian and bat mortality on a "per

5 turbine" basis, wind farms utilizing taller turbines nevertheless reduced mortality impacts overall

6 per megawatt of power generated. The County's responses to comments also incorrectly asserted

7 that bats would have a low likelihood to forage at the Project site, when, in fact, the responses to

8 comments acknowledged that other similar projects have impacted bats.

9 52. In response to the County's responses to comments, Petitioners submitted a recent

10 study to the County demonstrating that the repowered wind project at the Altamont Pass in

11 Northern California has demonstrated a higher avian mortality rate for certain raptors, including the

12 golden eagle, than the average mortality rates that were previously recorded at the Altamont Pass'
13 pre-repowering wind turbine project (*Altamont Study"). The Altamont Study constituted
14 substantial evidence demonstrating precisely the opposite result than the studies cited by the
15 County, namely that wind repowering projects can increase mortality impacts to certain species,

16 rather than reduce them. Petitioners' responses to the County's responses to comments also

17 explained that CEQA is concerned with changes over baseline conditions to individual species and

18 not changes in mortality per megawatt or other metrics that do not differentiate by species or
19 improperly attempt to mask impacts, as the County responses to comments did here.

20 53. The MND failed to include any surveys to determine avian or bat mortality by

21 species from the existing 291 turbines, nor studies to assess avian or bat use of the site to determine

22 whether behavior by protected species would place them at risk of collision from the new 499-foot
23 turbines. Thus, it was impossible for the County to determine that the Project would not increase

24 impacts to birds or bats because the County lacked any empirical or other evidence on which to do

25 so. Instead, the MND relied on mere assumptions unsupported by facts, rather than on substantial

26 evidence, as required by CEQA, that the Project would reduce impacts to special-status birds. The

27 - 17- 4566-001j
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 28 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P MND's unsupported assertions also contradicted substantial evidence submitted by Petitioners and
2 CDFW which demonstrated that the Project may cause significant impacts to certain species like
3 golden eagles. In particular, the MND never disclosed or analyzed potentially significant impacts

4 to bats, despite evidence from Petitioners and the CDFW that bats may be present on the site and

5 taller wind turbines increase bat mortality.

6 54. Failure to Mitigate Impacts to the Coachella Valley Jerusalem Cricket: The MND

7 disclosed that the Project would permanently disturb habitat for the CVJC. The MND explained
8 that the Project site is within the Upper Mission Creek/Big Morongo Canyon Conservation Arca of

9 the CVMSHCP, and the permanent disturbance would exceed allowable levels of habitat loss. The
10 MND claimed that, as part of the CVMSHCP process, the Project underwent Joint Project Review
11 (*JPR") with the CVAG and USFWS and CDFW to determine consistency with the CVMSHCP.
12 The MND proposed that the Project would submit later plan to provide restoration for the CVJC
13 or would require a "Transfer of Conservation Goals," pursuant to the CVMSHCP, subject to
14 approval by USFWS and CDFW.

15 55. Petitioners initially commented that the MND's proposed restoration for the CVJC
16| improperly deferred mitigation by relying on future development of a restoration plan to mitigate
17 the impacts of habitat loss for the CVJC.

18 56. Petitioners subsequently discovered the Final JPR document from CVAG and

19 provided it to the County. The JPR required the Project to provide replacement habitat for the
20 CVJC, in addition to restoration, and demonstrated that suitable replacement habitat had not been
21 identified by the County to replace the habitat that would be lost to the Project. However, the
22 County failed to determine whether the alternative - a Transfer of Conservation Objectives - could
23 be approved by USFWS and CFDW to address the Project causing permanently lost habitat. As a
24 result of the County's failure to address this significant impact, the JPR imposed a construction
25 moratorium for future projects within the Upper Mission Creek/Big Morongo Canyon
26 Conservation Area that impact the CVJC until mitigation was provided.

- 18 - 27 4566-001j
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 28 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 57. Petitioners commented that the MND's mitigation for impacts to the CVJC was

2 inadequate because it proposed to defer mitigation by relying on future actions, without sufficient

3 criteria to ensure that mitigation would actually occur. In particular, the MND failed to provide

4 any specifications about the types of habitat that would be required, and instead deferred these

5 critical determinations of site suitability to future consideration by the CVAG. Moreover, while

6 potentially feasible, the MND's unsupported reliance on a potential future Transfer of
7 Conservation Objectives for which the County had not yet applied as mitigation for lost CVJC

8 habitat did not constitute legally enforceable mitigation because the County has no authority to

9 require either USFWS or CDFW to approve a Transfer.
10 58. Finally, the MND misstated facts about the JPR process to the public and failed to

11 fulfil its obligations for requiring mitigation for potentially significant impacts to the CVJC habitat

12 prior to Project approval, compounding the MND's reliance on vague and unenforceable future
13 mitigation.

14 59. As a result of these deficiencies, the MND failed to adequately mitigate the

15 Project's potentially significant impacts on the CVJC.

16 Air Quality and Public Health Impacts

17 60. Valley Fever: The MND disclosed that Valley Fever is present in Riverside County

18 and that the Project would require dust generating activities during construction. However, the

19 MND concluded, without supporting evidence, that its proposed dust mitigation measures for

20 particulate matter would limit exposure of Valley Fever to a less than significant level.

21 61. Petitioners provided substantial evidence in the form of the expert opinion of air

22 quality expert Dr. Phyllis Fox, Ph.D., PE, who explained that: (1) Valley Fever is endemic to the

23 Project area; (2) Valley Fever is caused by inhaling Coccidioides immitis spores which are spread

24 through disturbed dust particles or soil disturbance (such as the type of excavation and grading that

25 will occur on the approximately 600-acre Project site); (3) the spores can remain aloft for long

26 periods and can be carried hundreds of kilometers; (4) Valley Fever is a disease which initially

27 4566-001j - 19 -

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P effects the lungs with influenza or pneumonia-like symptoms, but can spread beyond the lungs and
2 be fatal; and (5) construction of projects in the desert, like the Painted Hills Project, has been
3 directly linked to an increase in the incidence of Valley Fever. Dr. Fox also provided substantial

4 evidence demonstrating that the MND's proposed mitigation measures designed to reduce dust

5 exposure would not lessen exposure from Valley Fever spores because Valley Fever spores are

6 smaller than the dust particles targeted by the MND's dust-control mitigation measures.

7 62. Based on these facts, Dr. Fox concluded that the Project poses a significant risk to

8 construction workers and the public in general from potential exposure to Valley Fever that would
9 be caused by the Project. To mitigate the Project's potentially significant impacts from Valley
10 Fever, Dr. Fox recommended numerous feasible mitigation measures developed by public agencies
11 throughout California and based on scientific studies.

12 63. The County failed to recirculate the MND or prepare an EIR to disclose the

13 Project's potentially significant impacts from construction exposing the public to Valley Fever or
14 to incorporate these, or any other, feasible mitigation measures to mitigate the Project's potentially
15 significant impacts from Valley Fever exposure to less than significant level.
16 64. Toxic Air Contaminants: The MND asserted that Project construction would not
17 emit TACs above thresholds of significance established by the South Coast Air Quality
18 Management District ("SCAQMD").

19 65. Petitioners commented and provided substantial evidence from Dr. Fox which
20 demonstrated that the MND failed to include a health risk analysis that evaluated the Project's
21 increase in cancer risk that would be caused by exposure to TACs generated by the Project. Dr.
22 Fox submitted guidelines from the OEHHA, which recommended that health risk be quantified in
23 an HRA for all projects with construction projects lasting over two months, like this one.
24 Petitioners also commented that emissions of TACs, such as toxic diesel particulate matter
25 ("DPM"), were substantially underestimated in the MND. The MND relied on models that used
26 standard-size truck trips for hauling wind turbine blades, despite the substantial evidence provided
27 - 20 - 4566-001j
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 28 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F by Petitioners which demonstrated that unique, oversized equipment would be necessary to haul

2 the Project's giant 213-foot blades, that blades could not be hauled in pieces and assembled on site,

3 and that the standard trucks relied upon in the MND were at most 65-feet long, less than 1/3 the

4 size needed to haul single Project turbine blade. Dr. Fox's analysis demonstrated that the

5 uniquely oversized equipment needed for this component of the Project would result in an increase

6 of DPM over the standard trucks assumed in the MND.

7 66. The County's response to Petitioners' comments included a screening-level HRA.

8 However, the HRA relied on the same unsupported assertion in the MND, based on unsupported

9 statements from the Project Applicant, that the Project would use standard-sized trucks to haul the
10 turbine blades.

11 67. Dr. Fox reviewed and commented on the County's screening-level HRA. Dr. Fox

12 determined that the County's HRA lacked supporting documentation for the emissions parameters

13 it relied on and was inconsistent with OEHHA guidelines. Notwithstanding these flaws, Dr. Fox

14 found that the screening-level HRA nevertheless disclosed TAC emissions at levels creating a

15 cancer risk of 2.09 in one million, more than double OEHHA's significance threshold of one in one

16 million for cancer.

17. 68. The County failed to recirculate the MND or prepare an EIR to disclose the levels of

18 TACs emitted by the Project. The MND therefore failed to include an accurate and meaningful

19 health risk analysis that fully informed the public and decision-makers about the potentially
20 significant health risks posed by the Project and failed to provide feasible mitigation measures to

21 address the Project's admittedly significant TAC emissions.

22 Procedural Background

23 69. On October 24, 2018, the County circulated the MND for public comment. The

24 MND concluded that all Project impacts were identified in the MND and were mitigated to a less

25 than significant level.

26

- 21 - 27 4566-001j
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 28 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F 70. Prior to the Planning Commission hearing, Petitioners submitted two written

2 comment letters (including, as attachments, expert comments, reports, studies and other supporting
3 evidence) which provided substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project may

4 result in potentially significant impacts. Other written comments were submitted by the

5 Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Sierra Club. The Center for Biological

6 Diversity did not file written comments but did provide oral testimony raising issues about the
7 Project at the Planning Commission hearing.

8 71. Sometime prior to the public release of the MND, the Project began the JPR process

9 with CVAG to determine consistency with the CVMSHCP. CVAG provided the USFWS and

10 CDFW with a deadline of November 30, 2018 to provide comments as to whether the Project was
11 consistent with the CVMSHCP.

12 72. Despite substantial evidence in the record of unanalyzed and unmitigated potentially
13 significant impacts and the unfinished JPR process, on November 28, 2018, the Planning
14 Commission adopted a resolution to approve the Project entitlements and adopted the MND which
15 claimed the JPR process was complete.

16 73. The County provided responses to the Petitioners' initial comments on November
17 28 and November 30, 2018.

18 74. USFWS and CDFW provided comments on the JPR process on November 30 and
19 December 3, 2018, respectively.
20 75. On December 14, 2018, Petitioners filed a timely appeal of the Planning
21 Commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors, along with additional comments responding to
22 the County's initial responses to comments on the MND.

23 76. The JPR was finalized by the CVAG on December 17, 2018.
24 77. On January 31, 2019, the County provided Petitioners with the staff report on the
25 appeal. The staff report included written responses to comments made by Petitioners, CDFW,

26

27 - 22 - 4566-001j
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR 28 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 USFWS, and joint comment by the Sierra Club and Center for Biological Diversity. The

2 County's responses to comments were dated between January 15 and January 17, 2019.

3 78. On February 5, 2019, Petitioners filed comments responding to the County's

4 responses.

5 79. The Board of Supervisors held a hearing on February 5, 2019 to consider

6 Petitioners' appeal of the Planning Commission's approval of Project entitlements and adoption of

7 the MND. At the hearing, County staff contended, without evidentiary support, that the Project

8 will not cause a significant impact to the environment.

9 80. Despite the overwhelming evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the

10 Project may lead to potentially significant impacts on special-status birds and bats and potentially

11 significant public health impacts from Valley Fever and TACs, and that the MND fails to properly

12 mitigate for significant impacts to the CVJC, the County refused to prepare an EIR that recognizes,
13 analyzes and mitigates these impacts.

14 81. Instead, on February 5, 2019, the Board of Supervisors denied the Petitioner's
15 appeal, adopted the MND, and approved the Project entitlements.

16 Legal Background

17 82. A lead agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record
18 supports a fair argument that a proposed project may have a significant impact, even if the record

19 contains substantial evidence to the contrary. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d
20 68, 75. Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts and expert

21 opinion supported by facts. CEQA Guidelines | 15064(f)(5).

22 83. "[TJhe sufficiency of the evidence to support a fair argument" is a question of law.

23 Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1318. "Under this standard,
24 deference to the agency's determination is not appropriate and its decision not to require an EIR

25 can be upheld only when there is no credible evidence to the contrary." Id. (emphasis added).

26 "Whether a description of an environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits

27 4566-001j - 23 -

28 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

F the magnitude of the impact is not a substantial evidence question." Sierra Club v. City of Fresno

2 (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 521. Under this standard, a CEQA document can be held to be inadequate as

3 a matter of law without reference to substantial evidence, even where mixed questions of law and

4 fact are involved. Id.

5 84. CEQA requires lead agencies to describe and analyze impacts from the whole

6 project which is being approved, including all components and future activities that are reasonably

7 anticipated to become part of the project. CEQA Guidelines § 15378. This includes, but is not

8 limited to, "later phases of the project, and secondary, support, or off-site features necessary for its

9 implementation." Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Comm. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.
10 85. CEQA requires lead agencies to provide an accurate project description. An
11 accurate project description is necessary to determine the scope of environmental review

12 and allow "affected outsiders and public decision-makers [to] balance the proposal's benefit
13 against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of
14  terminating the proposal, and weigh other alternatives." County of Inyo v. City of Los
15 Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.3d 185, 192, 199.

16 86. CEQA imposes an affirmative obligation on agencies to avoid or reduce
17 environmental harm by adopting feasible project alternatives or mitigation measures. If

18 substantial evidence shows project may result in significant impacts, the lead agency must

19 then propose and evaluate mitigation measures and alternatives sufficient to minimize these
20 impacts. Pub. Resources Code §§ 21002.1(a), 21100(b)(3). The lead agency may not defer
21 the formulation of mitigation measures to future time. Mitigation measures must be
22 specific and enforceable. Pub. Resources Code § 21081.6; CEQA Guidelines
23 co 15126.4(a)(2).

24 87. CEQA does not normally allow for formulation of mitigation measures to be
25 deferred to the future without specifying performance standards for mitigating the

26 significant impact. CEQA Guidelines 15126.4(a)(1)(B).

14 all public agencies in California, Respondents were at all times under a clear and present

15 mandatory duty to comply with all requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

18 in the record by certifying : legally deficient MND for the Project that failed to comply with

2 b. Failing to support the MND's findings of no significant impacts with substantial

u C. evidence with regard to air quality, public health, and biological resources; and

4 Failing to incorporate all feasible mitigations measures, improperly deferring

5 mitigation, and relying on vague and unenforceable future permit approvals by other

6 agencies to reduce the Project's potentially significant impacts to biological

7 92. resources to less than significant levels.

8 Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by

9 law, and without the support of substantial evidence in the record, by committing the following
violations:

10

11 Adopting the MND Despite Substantial Evidence in the Record Supporting a Fair Argument

12 that the Project May Result in Significant Impacts to Special-Status Birds and Bats
93.

13 The MND lacked an adequate analysis of baseline conditions for biological

14 resources on the Project site and failed to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on special-status

15 birds by dismissing the possibility, without supporting substantial evidence, that the Project may
lead to potentially significant impacts on these species.

16 94.

17 During the County's administrative review process for the Project, Petitioners

18 provided the County with Ms. Owens' comments, with evidence from federal, State and local

19 agencies demonstrating that the Project may have significant avian and bat impacts, and with

20 scientific studies supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant impacts to

21 special-status birds and bats. CDFW's comments also provided substantial evidence demonstrating

22 that the Project may result in significant impacts to special-status birds and bats. Petitioners urged

23 the County to prepare an EIR that discloses, analyzes and mitigates the Project's potentially
significant impacts to special-status birds.

24 95.

25 Despite substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project

26 may result in significant impacts to special-status birds and bats, the County failed to prepare an
EIR, and instead adopted the legally inadequate MND.

96. The County prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in a manner

2 required by law and making findings that were contrary to, and unsupported by, substantial

3 evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant impacts

4 to special-status birds and bats.

5 Adopting the MND Despite Substantial Evidence in the Record Supporting a Fair

6 Argument that the Project May Result in Significant
Public Health Impacts from Valley Fever
7

8 97. The MND lacks an adequate discussion of Valley Fever and dismisses the threat of

9 exposure without supporting evidence, analysis, or adequate mitigation.

10 98. During the County's administrative review process for the Project, Petitioners

11 provided the County with Dr. Fox's comments, evidence from federal, State and local agencies,

12 and scientific and medical studies, all of which supported a fair argument that the Project may

13 result in significant public health impacts from Valley Fever. Petitioners urged the County to

14 prepare an EIR that discloses, analyzes and mitigates the Project's potentially significant public

15 health impacts from Valley Fever. Petitioners also provided the County with an extensive list of

16 feasible mitigation measures to mitigate the Project's potentially significant public health impacts

17 from Valley a Fever to a less than significant level.

18 99. Despite this substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair argument that the

19 Project may result in significant public health impacts from Valley Fever, the County failed to

20 circulate an EIR to fully analyze these impacts and failed to adopt feasible mitigation for the

21 Project's potentially significant impacts in the MND.

22 100. The County prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

23 required by law when it adopted the MND by making a decision contrary to, and unsupported by,

24 substantial evidence. The County also ignored substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair

25 argument that the Project may result in significant public health impacts from Valley Fever.

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Adopting the MND Despite Substantial Evidence in the Record Supporting a Fair Argument that the Project May Result in Significant Public Health Impacts from TACs and Failing to
2 Disclose All Sources of TACs

3 101. The MND failed to include meaningful health risk analysis which disclosed and

4 analyzed the significant cancer risk from TACs that would be emitted during Project operation.

5 The MND also failed to disclose and analyze the emissions from oversized and unique equipment

6 needed to transport the Project's wind turbine blades.

7 102. During the County's administrative review process for the Project, Petitioners

8 provided the County with Dr. Fox's comments, evidence from federal, State and local agencies,

9 and scientific and medical studies which constituted substantial evidence supporting a fair

10 argument that the Project may result in significant public health impacts from human exposure to

11 TACs and that unique TAC-emitting equipment would be needed to transport wind turbines to the

12 Project site.

13 103. Petitioners urged the County to prepare an EIR that disclosed, analyzed and

14 mitigated the Project's potentially significant public health impacts from TACs, and to prepare a

15 health risk analysis that made a reasonable effort to substantively connect the Project's air quality

16 emissions to the health consequences caused by those emissions. Petitioners also informed the

17 County that even its own incomplete screening-level HRA provided further substantial evidence

18 demonstrating that the Project's would have significant public health impacts from TACs.

19 104. Despite this substantial evidence in the record supporting : fair argument that the

20 Project may result in significant public health impacts from TACs, the County failed to prepare an

21 EIR or health risk assessment, and instead adopted the MND.

22 105. The County prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

23 required by law by making findings that were contrary to, and unsupported by, substantial evidence

24 in the record supporting a fair argument that the Project may result in significant public health

25 impacts from TACs when it adopted the MND.

1 Adopting the MND Without Requiring Adequate Mitigation for Impacts to the
Coachella Valley Jerusalem Cricket
2

3 106. Both the MND and JPR identified significant impacts to the CVJC through loss of

4 habitat. The MND purported to require conservation of habitat as mitigation. However, no habitat

5 was found to be available within the same conservation area. While the County could potentially

6 seek a Transfer of Conservation Objectives to find suitable habitat within another conservation

7 area, the requirement to seek a Transfer is not effective or enforceable mitigation because it would

8 require future discretionary approval by USFWS and CDFW that the County lacks jurisdiction to

9 enforce.

10 107. During the County's administrative review process for the Project, Petitioners

11 submitted comments to the County explaining that the MND improperly deferred mitigation.

12 Petitioners also explained that the MND failed to provide adequate mitigation for the loss of CVJC

13 habitat, since the MND acknowledged that finding additional habitat may not be possible, and

14 because the Project resulted in the imposition of a potentially indefinite construction moratorium

15 due to the loss of habitat resulting from the Project.

16 108. Petitioners urged the County to prepare an EIR that included mitigation for the loss

17 of habitat for the CVJC. Petitioners also commented that alternative habitat options through a

18 Transfer of Conservation Objectives would be unenforceable as it was subject to discretionary

19 actions by other agencies.

20 109. The County abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law by

21 failing to require legally adequate mitigation for the Project's significant impacts on biological

22 resources.
