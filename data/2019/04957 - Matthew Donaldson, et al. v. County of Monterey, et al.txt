PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
Matthew Donaldson, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al./Case No.

P

2 1. INTRODUCTION

3 This action challenges the decision of the COUNTY OF MONTEREY and the

4 MONTEREY COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ("Board") (collectively the "County" or

5 "Respondents") to approve Resolution No. 19-285 granting a Combined Development Permit

6 (PLN160851) for coastal development permits, design approval, and general development plan,

7 to establish a commercial construction business operation at 46821 Highway 1, including the

8 construction of an office, workshop, storage area, parking, and associated improvements,

9 development on slopes in excess of 30% slope, tree removal, and the conversion of a test well to a

10
NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOSS permanent well, within an environmentally sensitive habitat area and Visitor Serving Commercial

11 zoning area of the Big Sur (the "Project").

2.

ATTORNEYS AT LAW 12 Specifically, the Donaldsons allege that the County's actions in approving the

SALINas 13 Project violate the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code sec. 21000 et.

14 seq.) ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14 sec. 15000

15 et. seq.) by adopting a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project, rather than requiring the

16 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report, when the County was presented with a fair

17 argument that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment, and there was

18 substantial evidence, in light of in the record as whole, that the Project may have a significant
effect on the environment.

19 3.

20 The Project proposes a commercial construction company facility/corporation

21 yard, on a steep, redwood forested, 2.55 acre, site, located at 46821, Big Sur, adjacent to Highway

22 and Apple Pie Ridge Road, (across from, and next to, the River Inn), including a 760 square

23 foot office building, 798 square foot storage building, 600 square foot workshop with 300 square

24 foot canopy, the storage of construction equipment such as generators and above ground diesel

25 tanks, along with both employee parking and construction vehicle/equipment parking along

26 Highway 1. The Project requires the removal of 10 trees, as well as construction on slopes in

27 excess of 30% slope, grading, and conversion of a test well to a permanent well. The Project site

28 is zoned for visitor serving uses (Visitor Serving Commercial) which does not allow a
construction company/contractor yard.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
Matthew Donaldson, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al./Case No.

4.

2 Despite the glaring environmental impacts to the environmentally sensitive habitat

3 in which the Project is located, visual impacts to scenic Highway 1, the inconsistent commercial

4 contractor/construction yard use in the visitor serving zoning land use designation, and other

5 impacts, the Board, on a split (3-2) vote, voted to adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration and
approve the Project.

6 5.

7 In approving the Project, the County, as the responsible agency, prejudicially

8 abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA by failing to require the

9 preparation of a full Environmental Impact Report as required by CEQA, thereby depriving the

10 public and other agencies with opportunity to fully explore alternatives and mitigations that could
have addressed the Project's significant environmental impacts.

11 6.

TTORNEYS AT LAW NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOsS •8 12 The Donaldsons seek a writ of mandate vacating and setting aside the Project

YNITVS 13 approval on the grounds that the County violated CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion

14 when it adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approved the Project.

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 2

3 20. Petitioners have exhausted applicable administrative remedies with respect to the

4 County's CEQA determination.

5 21. Petitioners are appealing the County Project approval to the California Coastal

6 Commission ("Commission") claiming the Project is inconsistent with the Coastal Act.

7 22. However, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167(b), Petitioners must

8 file their CEQA challenge to the County's CEQA decision to adopt a Mitigated Negative

9 Declaration for the Project within 30 days of the County filing the CEQA Notice of

10 Determination (NOD), which NOD was filed and posted with the County Clerk on September 19,
SSOH y 3NN3LL 'AT3NVH NOLAND, 11 2019. Accordingly, the CEQA 30-day statutory filing period in which to challenge the County's
12 CEQA determination will run on October 19, 2019, before the Coastal Commission makes a MYTIY SA3NJOLY SVNITYS 13 determination as to whether it will take jurisdiction over the Project, hence Petitioners are

STANDING 1

2 26. Petitioners appeared before the County and raised objections to the Project

3 approval, including the grounds of non-compliance with CEQA.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND 4

5 27. The Project proposes the construction of a commercial construction company

6 facility/corporation yard, on a steep, redwood forested, 2.55 acre, site, located at 46821, Big Sur,

7 adjacent to Highway 1 and Apple Pie Ridge Road, (across from, and next to, the River Inn). The

8 Project involves the construction of a 760 square foot office building, 798 square foot storage

9 building, 600 square foot workshop with 300 square foot canopy, the storage of construction

10 equipment such as generators and above ground diesel tanks, along with both employee parking
HOSS 11 and construction vehicle/equipment parking along Highway 1. The Project requires the removal g
12 MY7 LV SAINJOLLY ENN3IE HAMERLY, NOLAND, of 10 trees, as well as, construction on slopes in excess of 30% slope, grading, and conversion of
YNITYS 13 a test well to a permanent well. The Project site is zoned for visitor serving uses (Visitor Serving

14 Commercial or "VSC" zoning district) which does not allow for a construction

15 company/contractor yard.

16 28. On or about August 31, 2018, the County issued a Notice of Intent to Adopt a

17 Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project. At that time the Project included permits for a

18 General Development Plan for the commercial construction business, a 760 square foot office,

19 600 square foot workshop, 800 square foot storage unit, storage of equipment, such as generators,

20 a cement silo, diesel storage tanks, a septic system, development on slopes in excess of 30%

21 slope, removal of 26 protected trees, and the conversion of a test well into a permanent well.

22 29. On October 1, 2018, the California Coastal Commission staff wrote a letter to the

23 County stating the Project was inconsistent with the Visitor-Serving Commercial (VSC) land use

24 designation and zoning, stating, "Contractor yards and storage facilities are not authorized as

25 either a principally permitted or conditional use in the VSC zone." And further stating, "The

supported 26 project further involves development within the critical viewshed, which also cannot be

27 under the LUP."

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
Matthew Donaldson, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al./Case No.

1 30.

2 On November 14, 2018, the Project was set for hearing before the Monterey

3 County Planning Commission. Given that Blaze Engineering had become a fixture in Big Sur, at

4 a prior location, the community came out en-mass in support of the Project, with letters of

5 support, from many residents and influential people, including Congressman Sam Farr.

31.

6 Petitioners, along with other residents, wrote letters in opposition and appeared at

7 the Planning Commission hearing objecting to the Project on many grounds, including the

8 inadequate CEQA analysis, inconsistency with the surrounding residential uses, inconsistency

9 with the Visitor Serving Commercial zoning district, tree removal, impacts to the lush and

10 forested hillside, visual impacts, grading impacts, noise from air compressors, pneumatic tools,

NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOSS 11 welders, grinders, gasoline and diesel engines, toxic fuels and fluids associated with them, noise
from large trucks and heavy equipment operations and maintenance, air quality and dust, and

IVTLY SA3NSOLI 12 traffic on Apple Pie Ridge Road and Highway 1.
SALINAS 13 32.

14 Despite these valid objections, in an apparent effort to appease the community, the

15 Planning Commission approved the Project creating "out of the box" findings to allow a private

16 construction company, not otherwise permitted in the Visitor Serving Commercial zoning district,
to be permitted as a public quasi-public use.

17 33.

18 The Planning Commission findings minimized inconsistency with the Land Use

19 Plan, the impact to onsite environmentally sensitive habitat, tree removal, the visual impact to

20 scenic Highway of having large construction trucks and equipment parked in an area clearly
visible from the Highway, among other impacts.

21 34.

22 On November 30, 2018, Petitioners, and another neighbor, appealed the Planning

23 Commission decision to the Board of Supervisors claiming, among other allegations, that:
(a)

24 apply to the site. The Project was not consistent with the applicable plans and policies which

25 (b) The Project was not suitable for the site.

26 (i)

27 The Project would split by the existing Apple Pie Ridge road
causing residents to have to drive through a commercial corporation yard and attendant

28 equipment and structures.
22560\000\1035939.1:101719

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
Matthew Donaldson, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al./Case No.

(ii) Development was proposed to occur on slopes of 30% and over. 1

(iii) Construction vehicle parking at the base of Apple Pie Ridge would 2

3 eliminate existing visitor serving parking, as well as be unsightly.

4 (c) The Project would have a visual impact on the scenic Highway and

5 adjacent properties. Among other visual impacts,

6 (d) The Project would have a significant impact on environmentally sensitive

7 habitat areas.

The Project required the removal of 16 protected trees, including 8 (i)

9 trees as large as 35", 48" and 60" in diameter.
(ii) The tree removal areas on the applicant's submitted materials were 10

11 inconsistent. The location of the trees to be removed on the site was not well marked and difficult

12 to assess which trees are actually being removed. MYT LY SAINJOLLY SSOH 3 INNIUT'A8IKVH 'ONVION (iii) The Project Applicant had already engaged in unpermitted grading YNITYS 13

14 on the site, including roads and pads, causing damage to the site, and compromising the lateral

15 support of the adjacent Donaldson property.

16 (e) The Project did not conform to the Big Sur LUP or Coastal Implementation

17 Plan.

18 (f) The Project violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
(i) An Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was required for the 19

20 Project, as there was substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the County, that the

21 project may have a significant effect on the environment(CEQA Guideline 15064 (a)(1)).
The Project was in rural area, where an activity that might not be 22 (ii)

23 significant in an urban area, may be significant in a rural area (CEQA Guideline 15064 (b)).
Further, in evaluating significance of the environmental effect of a 24 (iii)

25 project, the County must consider direct physical changes which will be caused by the Project,
26 including such physical impacts as dust, noise, heavy equipment traffic, etc. (CEQA Guideline

27 15064 (d)).

1 (iv) The above CEQA Guidelines heightened the CEQA review for the

2 Project located in rural, visitor serving commercial area of Big Sur, where this type of
3 construction yard commercial construction business is not permitted.

4 (v) The evidence presented to the County showed that, contrary to the
5 Initial Study, the Project would create potentially significant environmental impacts to:

6 Land Use and Planning - the project conflicts with the polices of the Big
7 Sur Land Use Plan, Big Sur Coastal Implementation Plan, the County Visitor Serving Commercial Zoning, as well as other land use policies and
8 regulations, as set forth here.

Aesthetics the project will be visible from Highway 1, a protected critical viewshed, including the 35 ft. high silo, the new private driveway being 10 created to access the property off Highway, the storing of large
11 construction trucks and equipment, along with the stockpiling of sand, gravel and other construction materials, the on the lower portion of the
MVT LY SA3NSOLLY NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOSS 12 property, as set forth herein
VNITYS 13 Noise - The commercial work shop, with its' attendant commercial workshop noise, will be located just 60 feet from the existing Donaldson's 14 residence. Large constructions trucks and equipment operating on and
15 entering and exiting the property will create unmitigated commercial traffic noise, as set forth herein.
16 Geology and Soils - The project involves the development on slopes of 17 30% or greater, in violation of County's land use and development policies for Big Sur (Coastal Implementation Plan Policy 20.145.140.A.4 et. seq.) 18

19 Transportation/Traffic - The project involves the creation of a new private road in the critical viewshed to access the property from Highway
20 1, in violation of County's viewshed and transportation policies for Big Sur (Coastal Implementation Plan Policies 20.145.030. A.2.e & 21 20.145.130.D.1 et. seq.). The project will use an existing road serving 23
22 residential homes, as well as, share a driveway entrance with another
residence, increasing the driving and pedestrian hazards and created
23 significant safety risks.

24 Biological Resources - The project involves the removal of eight (8) landmark trees over 24 inches in diameter, and as large as 60 inches in 25 diameter, in violation of County's forest resources polices for Big Sur. The
26 project approval does not provide for a scenic easement on the areas containing environmentally sensitive habitat, in violation of County's
27 environmentally sensitive habitat polices for Big Sur.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS
Matthew Donaldson, et al. v. County of Monterey, et al./Case No.

Hazards and Hazardous Materials - The project is in the middle of a
2 residential neighborhood. The project involves the storage of diesel, propane, and other hazardous materials, as well as, the transportation of
3 said materials. The project will use an existing road serving 23 residential homes, as well as, share a driveway entrance with another residence, 4 increasing the driving and pedestrian hazards and created significant safety risks. 5

6 35, The Project was then set for hearing before the Monterey County Board of
7 Supervisors on February 26, 2019.

8 36. At that hearing, after taking testimony from Petitioners, and others, the Board

9 deferred its difficult decision on the Project, asking Petitioners and the Project Applicant to
10 attempt to mediate a resolution.
NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOSS 8 11 37. Petitioners and the Project Applicant were unable to reach a resolution, as the
MVT LY SAUNJOUY 12 Project's potential damage and impacts to the environment, the neighborhood, and the public in
VNITYS 13 general, were simply too great to acquiesce in the Project going forward.

14 38. On April 16, 2019, the Ventana Chapter of the Sierra Club sent a letter to the

15 Board urging the Board to grant the Donaldson's appeal and deny the Project.

16 39. On May 8, 2019, Petitioners provided the County with additional expert evidence
17 of potential significant impacts to the Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Area (ESHA) on the
18 site, in the form of an arborist report from Rob Thompson of Thompson Wildland Management,
19 which report reiterated lack of an adequate environmental impact analyses and the potential

20 significant environmental damage that would occur to the environmentally sensitive redwood

21 forest habitat as a result of the Project.

22 40. Mr. Thompson's report states. "In summary, the proposed construction and

23 development project involves significant environmental impacts to large and majestic redwood
24 trees and environmentally sensitive redwood habitat from proposed grading and construction

25 associate with road improvements and the construction of a new office building, workshop,
26 storage unit, cement silo and other supporting infrastructure. Additionally, there will be

27 significant environmental concerns from the long-term impacts to trees and habitat from frequent

1 and regular daily traffic of heavy trucks and equipment through this sensitive redwood habitat

2 area. These impacts to the critical root zone of nearby redwood trees and ESHA habitat, as well

3 as concerns associate with storm water runoff, erosion & sedimentation control, hazardous

4 materials, containment & disposal, and wildland fire safety have not been adequately addressed

5 and evaluated."

6 41. Mr. Thompson's Tree and Resource Impact Assessment report and expert opinion
7 provided further substantial evidence that significant environmental impacts to the redwood forest

8 and environmentally sensitive habitat would occur with this Project, which potential significant

9 impacts had not been addressed or mitigated.

10 42. There was also substantial evidence in the record of a host of other Project plan
SSOH  INNIug 'ATHANVH 'ONVION 11 deficiencies, inconsistencies, and missing information, set forth in materials presented by

MVT LY SA3NHOLLY 12 Petitioners, which also invalidated the County's initial CEQA review.

13 43. The Project was heard again by the Board on May 21, 2019. At the hearing,

14 Petitioners again reiterated that the Initial Study/ Mitigated Negative Declaration prepared for the

15 Project was based on incomplete and inaccurate information and the CEQA analysis was

16 inadequate. Petitioners again objected to the Project approval and use of a Mitigated Negative

17 Declaration based on the substantial evidence in the record, stating an Environmental Impact

18 Report was required for this Project.

19 44. At the Board hearing, the Project Applicant stated they were amenable to making

20 some modifications to the Project, including removing the 35 foot tall cement silo, the second

21 access road, as well as swapping the location of the shop and storage area. The Board hearing
22 was then continued to a date uncertain pending the receipt of Project Applicant's revised plans for

23 the Project.

24 45. On or about June 2019 the Project Applicant submitted revised plans for the

25 Project that eliminated the 35 foot tall cement silo and second access road, and swapped the

26 storage building and shop building locations, but left unresolved the significant environmental

27 impacts to the ESHA arising from the Project and its ongoing operations, the land use

28 incompatibility with the Visitor Serving Commercial zoning district, the visual impacts to scenic

P Highway 1 as a result of parking large construction equipment and large construction trucks along
2 the Highway, as well as the land use incompatibility and environmental damage caused by

3 placing a construction company/contractor yard, with its associated buildings, large construction

4 trucks and large equipment, diesel tanks, and associated noise, dust, and visual impacts, along the

5 narrow steep dirt Apple Pie Ridge Road, serving 23 residences in the rustic redwood forested

6 hills of Big Sur.

7 46. The Project was then sent for further hearing before the Board on August 27, 2019.

8 47. On August 20, 2019 and August 22, 2019 Petitioners sent letters to the County

9 pointing out that, despite Project revisions, the overarching issues with incompatible use,

10 significant environmental impacts, visual impacts to scenic Highway 1, and inconsistency with
NOLAND, HAMERLY, ETIENNE & HOSS 11 the Coastal Act remained.

12 48. On August 22, 2019, the Sierra Club also sent another letter urging the County to
ATTORNEYS SYNNIYS 13 deny the Project.

14 49. Following testimony at the August 27, 2019 hearing, the Board, with stated

15 reservations and a narrow 3-2 vote, voted to adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration and

16 approve the Project, with no further CEQA review.

17 50. The County filed and posted the CEQA Notice of Determination on September 19,

18 2019.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Administrative Mandate - Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5)

21 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq)

22 51. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation

23 contained in Paragraphs through 50 inclusive, as set forth above.

24 52. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, a public agency must conduct

25 environmental review whenever it undertakes to approve a project that may cause either a direct

26 physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

27 environment, such as the Project reviewed and approved in this case, which has the potential to

28 directly impact, and reasonably foreseeably impact, environmental resources and aesthetics,

5 that the project may have significant effect on the environment, the agency shall prepare a draft

6 EIR". (CEQA Guideline 15064(a)(1), emphasis added). In this case, the County was presented

7 with substantial evidence, and a fair argument made, that the Project may have a significant effect
on the environment.

8 54.

9 If it is unclear whether there is substantial evidence in the record that a project may

*

TORNEYS AT LAW NOLAND, IAMERLY, 3NNELL3 : HOSS a have a significant effect on the environment, then, "If there is disagreement among expert opinion

11 supported by facts over the significance of an effect on the environment, the Lead Agency shall

12

SYNNYS treat the effect as significant and shall prepare an EIR". (CEQA Guideline 15064(g)(1), emphasis

13 added). In this case there is a disagreement among experts as to the potential significant impacts

14 to the Environmentally Sensitive Habitat.

55.

15 The Project is in rural area, where an activity that might not be significant in an

16 urban area, but may be significant in a rural area (CEQA Guideline 15064 (b)). In this case the

17 Project is located in scenic Big Sur, on a redwood forested parcel and along scenic Highway 1 in

18 one of the County's most treasured rural expanses.

56.

19 Further, in evaluating the significance of the environmental effect of a project, the

20 County must consider direct physical changes which will be caused by the Project, including such

21 physical impacts as dust, noise, heavy equipment traffic, etc. (CEQA Guideline 15064 (d)). This

22 Project involves a construction company with large construction trucks and equipment, on a

23 narrow dirt road, as well as the storage of generators, above-ground diesel tanks, all of which will

24 create noise, dust and heavy equipment traffic.

57.

25 The above CEQA code sections and guidelines, heighten the CEQA review

26 required for this Project proposed in an environmentally sensitive, visually sensitive, and

27 incompatible land use in the rural, visitor serving commercial area of Big Sur, where this type of

28 construction yard/commercial business is not permitted.

58. The evidence presented to the County showed that, contrary to the Initial Study,
2 the Project would create potentially significant environmental impacts, requiring the preparation

3 of an Environmental Impact Report.

4 59. The County abused its discretion when it failed to adequately evaluate the

5 environmental impacts of the Project , as required by CEQA, and improperly determined the

6 Project could be approved with Mitigated Negative Declaration.

7 60. The County's actions in approving the Project violate the California

8 Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code sec. 21000 et. seq.) ("CEQA") and the
CEQA Guidelines (California Code of Regulations, Title 14 sec. 15000 et. seq.) by adopting a

an 9

10 Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project, rather than requiring the preparation of
SSOH y INN3I13 AT83NYH 'ONYION 11 Environmental Impact Report, when the County was presented with a fair argument that the
12 Project may have a significant effect on the environment, and there was substantial evidence, in MYT LY SARNIOLLY SVNITVS 13 light of in the record as a whole, that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment.

14 61. In approving the Project, the County, as the responsible agency, prejudicially
15 abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA by failing to require the

16 preparation of a full Environmental Impact Report as required by CEQA, thereby depriving the
17 public and other agencies with opportunity to fully explore alternatives and mitigations that could
18 have addressed the Project's significant environmental impacts.
