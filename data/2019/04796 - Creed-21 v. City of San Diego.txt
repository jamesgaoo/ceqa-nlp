12 Plaintiff and Petitioner, VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND
13 VS. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER THE CALIFORNIA 14 CITY OF SAN DIEGO; and DOES 1 through 100, ) ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AND OTHER LAWS
15 Defendants and Respondents.
16 DOES 101 through 1,000,
17 Defendants and Real Parties in Interest.

18

19 Plaintiff and Petitioner CREED-21 ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

20 Parties

21 1. Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State
22 of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in, or near, the City of San Diego,

23 California, and has an interest in, among other things, ensuring compliance with environmental laws
24 and protecting the City's quality of life.

25 2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO ("CITY") is a "public agency" under
26 Section 21063 of the Public Resources Code and "local government" under Section 30109 of the

27 Public Resources Code: As a "public agency," CITY is required to comply with California
28 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.

3. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents/Real Parties in Interest
2 identified as DOES 1 through 1,000 are unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission
3 to amend this pleading in order to allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.
4 Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of the fictitiously named DOES

5 through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the proposed project that is the
6 subject of this proceeding and DOES 101 through 1,000 has some other cognizable interest in the
7 subject matter of this lawsuit.

8 Background Information

4. On or about March 19, 2019, CITY approved its so-called Parking Requirement
10 Regulatory Reform for Multifamily Residential Development in Transit Priority Areas, as reflected in
11 Ordinance no. 0-21057 and Resolution nos. R-312234 and 312235 (collectively, the "Project"). In

12 general terms, the Project eliminates minimum parking-space requirements for multifamily housing
13 projects.
14 5. CITY concluded that the Project is exempt from environmental review under CEQA.
15 Petitioner opposes the Project based on CITY's failure to subject the Project to CBQA.
16 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations
17 6. This proceeding is being commenced not more than 35 days after the notice described
18 in Public Resources Code Section 21167(d) was filed with the county clerk (if such a notice was filed).

19 7. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on

20 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct
21: copy of the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

22 8. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General
23 not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
24 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

25 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

26 9. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
27 Sections 21168 and/or 21 168.5, as applicable, and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 1060 et seq.,

28 and 1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIRP ETC. Page 2 :

10. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Alternatively
2 and additionally, neither Public Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion-of-

3 remedies requirement may be applied to Petitioner.
11. Defendants/Respondents' conduct in approving the Project without complying with
5 CEQA and other applicable laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this
pleading, they failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
12. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since

8 its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
9 Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other applicable laws. Defendants/Respondents'
10 approval of the Project also rests on their failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in
11 accordance with the applicable laws. Even when Defendants/Respondents are permitted or required
12 by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects under those laws, they remain under a clear,

13 present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with
14 those laws. Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve
15 the Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but
16 Defendants/Respondents have failed and refused to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond
17 the limits of and in a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

18 13. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants/Respondents' fulfillment of

19 all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.
20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

21 Illegal Approval of Project (Against All Defendants/Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)
22 14. Paragraphs 1 through 13 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
23 15. The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
24 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):
25 A. The Project violates CEQA. In particular:

26 i. CEQA applies to every discretionary project proposed to be carried out
27 or approved by a public agency, unless the project is exempt from CEQA. Generally speaking, the
28 public agency must review the potentially significant environmental impacts of every discretionary

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF ETC. Page 3

project subject to CEQA review that the agency proposes to carry out or approve. Such review involves
2 determining whether the proposal is exempt, should be the subject of a negative declaration, or should
3 be the subject of an environmental impact report.

4 ii. The use of a CEQA exemption is inappropriate when a project may have
significant environmental impacts or when there are potentially significant environmental impacts due

6 to unusual circumstances.

7 ili. The Project constitutes : "project" under CEQA because its approval
8 involved the exercise of discretion and has the potential to cause significant direct, indirect, or

9 cumulative adverse impacts (if not all such impacts) on the environment, including but not limited to

10 conflicts in Defendants/Respondents' land-use and zoning regulations.

11 iv. These significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts on the
12 environment give rise to Defendants/Respondents' legal obligation to subject the Project to CEQA•
13 review.

14 V. Defendants/Respondents' refusal to apply CEQA to the Project and
15 subject it to environmental review constitutes a violation of CEQA.

16 vi. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violation of CEQA, Petitioner
17 has been harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public, and the responsible
18 decision-makers were not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the
19 Project, and insofar as Petitioner, its members, and other members of the public did not have an
20 opportunity to participate meaningfully in the analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.

21 16. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Defendants/Respondents over the
22 Project's legal force and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because
:23 it violates CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws. Defendants/Respondents dispute
24 Petitioner's contention. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's legal force
25 and effect (if any).
26 Prayer

27 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays. for the following relief against
28 Defendants/Respondents (and any and all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this proceeding):

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that
Defendants/Respondents failed to fully comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws
as they relate to the Project and that there must be full compliance therewith before final approval and
implementation of the Project may occur;

B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that

6 Defendants/Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws as they
relate to the Project and that its approval and implementation was illegal in at least some respect,

8 rendering the approval and implementation null and void;
C. Injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants/Respondents (and any and all persons acting at
10 the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from taking any action on any
11 aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until Defendants/Respondents
12 comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws, as determined by the Court;
13 D. Any and all other relief that may be authorized by CEQA or other applicable laws, or
14 any combination of them, but is not explicitly or specifically requested elsewhere in this Prayer;

15 E. Any and all legal fees and other expenses incurred by Petitioner in connection with this
16 proceeding, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil
17 Procedure; and

18 F. Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.

19 Date: April 5, 2019. Respectfully submitted,

Dear City Clerk:
I represent CREED-21 and am sending this Notice of Commencement of Action on my client's behalf.
Please be advised that an action is to be commenced by my client in San Diego County Superior Court against your agency. The action will challenge your agency's approval of the so- called Parking Requirement Regulatory Reform for Multifamily Residential Development in Transit Priority Areas, as reflected in Ordinance no. O-21057 and Resolution nos. R-312234 and 312235 on or about March 19, 2019, on the grounds that the approval violated the California Environmental Quality Act (PUB. RES. CODE 8 21000 et seq.). The action may also challenge your agency's approval of the project based on one or more violations of other laws.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
BRIGGS LAW CORPORATION
