PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Petitioner Affordable Clean Water Alliance ("Petitioner" or "ACWA") seeks a writ

2 of mandamus and injunctive relief against Respondent Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation
3 District ("SCVSD" or "District"), and alleges as follows:
4 INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

5 1. This is a protective filing in the event the Court does not set aside SCVSD's
6 2017 Recirculated EIR for its "Chloride Compliance Project" in LASC Case No.

7 BS170983.

8 2. This suit challenges SCVSD's repeated attempts to violate and otherwise
9 avoid CEQA compliance in the implementation of a multi-million dollar project regarding
10 construction and expansion of two SCVSD water reclamation plants, whose dual, co-equal
J001 2000 pEL MVT NIELSU3ATIS 3HL 11
VOSL-LOLL6 components and purposes have always been to: (1) remove chloride (salt) from the
12

8 North Marengr Avenue, SCVSD's treated effluent; and (2) provide millions of acre feet of additional recycled
13 water for the beneficial use of the rate payers and general public in the Santa Clarita
Pasadei 14 Valley.

2 15 3. Contrary to SCVSD's current, misleading use of new nomenclature and
16 historical revisionism, there were never two separate, SO called "Chloride Compliance
17 Project" and "Recycled Water Project." Rather, the provision of recycled water was a
18 primary component of and interconnected with SCVSD's chloride removal, as part of the
19 overall "Chloride Compliance Project."
20 4. The integration of these overriding project components (chloride removal
21 and provision of recycled water) was stated and confirmed in, inter alia, SCVSD's 2013
22 EIR on the Chloride Compliance Project and again in SCVSD's 2016 SEIR regarding
23 Brine Management.
24 5. However, despite repeated promises to provide this increased recycled water
25 as part of its Chloride Compliance Project, which promises have been made to SCVSD's
26 rate payers as part of a multi-million dollar rate increase, to the court, to other public
27 agencies such as the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, and to the general public, including
28
- 2-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Petitioner ACWA, SCVSD has attempted to deny its obligations and commitments to

2 provide this additional recycled water as through and as part of the Chloride Compliance
3 Project. SCVSD's illegal attempt to separate recycled water out of the Chloride
4 Compliance Project has manifested itself through the invention of a supposedly separate
5 "Recycled Water Project." On or about August 4, 2016, SCVSD made this supposedly
6 separate "Recycled Water Project" the subject of a separate Notice of Preparation of a
7 Supplemental EIR related to recycled water/stickleback.
8 6. The District's latest violations of CEQA regarding its unstudied or
9 inadequately and improperly studied changes to the actual Chloride Compliance Project
10  culminated on or about February 25, 2019, when the SCVSD board passed a resolution in
OdV 'WHL MVI NIELSH3ATIS 3HL Floor ,C 'enuasy 215 North Marengo 11 which it stated that it was withdrawing the NOP for the recycled water/stickleback
9L-L0LL6 VO 'euapesed 12 Supplemental EIR, and purported to abandon the provision of recycled water altogether.
13 7. By its purported abandonment of the critical recycled water provision
14 component of its Chloride Compliance Project - which in reality was a mis-described and
15 unannounced radical change to its Chloride Compliance Project's project description,
16 SCVSD took an action that mandated CEQA review at that time. However, SCVSD

17 violated CEQA by effectively approving a new and/or changed Chloride Compliance
18 Project, but unaccompanied by any purported CEQA review document. ACWA is
19 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD's February 25, 2019
20 disguised approval of a new and different Chloride Compliance Project may have
significant, unmitigable impacts on the environment, but that those impacts were not
studied, disclosed, allowed to be commented on by other agencies and the public, or 21

22

23 mitigated - all in violation of CEQA.
PARTIES 24

25 8. Petitioner Affordable Clean Water Alliance is a California unincorporated

26 association which, along with various of its members and supporters, seeks SCVSD's
27 compliance with its legal obligations, and supports greater creation, retention and use of
28
- 3 -
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

recycled water for the Santa Clarita Valley community's beneficial use. It is a coalition of
2 environmental, property owner, residential and business interests in the Santa Clarita
3 Valley and surrounding areas concerned with water supply, quality and cost, as well as

4 with governmental transparency and accountability issues.

5 9. Petitioner and its members have a substantial interest in ensuring that

6 SCVSD's decisions are in conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those
7 requirements properly executed and the public duties of SCVSD enforced. Petitioner and
8 its members will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from SCVSD's actions and
9 approvals, and is aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of SCVSD as alleged in
10 this petition. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, on behalf of its members, and on behalf of
APC J004 11
BILVERSTEIN LAW FIRIA POSL-LOLL6 all others who will be affected in the Santa Clarita Valley and Los Angeles County areas.
215 North Marengr Avenue 12 10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

8 13 Respondent Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation District of Los Angeles County is a special
teuapesed 14 district operating in Los Angeles County that is responsible for the collection and treatment
15 of wastewater within its jurisdiction and the discharge of treated wastewater, and is the
16 agency responsible for the decisions at issue herein.
17 11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of the respondents sued herein as
18 1 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues said respondents by those fictitious
19 names. Petitioner will amend the petition to allege their true names and capacities when
20 the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon
21 alleges, that each of these fictitiously named respondents is in some manner responsible for
22 the wrongful conduct alleged in this petition. Petitioner is informed and believes, and
23 based thereon alleges, that these fictitiously named respondents were, at all times
24 mentioned in this petition, the agents, servants, and employees of their co-respondents and
25 were acting within their authority as such with the consent and permission of their co-
26 respondents.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 12. Jurisdiction over Respondents, and each of them, exists because each of the
3 Respondents named in this litigation are present and operating within the jurisdictional
4 limits of the County of Los Angeles.

5 13. Venue is proper because most or all of the acts and omissions complained of
6 in this litigation took place within this judicial district.
7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

8 14. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
9 Paragraphs 1 through 13 inclusive, of this petition.
10 15. On October 28, 2013, the Board of Directors of the SCVSD approved the
APC 11 Chloride Compliance Project and certified its EIR (*2013 EIR"). The 2013 Chloride
Eo 12
MVI NIEISH3ATIS 3HL POSI-LOLI J00L . € 'anuary 215 North Marengc Compliance Project included both chloride compliance and recycled water components.

8 13 16. On July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board voted to approve sewer rate increases
Pasadena, 14 for a six-year period from fiscal year 2014-2015 through 2019-2020 in order to help fund
15 the construction of facilities for the chloride removal and provision of recycled water
16 components of the Chloride Compliance Project. The rate increases in the 2018-2019
17 fiscal year would amount to about $83 more for the average family rate payer, and in the

18 2019-2020 fiscal year, would amount to about $100 more for the average family rate payer.
19 The increased rates to non-residential properties, e.g., office, commercial and retail, is
20 typically substantially more.
21 17. Also on July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board adopted a resolution reaffirming its
22 mission to convert treated effluent into recycled water, recognizing that the Chloride
23 Compliance Project will produce high quality recycled water and committing the District
24 to use recycled water as a local water supply. The resolution, along with staff comments at
25 public hearing extolling the recycled water benefits of the Chloride Compliance Project,
26 were made in effort to "sell" the rate payers on increased rates to pay for the Chloride

27 Compliance Project.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

18.

2 On or about February 23, 2016, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the

3 Hon. James C. Chalfant, ordered the setting aside and invalidation of the 2013 EIR, the

4 Chloride Compliance Project approvals, and further ordered SCVSD to refrain from taking

5 any steps to carry out the Chloride Compliance Project until and unless SCVSD had fully

6 complied with CEQA, all other applicable laws, and the accompanying writ. SCVSD has,

7 since that time, falsely claimed that only parts of the 2013 EIR were invalidated. SCVSD

8 never sought a severance order. The judgment and writ that issued resulted in a complete
invalidation of the 2013 EIR.

9 19.

10

APC In March 2016, SCVSD certified a Supplemental EIR ("2016 SEIR") to

11
NEISNMCY NEAISNEXIS 91101-15( address brine management (disposal of the by-product of chloride removal). SCVSD's

12 2016 SEIR was challenged in Court, and was also subsequently invalidated.

20.

§ 13
Pasadena, Both the 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR describe the recycled water provision

14 component as one of the Chloride Compliance Project's fundamental parts and objectives.

21.

3H1 215 North Marengo Avenue, 3' Floor 15 Blaming the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife and ACWA for delays in SCVSD

16 reapproving its Chloride Compliance Project, SCVSD attempted to sever out the recycled
water component.
17 22.

18 On June 2, 2016, the Court, the Hon. James C. Chalfant, identified the

19 serious problem of "piecemealing" in violation of CEQA, in terms of SCVSD's attempt to
sever out recycled water, and informed SCVSD that it must, inter alia: (1) provide
20 "evidence" that the Chloride Compliance Project and its recycled water component are "in
21

22 fact, separate", and provide "real evidence that" they "are severable"; (2) "give the public a

23 chance to comment"; and (3) "rebalance the impact of taking the Recycled Water

24 component out as a project objective on its choice of project alternatives."
23.

25 As part of attempting to sever out the recycled water component, SCVSD

26 announced that it would perform a separate but parallel CEQA review in conjunction with
its Recirculated Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation District Chloride Compliance Project
27 Environmental Impact Report - Separation of Recycled Water Project (*2017 REIR"), and
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

3 for that purpose, on August 4, 2016, issued a Notice of Preparation of a Supplemental

4 Environmental Impact Report for Study of Impacts to the Unarmored Threespine

5 Stickleback [UTS] Fish Under Reduced Discharge Conditions from the Santa Clarita
Valley Sanitation District's Water Reclamation Plants ("2016 Recycled Water SEIR").
24.

7 On August 30, 2017, the SCVSD board certified a Final 2017 REIR, which
6 incorporated and readopted the previously-invalidated 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR, both of

8

9 which reaffirmed and restated that the provision of recycled water was an integral part of
the Chloride Compliance Project. At the time of certification of the 2017 EIR, SCVSD

APC Floor 11 repeatedly assured the public, other public agencies, and the decision makers that the

POSL-LOI 10 provision of recycled water was still a component of the Chloride Compliance Project, but

12

8 215 North Mareng THE SILVERS TEIN LAWLERDS 'enuany 13 that its impacts were being reviewed under the separate but parallel 2016 Recycled Water

asadena, 14 SEIR. The 2017 REIR characterized the separation out of recycled water as merely an
"operational change."

25.

15

16 On February 25, 2019, SCVSD adopted the aforementioned resolution to

17 cease its planning efforts as to the recycled water component of its Chloride Compliance

18 Project, and withdrew the Notice of Preparation of the 2016 Recycled Water SEIR.

26.

19 Petitioner is informed, and believes, and based thereon alleges that SCVSD

20 did not file any Notice of Determination or Notice of Exemption for its February 2019

21 resolution regarding abandonment of its recycled water component of, and consequent

22 substantial change in, its Chloride Compliance Project and its project description. The

27.

23 filing of this petition by ACWA is timely, including under Pub. Res. Code § 21167(a).

24 The exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine does not apply in this
case since the District did not invoke or use CEQA as part

25 of its adoption of the February

26 2019 resolution, and provided no notice to the public of any CEQA review regarding its

27 February 2019 resolution, even though ACWA alleges that CEQA review, and notice of

28 same, was required to be provided to the public as part of SCVSD's consideration and
adoption of the February 2019 resolution. However, to the extent that any "exhaustion"

- 7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 requirement could be found to apply, then ACWA alleges that it exhausted as required by
2 any laws that might apply.

3 28. Petitioner will serve a copy of this a petition on the California Attorney
4 General as required by law.

5 29. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary
6 course of law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner, as well as members
7 of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not
8 granted and the substantially revised, but unstudied, Chloride Compliance Project is
9 allowed to proceed.
10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
APC DOON NOS SIARAY MYI NIELSH3ATIS 3H1 11
+OSI-LOLl6 YO 'euopesed (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines.)
12 30. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

North Marengi 13 Paragraphs 1 through 29 inclusive, of this petition.
14 31. CEQA requires the local agency to prepare and certify the completion of an

% 15 environmental impact report on any project it intends to carry out or approve that may have
16 a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code § 21151(a); Pub. Res. Code §
17 21100(a).

18 32. SCVSD's adoption of the February 2019 resolution was a "project" for
19 purposes of CEQA, including, inter alia, because it was not actually the deletion of an
20 independent "Recycled Water Project," but in reality, was and constituted a radical change
21 to, and reapproval of a new, "Chloride Compliance Project," one that will have new and
22 different significant environmental impacts, but which was not studied or approved with a
23 proper CEQA review document, much less any CEQA review document.
24 33. Petitioner ACWA alleges that SCVSD's February 25, 2019 action, which
25 a masqueraded as a withdrawal of the NOP for the 2016 Recycled Water SEIR and
26 abandonment of its so called and incorrectly-named "Recycled Water Project," was a

27 radical restructuring of its Chloride Compliance Project, approved without legally required
28
- 8 -
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 CEQA review, and performed in a manner to prejudice and injure other agencies such as
2 trustee and resource agency Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, Petitioner ACWA, the general
3 public, and the environment.

4 34. Petitioner ACWA is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
5 SCVSD's circulation of an NOP for the 2016 Recycled Water SEIR and then withdrawing

6 it by way of its February 25, 2019 resolution, acted to, and in fact did, induce trustee and
7 resource agency Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, and potentially other agencies, and members of

8 the public, not to comment on the 2017 REIR and its treatment, albeit inadequate, of
9 recycled water and the endangered stickleback, and instead, to detrimentally rely on the
10 then-announced and pending 2016 Recycled Water SEIR as the vehicle for commenting on
11 recycled water and stickleback issues. As a result, the 2017 REIR, if upheld in ACWA's 91101-1504 VO euapesed J00L o,g 'enualy obueJeW ON SLZ APC WaLH MVT NIELSH3ATS 3HI 12 current challenge to SCVSD's certification of same, could become the only CEQA
13 document on the recycled water and stickleback issues. As such, it could be improperly
14 used - in violation of the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife's role and ACWA and the public's
15 rights - by SCVSD if and when SCVSD reinstates its "Recycled Water Project" or any
16  variation thereof, or when another agency proceeds with the "Recycled Water Project"
17 from SCVSD's treated effluent. ACWA alleges that if SCVSD's actions as described
18 herein are not overturned, SCVSD will have used its alleged abandonment of recycled

19 water as a means to avoid and bypass required CEQA review, now and in the future, to the
20 prejudice of the public and harm to the environment.
21 35. CEQA requires public agencies: (1) to inform governmental decision
22 makers, other public agencies, and the public about the potential significant environmental
23 effects of proposed activities; (2) to identify ways that can avoid or significantly reduce
24 environmental damage; (3) to prevent significant avoidable damage to the environment by
25 requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures, and
26 (4) to disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved the project
27 in the manner it did. CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1)-(4). ACWA alleges that SCVSD,
28

-9 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 through its adoption of the February 2019 resolution, violated CEQA, including the CEQA
2 Guidelines.

3 36. CEQA compels an interactive process of assessment of environmental

4 impacts and responsive project modification "which must be genuine." ACWA alleges
5 that SCVSD's actions as described herein, including its adoption of the February 25, 2019
6 resolution, were its own "project" subject to CEQA, and were and are a radical
7 modification to its Chloride Compliance Project and project description, which was not
8 legal or genuine.
9 37. The CEQA Guidelines require a mandatory finding of significant impacts
10 where, in light of the whole record, the agency's project has the potential to: (1)
Floor 11
poSL-LOLL6 VO 'euapesed 2000 AE SNMARY HELSH3ATIS 3HL substantially degrade the quality of the environment; (2) achieve short-term environmental
'enuany obueJEN qoN 12 goals to the disadvantage of long-term environmental goals; (3) cause cumulatively
13 considerable incremental effects in connection with the effects of past projects, current

14 projects, and probable future projects; and (4) cause substantial adverse effects on human

2 15 beings, either directly or indirectly. Guidelines § 15065(a). ACWA alleges that SCVSD's
16 adoption of the February 25, 2019 resolution may or will cause all of the above, and was
17 approved without fulfilling and in violation of CEQA's requirements.
18 38. Petitioner ACWA alleges that SCVSD's project approvals as described
19 herein, including its approval of a new and different Chloride Compliance Project via its
20 adoption of the February 25, 2019 resolution, may and will result in significant,
21 unmitigable impacts to the environment, including but not limited to impacts related to
22 land use consistency, biological resources, air quality, GHG emissions, water supply,
23 public services, traffic, noise, construction-related impacts, and cumulative impacts.
24 39. Petitioner ACWA as well as other members of the public will suffer
25 irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Chloride Compliance
26 Project implementation commences or continues without a full and adequate EIR, and
27 absent compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 1

2 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines For Failure To Conduct A Subsequent

3 Review Of The Chloride Compliance Project.)
4 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

5 Paragraphs 1 through 39, inclusive, of this petition.
6 41. CEQA requires subsequent or supplemental environmental review where,
7 after the certification of an EIR, substantial changes are proposed in the project or new
8 information, which was not known and could not have been known at the time the
9 environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes available. Pub. Res. Code
10 § 21166; Guidelines §§ 15162-15163.
$ 8 11 42. The CEQA Guidelines "governing EIR supplements require them to be
PE POSI-LOLL6 215 North Marengo Avenue, : MV1 NIELSH3ATIS 3HL 12 circulated and subjected to public review in the same manner as the initial EIR."

S 13 Guidelines §§ 15162(d) and 15163(c).
'euapesed 14 43. By SCVSD's February 25, 2019 resolution, substantial changes in the
15 Chloride Compliance Project were approved without proper CEQA review. In addition,
16 new information that was not known and could not have been known at the time the 2017
17 REIR, with its embedded 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR, was certified as complete, became
18 available. This constitutes an additional basis to invalidate SCVSD's actions as described

19 herein.

20 44. As a result of SCVSD's violations of CEQA, Petitioner ACWA as well as

21 other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not
22 granted and the Chloride Compliance Project implementation commences or continues
23 without a full and adequate EIR, and absent compliance with all other applicable
24 provisions of CEQA and other laws.

I am a member of Affordable Clean Water Alliance ("ACWA"), Petitioner in this I, Alan "Flo" Lawrence, declare as follows:
