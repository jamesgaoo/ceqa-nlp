6 NIGUEL ("City Council"), PLANNING COMMISSION OF THE CITY OF LAGUNA NIGUEL

7 ("Planning Commission"), and DOES 1 through 20, Inclusive (collectively "Respondents"), and

8 alleges as follows:

9 INTRODUCTION

10 1. The Petition concerns the aberrant and legally deficient conduct of the Respondents

11 concerning the SunPointe residential development (*Proposed Project"), located on Tract 5241 at

12 the southern terminus of Avenida Del Caballo in the City of Laguna Niguel, County of Orange,

13 State of California ("Proposed Project Site"), proposed by Real Parties in Interest EULAND
14 CAPITAL ENTERPRISES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ("Euland LP") and EULAND CAPITAL

15 ENTERPRISES, LLC ("Euland LLC") (Euland LP and Euland LLC are collectively referred to

16 herein as "Euland"). Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project sought to construct 71
17 residential units facilitated by, in part, excavating and then relocating roughly 350,000 cubic yards
18 of cut-and-fill earth movement on the Proposed Project Site - which is a large, steep slope of

19 highly expansive soil displaced by one or more endemic landslides - to create a series of elevated a

20 building pads for the clustered units surrounded by extensive retaining walls up to 26° tall.

21 2. Upon information and belief, the •Proposed Project was yet another ill-conceived

22 attempt to develop the Proposed Project Site for residential purposes since the 1960s when an

23 approved 35 lot single family hillside subdivision was abandoned and subsequent attempts to

24 develop the Proposed Project Site failed due to the discovery of sweeping geotechnical hazards,

25 including, one or more landslides and highly expansive soil on the site, and the County of
26 Orange's adoption of more stringent grading regulations, thereby rendering development

27 dangerous and infeasible. Upon information and belief, given the characteristics of the Proposed

28 Project Site, including, in part, the grade, soil composition, and the replete history of geotechnical

1 hazards thereon, development of the Proposed Project Site in a conventional manner is not

2 possible.

3 3. As the homeowner association surrounding most of the Proposed Project site,
† including, in part, the ridgeline directly above the Proposed Project site, and separately, the sole
means of ingress to and egress from the Proposed Project, the Association had, and continues to
6 have, grave concerns about the myriad public and private risks associated with the Proposed

7 Project. Those concerns were ubiquitously communicated to the City and Euland through years of

8 participation in every workshop, community meeting, and public hearing concerning the Proposed

9 Project, in addition to numerous private meetings with the City and/or Euland about the same.

10 4. A most irregular process ensued once the Proposed Project proceeded to required

11 environmental review and public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City Council
12 concerning requisite discretionary entitlements. Upon information and belief, that process spanned

13 over 3 years due to mistakes made by the City, corrective actions by the City after public

14 condemnation of its attempt to fast-track the Proposed Project without adequate environmental

15 review, and the eventual capricious severing of portions of Euland's application for the Proposed
16 Project for piecemeal consideration, thereby creating a moving target, suppressing opposition to

17 the Proposed Project, creating such confusion that the City Council did not understand the

18 meaning or significance of its action, eliminating the City Council's consideration of the

19 Association's administrative appeal concerning the Proposed Project as a whole thereby

20 artificially delaying finality, and gaming statutory limitation periods to exclude the Association's

21 ability to seek rapid legal redress of the City's unlawful conduct.

22 5. Upon information and belief, the City's irregular and deficient procedure from the

23 outset of the Proposed Project's consideration necessitated the filing of an administrative appeal

24 by the Association. That appeal was not adjudicated by the City Council in a manner consistent

25 with California law, thereby vitiating all actions taken by the City with respect to the Proposed

26 Project. Those various actions include, in part, the City Council's purported certification of an

27 Environmental Impact Report for the Proposed Project in the absence of any approved project and

28 without due consideration for the Association's public comments and administrative appeal and

the subsequent approval of a General Plan Amendment without conducting requisite

2 environmental review and again without due consideration to the Association's public comments.

3 These actions, along with the other conduct described herein, are contrary to California law,
4 including, in part, Code of Civil Procedure ("Code of Civ. Proc.") sections 1094.5 and 1085, the

5 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("Pub. Res. Code")

6 section 21000 et seq., including, in part, Pub. Res. Code section 21168.5, and the Ralph M. Brown

7 Act ("Brown Act"), Government Code ("Gov. Code") sections 54950 et seq., and the Association

8 seeks appropriate relief thereunder to protect the interests of itself, its members, the residents of its
9 community, and the general public.

10 THE PARTIES AND STANDING

11 6. The Association is, and at all times relevant herein was, a California nonprofit

12 mutual benefit corporation, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of

13 California, composed of owners of certain real property and the residential units and common area
14 improvements thereon located in the City of Laguna Niguel, County of Orange, State of California

15 ("Colinas Community'). Upon information and belief, the Colinas Community contains 923 single

16 family homes and condominiums with over 3,000 residents in neighborhoods generally located off

17 Paseo de Colinas.

18 7. The Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community are

19 directly and beneficially interested in the Proposed Project, and the City's adherence to relevant

20 law in considering the Proposed Project, as the Colinas Community surrounds the Proposed

21 Project Site continuously from the southwest to the northeast, including all homes along the

22 ridgeline contiguous with the westerly border of the Proposed Project Site and all homes

23 contiguous with the northerly border of the Proposed Project Site. Further, the sole means of

24 ingress to and egress from the Proposed Project Site is from Avenida Del Caballo, a street wholly

25 within the Colinas Community. The neighborhood which includes, in part, the homes on the

26 ridgeline above the westerly border of the Proposed Project Site is called "Westridge Estates." The

27 neighborhood which contains, in part, Avenida Del Caballo is called "Country View Estates." The

28 neighborhoods comprising the Colinas Community as depicted as the color-shaded areas in the

F this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will also confer a substantial benefit

2 on the public at large by compelling Respondents to comply with California law in executing their

3 public functions. The Association's pursuit of this action permits it, its members, the residents of

4 the Colinas Community, and the general public to enforce important public rights and further

5 enforce the public duty of Respondents to comply with California law. Without the Association's

6 pursuit of this action, these rights and duties might otherwise go unenforced because other people

7 directly interested in enforcement of the public rights and duties do not have the resources, ability

8 or motivation to bring an action holding Respondents accountable for their violations of California

9 law.

10 9. In accordance with its Master Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and

11 Restrictions and Reservation of Easements for Colinas de Capistrano, recorded on September 1,

12 1982 and the First Amendment to and Restatement of Master Declaration of Covenants,

13 Conditions and Restrictions and Reservation of Easements for Colinas de Capistrano Community
14 Association, recorded on July 9, 2001, the Association has the right and duty, in part, to protect

15 the interests of the Colinas Community and has the power necessary to carry out its rights and

16 obligations, including the right, duty, and power to contract for legal services to prosecute any
17 action affecting the Colinas Community, including bringing this Petition. The Board of Directors

18 of the Association has duly exercised such authority in bringing this Petition.

19 10. Upon information and belief, the City is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

20 municipal corporation located in the County of Orange, a general a law city organized and existing
21 under the Constitution and laws of the State of California, the governmental entity under which

22 the City Council and the Planning Commission are organized and operate, and the governmental

23 entity, through the City Council and the Planning Commission, that has aggrieved the Association

24 by its conduct set forth in this Petition.

25 11. Upon information and belief, the City Council is, and at all times relevant herein

26 was, an elected body of the City with authority over certain aspects of Euland's application for the
27 Proposed Project and which took some of the conduct that has aggrieved the Association as set

28 forth in this Petition.

12. Upon information and belief, the Planning Commission is, and at all times relevant

2 herein was, an appointed body of the City with authority over certain aspects of Euland's

3 application for the Proposed Project and which took some of the conduct that has aggrieved the

4 Association as set forth in this Petition.

5 13. Upon information and belief, Euland LP is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

6 California limited partnership authorized to and doing business in the State of California,

7 including, in part, the County of Orange. Upon information and belief, as the applicant or co-

8 applicant of the Proposed Project, Euland LP is a real party in interest to this action.
9 14. Upon information and belief, Euland LLC is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

10 California limited liability company authorized to and doing business in the State of California,

11 including, in part, the County of Orange. Upon information and belief, as the applicant or co-

12 applicant of the Proposed Project, Euland LLC is a real party in interest to this action.

13 15. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or

14 otherwise, of Respondents and Defendants DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are unknown to the
15 Association, who therefore sues said Respondents and Defendants under such fictitious names.

16 The Association will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same

17 have been ascertained. Each of the Respondents and Defendants is the agent and/or employee of
18 the City, the City Council, and/or the Planning Commission, and each performed acts on which

19 this action is based within the course and scope of such party's agency and/or employment.

2 19. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. sections 395, subdivision

3 (a) and 395.5 as the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred, the property affected by
those acts is located, in the County of Orange.

5 STATEMENT OF FACTS

6 20. Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project Site consists of 19.5 acres

7 located at the southern terminus of Avenida Del Caballo, which serves as the sole vehicular access

8 point. Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project Site is a generally one large, steep slope

9 descending easterly towards Interstate 5 and is considered by the City to a be a "hillside" property.

10 The Proposed Project Site is bound on the north by the Country View Estates residential

11 development, which is part of the Association and the Colinas Community, on the east by
12 Mercedes Benz of Laguna Niguel, on the south by a slope that descends to Rancho Capistrano and

13 Saddleback Church, and on the west by the Westridge Estates residential development, which is

14 also part of the Association and the Colinas Community. Upon information and belief, the site

15 elevation on the Proposed Project Site ranges between 250 to 455 feet above mean sea level.

16 21. Upon information and belief, development of the Proposed Project Site has

17 uniformly failed since first attempted during the early 1960s. Upon information and belief, under

18 the jurisdiction of the County of Orange, a prior owner of the Proposed Project Site received

19 approval to subdivide and develop the Proposed Project Site with 35 single family homes on

20 separate lots. Upon information and belief, Tract 5241 was recorded in 1960 consistent with the

21 same. Upon information and belief, mass grading of the Proposed Project Site commenced in

22 1962. Upon information and belief, the same prior owner abandoned the development of approved

23 project shortly after commencing site improvements for unknown reasons.

24 22. Upon information and belief, the improvements on the Proposed Project Site have
25 largely remained the same since the prior owner abandoned the previously approved project

26 during the 1960s after completing rough grading, the installation of roads, and partial grading of
27 the 35 single family home lots. The Proposed Project Site presently appears as generally shown in

28 the following photograph:

14 23. Upon information and belief, subsequent attempts to develop the Proposed Project

15 Site failed following both the discovery during the 1970s of sweeping geotechnical hazards on the

16 Proposed Project Site, including, in part, one or more landslides which had never been remediated

17 and highly expansive soil, and the County of Orange's adoption of more stringent grading

18 regulations, the combination of the two rendered the development of the Proposed Project Site

19 dangerous and infeasible.

20 24. Upon information and belief, Euland acquired the Proposed Project Site on

21 November 18, 1993 from H & S Capital Enterprises II, a California Limited Partnership, knowing

22 and accepting that the attempts to develop the Proposed Project Site had failed for decades. Upon

23 information and belief, Euland is not a professional residential developer, and based upon public

24 records, consists of a husband and wife who conduct Euland-related business from their home in

25 Irvine.

26 25. Upon information and belief, undeterred by the decades of failure, Euland

27 presented the City with the Proposed Project during or around 2012. Upon information and belief,

28 the Proposed Project sought to change the previously approved plan for 35 large lot, single family

homes to 71 small lot, single family homes by creating five terraced, elevated building pads

2 surrounded by retaining walls up to 26° tall following excavating and relocating roughly 350,000

3 cubic yards of cut-and-fill earth movement on the Proposed Project Site to remediate the one or

4 more historic landslides thereon.

5 26. Upon information and belief, due to, in part, the unorthodox means of construction

6 proposed and the characteristics of the Proposed Project Site, the City determined that Euland

7 required a litany of discretionary entitlements from the City, including, a General Plan

8 Amendment, a Zone Change, a Site Development Permit, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map, and a

9 Minor Adjustment, for Proposed Project to be potentially approved.

10 27. Upon information and belief, after years of apparent private meetings between

11 Euland and the City and before holding any public hearing concerning the Proposed Project or

12 circulating any of environmental review documents required by CEQA, the Planning Commission

13 held a workshop on January 26, 2016 to introduce the public to the Proposed Project and
14 disturbingly expressed support for the Proposed Project without the benefit of public comment or
15 consideration of the Proposed Project's environmental impacts as required by CEQA. Upon

16 information and belief, the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community

17 expressed myriad concerns with the Proposed Project during that workshop.

18 28. Upon information and belief, to commence environmental review of the Proposed

19 Project consistent with CEQA's mandates, the City prepared and circulated a Draft Initial Study a

20 ("IS") and proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") on June 16, 2016. Upon

21 information and belief, public review and comment on the same occurred between June 16, 2016

22 and July 15, 2016. Upon information and belief, based upon the extensive public comments the

23 City received concerning the IS and MND, including, several hundred collective pages of

24 comments from the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community which

25 expressed profound concern with the Proposed Project due, in part, to the highly unconventional

26 nature of the Proposed Project and the characteristics of the Proposed Project Site and the City's

27 attempt to bypass required environmental review of the Proposed Project Site, the City did not

28 respond to the public comments it received and determined that it would change course and

1 require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report and the adoption of a Mitigation

2 Monitoring and Reporting Program.

3 29. Upon information and belief, consistent with the same, the City prepared and

4 circulated a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for which the public comment period began on
5 October 20, 2016 and ended on November 30, 2016. Upon information and belief, during the

6 pendency of that public comment period, the City a held a public scoping meeting concerning the

7 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report on November 9, 2016. Upon information and

8 belief, the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community participated and

9 commented with respect to the NOP and during scoping meeting setting forth their logical

10 concerns with the Proposed Project.

11 30. Upon information and belief, the City prepared and circulated a Draft

12 Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") concerning the Proposed Project in April 2017 for which

13 the public comment period began on April 27, 2017 and ended on June 12, 2017. The Association

14 submitted its public comments on the DEIR on June 12, 2017. Those public comments included

15 extensive comments specifically keyed to important portions of the DEIR alerting the City to

16 flawed assumptions, incomplete information, incomplete analysis, and other critical problems with

17 the proposed analysis of the Proposed Project's environmental impacts. The Association's public

18 comments also included a peer review completed by American Geotechnical of the
19 geotechnical/geologic and civil engineering reports relied upon in the DEIR which identified
20 I extensive material deficiencies in the geotechnical, geologic, and hydrological analysis and

21 conclusions rendering the proposed environmental impact findings of the DEIR flawed and

22 unreliable.

23 31. Upon information and belief, after the close of public comments on the DEIR, the

24 City discovered that portions of the DEIR had been omitted from the City's website purporting to
25 contain a complete version of the DEIR. Attempting to remedy this error, the City recirculated the

26 omitted portions of the DEIR on July 7, 2017 for a public comment period began on July 7, 2017

27 and ended on August 7, 2017. In response to the same, the Association forwarded the City a letter

28 from American Geotechnical that the recirculated portions of the DEIR did not require any

1 changes to its previously submitted peer review.

2 32. Upon information and belief, the City purported to have made a Final

3 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") available for public review on September 15, 2017, the
+1n same day that the City published its Staff Report for a public hearing scheduled to occur on
September 26, 2017 before the Planning Commission with respect to Euland's request for a

6 General Plan Amendment (for which the Planning Commission was a recommending body to the

7 City Council), a Zone Change (for which the Planning Commission was a recommending body to

8 the City Council), a Site Development Permit (for which the Planning Commission was the final
9 decision making body unless appealed to the City Council), a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (for

10 which the Planning Commission was the final decision making body unless appealed to the City

11 Council), a Minor Adjustment (for which the Planning Commission was the final decision making
12 body unless appealed to the City Council), and certification of the EIR for the Proposed Project

13 (for which both the Planning Commission and the City Council were final decision making
14 bodies) (collectively the "Planning Commission Entitlements").

15 33. Upon information and belief, while the EIR purported to provide substantive
16 itemized responses to the public comments received concerning the DEIR, significant and material

17 portions of the Association's public comments were either simply not referred to at all or were

18 responded to in cursory non-substantive manner in no manner evidencing that the City had given

19 due consideration to the Association's comments. The Association has unable to timely appreciate

20 this deficiency as the City failed to timely provide the Association a copy a of EIR as required by
21 section 15088, subdivision (b) of the Guidelines for Implementation of the California

22 Environmental Quality Act, 14 California Code of Regulations, sections 15000 et seq.
23 ("Guidelines") and as requested by the Association in its public comment letter about the DEIR.

24 34. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

25 appeared at the Planning Commission's public hearing on September 26, 2017 and spoke in

26 opposition to the Planning Commission Entitlements based upon myriad procedural irregularities

27 to date which barred the Planning Commission's lawful consideration of the Planning

28 Commission Entitlements and vast substantive concerns with the Proposed Project, largely

surrounding the deficient consideration of the Proposed Project's significant environmental

2 impacts and the inadequacy of the mitigation measures to reduce the admitted significant

3 environmental impacts of the Proposed Project to a less than significant basis. Upon information
4 and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments submitted in

5 opposition to the Proposed Project and contrary to the administrative record before it, the Planning

6 Commission approved the Planning Commission Entitlements through Resolution Nos. 17-08, 17-

7 09, 17-10, 17-11, and 17-12 (collectively the "Planning Commission Entitlements Approval").

8 35. Consistent with the appeal period and required content for an appeal as specified in
9 the City's Municipal Code ("Municipal Code"), the Association filed with the City a timely and

10 compliant appeal of the Planning Commission Entitlement Approval to the City Council on

11 October 6, 2017 (*Appeal"). The Association identified a variety of bases for the Appeal based
12 upon the Planning Commission's numerous and separate violations of CEQA and the Guidelines,

13 the Planning Commission's numerous and separate violations of the Brown Act, and the Planning

14 Commission's numerous and separate violations of Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5 (including,

15 acting without or excess of its jurisdiction, failing to provide a fair and impartial public hearing,

16 and prejudicially abusing its discretion). The Association submitted evidentiary support for the
17 bases articulated supporting the Appeal.

18 36. A public hearing before the City Council concerning the Appeal and Euland's

19 request for a General Plan Amendment (for which the City Council was the final decision making

20 body), a Zone Change (for which the City Council was the final decision making body), a Site
21 Development Permit (for which the City Council was the final decision making body due to the

22 Appeal), a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (for which the City Council was the final decision making

23 body due to the Appeal), a Minor Adjustment (for which the City Council was the final decision

24 making body due to the Appeal), and certification of the EIR for the Proposed Project (for which

25 the City Council was the final decision making body due to the Appeal) (collectively the "City

26 Council Entitlements") was scheduled to occur on November 7, 2017. The City Council continued

27 the November 7, 2017 public hearing concerning the Appeal and the City Council Entitlements

28 without any substantive consideration of the same to December 5, 2017.

37. The City Council continued the December 5, 2017 public hearing concerning the

2 Appeal and the City Council Entitlements without any substantive consideration of the same to

3 January 16, 2018.

4 38. The City Council tabled the January 16, 2018 public hearing concerning the Appeal
5 and the City Council Entitlements without any substantive consideration of the same to a date

6 uncertain, which was later noticed for April 17, 2018.

7 39. A continued public hearing before the City Council concerning the Appeal and the

8 City Council Entitlements occurred on April 17, 2018. Upon information and belief, following

9 public comments, the City Council continued the hearing to June 5, 2018 without substantive

10 consideration of the Appeal or the City Council Entitlements and directed the City's Staff and

11 Euland to hold a community outreach workshop concerning the Proposed Project before then
12 given, in part, the ongoing public opposition to the Proposed Project and Euland's change of the

13 Proposed Project by reducing the number of residential units from 71 to 60 by increasing the lot

14 sizes and square footage of the units while maintaining the other aspects of the Proposed Project.

15 The community outreach workshop occurred on May 10, 2018.

16 40. Upon information and belief, a continued public hearing before the City Council
17 concerning the Appeal and the City Council Entitlements occurred on June 5, 2018. Upon

18 information and belief, the City's Staff recommended at the continued public hearing and in its

19 Staff Report for the same that the City Council certify the EIR, approve the requested General
20 Plan Amendment and Zone Change to allow development for up to 60 residential units and to

21 refer the remaining entitlements with directions to the Planning Commission. Upon information

22 and belief, the City's Staff made no mention of or reference to the Appeal. Upon information and

23 belief, following public comment, which was uniformly opposed to the Proposed Project, the City

24 Council deliberated and concluded that it would not approve the Proposed Project and no
25 Councilmember made motion with respect to Euland's request for a General Plan Amendment, a

26 Zone Change, a Site Development Permit, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map or a Minor Adjustment
27 for the Proposed Project. Upon information and belief, similarly, no Councilmember made a
28 motion with respect to the Appeal. Upon information and belief, a question then arose whether the

1 certification of the EIR should be entertained. Upon information and belief, after none of the

2 Councilmembers were initially willing to make such a motion, one of the Councilmembers asked

3 the City Attorney for clarification about what such a motion would do, to which the City Attorney
4 responded, in part, with assurance that the certification of the EIR "was not the approval of the
5 project or any aspect of it." Upon information and belief, with the understanding the certification

6 of the EIR was not approving any project, and with the City Attorney's further assurance that the

7 certification could only potentially support a future hypothetical 35 unit residential project, the

8 same number of units originally approved for the Proposed Project Site and which the City

9 Council indicated during deliberations it believed was still appropriate for the Proposed Project

10 Site, the City Council passed a motion to certify the EIR and adopt the associated mitigation

11 monitoring and reporting program through Resolution No. 2018-1257. Upon information and

12 belief, the corresponding resolution purportedly memorializing the City Council's motion did not

13 reflect the City Council's deliberation, intention, understanding, representations, conditions, and

14 other expressed perimeters and contained content contrary to the same. Upon information and

15 belief, no mention, discussion, deliberation, adjudication or consideration as to the Appeal,
16 including, in part, any of the CEQA-based challenges therein, occurred anytime during the June 5,

17 2018 public hearing.

18 41. The City Council's failure to adjudicate the Appeal eliminated the Association's

19 ability to challenge the legality of the City Council's EIR certification prior to this Petition due to,

20 in part, the City's prevention of the Association's ability to exhaust its administrative remedies

21 and/or a lack of finality.

22 42. Six months later the Association unexpectedly received a Notice of Public Meeting

23 on January 4, 2019 concerning a public hearing before the Planning Commission on January 22,

24 2019 to provide recommendations to the City Council with respect to Euland's request for "City

25 approval of a General Plan Amendment to increase the maximum number of permitted single-

26 family detached residential dwelling units for the project site from 35 to 53 dwelling units (a

27 reduction from the initial request for 71 dwelling units)" ("Revised General Plan Amendment").

28 The same Notice further noted that "[a]ny grading of the site as part of a future development

1 project would continue to be balanced on-site, thereby avoiding the heavy truck traffic necessary

2 to facilitate soil import/export." Upon information and belief, contrary to the understanding,

3 assumptions, representations, and intentions of the City Council in certifying the EIR, principally

4 that by certifying the EIR it was not approving the Proposed Project or any aspect of it, the same

5 Notice indicated that:

6 "On June 5, 2018, the City Council certified Environmental Impact Report EIR

7 17-01 (SCH No. 2016061037) which establishes parameters for development of

8 the project site in such a manner as to avoid significant environmental impacts.

9 The requested General Plan Amendment would not result in new significant

10 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously

11 identified effects. Therefore modification of the Certified EIR is not required in

12 conjunction with review of the request General Plan Amendment."

13 43. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

14 appeared at the Planning Commission's public hearing on January 22, 2019 and spoke in

15 opposition to the Planning Commission recommending that the City Council approve the Revised

16 General Plan Amendment since, in part, (a) the Appeal was still outstanding and required

17 adjudication by the City Council before any potential entitlements for a proposed residential

18 development on the Proposed Project Site could be lawfully considered; (b) the City Council had

19 certified the EIR to only facilitate potential 35 unit residential project, not a 53 unit residential
20 project, (c) Euland had purposefully and inappropriately severed but one of the many discretionary
21 entitlements required for any residential development on the Proposed Project Site in order to

22 suppress and subvert public opposition, create ambiguity and confusion, and mislead the City and

23 public, and (d) since Euland had not provided reasonable and sufficient tangible information about

24 its proposed revised project for the Proposed Project Site, the public could not meaningful

25 participate in providing comments on the Revised General Plan Amendment, there was no basis

26 for the City Council to potentially conclude that the Revised General Plan Amendment would be

27 consistent with the EIR, the City Council's consideration of the Revised General Plan Amendment

28 would require recirculation of the EIR, there was no basis for the City Council to conclude that the

Costa Mesa, California 92626 FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Revised General Plan Amendment would be consistent with the City's General Plan. The

2 Association submitted a 9-page public comment letter, in part, detailing the foregoing. Upon

3 information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments submitted

4 in opposition to the Planning Commission potential recommending that the City Council approve
5 the Revised General Plan Amendment and contrary to the administrative record before it, the

6 Planning Commission passed a motion recommending to the City Council that it approve the

7 Revised General Plan Amendment. Upon information and belief, no resolution accompanied or

8 memorialized the foregoing Planning Commission motion.
9 44. On February 1, 2019, the City published a Notice of Public Hearing concerning a
10 public hearing before the City Council on February 19, 2019 to consider the Appeal, the Revised

11 General Plan Amendment, and the associated discretionary entitlements previously requested with

12 respect to the Proposed Project. The Notice specifically acknowledged that the Appeal was still

13 outstanding and required adjudication.

14 45. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

15 appeared at the City Council's public hearing on February 19, 2019. The Association spoke in

16 support of the merits of the Appeal. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the

17 Colinas Community spoke in opposition to the Revised General Plan Amendment. The bases for

18 that opposition largely mirrored the comments made before the Planning Commission as neither

19 Euland nor the City had cured the numerous deficiencies identified by the Association and the

20 public before the Planning Commission. The Association submitted a 14-page public comment

21 letter, in part, detailing the foregoing. The City's Mayor denied the Association's request for more

22 than 3 minutes to address the City Council which the Association submitted was reasonable and

23 necessary since two separate matters were being considered by the City Council (i.e., the Appeal

24 and the Revised General Plan Amendment) and since the public hearing was an evidentiary

25 hearing concerning the Appeal, the Association was entitled to sufficient time to meaningfully

26 support the Appeal, which was infeasible through the 3 minutes afforded to the public by default.

27 Upon information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments

28 submitted in opposition to the Revised General Plan Amendment and contrary to the

1 administrative record before it. the City Council approved the Revised General Plan Amendment

2 through Resolution No. 2019-1276 ("Resolution").

3 46. Upon information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the

4 evidence and arguments submitted by the Association in support of the Appeal and contrary to the

5 administrative record before it, the City Council apparently intended to deny the Appeal through

6 the Resolution; however, in fact, it yet again failed to take conclusive final action concerning the

7 same, in violation of, in part, California law and Section 9-1-112.2, Subdivision (f) of the

8 Municipal Code. Upon information and belief, the City Council's deliberation during the February

9 19, 2019 public hearing included no mention, discussion, deliberation, adjudication, or

10 consideration as to the Appeal. Upon information and belief, consistent with the City Council's

11 lack of any meaningful, substantive consideration of the Appeal, the Resolution contains a cursory

12 sentence indicating that: "[T]he appeal grounds [for the Appeal] provided lack sufficient facts,

13 detail, and analytical rationale to support the Appellant's [the Association] claims." Upon

14 information and belief, the Resolution fails to address any of the discrete bases for the Appeal in

15 any meaningful, substantive manner, thereby failing to bridge the analytic gap between the

16 administrative record and the City Council's apparent intent to deny the Appeal, the Resolution
17 contains numerous factual assertions facially contradicted by the administrative record, and the
18 Resolution in no manner reflects the City Council's deliberations during the February 19, 2019

19 public hearing. Upon information and belief, the Resolution does not state what specific action, if

20 any, the City Council took with respect to the Appeal contrary to the requirements of, in part,

21 section 9-1-112.2, Subdivision (f) of the Municipal Code which provides that the City Council

22 "shall consider the appeal and take one of the following actions: a. Take action to sustain, reverse

23 or modify the original decision b. Continue the appeal for further consideration. C. Refer the
24 application back to the original decision-making authority with directions."

25 47. The Resolution also, in part, provides:

26 "For purposes of determining compliance with the Permit Streamlining Act, any

27 future project submittals (excluding any which contain a proposed entitlement

28 requiring a legislative land use design) shall be deemed a 'development project'

- as defined in Government Code Section 65928 and processed in accordance with

2 applicable time limits, which such time limits shall commence upon City receipt

3 of revised project materials."

4 48. Upon information and belief, Euland has neither invoked the Permit Streamlining
5 Act nor provided the a public notice that is a condition precedent to the potential application of the

6 Permit Streamlining Act and thus the City Council could not lawfully deem any prospective

7 proposed development at the Proposed Project Site as a "development project" subject to the

8 Permit Streamlining Act. Upon information and belief, the foregoing is yet another example of the

9 City taking untoward liberties to facilitate the development of the Proposed Project Site contrary

10 to law and the rights of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

11 the public.

12 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

13 49. The Association has exhausted all available and non-futile administrative remedies

14 required to be pursued by it under the law and the factual circumstances underlying this action.
15 50. Respondents have, and at all relevant times had, a mandatory duty to exercise their

16 powers in accordance with the law. By engaging in the conduct described in this Petition,

17 Respondents respectively breached this mandatory duty. The Association is informed and

18 believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents will not fulfill their mandatory duties without a

19 court order.

20 51. The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

21 of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, that will remedy the Respondents' violations of

22 law described in this Petition and to prevent the Respondents from acting outside their legal

23 authority.

24 52. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the

25 public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted.

26 53. The Association has a direct and beneficial interest in the outcome of this action

27 and has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition. The maintenance and
28 prosecution of this action will further confer a substantial benefit on the public by compelling

Respondents to comply with California law in executing their public functions. The Association's

2 pursuit of this action permits its individual members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

3 the public throughout the County of Orange to enforce important public rights and further enforce

4 the public duty of Respondents to comply with California law. Without the Association's pursuit

5 of this action, these rights and duties might otherwise go unenforced because other persons

6 directly interested in enforcement of the public rights and duties do not have the resources, ability

7 or motivation to bring an enforcement action.

8 54. The Association seeks through this action to enforce important rights affect the

9 public interest and which confer a significant benefit on the public by ensuring that Respondents

10 comply with California law. The Association has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial

11 expense in attorneys' fees and costs pursuing this matter. There is no monetary recovery sought or

12 allowed in this action that would be available to offset the expense incurred by the Association in

13 pursuing this action for public benefit. As such, the Association is entitled to recover an award of

14 attorneys' fees from Respondents, individually or collectively, pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.

15 section 1021.5 and/or Gov. Code section 800.

16 55. The Association has requested that the City prepare a true copy of the

17 administrative record relating to the relevant underlying administrative proceeding pursuant to

18 Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.6, subdivision (c). The Association will lodge a copy of the

19 administrative record with this Court at an appropriate time pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. section

20 1094.5, subdivision (a).

21 56. All claims asserted herein are timely and/or are excused by Respondent's conduct.

8 approvals resulting from the Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings (collectively the

12 unlawful and invalid under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5 for the reasons, in part, alleged

2 in which by law a hearing was required at which evidence must be taken, Respondents were

3 required to provide the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and/or

8 causing one or more of the Challenged Resolutions to be unlawful and invalid under Code of Civ.

10

11 (The Underlying Resolutions are not Supported by Legally Sufficient Findings - Code of
Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

12 69.

13 The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

14 70.

15 Respondents were required to support the Challenged Resolutions with adequate

16 findings explaining how the City Council or the Planning Commission bridged the analytic gap

17 between the raw evidence before it and the ultimate decision or order contained in each of the

18 Challenged Resolutions in accordance with the requirements of applicable law. The Challenged

19 Resolutions each needed to contain findings sufficient, in part, to: (a) enable a reviewing court to

20 understand and examine how the basis for the City Council's or the Planning Commission's

21 decision or order, (b) enable a reviewing court to understand and examine how the City Council or

22 the Planning Commission traveled from the raw evidence before it during the relevant portion or

23 portions of the Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings and the corresponding Challenged

24 Resolutions, and (c) enable the Association, members thereof, the residents of the Colinas

Challenged Resolutions.

27 One or more of the Challenged Resolutions are not supported by legally sufficient

1 72. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the

2 public have been deprived of important rights and liberties and have otherwise been prejudicially

3 aggrieved, damaged, and injured, by Respondents' failure to base its conclusions on sufficient

4 findings in one or more of the Challenged Resolutions which violated, without limitation: (a) the

5 right of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public to

6 have a reviewing court be able to reasonably assess whether the City Council and/or the Planning

7 Commission properly considered the oral and written testimony and evidence presented by or on

8 behalf of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public,

9 and more generally, the record as a whole, during the Proposed Project Administrative

10 Proceedings and in reaching, considering, deliberating, adjudicating, and adopting each of the

11 Challenged Resolutions, (b) the right of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas

12 Community, and the public to have a reviewing court be unable to understand what evidence in

13 the record from the Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings upon which each of the

14 Challenged Resolutions is based, and (c) the right of the Association, its members, the residents of

15 the Colinas Community, and the public to be able to determine whether and on what basis to seek

Procedure § 1085)

18 The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

19 79.

20 In the event that this Court determines that the Association is not entitled to relief

21 under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5, the Association pleads in the alternative that it is entitled
to relief under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1085 in that the acts and omissions of

22 Respondents

23 concerning, relating to, and/or arising from the Proposed Project were arbitrary, capricious, and

24 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, failed to follow procedures and give the notices required

25 by law, and/or we beyond and outside Respondents' jurisdiction and authority, which have caused

26 the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public to be

27 deprived of important rights and liberties and otherwise be prejudicially aggrieved, damaged, and
injured.

28 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Respondents' Approval of the Challenged Resolutions Violated the California
3 Environmental Quality Act - Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
4 80. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all

5 preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

6 81. CEQA requires that public agencies, in part, consider and document the

7 environmental implications of their actions. CEQA's main objectives are to fully inform the public

8 and decision-makers of the significant adverse environmental effects of projects and develop ways
9 to avoid or reduce such effects by requiring implementation of feasible alternative and mitigation

10 measures.

11 82. CEQA's mandate is required to be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the

12 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

13 language." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 563-564.)

14 Any approving agency's action violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed
15 decisionmaking" and "informed public participation." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of
16 Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

17 83. As acknowledged in the EIR, since the approval of the Proposed Project, and any

18 part thereof, would have the potential to cause either a direct, or reasonably foreseeable indirect,

19 physical change in the environment, such action constitutes "approval" of a "discretionary project"

20 as defined by CEQA and in the Guidelines. Accordingly, at all times relevant herein, Respondents

21 were charged with a duty to, in part, fully and accurately consider the environmental consequences

22 of any approvals for, related to or facilitating the Proposed Project through preparation of an EIR

23 that complied with CEQA, to fully disclose, consider, and adopt feasible mitigation measures and

24 alternatives that would reduce or eliminated significant environmental impacts and to make lawful

25 findings that supported the decisions made and were supported by substantial evidence in the

26 administrative record.

27 84. In certifying the EIR, Respondents violated CEQA and the Guidelines, in part, in

28 each of the following manners:

Costa Mesa, California 92626 FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

N0T00D ∞O a. Respondents failed to timely provide a copy of the EIR to the Association after
the Association had requested the same, which Respondents acknowledged, in
violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089;
b. Respondents failed to timely make the EIR readily accessible for public review
in violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089;
c. Respondents failed to properly evaluate and respond to the Association's public
comments on the DEIR in violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15088 and
15088.5; and
d. Respondents failed to timely provide the Association with Respondents'

10 responses to the Association's public comments on the DEIR in violation of, in

11 part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089.

12 85. At all times relevant herein, Respondents were charged with a duty under CEQA

13 to, in part, prepare a recirculated, subsequent or supplemental EIR where substantial evidence in

14 the record showed one or more of the following:

15 a. Substantial changes are proposed in the Project which will require major
16 revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of
17 new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of
18 the previously identified significant effects;
19 b. Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

20 Project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or
21 negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental

22 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
23 significant effects; or

24 C. New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could

25 not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the

26 previous EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted,

27 shows any of the following:

28 i. The Project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in

Costa Mesa, California 92626 FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- N0 TOONDO the previous EIR or negative declaration;
ii. Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more
severe than shown in the previous EIR;
iii. Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible
would in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more
significant effects of the Project, but the Project proponents decline to
adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or
iv. Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different
from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one

10 or more significant effects on the environment, but the Project

11 proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

12 86. Respondents violated CEQA and the Guidelines by approving the Resolution

13 without preparing a recirculated, subsequent or supplemental EIR analyzing the Revised General

14 Plan Amendment despite the overwhelming evidence in the record of changes in the Proposed

15 Project, changes in circumstances surrounding the Proposed Project, and new information that

16 revealed significant new impacts and a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
17 impacts.

18 87. Respondents' failure to conform its conduct to the requirements of CEQA and the

19 Guidelines as, in part, described above, a constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to

20 proceed in a manner required by applicable law. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

21 88. The Association complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code section 21167.5

22 by providing Respondents with written notice of this action prior to filing the lawsuit.

23 89. The Association timely served the Attorney General of the State of California with
24 a copy of its Petition along with a notice of its filing pursuant to Pub. Res. Code section 21167.7

25 and Code of Civ. Proc. section 388, a true copy of which notice and proof of service is attached

26 hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein in full by this reference.

27 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2

3 (Respondents Violated the Ralph M. Brown Act by and through the Underlying

90. Administrative Proceedings - Government Code $ 54950 et seq.)

5 The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

6 91.

7 The Brown Act requires that an overwhelming majority of decisions made by

8 public agencies be made in public after providing the public with compliant notice of the proposed

9 actions and an opportunity to be heard on the proposed actions. The purpose of the Brown Act is

10 to facilitate public participation in governmental decision-making by ensuring that the deliberative

11 process by which decisions impacting the public are made before the public and with

12 transparency. The Gov. Code contains similar requirements concerning the timing and content of

13 mandatory public notices for meaningful land use decisions. (See, e.g., Gov. Code §§ 65090,
65091, and 65353.)

14 92.

15 The Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings, and the actions resulting
therefrom, including, in part, the Challenged Resolutions were subject to the Brown Act, its
16 incumbent requirements, and other Gov. Code provisions requiring certain timing and content of
17 mandatory public notices for meaningful land use decisions (e.g., Gov. Code §§ 65090, 65091,

18

19 and 65353). Respondents violated those requirements, in part, in each of the following respects:

20 a. The City and the Planning Commission failed to provide timely and

21 substantively compliant notice for the Planning Commission's public hearing

22 on September 26, 2017;

6 b. The Planning Commission inappropriately received and considered new

24 materials provided by the City's Staff that had not been disclosed and were not

25 part of the agenda for the Planning Commission's public hearing on September
26, 2017; and

26

27 93. c. Respondents failed to make the EIR readily accessible for timely public review.
The Association initiated the

28 Appeal on October 6, 2017 which identified each of
the above-alleged violations of the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code statutory requirements

WRIT OF TRADITIONAL MANDAMUS, PEREMTPORY MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION; COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

thereby fulfilling, to the extent applicable, the requirements of Gov. Code section 54960.2. The

2 Association is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents failed to timely
3 remedy the Brown Act and other similar Gov. Code violations alleged herein. Accordingly, the

4 Association is authorized to assert this claim.

5 94. Respondents' violations of the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code statutory

6 requirements were not technical or trivial in nature, but instead materially and substantially

7 impeded the mandate of the Brown Act and the Gov. Code to facilitate public participation in

8 decision-making.

9 95. Since Respondents failed to timely remedy the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code

10 statutory requirements alleged above, the Association is entitled to recover its reasonable

11 attorneys' fees and costs incurred pursuant to Gov. Code section 54960.5.

12 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

13 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 527)

15 96. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all

16 preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

17 97. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the Association and

18 Respondents concerning their respective rights and duties with respect to the Proposed Project, the

19 Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings, and the Challenged Resolutions. The Association is

20 therefore entitled to a judicial declaration of the parties' rights and duties with respect to the same

21 under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1060.

22 98. The Association contends that Respondents have not proceeded in accordance with
23 the law and has prejudicially abused its discretion by and through, in part, the conduct described in
24 this Petition with respect to the Proposed Project, the Proposed Project Administrative
25 Proceedings, and the Challenged Resolutions. The Association contends, in part, that such conduct

26 violates the Code of Civ. Proc., the Gov. Code, and the Pub. Res. Code as set forth above.

27 Accordingly, the Challenged Resolutions are subject to being set aside by this Court.

28 99. The Association is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents

1 deny the Association's contentions.

2 100. The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law other than this

3 proceeding to compel Respondents to comply with their incumbent legal obligations and remedy
1 the conduct and actions of Respondents to date in contravention of their legal obligations as set
forth, in part, herein. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

6 the public have a clear, present, and beneficial right to and interest in the proper performance by

7 Respondents of their mandatory duties under the law. Unless and until the Respondents are

8 enjoined from continued violations of the law by order of this Court under, in part, Code of Civ.

9 Proc. section 527, the Association, its members, residents of the Colinas Community, and the

10 public will suffer great and irreparable injury.

11 101. The issuance of a temporary stay order and temporary restraining order and

12 preliminary injunction in this case is in the public interest and is otherwise necessary and

13 appropriate pursuant to, in part, Code of Civ. Proc. Section 1094.5 to stay the effectiveness of the

14 Challenged Resolutions because, in the absence of injunctive relief, Respondents will proceed

15 forward approving further discretionary entitlements required for the Proposed Project or some

16 variation thereof to proceed in reliance upon Respondents' unlawful conduct which is the subject

17 of this Petition thereby potentially rendering this Petition moot and/or causing irreparable damage

18 upon the commencement of construction activities on the Proposed Project Site, pending trial on

19 the merits.

20 102. Unless and until Respondents are enjoined and restrained and a temporary stay

21 order is issued as herein requested, the Association, its members, residents, and the public will

22 suffer irreparable injury due to, in part, the irrevocable commitment to a project with significant
23 effects on the environment prior to the completion of environmental review in a manner required

24 by CEQA, thereby foreclosing the consideration of appropriate alternatives and mitigation

25 measures to address the environmental concerns raised to date by the Association, its members,

26 residents of the Colinas Community, and the public, none of which can be fully cured after the fact

27 and none of which can be adequately compensated by monetary damages.
28 103. If a temporary stay order and temporary restraining order and preliminary

injunction are issued as requested herein, Respondents will not suffer any irreparable injury or

2 harm in that they have known the objections raised to date by the Association, its members,

3 residents of the Colinas Community, and the public and have determined nonetheless to proceed

4 with full knowledge and acceptance of the incumbent risks of such action and Respondents have a

5 nominal, if any, interest in the completion of the Proposed Project such that any temporary delay

6 thereto attributable to this Court's issuance of a temporary restraining order and preliminary would

7 be inconsequential and capable of being fully cured after the fact. Accordingly, the balance of

8 hardships is in favor of issuing the stay order or temporary restraining order and preliminary

9 injunction as requested herein.

10 104. The Association seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the foregoing,

11 continued harm and to protect the Association, its members, residents of the Colinas Community,

12 and the public from Respondent's unlawful conduct.

13 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, the Association respectfully requests relief and prays for entry of
16 judgment as follows:

7 ("Planning Commission"), and DOES 1 through 20, Inclusive (collectively "Respondents"), and

8 alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION

10 1. The Petition concerns the aberrant and legally deficient conduct of the Respondents

11 concerning the SunPointe residential development ("Proposed Project"), located on Tract 5241 at

12 the southern terminus of Avenida Del Caballo in the City of Laguna Niguel, County of Orange,

13 State of California ("Proposed Project Site"), proposed by Real Parties in Interest EULAND

14 CAPITAL ENTERPRISES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ("Euland LP") and EULAND CAPITAL

15 ENTERPRISES, LLC ("Euland LLC") (Euland LP and Euland LLC are collectively referred to

16 herein as "Euland"). Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project sought to construct 71

17 residential units facilitated by, in part, excavating and then relocating roughly 350,000 cubic yards

18 of cut-and-fill earth movement on the Proposed Project Site - which is a large, steep slope of

19 highly expansive soil displaced by one or more endemic landslides - to create a series of elevated a

20 building pads for the clustered units surrounded by extensive retaining walls up to 26° tall.

21 2. Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project was yet another ill-conceived

22 attempt to develop the Proposed Project Site for residential purposes since the 1960s when an

23 approved 35 lot single family hillside subdivision was abandoned and subsequent attempts to

24 develop the Proposed Project Site failed due to the discovery of sweeping geotechnical hazards,

25 including, one or more landslides and highly expansive soil on the site, and the County of

26 Orange's adoption of more stringent grading regulations, thereby rendering development

27 dangerous and infeasible. Upon information and belief, given the characteristics of the Proposed

28 Project Site, including, in part, the grade, soil composition, and the replete history of geotechnical

1l

F hazards thereon, development of the Proposed Project Site in a conventional manner is not

2 possible.

3 3. As the homeowner association surrounding most of the Proposed Project site,

4 including, in part, the ridgeline directly above the Proposed Project site, and separately, the sole

u means of ingress to and egress from the Proposed Project, the Association had, and continues to

6 have, grave concerns about the myriad public and private risks associated with the Proposed

7 Project. Those concerns were ubiquitously communicated to the City and Euland through years of

8 participation in every workshop, community meeting, and public hearing concerning the Proposed

9 Project, in addition to numerous private meetings with the City and/or Euland about the same.

10 4. A most irregular process ensued once the Proposed Project proceeded to required

11 environmental review and public hearings before the Planning Commission and the City Council

12 concerning requisite discretionary entitlements. Upon information and belief, that process spanned

13 over 3 years due to mistakes made by the City, corrective actions by the City after public

14 condemnation of its attempt to fast-track the Proposed Project without adequate environmental

15 review, and the eventual capricious severing of portions of Euland's application for the Proposed

16 Project for piecemeal consideration, thereby creating a moving target, suppressing opposition to

17 the Proposed Project, creating such confusion that the City Council did not understand the

18 meaning or significance of its action, eliminating the City Council's consideration of the

19 Association's administrative appeal concerning the Proposed Project as a whole thereby
20 artificially delaying finality, and gaming statutory limitation periods to exclude the Association's

21 ability to seek rapid legal redress of the City's unlawful conduct.

22 5. Upon information and belief, the City's irregular and deficient procedure from the

23 outset of the Proposed Project's consideration necessitated the filing of an administrative appeal
24 by the Association. That appeal was not adjudicated by the City Council in a manner consistent

25 with California law, thereby vitiating all actions taken by the City with respect to the Proposed

26 Project. Those various actions include, in part, the City Council's purported certification of an
27 Environmental Impact Report for the Proposed Project in the absence of any approved project and

28 without due consideration for the Association's public comments and administrative appeal and

r the subsequent approval of a General Plan Amendment without conducting requisite

2 environmental review and again without due consideration to the Association's public comments.

3 These actions, along with the other conduct described herein, are contrary to California law,

4 including, in part, Code of Civil Procedure ("Code of Civ. Proc.") sections 1094.5 and 1085, the

5 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code (*Pub. Res. Code")

6 section 21000 et seq., including, in part, Pub. Res. Code section 21168.5, and the Ralph M. Brown

7 Act ("Brown Act"), Government Code ("Gov. Code") sections 54950 et seq., and the Association

8 seeks appropriate relief thereunder to protect the interests of itself, its members, the residents of its

9 community, and the general public.

10 THE PARTIES AND STANDING

11 6. The Association is, and at all times relevant herein was, a California nonprofit

12 mutual benefit corporation, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of

13 California, composed of owners of certain real property and the residential units and common area

14 improvements thereon located in the City of Laguna Niguel, County of Orange, State of California

15 ("Colinas Community"). Upon information and belief, the Colinas Community contains 923 single

16 family homes and condominiums with over 3,000 residents in neighborhoods generally located off

17 Paseo de Colinas.

18 7. The Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community are

19 directly and beneficially interested in the Proposed Project, and the City's adherence to relevant

20 law in considering the Proposed Project, as the Colinas Community surrounds the Proposed

21 Project Site continuously from the southwest to the northeast, including all homes along the

22 ridgeline contiguous with the westerly border of the Proposed Project Site and all homes

23 contiguous with the northerly border of the Proposed Project Site. Further, the sole means of

24 ingress to and egress from the Proposed Project Site is from Avenida Del Caballo, a street wholly

25 within the Colinas Community. The neighborhood which includes, in part, the homes on the

26 ridgeline above the westerly border of the Proposed Project Site is called "Westridge Estates." The

27 neighborhood which contains, in part, Avenida Del Caballo is called "Country View Estates." The

28 neighborhoods comprising the Colinas Community as depicted as the color-shaded areas in the

1 this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will also confer a substantial benefit

2 on the public at large by compelling Respondents to comply with California law in executing their

3 public functions. The Association's pursuit of this action permits it, its members, the residents of

4 the Colinas Community, and the general public to enforce important public rights and further

5 enforce the public duty of Respondents to comply with California law. Without the Association's

6 pursuit of this action, these rights and duties might otherwise go unenforced because other people

7 directly interested in enforcement of the public rights and duties do not have the resources, ability

8 or motivation to bring an action holding Respondents accountable for their violations of California

9 law.

10 9. In accordance with its Master Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and

11 Restrictions and Reservation of Easements for Colinas de Capistrano, recorded on September 1,

12 1982 and the First Amendment to and Restatement of Master Declaration of Covenants,

13 Conditions and Restrictions and Reservation of Easements for Colinas de Capistrano Community

14 Association, recorded on July 9, 2001, the Association has the right and duty, in part, to protect

15 the interests of the Colinas Community and has the power necessary to carry out its rights and

16 obligations, including the right, duty, and power to contract for legal services to prosecute any

17 action affecting the Colinas Community, including bringing this Petition. The Board of Directors

18 of the Association has duly exercised such authority in bringing this Petition.

19 10. Upon information and belief, the City is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

20 municipal corporation located in the County of Orange, a general law city organized and existing

21 under the Constitution and laws of the State of California, the governmental entity under which

22 the City Council and the Planning Commission are organized and operate, and the governmental

23 entity, through the City Council and the Planning Commission, that has aggrieved the Association

24 by its conduct set forth in this Petition.

25 11. Upon information and belief, the City Council is, and at all times relevant herein

26 was, an elected body of the City with authority over certain aspects of Euland's application for the

27 Proposed Project and which took some of the conduct that has aggrieved the Association as set

28 forth in this Petition.

5 13. Upon information and belief, Euland LP is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

6 California limited partnership authorized to and doing business in the State of California,

7 including, in part, the County of Orange. Upon information and belief, as the applicant or co-

8 applicant of the Proposed Project, Euland LP is a real party in interest to this action.
9 14. Upon information and belief, Euland LLC is, and at all times relevant herein was, a

10 California limited liability company authorized to and doing business in the State of California,

14 otherwise, of Respondents and Defendants DOES through 20, inclusive, are unknown to the

15 Association, who therefore sues said Respondents and Defendants under such fictitious names.

16 The Association will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same

17 have been ascertained. Each of the Respondents and Defendants is the agent and/or employee of

18 the City, the City Council, and/or the Planning Commission, and each performed acts on which

19 this action is based within the course and scope of such party's agency and/or employment.

3 (a) and 395.5 as the acts and omissions complained of herein occurred, the property affected by
4 those acts is located, in the County of Orange.

5 STATEMENT OF FACTS

6 20. Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project Site consists of 19.5 acres

7 located at the southern terminus of Avenida Del Caballo, which serves as the sole vehicular access

8 point. Upon information and belief, the Proposed Project Site is a generally one large, steep slope

9 descending easterly towards Interstate 5 and is considered by the City to a be a "hillside" property.
10 The Proposed Project Site is bound on the north by the Country View Estates residential

11 development, which is part of the Association and the Colinas Community, on the east by

12 Mercedes Benz of Laguna Niguel, on the south by a slope that descends to Rancho Capistrano and

13 Saddleback Church, and on the west by the Westridge Estates residential development, which is

14 also part of the Association and the Colinas Community. Upon information and belief, the site

15 elevation on the Proposed Project Site ranges between 250 to 455 feet above mean sea level.

16 21. Upon information and belief, development of the Proposed Project Site has
17 uniformly failed since first attempted during the early 1960s. Upon information and belief, under

18 the jurisdiction of the County of Orange, a prior owner of the Proposed Project Site received

19 approval to subdivide and develop the Proposed Project Site with 35 single family homes on

20 separate lots. Upon information and belief, Tract 5241 was recorded in 1960 consistent with the

21 same. Upon information and belief, mass grading of the Proposed Project Site commenced in

22 1962. Upon information and belief, the same prior owner abandoned the development of approved
23 project shortly after commencing site improvements for unknown reasons.

24 22. Upon information and belief, the improvements on the Proposed Project Site have
25 largely remained the same since the prior owner abandoned the previously approved project

26 during the 1960s after completing rough grading, the installation of roads, and partial grading of

27 the 35 single family home lots. The Proposed Project Site presently appears as generally shown in

28 the following photograph:

14 23. Upon information and belief, subsequent attempts to develop the Proposed Project
15 Site failed following both the discovery during the 1970s of sweeping geotechnical hazards on the

16 Proposed Project Site, including, in part, one or more landslides which had never been remediated

17 and highly expansive soil, and the County of Orange's adoption of more stringent grading

18 regulations, the combination of the two rendered the development of the Proposed Project Site

19 dangerous and infeasible.

20 24. Upon information and belief, Euland acquired the Proposed Project Site on

21 November 18, 1993 from H & S Capital Enterprises II, a California Limited Partnership, knowing

22 and accepting that the attempts to develop the Proposed Project Site had failed for decades. Upon

23 information and belief, Euland is not a professional residential developer, and based upon public

24 records, consists of a husband and wife who conduct Euland-related business from their home in

25 Irvine.

26 25. Upon information and belief, undeterred by the decades of failure, Euland

27 presented the City with the Proposed Project during or around 2012. Upon information and belief,

28 the Proposed Project sought to change the previously approved plan for 35 large lot, single family

F homes to 71 small lot, single family homes by creating five terraced, elevated building pads

2 surrounded by retaining walls up to 26' tall following excavating and relocating roughly 350,000
cubic yards of cut-and-fill earth movement on the Proposed Project Site to remediate the one or 3

4 more historic landslides thereon.

5 26. Upon information and belief, due to, in part, the unorthodox means of construction

6 proposed and the characteristics of the Proposed Project Site, the City determined that Euland

7 required a litany of discretionary entitlements from the City, including, a General Plan

8 Amendment, a Zone Change, a Site Development Permit, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map, and a

9 Minor Adjustment, for Proposed Project to be potentially approved.

10 27. Upon information and belief, after years of apparent private meetings between

11 Euland and the City and before holding any public hearing concerning the Proposed Project or

12 circulating any of environmental review documents required by CEQA, the Planning Commission

13 held a workshop on January 26, 2016 to introduce the public to the Proposed Project and

14 disturbingly expressed support for the Proposed Project without the benefit of public comment or

15 consideration of the Proposed Project's environmental impacts as required by CEQA. Upon

16 information and belief, the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community
17 expressed myriad concerns with the Proposed Project during that workshop.

18 28. Upon information and belief, to commence environmental review of the Proposed

19 Project consistent with CEQA's mandates, the City prepared and circulated a Draft Initial Study a
20 ("IS") and proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND") on June 16, 2016. Upon
21 information and belief, public review and comment on the same occurred between June 16, 2016

22 and July 15, 2016. Upon information and belief, based upon the extensive public comments the

23 City received concerning the IS and MND, including, several hundred collective pages of
24 comments from the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community which

25 expressed profound concern with the Proposed Project due, in part, to the highly unconventional

26 nature of the Proposed Project and the characteristics of the Proposed Project Site and the City's

27 attempt to bypass required environmental review of the Proposed Project Site, the City did not

28 respond to the public comments it received and determined that it would change course and

1 require the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report and the adoption of a Mitigation

2 Monitoring and Reporting Program.

3 29. Upon information and belief, consistent with the same, the City prepared and
4 circulated a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for which the public comment period began on
5 October 20, 2016 and ended on November 30, 2016. Upon information and belief, during the

6 pendency of that public comment period, the City held a public scoping meeting concerning the
7 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report on November 9, 2016. Upon information and
8 belief, the Association, its members, and the residents of the Colinas Community participated and

9 commented with respect to the NOP and during scoping meeting setting forth their logical
10 concerns with the Proposed Project.

11 30. Upon information and belief, the City prepared and circulated a Draft

12 Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") concerning the Proposed Project in April 2017 for which
13 the public comment period began on April 27, 2017 and ended on June 12, 2017. The Association

14 submitted its public comments on the DEIR on June 12, 2017. Those public comments included

15 extensive comments specifically keyed to important portions of the DEIR alerting the City to

16 flawed assumptions, incomplete information, incomplete analysis, and other critical problems with

17 the proposed analysis of the Proposed Project's environmental impacts. The Association's public

18 comments also included a peer review completed by American Geotechnical of the

19 geotechnical/geologic and civil engineering reports relied upon in the DEIR which identified
20 extensive material deficiencies in the geotechnical, geologic, and hydrological analysis and

21 conclusions rendering the proposed environmental impact findings of the DEIR flawed and

22 unreliable.

23 31. Upon information and belief, after the close of public comments on the DEIR, the

24 City discovered that portions of the DEIR had been omitted from the City's website purporting to
25 contain a complete version of the DEIR. Attempting to remedy this error, the City recirculated the

26 omitted portions of the DEIR on July 7, 2017 for a public comment period began on July 7, 2017
27 and ended on August 7, 2017. In response to the same, the Association forwarded the City a letter
28 from American Geotechnical that the recirculated portions of the DEIR did not require any

F changes to its previously submitted peer review.

2 32. Upon information and belief, the City purported to have made a Final

3 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") available for public review on September 15, 2017, the

4 same day that the City published its Staff Report for a public hearing scheduled to occur on

5 September 26, 2017 before the Planning Commission with respect to Euland's request for a

6 General Plan Amendment (for which the Planning Commission was a recommending body to the
7 City Council), a Zone Change (for which the Planning Commission was a recommending body to

8 the City Council), a Site Development Permit (for which the Planning Commission was the final

9 decision making body unless appealed to the City Council), a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (for
10 which the Planning Commission was the final decision making body unless appealed to the City

11 Council), a Minor Adjustment (for which the Planning Commission was the final decision making
12 body unless appealed to the City Council), and certification of the EIR for the Proposed Project
13 (for which both the Planning Commission and the City Council were final decision making

14 bodies) (collectively the "Planning Commission Entitlements").

15 33. Upon information and belief, while the EIR purported to provide substantive

16 itemized responses to the public comments received concerning the DEIR, significant and material

17 portions of the Association's public comments were either simply not referred to at all or were
18 responded to in a cursory non-substantive manner in no manner evidencing that the City had given

19 due consideration to the Association's comments. The Association has unable to timely appreciate
20 this deficiency as the City failed to timely provide the Association a copy of EIR as required by

21 section 15088, subdivision (b) of the Guidelines for Implementation of the California

22 Environmental Quality Act, 14 California Code of Regulations, sections 15000 et seq.

23 ("Guidelines") and as requested by the Association in its public comment letter about the DEIR.

24 34. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

25 appeared at the Planning Commission's public hearing on September 26, 2017 and spoke in
26 opposition to the Planning Commission Entitlements based upon myriad procedural irregularities
27 to date which barred the Planning Commission's lawful consideration of the Planning

28 Commission Entitlements and vast substantive concerns with the Proposed Project, largely

] surrounding the deficient consideration of the Proposed Project's significant environmental

2 impacts and the inadequacy of the mitigation measures to reduce the admitted significant

3 environmental impacts of the Proposed Project to a less than significant basis. Upon information

4 and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments submitted in

5 opposition to the Proposed Project and contrary to the administrative record before it, the Planning

6 Commission approved the Planning Commission Entitlements through Resolution Nos. 17-08, 17-

7 09, 17-10, 17-11, and 17-12 (collectively the "Planning Commission Entitlements Approval").

8 35. Consistent with the appeal period and required content for an appeal as specified in

9 the City's Municipal Code (*Municipal Code"), the Association filed with the City a timely and

10 compliant appeal of the Planning Commission Entitlement Approval to the City Council on

11 October 6, 2017 ("Appeal"). The Association identified a variety of bases for the Appeal based

12 upon the Planning Commission's numerous and separate violations of CEQA and the Guidelines,

13 the Planning Commission's numerous and separate violations of the Brown Act, and the Planning

14 Commission's numerous and separate violations of Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5 (including,

15 acting without or excess of its jurisdiction, failing to provide a fair and impartial public hearing,

16 and prejudicially abusing its discretion). The Association submitted evidentiary support for the

17 bases articulated supporting the Appeal.

18 36. A public hearing before the City Council concerning the Appeal and Euland's

19 request for a General Plan Amendment (for which the City Council was the final decision making

20 body), a Zone Change (for which the City Council was the final decision making body), a Site

21 Development Permit (for which the City Council was the final decision making body due to the

22 Appeal), a Vesting Tentative Tract Map (for which the City Council was the final decision making

23 body due to the Appeal), a Minor Adjustment (for which the City Council was the final decision

24 making body due to the Appeal), and certification of the EIR for the Proposed Project (for which

25 the City Council was the final decision making body due to the Appeal) (collectively the "City

26 Council Entitlements") was scheduled to occur on November 7, 2017. The City Council continued

27 the November 7, 2017 public hearing concerning the Appeal and the City Council Entitlements

28 without any substantive consideration of the same to December 5, 2017.

2 The City Council continued the December 5, 2017 public hearing concerning the

3 Appeal and the City Council Entitlements without any substantive consideration of the same to
January 16, 2018.

4 38.

5 The City Council tabled the January 16, 2018 public hearing concerning the Appeal

6 and the City Council Entitlements without any substantive consideration of the same to a date
uncertain, which was later noticed for April 17, 2018.

7 39.

8 A continued public hearing before the City Council concerning the Appeal and the

9 City Council Entitlements occurred on April 17, 2018. Upon information and belief, following

10 public comments, the City Council continued the hearing to June 5, 2018 without substantive

11 consideration of the Appeal or the City Council Entitlements and directed the City's Staff and

12 Euland to hold a community outreach workshop concerning the Proposed Project before then

13 given, in part, the ongoing public opposition to the Proposed Project and Euland's change of the

14 Proposed Project by reducing the number of residential units from 71 to 60 by increasing the lot
sizes and

15 square footage of the units while maintaining the other aspects of the Proposed Project.
The community outreach workshop occurred on May 10, 2018.

16 40.

17 Upon information and belief, a continued public hearing before the City Council

18 concerning the Appeal and the City Council Entitlements occurred on June 5, 2018. Upon

19 information and belief, the City's Staff recommended at the continued public hearing and in its

20 Staff Report for the same that the City Council certify the EIR, approve the requested General
Plan Amendment and Zone Change to allow development for up

21 to 60 residential units and to

22 refer the remaining entitlements with directions to the Planning Commission. Upon information

23 and belief, the City's Staff made no mention of or reference to the Appeal. Upon information and

24 belief, following public comment, which was uniformly opposed to the Proposed Project, the City

25 Council deliberated and concluded that it would not approve the Proposed Project and no

26 Councilmember made a motion with respect to Euland's request for a General Plan Amendment, a

27 Zone Change, a Site Development Permit, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map or a Minor Adjustment

28 for the Proposed Project. Upon information and belief, similarly, no Councilmember made a
motion with respect to the Appeal. Upon information and belief, a question then arose whether the

certification of the EIR should be entertained. Upon information and belief, after none of the

2 Councilmembers were initially willing a to make such a motion, one of the Councilmembers asked

3 the City Attorney for clarification about what such a motion would do, to which the City Attorney
4 responded, in part, with assurance that the certification of the EIR "was not the approval of the
5 project or any aspect of it." Upon information and belief, with the understanding the certification

6 of the EIR was not approving any project, and with the City Attorney's further assurance that the

7 certification could only potentially support a future hypothetical 35 unit residential project, the

8 same number of units originally approved for the Proposed Project Site and which the City

9 Council indicated during deliberations it believed was still appropriate for the Proposed Project

10 Site, the City Council passed a motion to certify the EIR and adopt the associated mitigation

11 monitoring and reporting program through Resolution No. 2018-1257. Upon information and

12 belief, the corresponding resolution purportedly memorializing the City Council's motion did not

13 reflect the City Council's deliberation, intention, understanding, representations, conditions, and

14 other expressed perimeters and contained content contrary to the same. Upon information and

15 belief, no mention, discussion, deliberation, adjudication or consideration as to the Appeal,

16 including, in part, any of the CEQA-based challenges therein, occurred anytime during the June 5,

17 2018 public hearing.

18 41. The City Council's failure to adjudicate the Appeal eliminated the Association's

19 ability to challenge the legality of the City Council's EIR certification prior to this Petition due to,
20 in part, the City's prevention of the Association's ability to exhaust its administrative remedies

21 and/or a lack of finality.

22 42. Six months later the Association unexpectedly received a Notice of Public Meeting
23 on January 4, 2019 concerning a public hearing before the Planning Commission on January 22,
24 2019 to provide recommendations to the City Council with respect to Euland's request for "City

25 approval of a General Plan Amendment to increase the maximum number of permitted single-

26 family detached residential dwelling units for the project site from 35 to 53 dwelling units (a

27 reduction from the initial request for 71 dwelling units)" ("Revised General Plan Amendment").
28 The same Notice further noted that "[a]ny grading of the site as part of a future development

F project would continue to be balanced on-site, thereby avoiding the heavy truck traffic necessary

2 to facilitate soil import/export." Upon information and belief, contrary to the understanding,

3 assumptions, representations, and intentions of the City Council in certifying the EIR, principally

4 that by certifying the EIR it was not approving the Proposed Project or any aspect of it, the same

5 Notice indicated that:

6 "On June 5, 2018, the City Council certified Environmental Impact Report EIR

7 17-01 (SCH No. 2016061037) which establishes parameters for development of

8 the project site in such a manner as to avoid significant environmental impacts.

o The requested General Plan Amendment would not result in new significant

10 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously

11 identified effects. Therefore modification of the Certified EIR is not required in

12 conjunction with review of the request General Plan Amendment."

13 43. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

14 appeared at the Planning Commission's public hearing on January 22, 2019 and spoke in

15 opposition to the Planning Commission recommending that the City Council approve the Revised

16 General Plan Amendment since, in part, (a) the Appeal was still outstanding and required

17 adjudication by the City Council before any potential entitlements for a proposed residential

18 development on the Proposed Project Site could be lawfully considered; (b) the City Council had

19 certified the EIR to only facilitate a potential 35 unit residential project, not a 53 unit residential

20 project, (c) Euland had purposefully and inappropriately severed but one of the many discretionary

21 entitlements required for any residential development on the Proposed Project Site in order to

22 suppress and subvert public opposition, create ambiguity and confusion, and mislead the City and

23 public, and (d) since Euland had not provided reasonable and sufficient tangible information about

24 its proposed revised project for the Proposed Project Site, the public could not meaningful

25 participate in providing comments on the Revised General Plan Amendment, there was no basis

26 for the City Council to potentially conclude that the Revised General Plan Amendment would be

27 consistent with the EIR, the City Council's consideration of the Revised General Plan Amendment

28 would require recirculation of the EIR, there was no basis for the City Council to conclude that the

F Revised General Plan Amendment would be consistent with the City's General Plan. The

2 Association submitted a 9-page public comment letter, in part, detailing the foregoing. Upon

3 information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments submitted

4 in opposition to the Planning Commission potential recommending that the City Council approve

5 the Revised General Plan Amendment and contrary to the administrative record before it, the

6 Planning Commission passed a motion recommending to the City Council that it approve the

7 Revised General Plan Amendment. Upon information and belief, no resolution accompanied or

8 memorialized the foregoing Planning Commission motion.

9 44. On February 1, 2019, the City published a Notice of Public Hearing concerning a

10 public hearing before the City Council on February 19, 2019 to consider the Appeal, the Revised

11 General Plan Amendment, and the associated discretionary entitlements previously requested with

12 respect to the Proposed Project. The Notice specifically acknowledged that the Appeal was still

13 outstanding and required adjudication.

14 45. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the Colinas Community

15 appeared at the City Council's public hearing on February 19, 2019. The Association spoke in

16 support of the merits of the Appeal. The Association, members thereof, and the residents of the

17 Colinas Community spoke in opposition to the Revised General Plan Amendment. The bases for

18 that opposition largely mirrored the comments made before the Planning Commission as neither

19 Euland nor the City had cured the numerous deficiencies identified by the Association and the

20 public before the Planning Commission. The Association submitted a 14-page public comment

21 letter, in part, detailing the foregoing. The City's Mayor denied the Association's request for more

22 than 3 minutes to address the City Council which the Association submitted was reasonable and

23 necessary since two separate matters were being considered by the City Council (i.e., the Appeal

24 and the Revised General Plan Amendment) and since the public hearing was an evidentiary

25 hearing concerning the Appeal, the Association was entitled to sufficient time to meaningfully

26 support the Appeal, which was infeasible through the 3 minutes afforded to the public by default.

27 Upon information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the public comments

28 submitted in opposition to the Revised General Plan Amendment and contrary to the

1 administrative record before it, the City Council approved the Revised General Plan Amendment

2 through Resolution No. 2019-1276 ("Resolution").

3 46. Upon information and belief, without due or reasonable consideration of the
t evidence and arguments submitted by the Association in support of the Appeal and contrary to the
administrative record before it, the City Council apparently intended to deny the Appeal through
6 the Resolution; however, in fact, it yet again failed to take conclusive final action concerning the

7 same, in violation of, in part, California law and Section 9-1-112.2, Subdivision (f) of the

8 Municipal Code. Upon information and belief, the City Council's deliberation during the February

9 19, 2019 public hearing included no mention, discussion, deliberation, adjudication, or

10 consideration as to the Appeal. Upon information and belief, consistent with the City Council's

11 lack of any meaningful, substantive consideration of the Appeal, the Resolution contains a cursory

12 sentence indicating that: "[T]he appeal grounds [for the Appeal] provided lack sufficient facts,

13 detail, and analytical rationale to support the Appellant's [the Association] claims." Upon

14 information and belief, the Resolution fails to address any of the discrete bases for the Appeal in
any meaningful, substantive manner, thereby failing to bridge the analytic gap between the 15

16 administrative record and the City Council's apparent intent to deny the Appeal, the Resolution

17 contains numerous factual assertions facially contradicted by the administrative record, and the

18 Resolution in no manner reflects the City Council's deliberations during the February 19, 2019

19 public hearing. Upon information and belief, the Resolution does not state what specific action, if

20 any, the City Council took with respect to the Appeal contrary to the requirements of, in part,
21 section 9-1-112.2, Subdivision (f) of the Municipal Code which provides that the City Council

22 "shall consider the appeal and take one of the following actions: a. Take action to sustain, reverse

23 or modify the original decision b. Continue the appeal for further consideration. c. Refer the

24 application back to the original decision-making authority with directions."

25 47. The Resolution also, in part, provides:

26 "For purposes of determining compliance with the Permit Streamlining Act, any

27 future project submittals (excluding any which contain a proposed entitlement

28 requiring a legislative land use design) shall be deemed a *development project'

N 0 7 . as defined in Government Code Section 65928 and processed in accordance with
applicable time limits, which such time limits shall commence upon City receipt
of revised project materials."

48. Upon information and belief, Euland has neither invoked the Permit Streamlining
Act nor provided the public a notice that is a condition precedent to the potential application of the
6 Permit Streamlining Act and thus the City Council could not lawfully deem any prospective
7 proposed development at the Proposed Project Site as a "development project" subject to the

8 Permit Streamlining Act. Upon information and belief, the foregoing is yet another example of the

9 City taking untoward liberties to facilitate the development of the Proposed Project Site contrary

10 to law and the rights of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

11 the public.

12 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

13 49. The Association has exhausted all available and non-futile administrative remedies

14 required to be pursued by it under the law and the factual circumstances underlying this action.

15 50. Respondents have, and at all relevant times had, a mandatory duty to exercise their
16 powers in accordance with the law. By engaging in the conduct described in this Petition,

17 Respondents respectively breached this mandatory duty. The Association is informed and

18 believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents will not fulfill their mandatory duties without a

19 court order.

20 51. The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

21 of law, other than the relief sought in this Petition, that will remedy the Respondents' violations of

22 law described in this Petition and to prevent the Respondents from acting outside their legal

23 authority.

24 52. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the

25 public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted.

26 53. The Association has a direct and beneficial interest in the outcome of this action

27 and has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition. The maintenance and
28 prosecution of this action will further confer a substantial benefit on the public by compelling

1 Respondents to comply with California law in executing their public functions. The Association's

2 pursuit of this action permits its individual members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

3 the public throughout the County of Orange to enforce important public rights and further enforce

4 the public duty of Respondents to comply with California law. Without the Association's pursuit

5 of this action, these rights and duties might otherwise go unenforced because other persons

6 directly interested in enforcement of the public rights and duties do not have the resources, ability

7 or motivation to bring an enforcement action.

8 54. The Association seeks through this action to enforce important rights affect the

9 public interest and which confer a significant benefit on the public by ensuring that Respondents

10 comply with California law. The Association has incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial

11 expense in attorneys' fees and costs pursuing this matter. There is no monetary recovery sought or

12 allowed in this action that would be available to offset the expense incurred by the Association in

13 pursuing this action for public benefit. As such, the Association is entitled to recover an award of

14 attorneys' fees from Respondents, individually or collectively, pursuant to Code of Civ. Proc.

15 section 1021.5 and/or Gov. Code section 800.

16 55. The Association has requested that the City prepare a true copy of the
17 administrative record relating to the relevant underlying administrative proceeding pursuant to

18 Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.6, subdivision (c). The Association will lodge a copy of the

19 administrative record with this Court at an appropriate time pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. section

20 1094.5, subdivision (a).

675 Anion Blvd., Sulte 1080 WRIT OF TRADITIONAL MANDAMUS, PEREMTPORY MANDAMUS OR PROHIBITION; COMPLAINT Metro Center Costa Mesa, Callfornia $2626 FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 72. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the

2 public have been deprived of important rights and liberties and have otherwise been prejudicially

3 aggrieved, damaged, and injured, by Respondents' failure to base its conclusions on sufficient

4 findings in one or more of the Challenged Resolutions which violated, without limitation: (a) the
5 right of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public to

6 a have a reviewing court be able to reasonably assess whether the City Council and/or the Planning
7 Commission properly considered the oral and written testimony and evidence presented by or on

8 behalf of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public,

9 and more generally, the record as a whole, during the Proposed Project Administrative
10 Proceedings and in reaching, considering, deliberating, adjudicating, and adopting each of the

11 Challenged Resolutions, (b) the right of the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas

12 Community, and the public to have a reviewing court be unable to understand what evidence in

13 the record from the Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings upon which each of the

14 Challenged Resolutions is based, and (c) the right of the Association, its members, the residents of

15 the Colinas Community, and the public to be able to determine whether and on what basis to seek
16 judicial review of one or more of the Challenged Resolutions. Respondents' failure to provide

17 sufficient findings therefore constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

18 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (The Underlying Resolutions are not Supported by Legally Sufficient Evidence - Code of
21 Civil Procedure § 1094.5)
22 73. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all

23 preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

24 74. Respondents were required to base the Challenged Resolutions upon the testimony
25 and evidence provided during the Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings in accordance

26 with the requirements of applicable law.

27 75. The Court is required to exercise is "independent judgment" to determine whether

28 each of the Challenged Resolutions' findings are supported by evidence since the Challenged

1 Resolution involve and substantially affect the fundamental, vested rights of the Association, its

2 members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public.

3 76. One or more of the Challenged Resolutions are not supported by legally sufficient
4 evidence causing one or more of the Challenged Resolutions to be unlawful and invalid under
5 Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5 for the reasons, in part, alleged herein.
6 77. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the

7 public have been deprived of important rights and liberties and have otherwise been prejudicially

8 aggrieved, damaged, and injured, by Respondents' erroneous and unlawful approval of one or

9 more of the Challenged Resolutions without support of evidence from the Proposed Project
10 Administrative Proceedings. Respondents' approval of the Challenged Resolutions therefore

11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

12 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.
13 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Respondents Acted Arbitrarily and Capriciously in Conducting the Underlying

15 Administrative Proceedings and in Approving the Underlying Resolutions - Code of Civil

16 Procedure § 1085)

17 78. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all

18 preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

19 79. In the event that this Court determines that the Association is not entitled to relief

20 under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1094.5, the Association pleads in the alternative that it is entitled

21 to relief under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1085 in that the acts and omissions of Respondents

22 concerning, relating to, and/or arising from the Proposed Project were arbitrary, capricious, and

23 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, failed to follow procedures and give the notices required

24 by law, and/or we beyond and outside Respondents' jurisdiction and authority, which have caused

25 the Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and the public to be

26 deprived of important rights and liberties and otherwise be prejudicially aggrieved, damaged, and

27 injured.

28 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

- SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Respondents' Approval of the Challenged Resolutions Violated the California
w +10 Environmental Quality Act - Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
80. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

6 81. CEQA requires that public agencies, in part, consider and document the

7 environmental implications of their actions. CEQA's main objectives are to fully inform the public

8 and decision-makers of the significant adverse environmental effects of projects and develop ways

9 to avoid or reduce such effects by requiring implementation of feasible alternative and mitigation

10 measures.

11 82. CEQA's mandate is required to be "interpreted in such a manner as to afford the

12 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

13 language." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 563-564.)

14 Any approving agency's action violates CEQA if it "thwarts the statutory goals" of "informed
15 decisionmaking" and "informed public participation." (Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of

16 Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712.)

17 83. As acknowledged in the EIR, since the approval of the Proposed Project, and any

18 part thereof, would have the potential to cause either a direct, or reasonably foreseeable indirect,

19 physical change in the environment, such action constitutes "approval" of a "discretionary project"

20 as defined by CEQA and in the Guidelines. Accordingly, at all times relevant herein, Respondents

21 were charged a with a duty to, in part, fully and accurately consider the environmental consequences

22 of any approvals for, related to or facilitating the Proposed Project through preparation of an EIR

23 that complied with CEQA, to fully disclose, consider, and adopt feasible mitigation measures and
24 alternatives that would reduce or eliminated significant environmental impacts and to make lawful

25 findings that supported the decisions made and were supported by substantial evidence in the

26 administrative record.

27 84. In certifying the EIR, Respondents violated CEQA and the Guidelines, in part, in

28 each of the following manners:

Cosia Mesa, California 92626 FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- N0 T000 ∞O a. Respondents failed to timely provide a copy of the EIR to the Association after a
the Association had requested the same, which Respondents acknowledged, in
violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089;
b. Respondents failed to timely make the EIR readily accessible for public review
in violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089;
c. Respondents failed to properly evaluate and respond to the Association's public
comments on the DEIR in violation of, in part, Guidelines sections 15088 and
15088.5; and
d. Respondents failed to timely provide the Association with Respondents'

10 responses to the Association's public comments on the DEIR in violation of, in

11 part, Guidelines sections 15087, 15088, 15088.5, and 15089.

12 85. At all times relevant herein, Respondents were charged with a duty under CEQA
13 to, in part, prepare a recirculated, subsequent or supplemental EIR where substantial evidence in

14 the record showed one or more of the following:

15 a. Substantial changes are proposed in the Project which will require major
16 revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of

17 new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of

18 the previously identified significant effects;

19 b. Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

20 Project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or
21 negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental
22 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
23 significant effects; or

24 c. New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could

25 not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the
26 previous EIR was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted,

27 shows any of the following:

28 i. The Project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in

the previous EIR or negative declaration;
N m $n0 N ii. Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more
severe than shown in the previous EIR;
iii. Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible
would in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more
significant effects of the Project, but the Project proponents decline to
adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or

8 iv. Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different
O from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one

10 or more significant effects on the environment, but the Project

11 proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

12 86. Respondents violated CEQA and the Guidelines by approving the Resolution
13 without preparing a recirculated, subsequent or supplemental EIR analyzing the Revised General

14 Plan Amendment despite the overwhelming evidence in the record of changes in the Proposed

15 Project, changes in circumstances surrounding the Proposed Project, and new information that
16 revealed significant new impacts and a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified

17 impacts.

18 87. Respondents' failure to conform its conduct to the requirements of CEQA and the

19 Guidelines as, in part, described above, a constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to

20 proceed in a manner required by applicable law. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

21 88. The Association complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code section 21167.5

22 by providing Respondents with written notice of this action prior to filing the lawsuit.

23 89. The Association timely served the Attorney General of the State of California with
24 a copy of its Petition along with a notice of its filing pursuant to Pub. Res. Code section 21167.7

25 and Code of Civ. Proc. section 388, a true copy of which notice and proof of service is attached

26 hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein in full by this reference.

EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Respondents Violated the Ralph M. Brown Act by and through the Underlying
m + 4 Administrative Proceedings - Government Code § 54950 et seq.)

90. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

6 91. The Brown Act requires that an overwhelming majority of decisions made by

7 public agencies be made in public after providing the public with compliant notice of the proposed

8 actions and an opportunity to be heard on the proposed actions. The purpose of the Brown Act is
9 to facilitate public participation in governmental decision-making by ensuring that the deliberative

10 process by which decisions impacting the public are made before the public and with

11 transparency. The Gov. Code contains similar requirements concerning the timing and content of

12 mandatory public notices for meaningful land use decisions. (See, e.g., Gov. Code §§ 65090,

13 65091, and 65353.)

14 92. The Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings, and the actions resulting

15 therefrom, including, in part, the Challenged Resolutions were subject to the Brown Act, its
16 incumbent requirements, and other Gov. Code provisions requiring certain timing and content of

17 mandatory public notices for meaningful land use decisions (c.g., Gov. Code §§ 65090, 65091,

18 and 65353). Respondents violated those requirements, in part, in each of the following respects:

19 a. The City and the Planning Commission failed to provide timely and

20 substantively compliant notice for the Planning Commission's public hearing
21 on September 26, 2017;
22 b. The Planning Commission inappropriately received and considered new
23 materials provided by the City's Staff that had not been disclosed and were not

24 part of the agenda for the Planning Commission's public hearing on September
25 26, 2017; and

26 C. Respondents failed to make the EIR readily accessible for timely public review.

27 93. The Association initiated the Appeal on October 6, 2017 which identified each of

28 the above-alleged violations of the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code statutory requirements

thereby fulfilling, to the extent applicable, the requirements of Gov. Code section 54960.2. The

2 Association is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents failed to timely

3 remedy the Brown Act and other similar Gov. Code violations alleged herein. Accordingly, the

4 Association is authorized to assert this claim.

5 94. Respondents' violations of the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code statutory

6 requirements were not technical or trivial in nature, but instead materially and substantially

7 impeded the mandate of the Brown Act and the Gov. Code to facilitate public participation in

8 decision-making.

9 95. Since Respondents failed to timely remedy the Brown Act and similar Gov. Code

10 statutory requirements alleged above, the Association is entitled to recover its reasonable

11 attorneys' fees and costs incurred pursuant to Gov. Code section 54960.5.

12 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.
13 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 527)

15 96. The Association incorporates and re-alleges, as though fully set forth herein, all
16 preceding paragraphs, inclusive.

17 97. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the Association and

18 Respondents concerning their respective rights and duties with respect to the Proposed Project, the
19 Proposed Project Administrative Proceedings, and the Challenged Resolutions. The Association is
20 therefore entitled to a judicial declaration of the parties' rights and duties with respect to the same

21 under Code of Civ. Proc. section 1060.

22 98. The Association contends that Respondents have not proceeded in accordance with

23 the law and has prejudicially abused its discretion by and through, in part, the conduct described in

24 this Petition with respect to the Proposed Project, the Proposed Project Administrative

25 Proceedings, and the Challenged Resolutions. The Association contends, in part, that such conduct

26 violates the Code of Civ. Proc., the Gov. Code, and the Pub. Res. Code as set forth above.

27 Accordingly, the Challenged Resolutions are subject to being set aside by this Court.

28 99. The Association is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents

1 deny the Association's contentions.

2 100. The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law other than this

3 proceeding to compel Respondents to comply with their incumbent legal obligations and remedy
+1 the conduct and actions of Respondents to date in contravention of their legal obligations as set
forth, in part, herein. The Association, its members, the residents of the Colinas Community, and

6 the public have a clear, present, and beneficial right to and interest in the proper performance by

7 Respondents of their mandatory duties under the law. Unless and until the Respondents are

8 enjoined from continued violations of the law by order of this Court under, in part, Code of Civ.

9 Proc. section 527, the Association, its members, residents of the Colinas Community, and the

10 public will suffer great and irreparable injury.

11 101. The issuance of a temporary stay order and temporary restraining order and

12 preliminary injunction in this case is in the public interest and is otherwise necessary and

13 appropriate pursuant to, in part, Code of Civ. Proc. Section 1094.5 to stay the effectiveness of the

14 Challenged Resolutions because, in the absence of injunctive relief, Respondents will proceed

15 forward approving further discretionary entitlements required for the Proposed Project or some
16 variation thereof to proceed in reliance upon Respondents' unlawful conduct which is the subject

17 of this Petition thereby potentially rendering this Petition moot and/or causing irreparable damage

18 upon the commencement of construction activities on the Proposed Project Site, pending trial on

19 the merits.

20 102. Unless and until Respondents are enjoined and restrained and a temporary stay

21 order is issued as herein requested, the Association, its members, residents, and the public will

22 suffer irreparable injury due to, in part, the irrevocable commitment to a project with significant

23 effects on the environment prior to the completion of environmental review in a manner required

24 by CEQA, thereby foreclosing the consideration of appropriate alternatives and mitigation

25 measures to address the environmental concerns raised to date by the Association, its members,

26 residents of the Colinas Community, and the public, none of which can be fully cured after the fact

27 and none of which can be adequately compensated by monetary damages.

28 103. If a temporary stay order and temporary restraining order and preliminary

1 injunction are issued as requested herein, Respondents will not suffer any irreparable injury or

2 harm in that they have known the objections raised to date by the Association, its members,

3 residents of the Colinas Community, and the public and have determined nonetheless to proceed

4 with full knowledge and acceptance of the incumbent risks of such action and Respondents have a
5 nominal, if any, interest in the completion of the Proposed Project such that any temporary delay

6 thereto attributable to this Court's issuance of a temporary restraining order and preliminary would

7 be inconsequential and capable of being fully cured after the fact. Accordingly, the balance of

8 hardships is in favor of issuing the stay order or temporary restraining order and preliminary

9 injunction as requested herein.

10 104. The Association seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the foregoing,

11 continued harm and to protect the Association, its members, residents of the Colinas Community,

12 and the public from Respondent's unlawful conduct.

13 WHEREFORE, the Association prays for relief as set forth below.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, the Association respectfully requests relief and prays for entry of
16 judgment as follows:

17 With respect to the First Cause of Action, the Second Cause of Action, the Third Cause of

18 Action, the Fourth Cause of Action, and the Fifth Cause of Action in this Petition:
