1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the decision of San Diego County and its Board of
3 Supervisors ("Respondents") to approve the Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19

4 project ("Project") and certify an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. The

5 Project includes, but is not limited to, a General Plan Amendment, Specific Plan, Zone
6 Reclassification, and a Tentative Map for a "master-planned community" on approximately
7 1,283.6 acres in the Proctor Valley region of the unincorporated County.

8 2. Petitioners CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, PRESERVE WILD
9 SANTEE, and the CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL INSTITUTE (collectively "Petitioners")

10 demonstrated throughout the administrative process that the Project will have significant
11 negative environmental impacts on, among other things, biological resources (including special
12 status species), air quality, greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), water supplies, water quality, fire
13 safety, energy consumption, aesthetics, traffic, and land use. Yet Respondents failed to disclose
14 or adequately analyze these impacts, identify and adopt effective mitigation measures to reduce
15 them, and consider reasonable alternatives to the Project. The Project is also inconsistent with
16 the County's General Plan in numerous respects. For example, the County impermissibly allows
17 for the purchase of "offsets" from outside the County to purportedly mitigate the Project's
18 significant GHG emissions. Respondents' environmental review and approval of the Project
19 therefore violates the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA"), Public Resources Code
20 sections 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs sections 15000 et seq. and
21 the State Planning and Zoning Law, Gov. Code § 65300 et seq.
22 3. For these reasons, and as described further below, the County's approval of the
23 Project and certification of the EIR constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

24 THE PARTIES

25 4. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a non-
26 profit conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats
27 through science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 70,000 members
28
1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

- worldwide, including members who reside within communities in the vicinity of the Project.
2 The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air
3 and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated San Diego County
4 where the Project is proposed. Members of the Center objected to the approval and construction

5

6 of the Project and will be directly and adversely affected by the Project.
5. Petitioner PRESERVE WILD SANTEE (*PWS") Santee is a volunteer
7 community environmental organization that has worked to protect and enhance the quality of
8 life and preserve natural resources in the City of Santee and adjoining areas since 1994. Preserve
9 Wild Santee's members offer input into local land use decisions in an effort to produce better
10 development projects with fewer environmental and fire safety impacts.
11 6. Petitioner CALIFORNIA CHAPARRAL INSTITUTE ("CCI") is a 501(c)(3)
12 nonprofit education, research, and advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of native
13 shrubland habitats throughout the West and supporting the creative spirit as inspired by nature.
14 7. Members of the Center, PWS, and CCI have environmental, educational,
15 recreational, scientific, and aesthetic interests in the Project area and its plants and wildlife.
16 These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions
17 of law as set forth in this Petition and which would cause irreversible harm to the natural
18 environment and its recreational, scientific, and aesthetic assets. The Petitioners and their
19 members have a direct and beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA
20 and the CEQA Guidelines. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
21 substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other
22| harms alleged herein.
23 8. Respondent SAN DIEGO COUNTY (the "County"), a political subdivision of the
24 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated
25 territory of the County, including implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA.
26 The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 2

CASE NO.

principal responsibility for conducing environmental review of the proposed actions. The

2 County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.

3 9. Respondent SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (the "Board")
is the duly elected decision-making body of the County. As the decision-making body, the
Board is responsible for granting the various approvals necessary for the Project and for
6 ensuring that the County has conducted an adequate and proper review of the Project's
7 environmental impacts under CEQA.

10. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest JACKSON PENDO
9 DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, also known as JACKSON PENDO DEVELOPMENT ("Real
10 Party in Interest"), is the Project applicant and developer, is the entity listed on the County's
11 Notice of Determination filed for the Project on June 27, 2019, is incorporated in the State of
12 California and does business in the State of California, and is the recipient of the Project

13 approvals that are the subject of this Petition and therefore a real party in interest within the
14 meaning of Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5.
15 11. GDCI PROCTOR VALLEY, LP, GDC HOLDINGS, LLC, PROCTOR VALLEY
16 INVESTORS, LLC, and GDC INVESTMENTS 11, LP are listed on the Applicant's Disclosure

17 of Ownership Interests on Application for Zoning Permits/Approvals form for the Project. On
18 information and belief, each is an entity registered to do business in the State of California and
19 does business in the State of California.

20 12. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
21 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore

22 sue said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show their
23 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the

24 agent and/or employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based
25 within the course and scope of such respondent's agency and/or employment.

26 13. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
27 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and

28 3

CASE NO.

1 therefore sue said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this
2 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 14. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
5 decision to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or
6 alternatively, section 1085) and Public Resources Code section 21168.5 (or alternatively, section
7 21168) and section 21168.9.

8 15. Venue for this action properly lies in the San Diego County Superior Court

9 because Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County. Many of the
10 significant environmental impacts from the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would
11 occur in San Diego County, and the Project would affect the interests of San Diego County
12 residents, including members of the Center, PWS, and CCI who reside in San Diego County.
13 16. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the EIR and
14 approving the Project. Respondents had a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including
15 but not limited to CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law, prior to undertaking the
16 discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
17 17. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
18 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on
19 Respondents on July 25, 2019. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached
20 hereto as Exhibit A.

21 18. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
22 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioners' request to prepare the record of
23 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the Petitioners' Election to Prepare
24 Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
25 19. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
26| action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law,
27 including, but not limited to, timely submitting extensive comments objecting to the approval of
28
4

CASE NO.

the Project and identifying to Respondents the deficiencies in Respondents' environmental
2 review for the Project on April 16, 2018, June 21, 2019, and June 26, 2019.

3 20. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
4 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 The Proposed Project and Project Site

7 21. The proposed Project site is in the remote Proctor Valley area of San Diego

8 County, northwest of the City of Chula Vista and near the small, unincorporated town of Jamul.
9 Apart from Proctor Valley Road, the site is undeveloped, with views of Proctor Valley, the San
10 Miguel and the Jamul Mountains, and the dense trees and shrubs of Upper Otay Reservoir.
11 22. Proctor Valley is home to an abundance of important biological resources. The site
12 abuts the 5,600-acre Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, owned by the California Department of
13 Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"), to the west, north, and east. The Rancho Jamul Ecological
14 Reserve provides raptor foraging habitat, host plants and nectar resources for the Quino
15 checkerspot butterfly, habitat occupied by the California gnatcatcher and San Diego fairy
16 shrimp, burrowing owl locations, and important habitat for numerous other special and protected
17 species, including mountain lions. Proctor Valley is a wildlife movement corridor for species
18 traveling between the protected habitat of San Miguel Mountain to the northwest and the Jamul
19 Mountains to the east. CDFW has acknowledged the importance of water sources in Proctor
20 Valley for wildlife migration between these two areas.

21 23. The Project site itself supports numerous sensitive natural vegetation communities
22 including chaparral, coastal sage scrub, riparian and vernal pools. Based on the County's own
23 data, 22 special-status plants and 28 special-status wildlife species occur on the Project site,
24 including the federally endangered San Diego fairy shrimp and Quino checkerspot butterfly, the
25 federally threatened California gnatcatcher, the federally threatened/state endangered Otay
26 tarplant, the state fully protected golden eagle and white-tailed kite, and the federal candidate
27 western spadefoot toad.
28 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 24. For instance, Proctor Valley contains crucial habitat for the federally endangered
2 Quino checkerspot butterfly, an orange-and-black butterfly that was once one of the most
3 abundant butterflies in Southern California, but whose numbers have been drastically reduced

4 due to, among other things, development in its dwindling habitat. The Project proposes to
5 develop significant portions of Quino checkerspot habitat even though surveys have repeatedly
6 documented individuals of this now-rare species on or near the Project site.

7 25. Additionally, recent observations and U.S. Geological Survey ("USGS") tracking
8 data show that federally protected golden eagles frequently travel through Proctor Valley and
9 forage in the Project site. Recent scientific literature indicates that golden eagles are particularly
10 sensitive to development-houses, roads, and infrastructure like those proposed for the Project
11 can cause golden eagles to vacate nearby areas. Development in Proctor Valley would almost
12 certainly result in the loss of important eagle foraging habitat and the San Miguel
13 Mountain/Rancho San Diego eagle territory, shrinking available habitat in San Diego County
14 significantly.
15 26. The western spadefoot toad, a state species of special concern that is not covered
16 by existing take authorization under the County's Multiple Species Conservation Program
17 ("MSCP"), is also present in Proctor Valley. This brown and green amphibian requires shallow,
18 temporary pools or streams during breeding season; the Project site contains at least 16 such
19 breeding pools.
20 27. Proctor Valley is designated as a very high fire hazard severity zone by the
21 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and the California Public Utilities
22 Commission-the highest fire risk level in California. The designation is well-deserved, as the
23 area has burned at least 17 times in the last 100 years. For example, the 2007 Harris Fire
24 affected over 90,000 acres, including a large portion of the Project site. The Project site is at
25 serious risk for fast-moving, wind-driven fires. According to fire experts, a fire ignited on the
26 Project site under Santa Ana winds would likely spread southwest towards population centers at
27 a rate of several miles per hour. The City of Chula Vista's nearest residential development is
28
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

- less than 1.5 miles away. The steep terrain surrounding the Project site, vegetated by chaparral
2 and coastal scrub, would make effective fire suppression difficult. The Project will be served by

3

4 a single evacuation route-the planned two-lane Proctor Valley Road.
28.

5 The proposed Project site is far from existing job centers and other services. The
City of San Diego is nearly an hour away by car, and by the County's own estimate, future
6 residents of the Project will drive 50 million miles per year in order to access these jobs and
7| other goods and services. The Project is the perfect example of the type of car-oriented sprawl
8 developments that impede the County's ability to achieve state climate goals.

9 29. Rainwater and runoff from the Project site drain into Proctor Valley Creek and
10 Jamul Creek, tributaries to the Upper and Lower Otay Reservoirs, which provide drinking water
11 to residents in the City of San Diego. Jamul Creek and the Lower Otay Reservoir are already
12 listed as impaired water bodies under the Clean Water Act. Development of the Project site
13 would further impair these hydrological systems.
14

15 Applicable Land Use Plans

16 30. San Diego County General Plan
The County approved the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan ("Subregional Plan"), as
17 part of the County's General Plan, on October 28, 1993. The Subregional Plan establishes land
18 uses for the nearly 23,000-acre Otay Ranch area (in which the Project is located). The
19 Subregional Plan generally designates Village 14 and Planning Arcas 16/19 for development but
20 acknowledges that project-level development approvals cannot occur until after the County
21

22 considers and addresses site-specific concerns related to such development. Other parcels

23 covered by the Subregional Plan have been developed, though Village 14 and Planning Areas
16/19 have not.

24 31. In its General Plan, the County committed to preparing a climate action plan with
25 detailed GHG emissions reduction targets and deadlines and comprehensive and enforceable
26 GHG emissions reduction measures that will achieve specified quantities of GHG reductions. As
27 mitigation for the harm to the climate from GHG emissions that would be caused by
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

CASE NO.

development authorized by the General Plan, the County adopted Mitigation Measure CC-1.2,
2 which requires the preparation of a County Climate Action Plan ("CAP""). On June 20, 2012, the
3 County adopted a CAP and Thresholds for determining the significance of GHG emissions for
4 CEQA purposes. This approval was successfully challenged by the Sierra Club in 2014.

5 32. In response, on February 14, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors adopted a
6 revised CAP and certified an EIR for it. The mitigation and monitoring program adopted by the
7 County pursuant to that EIR included mitigation measure M-GHG-1, which required certain
8 projects to mitigate GHG emissions by purchasing carbon offsets. Sierra Club again challenged

9 those approvals, along with the Center. On December 14, 2018, the San Diego Superior Court
10 granted the petition to set aside the Revised CAP and Mitigation M-GHG-1, finding in part that
11 Mitigation M-GHG-1 conflicted with the County's General Plan and associated EIR by allowing.
12 purchase of carbon offsets derived from carbon reduction projects located outside of the County.
13 33. A major goal of the General Plan is to create a housing stock at a range of prices
14 (Goal H-1), especially to meet the County's Regional Housing Needs Assessment allocations for
15 lower income households. The Housing Element recognizes that a critical means of achieving
16 this goal is to require large-scale residential developers to provide affordable housing.
17 Accordingly, Policy H-1.9 "[r]equires developers to provide an affordable housing component
18 when requesting a General Plan amendment for a large-scale residential project when this is
19 legally permissible."
20 Multiple Species Conservation Program
21 34. In response to ongoing threats to federally and state listed endangered species and
22 continued development pressures, CDFW and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS")
23 prepared an MSCP for San Diego County. The MSCP is a joint Habitat Conservation Plan under
24 federal law and Natural Community Conservation Plan under state law. The MSCP established
25 mechanisms intended to ensure the survival and recovery of certain federally and state listed
26 | species. In turn, it provided the County with limited "take" authorization for MSCP-covered
27 species pursuant to the federal Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. section 1531 et seq., and the
28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

California Endangered Species Act, Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq. The MSCP does
2 not cover all of the sensitive or special-status species found on the Project site. For example, it
3 does not cover (or authorize "take" of) the Quino checkerspot butterfly and the western

4 spadefoot toad.
35. To implement the MSCP in the vicinity of the Project, the County and the City of
Chula Vista worked with CDFW and USFWS to a prepare a MSCP Subarea Plan ("Subarea
7 Plan"). The Project is located within the "South County Segment" of the MSCP Subarea Plan.
36. CDFW approved the County's take permit pursuant to the Natural Community

9 Conservation Program Act (Fish and Game Code § 2800 et seq.) on March 17, 1998. The
10 County also entered into an "Implementing Agreement" with CDFW and USFWS to establish
11 the agencies' roles and responsibilities for carrying out the MSCP and Subarea Plan. According
12 to CDFW, the County's Subarea Plan, the Implementing Agreement, and the incidental take
13| permit obligate the County to assemble an MSCP Preserve and mitigate for impacts to covered
14 species and their habitats.
15 37. To incorporate the terms of a compromise known colloquially as the "Baldwin
16 Letter" or "Baldwin Agreement," the MSCP and the Subarea Plan include modifications to, and
17 expansion of, the open space preserve system originally approved as part of the County's
18 General Plan (specifically, in the Otay Ranch Subregional Plan). Consistent with the Baldwin
19 Agreement, the Subarea Plan designates approximately 200 acres of central Proctor Valley
20 (identified as areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3) as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch Areas

21 Where No 'Take Permits' Will be Issued." The Subregional Plan designates PV-1, PV-2, and

22 PV-3 as "100 percent conserved," meaning such lands fall within the designated "Hardline

23 Preserve" area. In exchange, the Baldwin Agreement modifications also allowed significantly

24 increased residential density in Otay Ranch Villages 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 and 11, which the City of

25 Chula Vista subsequently developed.

26 38. The EIR prepared for the MSCP also establishes preservation of areas PV-1, PV-2
27 and PV-3 as mitigation for the impacts of the development authorized by the MSCP. The MSCP

28 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

directed the County to modify its General Plan and the Otay Ranch Specific Plan to reflect
2 changes in development and open space designations as anticipated by the Baldwin Agreement
3 and incorporated into the MSCP and Subarea Plan. Indeed, both the County and the City of
4 Chula Vista took the necessary steps to remove other inconsistencies between the MSCP and
5 their then-existing general plans. However, without explanation or approval, the County failed
6 to actually re-designate areas PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 in its General Plan.

7 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Community Strategy

8 39. The San Diego Association of Government ("SANDAG") is the federally
9 designated regional agency directing overall transportation infrastructure funding. Every four
10 years it prepares a Regional Transportation Plan ("RTP") for the entire County of San Diego.
11 After the enactment of SB 375 (Govt. Code § 65080 et seq.), SANDAG has been required also
12 to prepare a Sustainable Community Strategy ("SCS"), setting out means for using
13 transportation projects and funding to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, and in
14 particular to reduce GHG emissions from driving. The RTP and SCS are a combined Plan that is
15 applicable to the entire County, with numerous policies intended to ensure the County
16 effectively addresses climate change impacts from transportation and land use.

17 The Project Approvals and EIR

18 40. On or about December 15, 2016 the County issued a Notice of Preparation
19 ("NOP") for the Project, in which it notified public agencies and interested individuals that, as a
20 lead agency, it would be preparing a Draft EIR to analyze the proposed Project's potentially
21 significant environmental impacts. CDFW submitted comments on the NOP and observed that
22 the proposed development footprint included areas designated in the MSCP Subarea Plan as
23 "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will Be Issued" and that a proposed project
24 alternative that included a land-exchange involving CDFW preserve lands would not be feasible.
25 41. On or about March 1, 2018, Respondents published a Notice of Availability of a
26 Draft EIR for the Project and circulated the Draft EIR for public review and comment.

27

28 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

42. Petitioners and numerous others, including public agencies, organizations, and
individual members of the public, submitted comments pointing out the serious deficiencies in
the Draft EIR. For example, commenters explained that the Project would have significant
4 impacts on air quality, greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), biological resources (including special
status species), water supplies, water quality, fire safety, energy consumption, aesthetics, traffic,

6 and land use.

43. In a letter to the County on April 16, 2018 before the close of the comment period
8  on the Draft EIR, Petitioners commented that the Draft EIR failed to comply with CEQA in the

9 following respects:

10 a. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for impacts to biological resources was

11 inadequate because, inter alia, it failed to disclose, evaluate, and avoid significant
12 impacts to biological resources including special status species, vernal pools,

13 wetlands and federally designated critical habitat; failed to account for impacts to
14 the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve; and

15 b. the Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for GHG impacts was inadequate
16 because, inter alia, the Draft EIR improperly estimated GHG emissions from the

17 Project, improperly relied on offsets as mitigation for the Project's GHG
18 emissions, and failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures; and

19 C. the Draft EIR's analysis of the Projects impacts on water supplies was inadequate.

20 44. In or around September 2018, the County released a Final EIR, for the Project,

21 which included text changes to the Draft EIR and Respondents' responses to public comments
22 on the Draft EIR. The defects identified in the Draft EIR identified by commenters persisted in
23 the Final EIR.

24 45. On October 19, 2018, the Planning Commission considered the Project, and voted

25 to recommend approval.

26 46. The Board delayed holding a hearing on the Project, later scheduled a hearing for
27 December 12, 2018, then again delayed the hearing. In or around May 2019, the Board provided
28 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 notice that the Project would be heard before the Board at its June 26, 2019 regularly scheduled
2 hearing.

3 47. In mid-June 2019, the Center discovered that the County had made unannounced

4 changes to the Final EIR and had replaced several sections of the Final EIR on the County's
5 website with new versions of those documents. These versions contained changes, including

6 substantive modifications to Final EIR sections on Air Quality, Greenhouse Gas Emissions,
7 Transportation and Traffic as well as to the proposed mitigation measures and the County's

8 response to public comments, including the Center's.

9 48. In a letter submitted to the County on June 21, 2019, before the final hearing to
10 approve the Project and certify the Final EIR, Petitioners described deficiencies remaining in the
11 Final EIR, commenting that the Final EIR failed to comply with CEQA in the following
12 respects:
13 a. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's impacts to biological
14 resources, including special status species such as the federally listed Quino
15 checkerspot butterfly, remained inadequate; and

16 b. the EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's GHG emissions remained
17 inadequate; and
18 C. the EIR's water supply analysis remained deficient; and

19 d. the EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's wildfire risks and impacts
20 was inadequate; and

21 C. the Final EIR did not adequately respond to the Petitioners' comments on the
22 Draft EIR.

23 49. In a letter submitted to the County on June 26, 2019, prior to the close of the final
24 hearing to approve the Project and certify the Final EIR, Petitioners commented that:
25 a.. The County's late changes to the Final EIR, for which it did not provide notice
26 to the public, impeded public review of the document; and

27

28
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 b. the County's proposal to enter into a so-called "Dispute Resolution Agreement"
2 with CDFW and the applicant that would commit the County to entering into a
land-exchange deal relating to lands in and around the Project area constituted a
4 new, separate project for which environmental review had not been conducted;

5 and

6 C. the County should recirculate a revised EIR that studied the new project.

7 Respondents' Approval of the Project and Certification of the EIR

8 50. On June 26, 2019, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on the proposed
9 Project and Final EIR to consider whether to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project.
10 Members of the public, including members of the Center, PWS, and/or CCI, attended the public
11 hearing and opposed the certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project.
12 51. At the conclusion of the June 26, 2019 hearing, the Board of Supervisors adopted
13 the Planning Commission's recommendation, certified the Final EIR, approved the Project and
14 adopted findings in support of the Project approval and EIR certification, and voted to enter into
15 the Dispute Resolution Agreement, which commits the County to supporting a land exchange
16 that would drastically alter the Project footprint to, among other things, allow for the
17 development and destruction of hundreds of acres of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve.

18 52. On June 27, 2019 the County executed the Dispute Resolution Agreement.

19 53. On June 27, 2019, the County recorded a Notice of Determination for the Project,
20 which stated that the County had approved the Project, certified the EIR, and adopted Findings
21 and a Statement of Overriding Considerations.
22 54. As a result of Respondents' actions in approving the Project, certifying the EIR for
23 the Project, adopting Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and entering into

24 the Dispute Resolution Agreement, Petitioners and their members will suffer significant and
25 irreparable harm as described herein. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at

Respondents to set aside certification of the EIR and approval of the Project, Respondents'
2 approval will remain in effect in violation of state law.

3 55. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the

4 manner required by law in the following ways:

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.,
7 CEQA Guidelines 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.)

8 56. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
9 above.

10 57. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that long-term protection of the
11 environment be the guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a
12 project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR for the
13 project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the
14 requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR
15 must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can intelligently
16 and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project. Such
17 analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial
18 evidence in the record.

19 58. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and
20 enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant
21 environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less
22 than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible
23 alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
24 significant environmental impacts.
25 59. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of
26 the agency's findings and conclusions, including those contained in the EIR, and that the agency
27 explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

28
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

- 60. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
2 manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet the CEQA's
3 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant

4 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct and cumulative impacts to wildfire
5 risks, air quality, GHGs, biological resources, water supplies, water quality, traffic, aesthetics,
6 land use (including growth inducing impacts) and energy consumption.

7 61. Environmental Setting. The EIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirement to
cO provide an adequate and accurate description of the environmental setting of the Project area.

9

10 (CEQA Guidelines § 15125.) The EIR's description of the environmental setting is inadequate
because, inter alia, it fails to:
11 a.

12 Adequately describe and disclose the Project area's importance as habitat and/or a

13 corridor and linkage for special status wildlife in the vicinity of the Project;

14 b. establish that protocol-level surveys were performed on all appropriate species;
and,

15 C.

16 describe and disclose the results of all biological surveys conducted on the Project

site.

17 62. Project Description. The EIR's project description is legally inadequate because,
18 inter alia, the EIR:

19 a. Fails to describe the whole of the Project;

20

21 b. fails to describe and analyze the Project as it was ultimately approved by the

22 County at the Board's June 26, 2019 hearing; and

C.

23 fails to describe the Dispute Resolution Agreement entered into by the County and

24 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife as part of the Project, or disclose

25 how the Dispute Resolution Agreement will foreseeably alter the size, footprint,

26 and location of the Project or result in additional or increased significant
environmental impacts.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

CASE NO.

1 63. Air Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
2 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to air quality. The Project will have
3 significant and long-term air quality impacts that will be felt by residents of the Project, by

4 residents of the Otay Mesa area, and by sensitive wildlife, and that will have a negative impact

5 on wildlife habitat in the region. While the EIR acknowledges the Project will result in

6 significant air quality impacts, it fails to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and consider
7 alternatives that would reduce these impacts.

8 64. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate
9 the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative GHG impacts. The EIR's analysis of
10 GHG impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

11 a. Fails to accurately estimate the GHG emissions that will result from the Project;
12 b. relies on GHG mitigation measures that are vague, deferred, unenforceable,
13 and/or inconsistent with the County General Plan and other applicable state,
14 regional, or local plans, policies, or regulations, and fails to set forth the specific
15 numerical reductions in GHG emissions these measures will achieve;
16 C. is inconsistent with other emissions reductions plans, policies and regulations;
17 d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures;
18 e. impermissibly relies on off-site offsets to mitigate Project emissions because off-

19 site emissions reductions claimed as offsets are not real, permanent, quantifiable,
20 verifiable, and enforceable reductions as set forth in Health and Safety Code
21 Section 38562(d)(1), are not additional to any other requirement of law or
22 regulation (CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(c)(3)), and lack legally-required
23 performance standards; and
24 f. fails to analyze, disclose, and if necessary, provide adequate mitigation for the
25 impacts resulting from the Project's inconsistency with County General Plan
26 Policy COS-20, which requires specified GHG reductions within the County,
27 given that each Project relies on the ability to use out-of-County GHG offsets.
28 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

65. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or

2 mitigate the Project's significant and cumulative impacts to biological resources, including
3 numerous animal and plant species affected by the Project. Those species include, but are not

4 limited to: golden eagle, Quino checkerspot butterfly, Western spadefoot toad, California
gnatcatcher, San Diego fairy shrimp, burrowing owl, mountain lion, spreading navarretia, Otay

6 tarplant, Dudleya variegata, and San Diego button-celery. The EIR's biological resources
7 analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
a. Relies on mitigation measures that are vague, deferred, and/or unenforceable;
b. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant
10 impacts on habitats and features such as vernal pools, non-riparian wetlands, and

11 preserved areas such as the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve, Otay Lakes

12 Cornerstone Lands Preserve and Otay Ranch open space;

13 C. fails to satisfy the requirements of the MSCP. County Subarea Plan and
14 Biological Mitigation Ordinance; and

15 d. fails to properly analyze the Project's impacts on occupancy and designated

16 critical habitat for Quino checkerspot butterfly.

17 66. Water Supply. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
18 environmental consequences of supplying water to the Project. The EIR's water supply analysis
19 is inadequate because, inter alia, the water supply analysis and the EIR:

20 a. Fail to adequately analyze the impacts of providing the Project with long-term
21 potable water supply;

22 b. fail to accurately describe the uncertainty surrounding regional supplies in light of
23 increasing drought conditions;
24 C. fail to analyze cumulative impacts associated with supplying water to the Project;

25 and

26

27

28 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

d. present conflicting information, undermining the documents' ability to accurately
2 disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the impacts associated with supplying water to

3 the Project.

4 67. Fire Safety. Although the Project site is located in an area designated by the

5 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection as a Very High Fire Hazard Severity

6 Zone, the Respondents failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that would
7 reduce or avoid the Project's direct and cumulative fire safety impacts. Among other things, the
8 Respondents failed to fully consider the likelihood that the Project would increase the risk and
9 intensity of wildfires which will impact human health and safety and habitat for special status
10 species. The EIR also fails to assess the Project's impacts on area fire protection services and
11 utilities.

12 68. Growth-inducing impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
13 mitigate the Project's significant growth-inducing impacts because, inter alia, the EIR contains
14 limited and inadequate discussion of the growth-inducing impacts of urbanizing a rural,
15 undeveloped area, and the EIR fails to acknowledge that the Project will induce future growth.

16 69. Energy. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
17 Project's significant impacts on energy due to the substantial increase in VMT and fuel
18 consumption the Project will create.
19 70. Traffic. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
20 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative traffic impacts.
21 71. Hydrology and Water Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze,
22 and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts the Project will have on hydrology
23 and water quality.

24 72. Aesthetics. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
25 Project's direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts to aesthetics. The EIR is inadequate because,
26 inter alia, the EIR:

27

28 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

a. Fails to properly analyze Project impacts to views along Proctor Valley Road, a

2 designated scenic highway;

3 b. contains insufficient analysis of visual impacts to area trails and recreation areas;

4 C. contains deficient analysis of night time views; and
d. fails to adequately account for cumulative impacts on scenic views in and around
the Project site.

73. Land Use. The EIR failure to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
inconsistency with applicable land use plans, including but not limited to the MSCP and the

9 General Plan.

10 74. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives
11 that foster informed decision-making and informed public participation. The alternatives

12 analysis in the EIR does not meet CEQA's requirement that an EIR consider a reasonable range

13 of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant environmental impacts, and does not focus on
14 alternatives thät either eliminate adverse impacts or reduce them to insignificance, even if they
15 would to some degree impede the Project's objectives. The EIR's analysis of alternatives is
16 inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
17 a. Improperly relies upon an overly narrow statement of purpose and Project

18 objectives;

19 b. does not support its conclusion that no alternative sites exist for the Project;

20 C. includes the Land Exchange Alternative, which would worsen the Project's

21 environmental impacts;

22 d. fails to include quantitative and/or meaningful comparisons of the Project's

23 impacts and the proposed alternatives; and,

24 e. misrepresents the physical conditions of the Project site in the discussion of
25 alternatives.

26 75. Responses to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to
27 meet CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor

28 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 provide specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, mitigation measures, or

2 alternatives. CEQA requires that the lead agency evaluate and respond to all environmental

3 comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period. The responses must

4 describe the disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain reasons for rejecting
5 suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's
6 responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law.

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
9 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
10 76. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate
11 the requirements of the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents' findings fail to identify the changes or
12 alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant
13 environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines § 15091(a)(1), and do not provide adequate reasoning
14 or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by law. The purported benefits of the
15 Project cited in the Statement of Overriding Considerations do not outweigh the substantial costs
16 of the Project to public health and the environment. Respondents' Findings and Statement of
17 Overriding Considerations are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. (CEQA
18 Guidelines, § 15091(b).)
19 77. Where mitigation measures and alternatives to a project are not adopted, the
20 CEQA findings must identify specific economic, legal, social and technological and other
21 considerations that make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives. All
22 CEQA findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and must disclose the
23 analytical route by which approval of the Project is justified. The findings regarding the impacts,
24 mitigation measures, and alternatives relied upon by Respondents' approval of the Project are
25 not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the links between evidence and
26 conclusions are not satisfactorily provided.

27

28
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

78. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Consideration fail to
2 reflect the independent judgment of Respondents.

3 79. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner
4 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial
5 evidence.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

8 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

9 80. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

10 above.

11 81. •CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft
12 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the EIR must be amended and
13 recirculated for public review and comment.
14 82. The Final EIR for the Project was posted to the County's website after the
15 Planning Commission's October hearing, on or around November 2018. The County
16 subsequently made multiple revisions and updates to those Final EIR documents, including
17 changes to its responses to Petitioners' comments on the Draft EIR. Petitioners and the public
18 were not provided with notice of these revisions, and the revisions from the previously
19 published Final EIR documents were not discernable by reviewing the revised documents. These
20 revisions constituted significant new information requiring recirculation of the EIR.

21 83. In or around mid-June 2019, the County added numerous materials, including a

22 draft so-called Dispute Resolution Agreement, to its agenda for the June 26, 2019 Board hearing
23 on the Project and EIR. These new materials proposed significant changes to the Project and/or
24 the adoption of a new, separate project, and contained significant new information regarding the
25 Project and environmental review for the Project. For example, the Dispute Resolution
26 Agreement commits the County to supporting a land exchange that would drastically alter the
27

28 21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

F Project footprint to, among other things, allow for the development and destruction of hundreds
2 of acres of the Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve.

3 84. Despite the significant new information added to the EIR and the proposed
4 changes to the Project, Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR as
5 required by CEQA. As a result of Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, the members of
6 the public and public agencies were deprived of the opportunity to meaningfully review and
7 comment on the Project as approved, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and
8 the new information regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.

9 85. By failing to recirculate the EIR prior to approving the Project, Respondents failed
10 to proceed in the manner required by law.
11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
12 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Retain Administrative Record Documents
13 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
14 86. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
15 above.

16 87. State and local law, including Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e) and
17 County Board of Supervisors Resolution 17-170 and Policy A-129 require the County to retain
18 all records necessary to form the complete administrative record of proceedings in an action to
19 challenge the County's approval of a project under CEQA.
20 88. On information and belief, the County has deleted or destroyed records relating to
21 the Project and/or environmental review for the Project, which were required to be retained for
22 inclusion in the administrative record for this action.

23 89. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the
24 manner required by law by failing to preserve records necessary for lawful CEQA review.
25 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law®
27 (Government Code § 65300, et § seq.)
28
22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

90. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
2 above.

3 91. The California State Planning and Zoning Law requires the legislative body of

4 each county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The County's

5 General Plan is fundamental land use planning document and serves as the constitution for
6 future development within the County. Land use actions, including the approvals associated with

7 the Project, must be consistent with the General Plan.

8 92. The Project is inconsistent with mandatory County General Plan policies,

9 including, but not limited to, policies discouraging sprawl; policies discouraging high density or
10 high intensity development in Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones; policies requiring GHG
11 emission reductions to be made within the County (such as Goal COS-20 and Policy COS-20.1);
12 and policies requiring the provision of affordable housing for projects requesting a General Plan
13 Amendment (such as Policy H-1.9).

14 93. By approving a project inconsistent with the County's General Plan, Respondents
15 prejudicially abused their discretion and violated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning
16 Law, requiring invalidation of the County's approvals.
17 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of Natural Community Conservation Plan Act and MSCP

19 (Fish & Game Code § 2800 et seq.)

20 94. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
21 above.

22 95. CDFW approved the MSCP, a natural community conservation plan, for the
23 region in which the Project is located, pursuant to the Natural Community Conservation Plan
24 Act, Fish and Game Code section 2800 et seq. The MSCP includes both a Subarea Plan and an
25 Implementing Agreement with the County. Pursuant to these documents, CDFW approved an
26 "incidental take" permit for the County on March 17, 1998.

27

28 23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

- 96.

2 The Subarea Plan designates areas of the Project known as PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3
as "no take authorized" and "Otay Ranch Areas Where No 'Take Permits' Will be Issued." The
3 MSCP and associated EIR designate PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3 as "100 percent conserved."

4 97. The Project includes development of PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3. Development within
5 the areas is inconsistent with the MSCP, the Subarea Plan, and the mitigation measures included
6 in the associated EIR.

7 98.

8 The Fish and Game Code requires implementing agreements to prohibit parties

9 from "adopting, amending, or approving any plan or project without the concurrence of the
wildlife agencies that is inconsistent with the objectives and requirements" of the NCCP. Fish
10 and Game Code § 2820(b)(3)(C)).

11 99. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the
12 manner required by law by approving the Project, which permits development of areas PV-1,
13 PV-2 and PV-3 in a manner inconsistent with the MSCP, the Subarea Plan, and the mitigation
14 | measures included in the associated EIR.

15 100. As such, Respondents' approval of the Project and Dispute Resolution Agreement
16 must be set aside.

17

18

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

20 1. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate
21 and set aside certification of the EIR, adoption of the Findings and Statement of Overriding
22 Considerations, and approval of all associated Project permits, entitlements, and approvals;
23 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply
24 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and take any other action as required by Public
25 Resources Code section 21168.9;

4 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving
5 the Project violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and that the certification and approvals

6 are invalid and of no force or effect, and that the Project is inconsistent with other applicable

7 plans, policies, or regulations;

8 5. For costs of the suit;

9 6. For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
10 other provisions of law; and,

Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Alleging Environmental Harm

Dear Mr. Becerra:

The enclosed Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, Center for Biological Diversity et al. V. County of San Diego et al. (San Diego Superior Court), is submitted to your office pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code section 21167.7. This case is
being pursued under the private attorney general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

The case is being brought by the Center for Biological Diversity, Preserve Wild Santee, and the California Chaparral Institute challenging the County of San Diego's and Board of Supervisor of San Diego County's approval of the Otay Ranch Village 14 and Planning Areas 16/19 project (the "Project"). The Project would be built in a biologically sensitive area within the County of San Diego. The Project would develop over 1,100 acres in the Proctor Valley
region of the unincorporated County.
The Center for Biological Diversity, Preserve Wild Santee, and the California Chaparral Institute allege environmental harm that could affect the public generally and the natural resources of the state.

Please acknowledge receipt in the enclosed prepaid, self-addressed envelope. Thank you for your attention to this matter. 1R

Sincerely, fu fyulite.
