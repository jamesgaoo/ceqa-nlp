1 Petitioner and Plaintiff One Vassar LLC ("One Vassar") seeks a traditional writ of mandate
2| against Defendants and Respondents the City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Board
3 of Supervisors, and the San Francisco Planning Department (collectively, the "City") pursuant to
4 California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and California Public Resource Code section
21168.5 directing the City: (1) to reverse certification of the Central SoMa Plan Environmental
6 Impact Report; to analyze a higher housing density alternative as a means to substantially lessen
7 impacts on transit, traffic, and air quality; to address the Central SoMa Plan's inconsistencies with
the Housing Element of the General Plan; to address the Housing Sustainability District ordinance's
inconsistencies with the Housing Element of the General Plan; and to then certify an Environmental
10 Impact Report for the Central SoMa Plan in compliance with the California Environmental Quality
arnBpajo amns ay uy pouuoj dayemuured Qurqey pouu 11 Act; or (2) to show cause why a writ of mandate should not issue. One Vassar also seeks declaratory
12 and injunctive relief. In support of this Petition and Complaint ("Petition"), One Vassar alleges as d11 H.LIWS CHEd 13 follows:

INTRODUCTION 14

15 1. The City has violated the public trust and California law by failing to comply with the
16 requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

17 2. On December 12, 2018, Mayor London Breed approved the Central SoMa Plan, a
18 multi-faceted strategy for guiding the growth and evolution of a 230-acre area in a portion a of San
19 Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, comprising 17 city blocks within the area approximately
20 bounded by 2nd Street to 6th Street and Market Street to Townsend Street. The Central SoMa Plan
21 consists of amendments to the San Francisco General Plan, Planning Code, Administrative Code,
22 and Zoning Map, as well as adoption of an Implementation Program.

23 3. The Planning Department had earlier determined that the proposed Central SoMa Plan
24 would likely have a significant effect on the environment and therefore required that an
25 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") under CEQA be prepared prior to approval of the Plan.

4. The City, however, failed to perform its duty under CEQA and committed a
27 prejudicial abuse of discretion by ultimately certifying the Central SoMa Plan EIR, which clearly 26

1/16/19 11:11 AM 28 suffers from a number of legal deficiencies, and subsequently approving the Central SoMa Plan.
- 2 -

1 5. The City's actions violated CEQA for three main reasons.

2 6. First, the City committed such failure and abuse of discretion by failing to describe a

range of reasonable alternatives to the Central SoMa Plan by omitting consideration of a higher
4 housing density alternative to substantially lessen significant environmental impacts.
potential 5 7. Second, the City violated CEQA by failing to properly address the
6 environmental impacts and failing to discuss the inconsistency with regard to affordable housing
7 between the Central SoMa Plan and the City's Housing Element of the General Plan.

8 8. Third, the City violated CEQA by failing to discuss and properly address
9 environmental impacts arising from inconsistencies between the Housing Sustainability District
10 ordinance (enacted as part of the Central SoMa Plan), which disincentivizes-and therefore will
aemepa jo ains ay ug pouvoy dyyswuued Agqey payug y 11 likely reducethe number of affordable housing for buildings taller than 160 feet, and the Housing
12 Element of the General Plan. The City also violated CEQA by failing to prepare and recirculate an dTIHLIWS qHH 13 updated EIR to consider the impacts of the Housing Sustainability District ordinance.

14 9. One Vassar has exhausted its administrative remedies and now files this action
15 seeking a writ of mandate from this Court commanding the City: (a) to reverse certification of the
16 Central SoMa Plan EIR; to analyze a higher housing density alternative as a means to substantially
17 lessen impacts on transit, traffic, and air quality; to properly address the environmental impacts
18 arising from the Central SoMa Plan's inconsistencies with the Housing Element of the General Plan;
19 to address the Housing Sustainability District ordinance's inconsistencies with the Housing Element
20 of the General Plan and the resulting environmental issues; to prepare and recirculate an updated EIR

21 to consider the impacts of the Housing Sustainability District ordinance; and to then certify an EIR
22 in compliance with CEQA; or (b) to show cause why a writ of mandate should not issue.

PARTIES 23

24 10. One Vassar is the developer of a proposed mixed-use office, hotel, and residential
25 project comprised of multiple parcels located on the south side of Harrison Street between Second
26 and Third Streets in the Central SoMa Plan area.

27 11. The City and County of San Francisco is, and at all times mentioned in this Petition
28 was, a consolidated charter city and county organized and existing under the laws of the State of
. 3 -

California. The City is the lead agency that provided final approval for the Central SoMa Plan and
2 that will have primary responsibility for implementing the Central SoMa Plan.

12. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors is the elected legislative body within the
4 government of the City and County of San Francisco, responsible for implementing and complying
5 with the provisions of CEQA.

6 13. The San Francisco Planning Department is a public administrative agency within the
7 City and County of San Francisco responsible for regulating the growth and development of San
8 Francisco through the development and implementation of land use laws and regulations.

9 14. One Vassar is ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents named as Does
10 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore names those parties by such fictitious names. One Vassar
MEMEPOJO QIEIS 941 u; pouuoy dysauue AgE!qEg pOl!wH V 11 will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.
12 One Vassar is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that each of the respondents named as d'TI HLONS GHRH 13 a Doe is responsible in some manner for the events that are alleged and is liable as set forth herein.
One Vassar alleges that at all times mentioned in this Petition each and every 14 15.

15 defendant and respondent was the agent and employee of each and every other defendant and
16 respondent, and in doing the acts alleged, was acting within the course and scope of such agency and
17 employment, and was acting with the consent, permission, and authorization of each of the remaining
18 defendants and respondents. All actions by each defendant and respondent herein were ratified and
19 approved by each of the other defendants and respondents.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 20

21 16. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060 and

22 1085.

23 17. This Court has jurisdiction over Defendants and Respondents the City because they
24 are governmental entities located in the City and County of San Francisco.

25 18. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
26 sections 393 and 394 because Defendants and Respondents are located in the County of San
27 Francisco and because the challenged agency action occurred in the County of San Francisco, which
28 is also where the environmental impacts resulting from the challenged agency action will occur.

19. One Vassar has fully complied with Public Resources Code section 21177 and
2 exhausted all available administrative remedies prior to filing this action. Specifically, One Vassar
3 timely submitted written public comments on the Draft EIR for the Central SoMa Plan in February
4 2017 to the San Francisco Planning Department. One Vassar also timely appealed the San Francisco
5 Planning Commission's certification of the Final EIR for the Central SoMa Plan in June 2018 to the
6 San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Finally, One Vassar submitted supplemental written comments
7 in support of its appeal to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in July 2018 and September 2018.
8 In exhausting its administrative remedies, One Vassar raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted

9 in this Petition.

10 20. One Vassar has standing to initiate this lawsuit because of its beneficial interest in the
aremejaajo ajens au) u! pouuoj diys otre Kazqen payy V 11 outcome of this lawsuit. As a developer of a proposed mixed-use office, hotel, and residential project

REED SMITH LLP 12 comprised of multiple parcels located in the Central SoMa Plan area, One Vassar and its members
13 and property users will be irreparably harmed by the environmental impacts caused by the City's
14 failure to properly address various environmental impacts, resulting in the certification of the Central
15 SoMa Plan EIR, which is inconsistent with CEQA's legal requirements. One Vassar is also entitled
16 to the City's adherence to its legal obligations under CEQA and under the zoning and General Plan
17 provisions applicable to the designated area.

18 21. This action was timely filed within the limitations period established in Public
19 Resources Code section 21167(c), as it was filed within 30 days of the City's filing of its Notice of
20 Determination with the County Clerk for the City and County of San Francisco on December 18,
21 2018.

22 22. One Vassar provided a written notice of its intention to file this Petition to the City

23 on January 14 and 16, 2019, in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A copy of
24 One Vassar's notices to all three respondents and the proofs of service are included as Exhibit 1.

25 LEGAL STANDARD

26 23. CEQA requires public agencies, including the City, to consider and document the
27 environmental implications of their actions in order to "[e]nsure that long-term protection of the
28 environment, consistent with the provision of a decent home and suitable living environment for
-5-

1 every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21001(d).)
2 In enacting CEQA, the State Legislature declared it to be the policy of California to "[t]ake all action
3 necessary to provide the people of this state with clean air and water, enjoyment of aesthetic, natural,
4 scenic, and historic environmental qualities, and freedom from excessive noise." (Id., § 21001(b).)
5 CEQA thus requires all agencies to give "major consideration" to "preventing environmental
6 damage" and protecting public health and safety. (Id., § 21000(g).)

7 24. The environmental review process established by the Legislature in CEQA carries out
8 this mandate by bringing citizens' environmental concerns about governmental action to the attention
9 of public agencies. CEQA therefore requires public agencies to determine whether a project may
10 have a significant impact on the environment prior to approval of a project. (Id., § 21151.) This is
SIENeÇCIjo zueS aq ui pouuoy drysuye Lag!qe! povung V 11 to ensure that any environmental impacts can be minimized or mitigated and so that public agencies
12 may consider the comparative environmental impacts and benefits of alternatives. (Id., § 21002.1.)
aaad SMITH LI 13 25. CEQA contains a "substantive mandate" that public agencies must refrain from
14 approving projects with significant environmental effects if "there are feasible alternatives or
15 mitigation measures" that can substantially lessen or avoid those effects. (Mountain Lion Found. v.
16 Fish & Game Comm'n (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134.)
17 26. To that end, CEQA requires that public agencies prepare an environmental impact
18 report ("EIR") whenever the approval of a proposed project may cause significant effects or impacts
19 on the environment. (Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21002.1, 21061, 21100, 21151; Cal. Code Regs., tit, 14,
20 8§ 15080-15097, 15120-15132, 15160-15170, 15362, 15382.) "The EIR requirement is the heart of
21 CEQA." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15003(a); citing County of Inyo v. Yorty (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795.)

22 27. Courts have consistently held that the foremost principle under CEQA is that its
23 requirements are to be "interpreted in such : manner as to afford the fullest possible protection of the
24 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
25 Bd. of Supervisors of Santa Barbara Cnty. (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 563-64 (internal quotations and
26 citation omitted).)

27 28. In reviewing an agency's compliance with CEQA and the adequacy of an EIR, courts
28 must determine "whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21168.5;

see also Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3. Cal. 5th 497,
2 511.) "Such an abuse is established if the agency has not a proceeded in a manner required by law or
3 if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence." (Id., citing Vineyard Area
4 Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)

5 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6 29. The San Francisco Planning Department began the process of creating the Central

7 SoMa Plan in 2011.

8 30. The Central SoMa Plan is a multi-faceted strategy for guiding the growth and
9 evolution of a 230-acre area in a portion of San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood,
10 comprising 17 city blocks within the area approximately bounded by 2nd Street to 6th Street and
he State of Delaware 11 Market Street to Townsend Street. The Central SoMa Plan consists of amendments to the San
12 Francisco General Plan, Planning Code, Administrative Code, and Zoning Map, as well as adoption
SMITH LL Taa 13 of an Implementation Program.
drysaocred Auguqey pargun y 14 31. The Central SoMa Plan aims at accommodating population and job growth in the
15 Central SoMa neighborhood by, among other things, removing certain land use restrictions,
16 increasing height limits for certain sites, providing additional and affordable housing units, and
17 supporting growth near existing or planned public transportation hubs.

18 32. The Planning Department released a draft Plan for the then-called Central Corridor
19 Plan in April 2013. Environmental review of the draft Central Corridor Plan pursuant to the CEQA
20 began in April 2013. The Planning Department determined that the renamed Central SoMa Plan
21 could have a significant effect on the environment and required that an EIR be prepared.

22 33. A Notice of Preparation of an EIR was issued on April 24, 2013. The Planning
23 Department released an Initial Study regarding the impacts of the proposed project and to identify
24| environmental issues to be considered in the Draft EIR on February 12, 2014.

25 34. A revised draft plan, renamed the Central SoMa Plan, was released for public review
26 in August 2016. The Draft EIR for the Central SoMa Plan was released on December 14, 2016.

27 35. One Vassar timely submitted written public comments on the Draft EIR in February
28 2017 before the expiration of the public comment period. (Exh. 2.) On March 28, 2018, the Planning
- 7-

RELIEF

1 Department released the Response to Comments for the Central SoMa Plan EIR. The Response to
2 Comments, combined with the Draft EIR, constitute the Central SoMa Plan's Final EIR.

3 36. The Final EIR findings included, among other things, that the Central SoMa Plan

4 would result in significant and unavoidable environmental impacts even with mitigation measures
5 with respect to transit, traffic, and air quality.

6 37. Specifically, the Final EIR determined that development under the Plan "would result
7 in a substantial increase in transit demand that would not be accommodated by local transit capacity,

8 and would cause substantial increase in delays resulting in adverse impacts on local and regional
9 transit routes." (Exh. 3 at p. 29.)

10 38. As for traffic impacts, the Final EIR stated that development under the Plan "would
SEMEPCJO RLES 11 result in crosswalk overcrowding" in certain intersections and "an increased demand for on-street
12 commercial and passenger loading and a reduction in on-street loading supply" that would impact d'TI HLIWS CHTd A941qeu paggwg V ! pauroy dasauu ned 13 loading zones and create potential hazards or significant delays for transit, vehicles, bicycles and/or
14 pedestrians." (Id. at p. 30.)

15 39. Regarding air quality, the Final EIR stated that development under the Plan would
16 violate certain air quality standards and would result in "emissions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
17 and toxic air contaminants that would result in exposure of sensitive receptors to substantial pollutant
18 Il concentrations." (Id. at pp. 36-37.)

19 40. The Planning Department prepared a Statement of Overriding Considerations
20 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21081, subdivision (b) [requiring finding by public
21 agency "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the
22 project outweigh the significant effects on the environment"] and Code of Regulations, title 14,
23| section 15093, subdivision (a) ['"statement of overriding considerations shall be supported by
24 substantial evidence in the record"]. (Id. at pp. 51-55.)

25 41. The Statement of Overriding Considerations stated that in spite of unavoidable
26 significant environmental impacts, that there were significant benefits to enacting the Central SoMa
27 Plan that outweighed its adverse environmental effects. (Id. at p. 52.) It also acknowledged that the
28 Central SoMa Plan would result in adverse environmental effects that could not be mitigated to

insignificant levels. (Id. at p. 55.)

2 42. The Planning Commission nevertheless voted unanimously to certify the EIR and its
3 findings under CEQA on May 10, 2018. (Exh. 4 at pp. 10-12.)
43. One Vassar submitted an appeal of the Planning Commission's certification of the
5 EIR to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors on June 11, 2018. (Exh. 5.) One Vassar's appeal laid

6 out three main reasons demonstrating why the Planning Commission's certification of the EIR was
7 erroneous and in violation of CEQA.

8 44. First, One Vassar argued that the EIR violated CEQA by failing to consider a project
means to substantially lessen significant impacts on 9 alternative with higher housing density as a
10 transit, traffic, and air quality in violation of. (Id. at pp. 3-5.) Second, One Vassar argued that the
aIExepajo ams aup u pouoj dupouued Kgqeu poajwn V 11 EIR violated CEQA because it failed to discuss inconsistencies regarding the amount of affordable
12 housing between the Central SoMa Plan and the Housing Element of the General Plan. (Id. at pp. 5-
dTT HLIWS CARd 13 6.) Finally, One Vassar argued that the EIR violated CEQA because it did not discuss inconsistencies
14 between the Housing Sustainability District designation for the Central SoMa Plan area and the

a 15 Housing Element in that the Housing Sustainability District provides expedited review for residential
16 projects taller than 160 feet only if the building is 100 percent affordable. This would create
17 disincentive to build affordable housing units because very few developers would dedicate all units
18 in a tall project to affordable housing just to get expedited review. Thus, the all-or-nothing option for
19 buildings taller than 160 feet would result in very few, if any, affordable housing units whereas if
20 expedited review was granted to such buildings that included a lower percentage, a developer might
21 be incentivized by expedited review. By not allowing for a lower percentage of affordable housing
22 in buildings taller than 160 feet, the Housing Sustainability District conflicts with the Housing
23 Element, which, as previously stated, requires substantial increases in the number of affordable
24 housing units citywide. (Id, at pp. 6-7.)

1 appeals to the Central SoMa Plan EIR and upheld the certification of the EIR.

2 47. On November 27, 2018 and December 4, 2018, the Board of Supervisors unanimously
3 adopted the Central SoMa Plan. Mayor London Breed approved the Central SoMa Plan on December
4 12, 2018. A Notice of Determination under CEQA for the Central SoMa Plan was filed with the San
5 Francisco County Clerk on December 18, 2018. (Exh. 8.)

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA; Failure to Analyze a Range of Reasonable Alternatives Code of Civil Procedure section 1085; Public Resources Code section 21002; California Code
8 of Regulations, title 14, section 15126.6

9 48. One Vassar realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 47 as though such
10 paragraphs are fully set forth here.
State of Delaware 11 49. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, subdivision (a), a traditional writ
12 of mandate is used to invoke judicial review of legislative and ministerial actions by government
d'TTHLINS 0geg 13 agencies. When those agencies have abused their discretion through their actions, the courts can
y drys rored Auguqeui pauouy V 14 compel them to act in a manner consistent with applicable laws.

15 50. The City has a clear legal duty to abide by the requirements of CEQA and has the
16 ability to perform that duty.

17 51. One Vassar has a beneficial interest in the City's performance of this duty because,
18 as a developer of a proposed mixed-use office, hotel, and residential project comprised of multiple
19 parcels located in the Central SoMa Plan area, One Vassar and its members will be irreparably
20 harmed by the environmental impacts improperly analyzed, mitigated and essentially allowed under
21 the Central SoMa Plan EIR certified by the City.

22 52. The City has failed to perform its duty under CEQA and committed a prejudicial
23 abuse of discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, Public Resources Code section
24 21002, and California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15126.6 by not proceeding in a manner
25 required by law. Specifically, the City committed such failure and abuse of discretion by, among
26 other things, failing to describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the Central SoMa Plan by
27 omitting consideration of a higher housing density alternative to substantially lessen significant
28 environmental impacts.

53. The Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA [Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA
2 Guidelines")] section 15126.6 requires an EIR to "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the
3 project. . . which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid
4 or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project . .."

5 54. The nature and scope of the alternatives to be studied in an EIR is governed by the
6 "rule of reason." (Id., § 15126.6(f).) Under the rule of reason, an EIR must discuss and address only
7 those alternatives necessary to permit a reasoned choice. (Id.) The range of alternatives examined in

8 an EIR should be designed to "foster informed decision-making and public participation." (Id., (a).)

9 55. An alternative must avoid or substantially lessen the Plan's significant environmental
10 effects [Pub. Res. Code, § 21002], offering substantial environmental advantages [Citizens of Goleta
aJexepajo aes aus ut pauuoy djyssauuret Fg!qen Pouwg v 11 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 566]. It must also be able to implement most
12 of the Plan's objectives. (Mira Mar Mobile Community v. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th dTI HLIWS GHHd 13 477, 487.)

14 56. An alternative must also be "potentially feasible" [CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)]
15 in that it is "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of
16 time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors" [Pub. Res.
17 Code, § 21061.1]. And, it must be "reasonable" [CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)] in that the
18 alternative is not remote and speculative requiring, for example, significant changes in governmental
19 policy or legislation [Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Comm. v. Board of Trustees of Lodi (1979) 89
20 Cal.App.3d 274, 286-287],

21 57. The City acted in violation of CEQA because the EIR failed to describe and consider
22 a range of reasonable alternatives to the Central SoMa Plan. Specifically, the City omitted
23 consideration of a higher housing density alternative, which would substantially lessen significant
24 environmental impacts. (See Mira Mar, 119 Cal.App.4th at 490 [a higher density alternative should
25 be considered in an EIR when it would avoid or substantially lessen significant impacts of the
26 project].) Such an alternative not only would have substantially lessened the significant and
27 unavoidable environmental impacts of the Plan as stated in the EIR on transit, traffic, and air quality,
28 but it might have reduced those impacts from significant to less than significant. 'Accordingly, the
- 11

RELIEF

1 City should not have approved the EIR since there was a "feasible alternative[ ] or mitigation
measure[ 1" that could have substantially lessened these impacts. (Mountain Lion Found., 16 Cal.4th
at 134.)

58. Under the Central SoMa Plan, the EIR projected household growth to be 14,400 by
5 2040, which would presumably be accommodated by the projected growth in the number of housing
6 units, which is 14,500. (Exh. 10 at p. IV-6, Table IV-1.) However, the projected growth in the
7 number of jobs by 2040 in the EIR study area is 63,600. This obviously means more workers would

8 be transporting to, and not living in, the City because of the lack of housing, resulting into a
9 recognized increase in what could be avoidable environmental impacts. (Id.)
With such a large gap between the increase in the number of households and the 10 59.
arEXePCjo aing aup uy pauuo; diysrouued Kugqe! poyy y 11 increase in the number of jobs, vehicle trips by out-of-town commuters, clogging transit routes,
12 would vastly outnumber shorter in-town commutes by residents who could walk or bicycle to work, SMITH LLP daad 13 which would significantly lessen impact on transit.

14 60. As result, Impact TR-3 of the EIR found that "[d]evelopment under the Plan would
15 result in a substantial increase in transit demand that would not be accommodated by local transit
16 capacity, and would cause a substantial increase in delays resulting in adverse impacts on local and
17 regional transit routes." (Exh. 10 at p. S-17.) The EIR found that there would be a significant and
18 unavoidable adverse impact with respect to transit, even after mitigation. (Id.) In addition, "transit
19 impacts on Muni, Golden Gate Transit, and SamTrans operations would be significant and
20 unavoidable." (Id. at p. VI-25.)

21 61. To address these significant and unavoidable environmental impacts, the City should
a 22 have considered a higher housing density alternative. Such an alternative could have reduced the
23 Plan's environmental impacts on transit, traffic, and air quality to less than significant. (See, e.g.,
24 Cleveland Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 506 [stating

25
The Planning Department attempts to explain major discrepancies among various figures for projected number of 26 housing units in the plan area. (See Exh. 9.) With respect to the figures cited here, the department says that "the EIR
27 anticipated to occur with the Plan Area." (Id. at p. 3.) The department provides no explanation for what it considers the analyzes an increase of approximately 14,500 residential units within the EIR study area, of which 8,320 units are

reductions can be achieved by maximizing building densities at locations served by 1 greenhouse gas
2 public transit, thereby reducing automobile dependency]; see also Exh. 11 at p. 4; Exh. 12 at p. 97
3 [reductions in GHG emissions can be achieved through local government development of "land use
4 plans with more efficient development patterns that bring people and destinations closer together in
communities that facilitate walking, biking, and use of transit"]; Exh. 13 more mixed-use, compact
6 at p. RTC-278-RTC-279 ["VMT per person would decrease, both in the Plan Area and throughout
7 the Bay Area, if more housing were provided within the Plan Area"]; Exh. 3 at p. 36 [recognizing
8 relationship between greater vehicle trips and an increase in criteria air pollutants].)

62. The City has long-recognized the correlation between high housing density and
10 reductions in transit impacts: "In the Bay Area, transportation is the single largest source of
anemepecjo awus au u; pouoy drysrotured Agigeg porug v 11 greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), with passenger travel in cars and light trucks causing more than
12 40% of those emissions." (Exh. 11 at p. 4.) "Transforming some of that passenger travel to transit,
dTT HLIWS CITH 13 biking or walking will not only support environmental goals like reduction of energy consumption,
14 lower greenhouse gas emissions, and less air pollution, but also economic and social ones such as
15 increased physical activity, lower vehicle accident rates, and lower household transportation
16 expenses." (Id.; see also Exh. 14 at p. 4 [explaining how high-density housing leads to traffic
17 reduction and fewer auto trips].)

18 63. Nonetheless, the City failed to consider a higher housing density alternative that could
19 have reduced transit impacts and impacts on air quality from significant to less than significant.
Moreover, a higher housing density alternative would satisfy virtually all of the
21 Central SoMa Plan's primary objectives, including the objective of increasing housing and bringing 20 64.

22 City residents closer to their in-City jobs.

23 65. Such an alternative is also feasible and could be accomplished a within a reasonable
24 amount of time. The vast majority of new zoning in the Central SoMa Plan area already allows for
25 residential use. Under the Central SoMa Plan, approved amendments to the Planning Code and
26 Zoning Map rezone the majority of the Plan area as Central SoMa Mixed Use ("CMUO") and Mixed
27 Use-General District ("MUG"). Permitted uses in the CMUO sites include residential uses. (SF
28 Planning Code, § 848 [approved].) Permitted uses in the MUG sites also include residential uses.
- 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

- (SF Planning Code, § 840 [approved].)

2 66. The CMUO district is "designed to encourage a mix of residential and non-residential
3 uses" (Exh. 3 at p. 181.) and the MUG district encourages "[n]ew residential or mixed use
4 developments . to provide as much mixed-income family housing as possible." (Id. at p. 169.)
5 Both zones not only permit, but explicitly encourage residential use. The plan area, after being
6 rezoned to comprise a majority CMUO and MUG districts, can accommodate more housing than is
7 currently projected in the Central SoMa Plan and the EIR.

8 67. In addition, the City's Housing Element recognizes that the South of Market area can
9 accommodate more housing with higher housing density and in-fill projects. (Exh. 15 at p. I.73
10| ["with higher densities allowed in [Chinatown and South of Market], in-fill development could
aanepajo auns ay ut pouuoy drysuauured Augqe! payjuny y 11 accommodate at least an additional 9,870 units"].)

12 68. Higher density is warranted in particular because of Central SoMa's close proximity
d'TI HLINS GHHd 13 to two major and imminent public transit improvements; the new Central Subway extension of the
14 Muni Metro light rail system, running through the length of Central SoMa below 4th Street, and the
15 new Transbay Terminal, which eventually will house Caltrain and high speed rail. These two
16 projects will serve thousands of Bay Area residents and workers each day, many of whom would be
17 able to live within walking distance if a higher housing density alternative is considered and
18 ultimately adopted.

19 69. Thus, higher housing density alternative is feasible and should have been considered
20 in the EIR.

21 70. Lastly, a higher housing density alternative is reasonable, requiring no changes in
22 governmental policy or legislation. The City's Housing Element of the General Plan and its regional
23 allocation for affordable housing require the City to build a higher percentage of affordable housing
24 units relative to market-rate housing than is projected under the Central SoMa Plan.

25 71. Thus, governmental policy and implementing legislation are already pushing the City
26 toward increasing the number of housing units, both affordable and market-rate, in the Central SoMa
27 Plan area. To this end, higher housing density could have also been obtained by increasing building
28 height limits in many areas within Central SoMa and/or enlarging building footprints.

1 72. Thus, because the EIR did not consider a project alternative with higher housing
2 density that would substantially lessen environmental impacts on transit, traffic, and air quality, the
3 City failed to perform its duty under CEQA and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion under
4 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, Public Resources Code section 21002, and California Code

6 73. Therefore, One Vassar requests that the Court issue a writ of mandate commanding

14 paragraphs are fully set forth here.

15 75. The City has failed to perform its duty under CEQA and committed a prejudicial
16 abuse of discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and CEQA Guidelines section 15125
17 by not proceeding in a manner required by law. Specifically, the City committed such failure and
18 abuse of discretion by, among other things, failing to discuss the inconsistency between the Central
19 SoMa Plan's affordable housing goal, and the City's Housing Element of the General Plan's
20 affordable housing goal.

21 76. An EIR must "discuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and
22 applicable general plans . (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125(d).) An applicable plan is a plan that has
23 already been adopted and thus legally applies to a project. (See Chaparral Greens v. City of Chula
24| Vista (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1145 fn. 7.) The purpose of this requirement is to identify
25 inconsistencies that the lead agency should address and to allow the agency an opportunity to modify

26| project to avoid any inconsistencies. (See Orinda Ass'n v. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182
27 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1169.)

28 77. A proposed project's inconsistency with an applicable general plan may indicate that
- 15 -

RELIEF

the project has a significant environmental impact. (See Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue V, City of
2 Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1207.)

3 78. The Central SoMa Plan EIR stated that "[t]he objectives, principles, and
4 implementation strategies of the [Central SoMa] Plan are founded, in part, upon the policy direction
5 of the Housing Element [of the General Plan], particularly with respect to provision of affordable
6 housing, and do not present a potential conflict with those policies." (Exh. 10 at p. III-10.) This

7 conclusion is inaccurate; the Central SoMa Plan does not achieve the housing goals set forth in the
8 Housing Element.

79. The Housing Element recognizes that the City's "share of the regional housing need
10 for 2015 through 2022 has been pegged at 28,870 new units, with almost 60% to be affordable.3
3JRMEPCJO RIRIS ay ut pouuog drysauued Agqey pouwl y 11 (Exh. 15, Preface; Part II at pp. 2-3.) Moreover, "[fJor the RHINA period covering 2015 through
12 2022, ABAG has projected that at least 38% of new housing demands for San Francisco will be from dT1 HLINS GH3X 13 very low and low income households (households earning under 80% of area median income), and
14 another 22% of new housing demands to be affordable to households of moderate means (carning
15 between 80% and 120% of area median income)." (SF Planning Code, § 103(b)(4).)

16 80. The Central SoMa Plan EIR fails to discuss the inconsistency between the Central
17 SoMa Plan's and the Housing Element's differing goals for the amount of necessary new affordable
18 housing. (SF Planning Code, § 103(b)(5).)

19 81. This inconsistency indicates that the project has a significant environmental impact.
20 (See Lighthouse, 131 Cal.App.4th 1170.) The environmental impacts that will result from this
21 inconsistency are, as previously discussed, impacts on transit, traffic, and air quality. Indeed, as the
22 City has recognized, there is an environmental need "to increase housing near jobs, reduce urban
23 sprawl, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions." (Exh. 15, Preface.)

24 82. In addition, the disparity regarding affordable housing between the Central SoMa
25 Plan and the Housing Element will have an adverse impact on low-income residents and workers
26 who live and work in the City. The Central SoMa Plan, by failing to meet the Housing Element's
27 a goal for a higher percentage of affordable housing units, will mean fewer residents and workers will
28 be able to afford to live and work in the City. This will inevitably increase the number of workers

commuting to the City, causing additional environmental impacts as well as increasing the
2 percentage of homeless persons living in the City, worsening one of the City's most glaring social
3 and economic issues and one of its top political priorities.

4 83. By failing to address the Central SoMa Plan's inconsistency with the Housing
5 Element of the General Plan, the Central SoMa Plan EIR violates CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, co.
6 15125(d).)

7 84. Thus, because the EIR failed to address the Central SoMa Plan's inconsistencies with
8 the Housing Element of the General Plan, the City failed to perform its duty under CEQA and
9 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and CEQA

23 Specifically, the City committed such failure and abuse of discretion by, among other things, failing
24 to discuss inconsistencies between the Housing Sustainability District ordinance (enacted as part of
25 the Central SoMa Plan), which disincentivizes affordable housing for buildings taller than 160 feet,
26 and the Housing Element of the General Plan. In addition, the City violated Public Resources Code
27 section 21155.10 by failing to supplement the Central SoMa Plan EIR and/or prepare a new EIR to a
28 consider the impacts of the Housing Sustainability District.
- 17 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

The Housing Sustainability District ordinance, adopted as part of the Central SoMa 88.

2 Plan, is inconsistent with the Housing Element of the General Plan because it creates a disincentive it
3 to construct affordable housing in projects taller than 160 feet, whereas the Housing Element calls
4 for substantial increases in the construction of affordable housing.

89. The Housing Sustainability District ordinance a provides a "streamlined, ministerial
6 approval process" for eligible residential and mixed-use projects in the Central SoMa Plan area. 5

7 (Exh. § 16, SF Planning Code, § 343(a).) However, projects over 160-feet tall are ineligible for this

8 process unless they satisfy certain requirements.
90. For projects over 160 feet tall, the project's "principal use" must be "housing, where
10 all such housing is restricted for a minimum of 55 years as affordable for 'persons and families of 9

aumepajoanS oup ug P 11 low or moderate income,' as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50093[.]" (Id.,
12 (d)(4).) If the building is not 100 percent affordable housing, it will not receive expedited review.
TI HLIWS OITH 91. This severe restriction on buildings taller than 160 feet disincentivizes construction
daysauured Avuqe! paqtuat V 14 of any affordable housing units whatsoever. If a developer of a building taller than 160 feet will not 13

15 receive expedited review unless he includes 100 percent affordable housing units, that developer
16 may choose not to include any affordable housing units at all. This is because a developer does not
17 have a financial incentive to include 100 percent affordable housing units in a project that is taller
18 than 160 feet just to obtain expedited ministerial review because that project is not a money-making
19 endeavor.

20 92. However, a developer does have an incentive to include a smaller percentage of
21 affordable housing units in a project to receive expedited review because there is a cost benefit in
22 saving time and eliminating the uncertainty of discretionary review. The Housing Sustainability
23 District ordinance is written in such a way that it will have the opposite of its intended effect;
24 discouraging rather than encouraging the construction of affordable housing units in new projects.
25 In effect, the Housing Sustainability District ordinance caps projects within the district at 160 feet in
26 height.

27 93. As previously discussed supra, the Housing Element of the City's General Plan
28 requires the City to establish more affordable housing. (Exh. 15 at p. I.33.) By encouraging less, not

of the Central 1 more, affordable housing, the Housing Sustainability District ordinance that is part
2 SoMa Plan conflicts with the City's Housing Element.

3 94. Encouraging less affordable housing will have an adverse impact on low-income
4 residents and workers who live and work in the City. The Housing Sustainability District ordinance,
5 by discouraging projects taller than 160 feet from including affordable housing units in the project,
6 will lead to the creation of fewer affordable housing units. This means fewer residents and workers
7 will be able to afford to live and work in the City. This will inevitably increase the percentage of
8 homeless living in the City, worsening one of the City's most glaring social and economic issues and
9 supposedly one of its top political priorities.

10 95. By failing to discuss the inconsistency between the Housing Sustainability District
aseaupcjo ajms aq ui pouuoy drsaqued Aguqeu pozway y 11 ordinance and the Housing Element, the Central SoMa Plan EIR violates CEQA.

12 96. Therefore, One Vassar requests that the Court issue a writ of mandate commanding d'TT HIINS CHAN 13 the City to reverse certification of the EIR; to address the Housing Sustainability District ordinance's
14 inconsistencies with the Housing Element of the General Plan; and to then certify an EIR in

To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initlal paper. Faiture to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) prejudgment writ of attachment. The Identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the is case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
