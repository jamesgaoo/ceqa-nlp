PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5 and

2 California Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., Golden State Environmental Justice
3 Alliance (*Petitioner") brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of its members, and on

4 behalf of the general public to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and

5 alleges as follows:

6

7 INTRODUCTION

8 1. This action concerns the approval by the City of San Jacinto City Council ("City

9 Council) of the construction of a project called KPC Promenade ("Project").
10 2. The City of San Jacinto ("City") has adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration

11 ("MND") for the Project in contravention of the requirements of the California Environmental

12 Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq., hereinafter "CEQA").

13 3. The City violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project because Petitioner

14 and other interested individuals have presented substantial evidence in support of a fair argument

15 that the Project will have significant, unmitigated impacts on the environment. The City turned a

16 blind eye to the abundant evidence before it. CEQA does not allow for such clear evidence of

17 environmental impact to be disregarded. An Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") must be
18 prepared to fully analyze and mitigate for all of the impacts of the Project.

19 4. The MND is also deficient in that it evaluates environmental impacts from an
20 improper baseline of environmental conditions, defers the development and imposition of
21 mitigation measures for the approval of other agencies, fails to consider all impact of the Project

22 by improperly segmenting the analysis of the Project, and ignores the cumulative impact of the
23 Project on communities that are already heavily impacted by other developments. The MND is
24 therefore invalid and its approval must be denied.

25 5. Petitioner has been deprived of its rights by these actions. Respondents have
26 failed to comply with CEQA by ignoring fair arguments supported by substantial evidence of

27 multiple significant impacts of the proposed Project and by relying upon legally deficient,
28 factually erroneous, and completely illogical arguments in the MND. Members of the public
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

including Petitioner herein -- have thus been deprived of the opportunity to exercise their rights

2 under CEQA to ensure that the significant impacts on their community are fully considered and

3 addressed, to review and comment on the Project, and to have their comments considered and

4 responded to by the government decisionmakers. Petitioner asks only that an EIR be prepared to

5 fairly assess the environmental impacts and mitigation measures in a complete, neutral, even-
6 handed manner - the basic process required by law.

7

8 PARTIES

9 6. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("GSEJA") is a nonprofit,

10 advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the promotion

11 of safe and healthy communities. It is a corporation formed and operating under the laws of the

12 State of California. Members of GSEJA are taxpayers who reside in and/or near the City of San

13 Jacinto and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts and have an

14 interest in ensuring open, accountable, and responsive government and in protecting the region's

15 environment. Members of GSEJA participated in administrative proceedings before the City
16 concerning the Project. Members of GSEJA bring this action on behalf of the public and are

17 acting as private attorney generals conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a large

18 class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

19 7. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF SAN JACINTO is a municipal corporation,

20 duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of California as a charter city located in

21 the County of Riverside.

22 8. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF SAN JACINTO CITY COUNCIL is the

23 governing body of the City of San Jacinto.

24 9. Respondents and Defendants DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are persons who act

25 on behalf of, as agents of, administer decisions reached by, or carry out responsibilities placed

26 upon them by Respondents. Petitioner is unaware of the true names, identities, and official titles

27 of Does through 100, and are currently unable to learn them. Petitioner therefore sues them by
28 these fictitious names. When Petitioner has ascertained the names, identities, and official titles
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

M of Does 1 through 100, it will seek leave of court to amend this petition and complaint to allege

2 the same.

3 10. Real Party in Interest LATHAM MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING

4 SERICES, INC., at all times herein was, and is now, a business entity duly organized and

5 existing and licensed to do business, and actually doing business in the County of Riverside,

6 California, with its principle place of business in County of Riverside, California.

7 11. Real Party in Interest THE KPC GROUP, at all times herein was, and is now, a

8 business entity of form unknown, doing business in County of Riverside, California, with its

9 principle place of business in County of Riverside, California.

10 12. Real Party in Interest LATHAM DEVELOPMENT, at all times herein was, and is

11 now, a business entity of form unknown, doing business in County of Riverside, California, with

12 its principle place of business in County of Riverside, California.

13 13. Real Party in Interest LATHAM MANAGEMENT GROUP, at all times herein

14 was, and is now, a business entity of form unknown, doing business in County of Riverside,

15 California, with its principle place of business in County of Riverside, California.

16 14. Real Parties in Interest LATHAM MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING

17 SERVICES, INC., THE KPC GROUP, LATHAM DEVELOPMENT, and LATHAM
18 MANAGEMENT GROUP are the owners, lessees, and/or developers of the property that is the

19 subject of this action and the underlying determinations challenged herein, and are the

20 proponents of the Project and the applicants for the approvals that are the subject of this action.

21 15. Real Parties in Interest DOES 101 through 200, inclusive, are persons who act on
22 behalf of, as agents of, administer decisions reached by, or carry out responsibilities placed upon

23 them by Real Parties in Interest LATHAM MANAGEMENT AND CONSULTING SERVICES,

.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 16. Jurisdiction lies in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, in

5 that Petitioner seek to compel the performance of acts which the law specifically enjoins,

6 namely, the denial of adoption of an inadequate MND, and the preparation of an EIR and full

7 compliance with the provisions of CEQA.

8 17. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, in

9 that Respondent City of San Jacinto is within the County of Riverside.

10

11 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

12 18. The California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code

13 section 21000 et seq., is based upon the principle that "[the maintenance of a quality

14 environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern."

15 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).) CEQA requires that "public agencies should not
16 approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures

17 available which would substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such
18 projects." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.)

19 19. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
20 goals, principally the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). This procedure provides both for

21 determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the environment of

22 discretionary projects which governmental agencies propose to approve, and requires a

23 description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation measures to
24 lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.) CEQA is not merely a
25 procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive responsibilities on agencies that propose to
26 approve projects, requiring that public agencies not approve projects that harm the environment
27 unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are employed to minimize that harm. (Pub.

28 Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21002.1, subd. (b).)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

- 20.

2 An EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole

3 record before the lead agency, that the project may have significant effect on the

4 environment..." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (d).) An EIR must be prepared "if a lead

5 agency is presented with a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

6 environment ... even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the

7 project will not have a significant effect." (14 Cal. Code Reg., § 15064, subd. (f)(1).)

21.

8 Under specific and limited circumstances, the public agency evaluating a

9 proposed project may find that an EIR is not required. In such cases, the agency may adopt a

10 negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration. A negative declaration may be prepared

11 and adopted for a proposed project that "will not have a significant effect on the environment and

12 does not require the preparation of an environmental impact report." (Pub. Resources Code,

13 § 21064.) An MND may be prepared and adopted when "revisions in the project plans... would
avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the
14 environment would occur" and "there is not substantial evidence in light of the whole record

15 before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the
16 I environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21064.5.) If either of these conditions does not apply to

17 the project in question, the agency must prepare an EIR.

18 22.

19 Because informing the public about the environmental impacts of a proposed

20 project is a critical function of CEQA, any proposed mitigation measures in the MND must be

21 made available for public review and comment prior to adoption of the declaration. (Pub.
Resources Code, § 21081.6, subd. (c).)

22 23.

23 Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry
out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to the Project's impacts is
24 developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires
25 invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have
26 produced a different result. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.)

27 24.

28 CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt
guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Resources Code,
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

P 21083.) These guidelines, which are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, section

2 15000 et seq. (hereinafter "Guidelines"), are binding on all state and local agencies, including
3 Respondents.

4 25. The Guidelines establish procedures for calculating the baseline environmental

5 conditions at a proposed project site, providing that "[a]nEIR must include a description of the

6 physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the

7 notice of preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time the
8 environmental analysis is commenced...." (14 Cal. Code Reg., § 15125 (a)(emphasis added).)

9 26. The Guidelines also require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
10 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (14 Cal. Code Reg., 15063

11 (a)(1).) CEQA defines project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in

12 either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

13 change in the environment." (14 Cal. Code Reg., § 15378 (a).)

14

15 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

16 27. The proposed Project involves 22.43 acres of land and is a four-story, 120-room
17 hotel with a height of up to 96 feet; a 6600 square feet urgent care medical office building; a

18 service station/car wash with a 3500 square feet convenience store; a three-story gated 114-room

19 active senior apartment development; 4 commercial pads including a 4300 square feet drive-

20 through restaurant, a 3500 square feet drive-through restaurant, 5000 square feet full service

21 restaurant, and a 6300 a square feet retail building; associated parking and an 0.85 acre retention

22 basin.

23 28. Based on the Initial Study for the Project, a Mitigated Negative Declaration was

24 prepared for this Project.

25 29. The MND for the Project is fatally flawed in several respects, including, but not

26 limited to:

27 The project proposes to amend the existing General Plan land use designation from

28 Low Density Residential to Community Commercial. Chapter 12 of the 1993
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 SCAQMD CEQA Air Quality Handbook provides consistency determinations for

2 development proposals that differ from the land use designation assumed within

3 SCAQMD 2016 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP). The CEQA Air Quality

4 Handbook indicates that consistency with AQMP growth assumptions must be

5 analyzed for new or amended General Plan elements, Specific Plans, and significant

6 projects. The MND does not provide any statement regarding the inconsistency

7 between the proposed project and the project site's existing General Plan Land Use

8 designation. The MND concludes the project "would be consistent with the future

9 General Plan land use designation. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the project

10 would exceed the AQMP assumptions for the project site, and is found to be

11 consistent with the AQMP for the second criterion."

12 The MND does not discuss the project's inconsistency with the existing General Plan

13 Land Use designation, which is also utilized by SCAG for the Regional

14 Transportation/Sustainable Communities Strategy (RTP/SCS) analysis. The MND is

15 misleading to the public and decision makers by concluding that the project's

16 consistency with the future General Plan Land Use designation means it is consistent

17 with SCAG's RTP/SCS and the AQMP. The existing General Plan Land Use (Low
18 Density Residential) was analyzed in SCAG's RTP/SCS, not the proposed

19 Community Commercial designation. The project is not consistent with the AQMP or

20 SCAG's RTP/SCS and a finding of significance must be made. The MND is

21 misleading and avoids providing meaningful analysis regarding the General Plan

22 consistency requirement because the project requires a General Plan Amendment to

23 be implemented. An EIR must be prepared which provides meaningful analysis of the

24 proposed project's inconsistency with the 2016 AQMP to disclose the potentially

25 significant Air Quality Impacts to the public and decision makers.

26 Further, General Plan Land Use Element Table LU-3 Development Capacity projects

27 0 dwelling units in the Community Commercial land use designation. The project

28 proposes 114 senior apartment dwelling units. The MND does not provide any
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

analysis or discussion of the project's conflict with this projection. The MND is

2 inadequate as an informational document and does not provide meaningful analysis

3 regarding how the proposed project will not conflict with the goals and policies of the
General Plan Land Use Plan and SCAG's (RTP/SCS) analysis.

5 The MND states that analysis of several pollutants that are included in California

6 Standards for Ambient Air Quality were not included in the Air Quality Analysis

7 (AQA). For example, the AQA does not analyze lead or hydrogen sulfide because

8 "the project is not anticipated to emit lead" and the project "would not generate

9 hydrogen sulfide in any substantial quantity."The MND utilizes uncertain language

10 in its methodology and an EIR must be prepared to provide supporting evidence for

11 these assertions.

12 Further, Table 2 Regional Significance - Construction Emissions (pounds/day) in the

13 MND (listed as Table 8 in the Air Quality Analysis) includes emissions analysis of

14 overlapping construction phases (construction, architectural coatings, and paving

15 phases). However, the CalEEMod Output Sheets included in the Air Quality Analysis

16 do not model overlap of any construction phases.

17 The MND's conclusion that overlapping phases will not exceed SCAQMD thresholds

18 for emissions is not supported by evidence or analysis included in the AQA. An EIR

19 must be prepared which provides the modeling analysis for the overlap of

20 construction phases.

21 Section 8.40.090(A) of the San Jacinto Municipal Code (SJMC) prohibits

22 construction activity between the hours of 7:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M. Monday through

23 Saturday. All such activities are also prohibited on Sundays. Thus, the legal hours of

24 construction in the City of San Jacinto are 7:00 A.M. - 7:00 P.M., Monday - Saturday.

25 The MND does not provide a "worst-case scenario" analysis of construction

26 equipment emitting pollutants for the legal 12 hours per day. It is legal for

27 construction to occur for much longer hours and an additional day (6 days per week

28 including Saturday) than modeled in the Air Quality Analysis. The Air Quality
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

modeling must be revised to account for these legally possible longer construction

2 days and increased number of construction days. If shorter hours of construction are

3 proposed by the project, this must be reflected in the MND analysis and included as

4 an enforceable mitigation measure with field verification by an enforcement entity of

5 the lead agency (CEQA § 21081.6 (b)).

6 The MND includes Mitigation Measure (MM) AQ-1 which states: MM AQ-1: The

7 project is required during grading to limit the daily disturbance area of 5 acres or less.

8 However, MM AQ-1 is unenforceable as there is no enforcement entity, field
verification, or lead agency oversight component. An EIR must be prepared with

10 revised Mitigation Measures to include consistent and timely verification of

11 compliance by the Lead Agency throughout the duration of project construction in

12 order to comply with CEQA § 15126.4 (a)(2).

13 According to the technical Biological Appendix preliminary survey conducted on

14 January 26, 2016, "A pair of burrowing owls were observed on site. At the time of the

15 survey, they had taken up residence in a set of abandoned Beechey ground squirrel

16 burrows." During the preconstruction survey on August 26, 2016, "The burrowing

17 owl burrows had been artificially filled in and the burrowing owl pair was no longer

18 resident at the location of the burrows where they were observed previously. The field

19 team inspected other previously unoccupied burrows, but there was no sign of the

20 burrowing owl pair or any other burrowing owls." The Appendix concludes that "Due

21 to the nature of the damage to the burrows, it was impossible to determine if the

22 burrows had been filled in before the animals had left or after" and no burrowing

23 owls were resident on the site. The Appendix describes the burrows as filled in

24 "artificially", meaning they were not filled in intentionally by the burrowing owls.

25 The Appendix does not describe the observation and presence of any species at the

26 site that would be a threat to the burrowing owl as supporting evidence for the burrow

27 fill. The artificial fill of the burrows are implementation of the project without CEQA

28 review.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

P The MND concludes that because the burrowing owls were not present on the site

2 during the preconstruction survey on August 26, 2016, no mitigation is required. This

3 conflicts with the recommended mitigation included in the technical Biological
71n 0 A Appendix which states:
A pre-construction burrowing owl survey following the recommended
guidelines of the MSHCP be conducted.
• If BUOW are found during the MSHCP-required 30-day pre-construction
ag survey, the project proponent should immediately inform the Regional
O Conservation Authority (RCA) and the Wildlife Agencies, and would need to

10 coordinate further with RCA and the Wildlife Agencies, with the possibility

11 for preparation of a Burrowing Owl Protection and Relocation Plan to be

12 reviewed and approved prior to initiating ground disturbance.

13 At minimum, the recommended mitigation measures in the technical Biological

14 Appendix must be included in a project EIR. The following mitigation measures

15 regarding burrowing owls must also be implemented in a project EIR in order reduce

16 the significant impacts to the burrowing owl:

17 1. If BUOW are present, Project activities will take place outside the BUOW

18 breeding season (February 1 to August 31), 1 to the greatest extent feasible.

19 2. If Project activities occur during the breeding season and nesting BUOW

20 are present, a buffer will be flagged and/or fenced for avoidance in all Project

21 areas within the vicinity of the burrow according to the buffer distances

22 recommended by the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) Staff

23 Report and RCA guidelines.

24 3. In the event that an active BUOW burrow is detected during the non-

25 breeding season (September 1 to January 31), a buffer will be flagged and/or

26 fenced for avoidance in all Project areas within the vicinity of the burrow

27 according to the buffer distances recommended by the CDFW Staff Report.

28 4. Monitoring will be conducted to ensure the appropriate buffers, as
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

F determined by an approved qualified biologist, are adhered to by construction

2 personnel and that they are adequate to provide the necessary protection.
3 When construction activities commence adjacent to the buffer area, a qualified
v biologist will be present on-site during all construction activities to monitor
un the behavior of BUOW for at least 3 days. The qualified biologist will have
6 the authority to increase the setback distance and/or halt construction activities

7 if there are signs of disturbance, such as changes in behavior as a result of

co construction or other indications of distress by BUOW. If the type of
construction activity adjacent to the buffer increases in intensity, an additional

10 3 day monitoring period will be implemented to ensure the buffer is adequate

11 under the changed circumstances.

12 5. If BUOW occupancy on site is confirmed and relocation is necessary,

13 CDFW will be notified and the BUOW exclusion procedures will be

14 implemented, per recommendations set forth by the CDFW Staff Report.

15 Threshold A - The MND concludes that "the location is along the perimeter of an

16 established community along a major transportation corridor and the San Jacinto

17 River" resulting in a less than significant impact. However, the MND does not

18 provide any evidence or analysis to support this conclusion. An EIR must be prepared

19 which includes this analysis. This is especially necessary as the MND states "the

20 design of the senior residential housing severs circulation patterns that were partially

21 constructed for the adjoining single family development." The MND does not discuss

22 the termination of Cornflower Avenue and Poppy Street in the adjacent residential

23 community, or the impact of the proposed project on the recorded residential lots

24 established by Tract 32053 on the remainder parcel, which could have potentially

25 significant impacts. An EIR must be prepared which provides this analysis in order to

26 comply with CEQA's requirements for meaningful disclosure.

27 Threshold B - The MND states that "The project site is designated for single family

28 residential development within the existing General Plan and Zoning Map. A General
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

1 Plan Amendment and change of zone applications have been filed in conjunction with

2 development plans to establish a commercial zoning designation that reflects the
w D proposed development and the emerging development pattern in the area. The
General Plan Amendment would have to be approved in order for other applications
to be approved.' However, the MND does not provide any supporting evidence or

6 meaningful analysis to support this conclusion. The San Jacinto General Plan

7 provides policies and guidance regarding land use in the City, but there the MND

8 does not include discussion of any General Plan goals or policies in relation with the

9 proposed project.

10 Notably, General Plan Land Use Element Table LU-3 Development Capacity projects

11 0 dwelling units in the Community Commercial land use designation. The project

12 proposes 114 senior apartment dwelling units. The MND does not provide any

13 analysis or discussion of the project's conflict with this projection. The MND is

14 inadequate as an informational document and does not provide meaningful analysis

15 regarding how the proposed project will not conflict with the goals and policies of the

16 General Plan Land Use Plan.

17 Threshold C Again, the MND concludes that because the burrowing owls were not

18 present on the site during the preconstruction survey on August 26, 2016, no

19 mitigation is required. This conflicts with the recommended mitigation included in

20 the technical Biological Appendix. The same burrowing owl mitigation measures

21 suggested in the Biological Resources section of this comment letter must also be

22 applied in the Land Use and Planning section of a project EIR.

23 The MND is erroneous and inadequate as an informational document. The MND

24 a states as a "Finding of Fact" that "Section 8.40.090 of the noise ordinance allows for

25 construction to occur between the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays. On

26 the weekends construction must not create or produce loud noise that disrupts a

27 person of normal sensitivity who works or resides in the vicinity, or a peace officer,

28 on any weekend of federal holiday." This statement is not accurate and does not
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

reflect the text of SJMC Section 8.40.090 - Construction activity noise regulations:

2 A. Weekdays and Saturdays. No person shall engage in construction, remodeling,

3 digging, grading, demolition or any other related building activity, nor shall

4 operate any tool, equipment or machine, on any weekday or Saturday except
between the hours of seven a.m. and seven p.m.
Thus, the legal hours of construction in the City of San Jacinto are 7:00 A.M. - 7:00

7 P.M., Monday - Saturday. The MND is inadequate as an informational document and

8 cannot be relied upon by the public or decision makers. An EIR must be prepared and

9 circulated for public review.

10 Further, the technical Acoustic Study did not analyze any sensitive receptors to the

11 south of the project site across Main Street. An EIR must be prepared and circulated

12 for public review which includes analysis of the existing residences south of the

13 project site across Main Street.

14 The technical Acoustic Study includes basic information regarding construction

15 noise, but does not include any analysis of the project's potentially significant

16 construction noise impacts. The Acoustic Study asserts that the "degree of

17 construction noise may vary for different areas of the project site and also vary

18 depending on the construction activities. Noise levels associated with the construction

19 will vary with the different phases of construction." There is no quantified analysis of

20 the project's construction noise levels and how it may impact sensitive receptors or

21 exceed exterior/interior noise standards set by the City of San Jacinto in the General

22 Plan or Section 8.40 - Noise Control of the Municipal Code.

23 Even though the technical Acoustic Study does not include construction analysis, the

24 MND makes its own threshold that construction noise "would be considered

25 significant if construction activities are taken outside the allowable times as described

26 in the City's Municipal Code." The MND states that "construction noise will have a

27 temporary or periodic increase in the ambient noise level above the existing within

28 the project vicinity" but does not provide supporting evidence to demonstrate that
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 14

these increases do not exceed the maximum 65 dBA exterior noise level and 45 dBA

2 interior noise level for the nearby single family home sensitive receptors as outlined

3 by the San Jacinto Municipal Code. An EIR must be prepared for the project which

4 includes an adequate, quantifiable construction noise analysis.
The MND includes Mitigation Measures (MM) N-1, N-2, and N-3. However, these

6 Mitigation Measures are unenforceable as there is no enforcement entity, field

7 verification, or lead agency oversight component. An EIR must be prepared with

8 revised Mitigation Measures to include consistent and timely verification of

9 compliance by the Lead Agency throughout the duration of project construction in

10 order to comply with CEQA § 15126.4 (a)(2).

11 N-1: Construction operations must follow the City's General Plan and the Noise

12 Ordinance, which states that construction, repair or excavation work performed must

13 occur within the permissible hours. To further ensure that construction activities do

14 not disrupt the adjacent land uses, the following measures should be taken:

15 1. Construction should occur during the permissible hours as defined in Section

16 8.40.090.

17 2. During construction, the contactor shall ensure all construction equipment is

18 equipped with appropriate noise attenuating devices.

19 3. The contractor should locate equipment staging areas that will create the

20 greatest distance between construction-related noise/vibration sources and

21 sensitive receptors nearest the project site during all project construction.

22 4. Idling equipment shall be turned off when not in use.

23 5. Equipment shall be maintained so that vehicles and their loads are secured from

24 rattling and banging.

25 MM N-1 utilizes uncertain language by stating that construction "should" occur

26 during the permissible hours of construction in the City and the contractor "should"

27 locate equipment staging furthest from sensitive receptors. MM N-1 must be revised

28 to utilize enforceable language which requires the project to adhere to these
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

T guidelines during construction instead of merely suggestive and uncertain language.

2 Further, it must be revised to include a contact name and phone number for a lead

3 agency enforcement entity to report violations or work conducted outside of the legal

4 hours of construction in order to comply with CEQA § 15126.4 (a)(2).

5 N-2: Prior to obtaining building permits, the applicant shall provide an interior

6 acoustic isolation analysis verifying separating assemblies (e.g. demising wall and

7 floor/ceiling assemblies) for the senior housing and hotel meet Title 24 STC/IIC

8 sound attenuation requirement as outlined within Chapter 12, Section 1207 of the

9 2013 California Building Code.

10 MM N-2 represents deferred mitigation as the interior acoustical analysis is not

11 required until the applicant wishes to obtain building permits. The interior acoustical

12 analysis will not be made available for public review through this MM, which is

13 implementation of the project without CEQA review. An EIR must be prepared for

14 the project which includes the interior acoustical analysis for public review.

15 N-3: An exterior post-construction acoustical study shall be prepared for review and

16 approval by staff to assure that noise from the proposed car wash into adjoining

17 property will comply with the Section 8.40.090 of the Municipal Code. Appropriate

18 noise attenuation measures shall be recommended and incorporated into the project

19 design to maintain a noise level of 65 dba or less extending off site.

20 MM N-3 represents deferred mitigation. The post-post-construction acoustical

21 analysis will not be made available for public review through this MM, which is

22 implementation of the project without CEQA review. An EIR must be prepared for

23 the project which includes an acoustic study of an existing car wash that operates in

24 similar conditions as supporting evidence to provide an accurate estimation of the

25 potential noise impacts from the proposed car wash on nearby sensitive receptors.

26 Threshold A - The MND does not address the potentially significant impacts related

27 to inducing substantial population growth in an area, either directly or indirectly. The

28 MND does not give a population estimate based on the existing General Plan/Zoning
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

designations in comparison to the proposed General Plan/Zoning designations. The

2 MND simply states that the "proposed project will introduce multiple family density
of 16 units per acre that adjoins land containing recorded lots for single family

4 density at 4 units per acre." This statement does not provide any meaningful analysis

5 or supporting evidence to conclude there will not be direct or indirect substantial

6 population growth in the area.

7 The MND also does not discuss that the population growth will exceed SCAG's

8 projections because the proposed project requires a General Plan Amendment to be

9 implemented in order to increase the allowable density of the project site which in

10 turn increases the number of units assumed at General Plan Build Out by SCAG.

11 SCAG's 2016 RTP/SCS population projections utilized the existing San Jacinto

12 General Plan Land Use designations for analysis. The MND fails to discuss or

13 analyze this fact. An EIR must be prepared and circulated for public review to include

14 this analysis in order to present the project's potentially significant impacts and be an

15 adequate informational document. The EIR must analyze the potentially significant

16 impacts related to direct and indirect population growth resulting from development

17 of the project and proposed land use policy changes.

18 The technical Transportation/Traffic Analysis does not include the proposed car wash

19 in trip generation estimates for the project. An EIR must be prepared which includes

20 the proposed car wash in trip generation estimates in order to accurately analyze

21 traffic impacts.

22 Threshold B - The MND states that the realignment of "SR-79 between Domenigoni

23 Parkway and Gilman Springs Road as a freeway facility will reduce traffic volumes at

24 the Sanderson Avenue/Ramona Expressway intersection and produce an acceptable

25 level of service" for the proposed project. The MND continues by stating that

26 "Mitigation Measure T-1 requires that improvement to be in place prior to the

27 occupancy of the hotel," meaning that the hotel must remain vacant after construction

28 until the SR-79 realignment is completed by Caltrans and the Riverside County
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

Transportation Commission (RCTC). However, the MND is not internally accurate as

2 MM T-1 does not include this requirement as outlined by the MND's discussion. MM
3 T-1 states:

+10 0 MM T-1 Sanderson Avenue/Ramona Expressway: The proposed SR-79
realignment project, currently in the environmental review phase, will realign SR-
79 between Domenigoni Parkway and Gilman Springs Road as a freeway facility, a
A 0 which will reduce traffic volumes at the Sanderson Avenue/Ramona Expressway
intersection and supersede the need for any further widening of the intersection.
O This project is funded in part with TUMF fees. Therefore, compliance with
10 Mitigation Measure T-4 will reduce this impact to a level of insignificance.

11 According to the Riverside County Transportation Commission, the SR-79 project is

12 still in the pre-construction phase and "the funding sources are currently funded far

13 below historical levels. Until additional funding is available, RCTC cannot proceed

14 with right-of-way acquisition or construction of the project1." It is uncertain

15 mitigation to require completion of the SR-79 realignment before the hotel may be

16 a issued a certificate of occupancy and begin operations. There is no evidence that the

17 SR-79 realignment will be completed in any reasonable time period and the

18 improvements are beyond the jurisdiction of the City. If the hotel is constructed, it

19 must be left vacant until the SR-79 realignment is completed according to the MND

20 (which is not internally accurate as MM T-1 does not include this requirement as

21 outlined by other text in the MND). The MND attempts to mitigate the impacts to

22 Sanderson Avenue/Ramona Expressway with uncertain mitigation. An EIR must be

23 prepared for the project which includes enforceable mitigation that will reasonably

24 result in quantifiably reduced traffic impacts.

25 The MND also concludes that implementation of Mitigation Measure T-4 will

26 mitigate the cumulatively significant impacts at study intersections. However, MM T-

27 4 requires the project applicant to contribute funds towards the SR-79 freeway

28 upgrade, which is under Caltrans jurisdiction.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 18

1 MM T-4: The applicant shall participate in the funding or construction of regional

2 improvements, including the SR 79 freeway upgrade, that are needed to serve

3 cumulative traffic conditions through the payment of the Transportation Uniform

4 Mitigation Fees (TUMF) and City of San Jacinto Development Impact Fees (DIF) or

5 a fair share contribution as directed by the City.

6 An assessment of fees is appropriate when linked to a specific mitigation program.

7 (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, Save

8 our Peninsula Comm. v. Monterey County Bd. Of Supers. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99,

9 141.) Payment of fees is not sufficient where there is no evidence mitigation will

10 actually result. (Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099,1122.) The

11 assessment of fees here is not adequate as there is no evidence mitigation will actually

12 result. The improvements to the SR-79 freeway will be completed by Caltrans which

13 is beyond the jurisdiction of the City of San Jacinto. The MND includes uncertain

14 mitigation as the completion of the necessary improvements are beyond the

15 jurisdiction of the lead agency. An EIR must be prepared for the project which

16 includes enforceable mitigation that will reasonably result in quantifiably reduced

17 traffic impacts.

18 The Traffic Study Appendix includes Exhibit 7 - Cumulative Project Map and Table

19 12 - Summary of Cumulative Projects which do not indicate the city each cumulative

20 project is located in. 39 of the 45 projects do not include a name of each project

21 either, only an acronym for what can be assumed to be a zoning case number or tract

22 number. The project site is adjacent to the borders of Hemet and Riverside County

23 land, and the public cannot clearly determine which of these projects in each of those

24 jurisdiction. Exhibit 7 is illegible and does not include street names in order for the

25 public to located each project. Additionally, the traffic study utilizes an arbitrary 3

26 mile radius of the project site without discussion for why this radius is appropriate.

27 This does not comply with CEQA's requirements for meaningful disclosure and an

28 EIR must be prepared which includes this information. :

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 19

Threshold A - Again, the MND does not include mitigation measures related to the
2 burrowing owls found on the project site. This conflicts with the recommended

3 mitigation included in the technical Biological Appendix. The analysis here does not
discuss the burrowing owl at all. An EIR must be prepared for the project with

5 analysis of impacts upon wildlife resources, including the burrowing owl which was

6 found on the project site.

7 Threshold C The analysis here must focus on the threshold which analyzes impacts

8 that are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable. The MND does not

9 analyze impacts from all environmental categories, but instead states that they are not
10 cumulatively significant because none of the project-level significance thresholds will
11 be exceeded. This is counter to the threshold for analysis which includes "impacts
12 that are individually limited." The MND also references adoption of the San Jacinto
13 General Plan EIR, for which "the City Council adopted a Statement of Overriding
14 Considerations that determined that the benefits accrued through the build-out of the
15 SJGP overrode the resulting impacts" and analyzes the "relationship of certain
16 potentially significant impacts from the proposed project to the SJGP EIR" in this
17 section. The MND does not consider that the General Plan did not include the

18 proposed project because the project requires a General Plan Amendment in order to
19 be implemented. An EIR must be prepared which includes cumulative analysis and
20 modeling for all environmental factors. This is especially true given a lead agency's
21 ability to approve a project notwithstanding significant environmental impacts. The
22 EIR must be revised to include information to support the claim that cumulative
23 impacts will be less than significant.

24 30. The MND should not have been certified because Petitioner and other members of

25 the community have provided substantial evidence in support of a fair argument that the Project
26 will have significant impacts that are not adequately mitigated, requiring the preparation of an
27 EIR. Further, the MND insufficiently and incorrectly analyzes the impacts of the Project,
28 improperly defers development of mitigation measures, and inappropriately segments the
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 20

T Project.

2 31. Respondents have ignored this substantial evidence and have failed to adhere to

3 their legal duty to prepare an EIR when substantial evidence shows that a project will create

4 significant, unmitigated impacts.

5 32. In light of the evidence introduced by Petitioner and that are present in

6 Respondents' own analysis, Respondents cannot logically conclude that "there is no substantial

7 evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may

8 have a significant effect on the environment." (Public Resources Code, § 21064.5.) Such

9 evidence is abundant in the record. Respondents' decision to adopt the MND falls far short of
10 their obligation under CEQA to adopt an MND only when there is no substantial evidence of

11 unmitigated impacts before them.

12 33. The MND is also legally deficient because its defers mitigation measures for

13 approval of other agencies or for future consideration, and therefore fails to make mitigation

14 measures available for public review and comment as required by CEQA. The MND is also
15 legally deficient because it does not contain all necessary measures to mitigate the significant
16 impacts.

17 34. On or about April 2, 2019, the City and City Council approved the Project. This
18 action is timely filed within the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.

19

20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 California Environmental Quality Act

22 (Against all Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

23 35. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 30 above by this

24 reference as though set out fully herein.

25 36. Petitioner brings this action to set aside Respondents' approval of the Project and
26 their adoption of the MND for the Project.

27 37. In deciding to undertake the actions set forth in the preceding paragraph despite
28 the facts that the process and procedure violated CEQA and that the MND contained substantive
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 21

and procedural inadequacies, Respondents City and City Council proceeded in excess of their
2 jurisdiction, deprived Petitioner of fair notice and comment procedures, and a fair hearing, and

3 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by not proceeding in the manner required by law, and

4 by reaching a decision and findings that were not supported by substantial evidence.

5 38. In particular, the adoption of the MND violated CEQA, and Respondents failed to

6 proceed in the manner required by law and/or made erroneous and inadequate decisions or

7 findings, in at least the following respects:

8 39. Respondents violated CEQA by, inter alia, ignoring substantial evidence in

9 support of a fair argument that the Project will cause significant unmitigated impacts.

10 40. An EIR under CEQA must be prepared whenever a fair argument supported by

11 substantial evidence shows that the project may cause significant environmental impacts.

12 41. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR despite the substantial

13 evidence on the record indicating that the proposed Project would create significant,
14 insufficiently-mitigated impacts.

15 42. Respondents violated CEQA by, inter alia, adopting the MND despite the fact that

16 the MND's baseline is erroneous and insufficient in that it fails to analyze actual significance of
17 environmental impacts.

18 43. Under CEQA, the MND must address and consider the cumulative impacts of the
19 proposed project. When considering these impacts, the agency must consider the additional
20 effects created by the project and whether these effects are significant when combined with the

21 existing cumulative effect. In its determination of the significance of cumulative impacts, the

22 agency may not rely solely on thresholds of significance if there is other substantial evidence

23 suggesting that the project will generate significant cumulative impacts.

24 44. CEQA only permits preparation and adoption of an MND when modification of

25 the plans for the proposed Project sufficiently mitigates the effects of the project to ensure that
26 no significant environmental effects will a occur as a result of the project. (Pub. Resources Code,

27 § 21064.5.)

28 45. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting an MND with inadequate plan revisions
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 22

1 and mitigation measures and thus failing to ensure that the revisions and measures would

2 sufficiently mitigate the effects of the project to a point of non-significance.

3 46. When an agency prepares an MND or negative declaration under CEQA, the

4 agency must make the proposed mitigation measures in the declaration available for public

5 review and comment before the agency adopts the declaration.

6 47. Respondents violated the review and comment policies underlying CEQA by

7 failing to include concrete or specific mitigation measures impacts generated by the proposed

8 Project and thus deprived Petitioner of its right to review and comment on the mitigation

9 measures prior to Respondents' adoption of the measures.

10 48. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the action herein and bring this

11 action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 to

12 vindicate its own interests and those of the taxpayers and citizens of the City of San Jacinto in

13 the proper implementation of the environmental and land use laws.

14

15 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

16 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

17 1. For a preliminary injunction restraining Respondents, their agents, servants,

18 employees, and all persons or entities acting under, for, in concert with, in or under contract with
19 Respondents, from taking any action to carry out the Project pending trial.

20 2. For a peremptory Writ of Mandate directing Respondents to:

21 (a) Vacate, set aside, and annul its approval of the Project;

22 (b) Suspend all activity under the Project approval that could result in any change or
23 alteration in the physical environment until Respondents have taken actions that may be

24 necessary to bring the Project approval into compliance with CEQA; and

25 (c) Prepare, circulate and consider a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report
26 ("EIR") and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the
27 Project.

28 3. In the alternative, for an Alternative Writ of Mandate directing Respondents to:
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 23

F (a) Vacate, set aside and annul its approval of the Project;
2 (b) Suspend all activity under the Project approval that could result in any change or

necessary 3 alteration in the physical environment until Respondent has taken actions that may be

4 to bring the Project approval into compliance with CEQA; and

5 (c) Prepare, circulate and consider a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report

the 6 ("EIR") and otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve
7 project; or

8 (d) Show before this Court at a time and place specified by the Court why they have not
9 done so and why Writ of Mandate should not issue.

10 4. For costs of this action;

11 5. For attorneys' fees; and

12 6. For such other equitable and legal relief as the Court deems just and proper.
