DWIGHT HILLSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION and PHILLIP BOKOVOY,
4 (collectively, "Petitioners") petition this Court on their own behalf, on behalf of their members, on
behalf of the general public and in the public interest pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") §
6 1085 and Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 21168.5, or, in the alternative, pursuant to CCP §
7 1094.5 and PRC § 21168, for a writ of mandate, and for declaratory and injunctive relief directed to

11 University of California, Berkeley, and JANET NAPOLITANO, in her official capacity as President
12 of the University of California, as well as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, (collectively,
13 "Respondents" or "University"). By this verified petition and complaint ("Petition"), Petitioners
14 allege as follows:

15 INTRODUCTION

16 1. Petitioners bring this action to challenge Respondents approval of the Clark Kerr
17 Volleyball Complex (*Volleyball Complex" or "Project") and the January 4, 2019 decision executed
18 by Respondent Vini Bhargava to issue a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") determining that the Project
19 is categorically exempt from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act
20 ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ("PRC") § 21000, et seq. The NOE improperly applies a Class 3
21 Categorical Exemption for "New Construction or Small Structures" to the Project. See 14 Cal.
22 Admin. Code 8 15303. § "Class 3 consists of construction and location of limited numbers of new,
23 small facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures;
24 and the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor
25 modifications are made in the exterior of the structure." Id.

26 2. A project of this size, scope and type of use does not qualify for the Class 3
27 Categorical Exemption. The Project proposes to remove an existing intramural and practice softball
28 field located adjacent to Dwight Way at the northern edge of the Clark Kerr Campus and construct a

2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

new intercollegiate beach volleyball complex. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon
2 allege that the Project will consist of four beach volleyball courts covering an approximately 14,000
square feet area; a 3,000 square feet building to house player locker rooms, rest rooms and storage;
4 about 3,000 square feet of concrete paving; a spectator berm that could accommodate up to 400
5 spectators; four approximately 40 foot tall field lights; a public address system; the demolition of a

6 separate building on the Clark Kerr campus, and; the hosting of intercollegiate beach volleyball
7 matches and tournaments, summer camps, and other special events. The existing softball field is not
8 being converted to another use with minor modifications. Rather, the softball facility is being
9 completely removed from the site. The type, scope and operation of the Project are inconsistent with
10 the criteria established for the Class 3 Categorical Exemption. The University abused its discretion
11 in applying the Class 3 Exemption to the Project.

12 3. An exemption also cannot be applied to the proposed Project because the Project will
13 violate several mitigation measures adopted in the environmental impact report prepared for the
14 University's anticipated acquisition of the Schools for the Deaf and for the Blind campus (which
15 became the Clark Kerr campus) and the University's site plan for the campus. (See Dwight-Derby
16 Site Reuse Study (Schools for the Deaf and for the Blind), Draft Environmental Impact Report (Dec.
17 1978) ("1978 DEIR"); Draft Dwight-Derby Site Plan and Final Environmental Impact Report
18 (Schools for the Deaf and for the Blind) (May 1979) ("1979 FEIR").) In response to noise concerns,
19 the 1979 EIR adopted Mitigation Measure No. 25(f) providing that "[n]o University activities
20 involving spectators will be scheduled." (DEIR, p. 380.) In addition, Mitigation Measure 25(e)
21 provides that "No rock concerts or other noisy activities will be scheduled in the recreation
22 facilities." (Id.) Lastly, in order to address aesthetic impacts, Mitigation Measure 26(d) provides that
23 "[t]he attractive series of outdoor spaces will be maintained in their present condition." The Project
24 will violate one or more of these adopted mitigation measures by involving spectators, scheduling
25 noisy activities and not maintaining the outdoor space at the softball field in the condition that was
26 present as of 1979. Because mitigations are required to be applied to the Project, to no exemption can
27 be applied. The University has abused its discretion and proceeded in a manner inconsistent with law
28 by approving a project that violates adopted mitigation measures for the Clark Kerr Campus.

3 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4. Alternatively, assuming the Project qualifies for the Class 3 Exemption, the

2 University abused its discretion in determining that no unusual circumstances existed with the

3 Project for the Class 3 Exemption and failed to acknowledge the additional risk of significant noise,

4 light and traffic impacts on nearby residents posed by the Project. The circumstances of the Project

5 are unusual for the Category 3 Exemption because the general circumstances of the "New

6 Construction or Small Structures" exemption facilities do not include intercollegiate athletic

7 facilities, sporting events including spectators, cheering crowds, a public address system and

8 powerful field lights. Nor do projects exempt under Class 3 involve the demolition of structures. Nor

9 do the general circumstances of exempt facilities under Class 3 include projects that violate

10 mitigation measures adopted pursuant to CEQA. Each of these unusual components for the Project
11 within the Category 3 Exemption risk significant noise, visual and traffic impacts that do not exist

12 for the general class of projects subject to Category 3.

13 5. By failing to perform any CEQA review of the Project and issuing : categorical

14 exemption for the Project, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

15 PARTIES

16 Petitioners and Plaintiffs

17 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff SAVE BERKELEY'S NEIGHBORHOODS ("SBN') is a

18 California nonprofit public benefit corporation formed to provide education and advocacy to

19 improve quality of life, protect the environment and implement best planning practices. SBN's

20 founders, members, and directors live in the vicinity of the Clark Kerr campus and in the area
21  affected by the Project. SBN and its members will suffer injury from adverse environmental impacts
22 caused by the construction and operation of the Beach Volleyball Complex if the legal violations
23 alleged in this Petition and Complaint are not remedied. SBN was formed and brings this action to

24 represent and advocate the beneficial interests of its founders, members, and directors in obtaining

25 relief from these legal violations and to improve quality of life, protect the environment and ensure
26 that the University adheres to the requirements of CEQA in evaluating projects on the Clark Kerr

27 campus, including the Project. SBN has expressed its concerns to the University and urged the
28 University to conduct review of the impacts of the Project by preparing an appropriate CEQA

1 document.

2 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff the CLAREMONT-ELMWOOD NEIGHBORHOOD

3 ASSOCIATION ("CENA") is a California non-profit corporation. CENA was formed by Berkeley

4 residents as a neighborhood association in 1969, and incorporated as a non-profit corporation in

5 1975. With over 800 members, CENA is the largest neighborhood association in Berkeley. The

6 primary goal of CENA is to make the neighborhood a safe and desirable place to live, and to keep

7 residents informed about important issues in the City and the neighborhood. CENA monitors traffic

8 and transportation, crime and public safety, emergency preparedness, open space, the local business

9 environment, city planning and the University of California's impact on the community. CENA

10 interfaces with other neighborhood associations. CENA has led the fight for balanced development,

11 for getting City Hall to address traffic problems on residential streets, for preserving parkland and

12 open space, and protecting local neighborhood merchants. CENA and its constituents are concerned

13 about the Project at issue here and its impacts on the environment and residents of Berkeley. CENA

14 has expressed its concerns in writing to the University and urged the University to conduct review of

15 the impacts of the Project by preparing an appropriate CEQA document.

16 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff PANORAMIC HILL ASSOCIATION ("PHA") is a non-

17 profit public benefit corporation established to preserve the character and represent residents of the

18 Panoramic Hill neighborhood in Berkeley, California. The Panoramic Hill neighborhood is located

19 in the Berkeley hills, overlooking the Clark Kerr campus and in close proximity to the Project. The

20 neighborhood includes numerous historic homes by renowned architects. On October 21, 2005,
21 based on the historic quality of the homes as well as the neighborhood's unique location and scenic

22 vistas, the State Office of Historic Preservation added the Panoramic Hill neighborhood to the

23 National Register of Historic Places as an historic district. PHA has expressed its concerns in

24 writing to the University and urged the University to conduct review of the impacts of the Project by

25 preparing an appropriate CEQA document.

26 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff DWIGHT-HILLSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION

27 ("DHNA") is an unincorporated association that was started about 45 years ago. The group's

28 mission is to work to preserve and enhance the livability of the neighborhood encompassed by

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Dwight Way, on the south, Hillside Ave. and Hillside Court on the east, Channing Street on the
2 north and Prospect Street on the west. Several members residing on Dwight Way and Hillside Ave.
are immediately adjacent to the softball field where the University proposed to build and operate the
4 Project. DHNA has expressed its concerns in writing to the University and urged the University to
conduct review of the impacts of the Project by preparing an appropriate CEQA document.
6 10. Petitioner and Plaintiff PHILIP BOKOVOY is a concerned citizen who resides in

7 Berkeley, in the vicinity of the Project. Mr. Bokovoy is deeply concerned about the impacts of the
8 Project, and will be directly and adversely affected if the Project is implemented in its present form.
9 Mr. Bokovoy has expressed his concerns to the University and urged the University to conduct
10 review of the impacts of the Project by preparing an appropriate CEQA document.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 17. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to CCP §§ 526 (injunctive relief),
9 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate), 1094.5 (administrative mandate); and PRC §§
10 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA). The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory
11 relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $ 1060 and § injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil
12 Procedure § 525 et seq.
13 18. Venue is proper pursuant to CCP §§ 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395
14 (actions generally) because the Respondents include an agency of the State of California, and public
15 officers of an agency of the State of California. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of
16 action alleged in this Petition arose in the County of Alameda and the Project will occur within the
17 County of Alameda and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt within the
18 County.

19 19. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations. This action is
20 timely under CEQA because it is filed within 35 days of the Notice of Exemption filed by the
21 University. (PRC § 21167(d); 14 CCR § 15112(c)(2).) §
22 20. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with
23 the requirements of PRC § 21167.5 by serving prior notice of the complaint in this action. A copy of
24 the written notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit A to the Petition in this action.
25 21. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b), Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of
26 proceedings in this matter, and are simultaneously filing their notice of intent to prepare said record
27 of proceedings with this complaint. A true and correct copy of Petitioners' Notice of Intent to
28 Prepare Record is attached to this complaint as Exhibit B.

1 22. Petitioners will provide notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State of
2 California, by serving a copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing, as required by PRC §
3 21167.7 and CCP § 388.

4 CEQA LEGAL BACKGROUND

5 23. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment . . . shall be the
6 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. PRC § 21001(d).
24. CEQA is intended to provide the fullest possible protection to the environment.
8 CEQA requires that a lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any discretionary project that may
9 have a significant adverse effect on the environment. (PRC §§21002.1(a), 21100(a), 21151(a); 14
10 CCR §§15064(a)(1), (f)(1), 15367 ("lead agency" is the "public agency which has the principal
11 responsibility for carrying out or approving a project").) "[CEQA] requires the preparation of an
12 EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have a
13 significant environmental impact." (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75; see
14 Friends of "B" Street v. City of Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002; PRC §21080(c)-(d).)
15 The "fair argument" standard establishes a low threshold for a requiring the preparation of an EIR.
16 (No Oil, Inc., 13 Cal.3d at 75; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 310.)
17 25. "The purpose of an [EIR] is to provide public agencies and the public in general with
18 detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment;
19 to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized; and to indicate
20 alternatives to such a project." (PRC § 21061; see also $21002.1.) An EIR "serves not only to
21 protect the environment but also to demonstrate to the public that it is being protected." (14 CCR
22 §15003(b).) "The EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self-
23 government." (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California (1988)
24 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) "The EIR process will enable the public to determine the environmental and
25 economic values of their elected and appointed officials thus allowing for appropriate action come
26 election day should a majority of voters disagree." (People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d
27 830, 842.)

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 26. A "project" is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken, supported, or authorized

2 by a public agency "which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a

3 reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment. (PRC § 21065; 14 CCR

4 15378(a).) For this reason, CEQA is concerned with an action's ultimate "impact on the
5 environment." (Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283.) CEQA requires environmental

6 factors be considered at the "earliest possible stage before [the project] gains irreversible

7 momentum," (Id. at 277), "at a point in the planning process where genuine flexibility remains."

8 (Sundstrom v. Mendocino County (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 307.)

9 27. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects, called categorical exemptions, which are

10 exempt from the provisions of CEQA. (PRC §21084(a);14 CCR §§ 15300, 15354.) Categorical

11 exemptions are certain classes of activities that generally do not have a significant effect on the
12 environment. (Id.)

13 28. Exemptions to CEQA, are narrowly construed and "[e]xemption categories are not to

14 be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Mountain Lion Foundation

15 vV. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.) A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce

16 all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors

17 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

18 29. In addition to the limitation that categorical exemptions be narrowly construed,

19 CEQA also provides an "unusual circumstances" exception to categorical exemptions. CEQA

20 Guidelines section 15300.2(c) provides, "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
21 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

22 environment due to unusual circumstances."

23 30. The test for whether a project presents unusual circumstances is whether "the
24 circumstances of a particular project (i) differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered

25 by a particular categorical exemption, and (ii) those circumstances create an environmental risk that

26 does not exist for the general class of exempt projects." (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V. Main San
27 Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1207.)

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

31. In determining the existence of an unusual circumstance, courts look to whether
additional environmental risks are presented by the proposed project. (Azusa Land Reclamation Co.,
52 Cal.App.4th at 1207.) Additionally, the scope and size of a project can be a potential unusual
circumstance. (Voices for Rural Living V. El Dorado Irrigation Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096,
1108-14.)

6 32. "A party invoking the exception may establish an unusual circumstance without

7 evidence of an environmental effect, by showing that the project has some feature that distinguishes

8 it from others in the exempt class, such as its size or location. In such a case, to render the exception
applicable, the party need only show a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that

10 unusual circumstance." (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086,

11 1105.)

12 33. "[A] party may establish an unusual circumstance with evidence that the project will

13 have a significant environmental effect. That evidence, if convincing, necessarily also establishes "a

14 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to

15 unusual circumstances." (Berkeley Hillside Preservation, 60 Cal.4th at 1105 (citing CEQA

16 Guidelines, § 15300.2(c).)

17 34. "[A]n agency may not apply a categorical exemption without considering evidence in

18 its files of potentially significant effects, regardless of whether that evidence comes from its own
19 investigation, the proponent's submissions, a project opponent, or some other source." (Berkeley
20 Hillside Preservation, 60 Cal.4th at 1103.)

21 35. An agency's determination as to whether there are "unusual circumstances" is

22 reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation, 60 Cal.4th at

23 1114.) "However, an agency's finding as to whether unusual circumstances give rise to "a

24 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment" is reviewed

25 to determine whether the agency, in applying the fair argument standard, "proceeded in [the] manner

26 required by law.' (Id. (citations omitted).)

27

36. "A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a
2 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.» (CEQA Guidelines, §
3 15300.2.)

4 37. Under CEQA, abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a
5 manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence.

6 (PRC §§ 21168.5.) Erroneous reliance by the City on a categorical exemption constitutes a
7 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA. (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San
8 Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192.) Substantial evidence is defined as
9 "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument
10 can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." (14
11 CCR § 15384(a).) Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts,
12 and expert opinion supported by facts; however, it does not include argument, speculation, or
13 unsubstantiated opinion or narrative. (PRC §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c).)
14 38. "Mitigation measures adopted as conditions of approval become part of the project
15 and are legally binding." (UC CEQA Handbook: Chapter 5.2 (https://www.ucop.edu/ceqa-
16 handbook/chapter_05/5.2.html).) As the University explains:
17 CEQA imposes an obligation to implement mitigation measures or project alternatives to
18 mitigate significant adverse environmental effects, if these measures or alternatives are feasible. Thus, CEQA establishes both a procedural obligation to analyze and make public 19 adverse physical environmental effects, and
impacts. a substantive obligation to mitigate significant

STATEMENT OF FACTS

4 39. The Project proposes to replace an existing intramural and practice softball field
located adjacent to Dwight Way at the northern edge of the Clark Kerr Campus with an
6 intercollegiate beach volleyball complex consisting of four beach volleyball courts, a 3,000 square
7 feet building to house player locker rooms, rest rooms and storage. Based on their information and
8 belief, Petitioners allege that the softball field currently is used intermittently as a practice field and
9 location for intramural softball and baseball games. It also is used as the location for some archery
10 activity involving about four archery targets. The current playing field is level and bordered by
11 mature trees. The ground slopes sharply up at the edge of the field on the east side where the existing
12 trees begin. There is an opening from the field onto Dwight Way to the north. There are a number of
13 residences across the street from the field on Dwight Way. The closest residence is about 100 feet
14 northwest from the edge of the existing field. Numerous residents live within 1,000 feet of the
15 proposed Project.

16 40. The NOE provides the following description of the Project:
17 The UC Berkeley campus would convert the existing Clark Kerr Campus softball field
18 from a recreational softball field into a recreational and Intercollegiate Athletic beach volleyball facility with four beach volleyball courts, a support building with team rooms,
19 locker rooms, restrooms, coach office and storage, new lighting and scoreboard, and a lawn area.
20

21 Drawings depicting the proposed Project were circulated to the public beginning in August of 2018.

22 A rendering of the Project was prepared on or about August 16, 2018 On December 17, 2018, the

23 University publicly circulated updated project design boards for the Project. The design boards

24 depict a rectangular court area containing four beach volleyball courts. Petitioners are informed and

25 believe, and thereupon allege that the sand-covered court area covers approximately a 14,000 square

26 feet area. The design boards depict a lawn spectator berm located along the length of the east side of

27 the courts. Also depicted is level lawn area along the north side of the courts. The proposed field

28 house containing rest rooms, locker rooms and storage rooms is located along the south edge of the
existing field. The building would be about 3,000 square feet in size. Concrete paving would

12 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

surround the volleyball courts and continue out to an entry plaza and paved walkway leading onto
2 Sports Lane and an adjacent roadway at the southeast corner of the facility.
3 41. The new facility would be surrounded by an 8 foot tall chain link fence. The facility
4 would be accessed through three gated entrances. One gated entrance would be located adjacent to
5 the entry plaza at the southeast corner A second gate is located at the southwest corner of the facility.
6 And a third gate is located near the northwest corner of the facility and exits onto Dwight Way.
7 42. The facility would include four tall light poles located at each of the four corners of
8 the court area. Based on the December 2018 rendering, the light poles appear to be about 40 feet
9 high. The purpose of the lights is to facilitate evening and intercollegiate matches at the facility. The
10 lights also are intended to increase the use of the Project by students. "By providing better lighting,
11 the site can provide more access throughout the year, particularly during the school year in late fall
12 or early spring." UC Berkeley Beach Volleyball Facility, Summary of Submitted Questions and
13 University Responses (Sept. 5, 2018). The rendering also depicts a large, possibly video, display
14 board on the south side of the courts.

15 43. The Project includes installation and operation of a public address system. The
16 information made available to the public by the University includes very little detail on this aspect of
17 the Project. The December 2018 design boards show a public address speaker located at the southern
18 edge of the courts and pointing in the direction of Dwight Way.
19 44. The project will involve the removal of an unknown number of trees at the site. In
20 describing the Project, the University has indicated that several existing redwood trees located at the
21 southeast corner of the project site adjacent to Sports Lane would be preserved. Although an arborist
22 and Campus architect apparently reviewed the site for specimen trees, that information has not been
23 disclosed to the public.

24 45. The Project includes the demolition of at least one other building on the Clark Kerr
25 campus. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding by and between the University and the City
26 of Berkeley dated April 23, 1982 (the "MOU"), no new buildings except for a designated elderly
27 housing project are allowed to be constructed on the Clark Kerr campus except to replace existing
28 buildings that are "destroyed by fire, earthquake or other disasters or removed due to hazards or

13 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 infeasibility of rehabilitation." The new, replacement building must be of a "similar size and scope"
2 as the removed building. Pursuant to that provision of the MOU, the University's outside counsel
3 has indicated that "[t]he University has identified at least two buildings on the Clark Kerr Campus
4 that pose serious seismic risks and are slated for demolition" and that the Project's proposed 3,000
5 square foot building will replace some of that demolished space. The NOE does not acknowledge
6 this component of the Project.

7 46. The Project will be available for use by the women's beach volleyball team, the
8 archery club, several sports camps hosted by the University, and by the neighboring community. The
9 women's volleyball team will practice at the facility. The University indicates that the operating
10 hours of the facility will be from 7:00 a.m. to 10 p.m. Initially, volleyball matches would be held
11 from six to seven times each year. Matches typically will occur on Friday, Saturday or Sunday
12 afternoons. Championship meets would likely be hosted at the facility in the future. Pac-12 at
13 championship beach volleyball events currently occur over a three day period and can involve up to
14 six teams. The facility also anticipated hosting tournaments in the future. Tournaments often include
15 simultaneous matches.

16 47. The August 16, 2018 rendering of the facility indicates that the spectator berm along
17 the east side of the courts would be able to accommodate about 400 spectators in that area alone.
18 48. Currently, the women's beach volleyball team practices and plays on two sand courts
19 located about 900 feet from the proposed Project in the southeast portion of the Clark Kerr campus.
20 Originally built in 1990, the two courts were originally used solely by local volleyball enthusiasts.
21 The Women's intercollegiate beach volleyball team began using the two courts in 2014 when the
22 beach volleyball program began. In addition to the women's volleyball team, the two courts are the
23 location of a number of weekend volleyball camps. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon
24 allege, that there are no lights or public address system installed at the two existing sand courts.
25 Currently, according to the University, volleyball matches at the existing sand courts attract about 50
26 spectators per match. The University has indicated that while the new facility may increase the
27 interest in the sport, the University does not expect regular attendance for volleyball matches to
28 change dramatically.

14 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 49. The proposed location of the Project is currently occupied by the Golden Bear
2 Softball Field. The field is used for sport club practices, recreational softball, and summer camp
3 activities. The field includes a fenced backstop. Several metal storage containers are located along
4 the fenceline along each base path. Four light poles are located on the edge of the infield area.
5 Another two light poles are located on the edge of the left and right outfields and are partly obscured
6 by adjacent trees. The University instructs users of the softball field who may be driving to the field
7 that street parking is available along Dwight Way as well as at "metered spaces across from the
Golden Bear building."

9 50. The Class 3 Exemption relied upon by the University, on its face, is not applicable to
10 the Project because the Project is not limited to the criteria established for the exemption.
11 51. The Project does not involve the "construction and location of limited numbers of
12 new small facilities or structures...." The size of the Project is larger than anticipated by the Class 3
13 Exemption. The overall Project encompasses a fenced area of approximately 35,000 square feet.
14 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the field light fixtures themselves will
15 be about 40 feet tall and target illuminating an area of greater than 14,000 square feet. In addition,
16 the Project includes the 3,000 square feet field house as well as another 3,000 square feet or more of
17 paved area. The NOE only addresses the size of the field house and ignores all other aspects of the
18 project in its rationale for relying on the Class 3 Exemption.
19 52. The Project goes well beyond the construction and location of structures because it
20 also includes the Facility's new uses and operation. The Project includes large gatherings of 50 or
21 more people, amplified sound, crowd noises including cheering, and operation of lights. The
22 University has not established any restrictions on the number of spectators that may attend a beach
23 volleyball event at the Project. As many as 400 spectators can be accommodated by the Project.
24 53. The Project includes the demolition of a structure on the Clark Kerr Campus. The
25 Clark Kerr Campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Petitioners are informed and
26 believe, and thereon allege, that the structure to be demolished as part of the Project will exceed
27 13,000 square feet in size. The Class 3 Exemption does not extend to any demolition activities.
28 Given the inclusion of the entire campus on the Register of Historic Places, the demolition of any

15 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 building on the campus associated with the Project "may cause a substantial adverse change in the
2 significance of a historical resource." 14 Cal. Admin. Code15300.2(f).

3 54. The Project involves an unknown level of tree removal from the site. The Class

4 Exemption does not extend to any tree removal activities.
55. The Project is not converting any existing small structures from one use to another
where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure. It is instead removing the
7 existing softball field and its existing backstop and field lights and replacing it with new structures
8 including the fieldhouse, beach volleyball courts, paved areas, large field lights, and a public address

9 system. In addition, the use is being changed from a recreational softball use to intercollegiate beach
10 volleyball use. A pick-up game of softball is not an equivalent use to an intercollegiate beach
11 volleyball match or tournament. The complete removal of the softball field is not a minor
12 modification to the exterior of a structure.

13 56. The Project will violate several mitigation measures adopted in the 1979 FEIR
14 prepared for the University's then anticipated acquisition of the Schools for the Deaf and for the
15 Blind campus and the University's site plan for the campus. In response to noise concerns, the EIR
16 adopted Mitigation Measure No. 25(f) providing that "[n]o University activities involving spectators
17 will be scheduled." (DEIR, p. 380.) In addition, Mitigation Measure 25(e) provides that "No rock
18 concerts or other noisy activities will be scheduled in the recreation facilities." (Id.) Lastly, in order
19 to address aesthetic impacts, Mitigation Measure 26(d) provides that "[t]he attractive series of
20 outdoor spaces will be maintained in their present condition." The Project will violate one or more of
21 these adopted mitigation measures by involving spectators, scheduling noisy activities and not
22 maintaining the outdoor space at the softball field in the condition present as of 1979. Because
23 mitigations are required to be applied to the Project, the Project cannot proceed as proposed and no
24 categorical exemption can be applied.

25 57. Assuming the Project qualifies for the Class 3 Exemption, the University abused its
26 discretion in determining that no unusual circumstances existed with the Project for the Class 3
27 Exemption and failed to acknowledge the additional risk that the Project creates of significant noise,
28 light and traffic impacts on nearby residents. The circumstances of the Project are unusual for the

16 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Category 3 Exemption because the general circumstances of the "New Construction or Small
2 Structures" exemption facilities do not include intercollegiate athletic facilities, sporting events
including spectators, cheering crowds, a public address system, powerful field lights, the demolition
4 of buildings, or violations of adopted CEQA mitigation measures. Each of these unusual components
5 for the Project within the Category 3 Exemption risk significant noise, visual and traffic impacts that
6 do not exist for the general class of projects subject to Category 3.
7 PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

8 58. In early August, 2018, the University circulated a flyer inviting interested persons to a

9 community open house for "a proposed facility would replace existing beach volleyball courts at
10 Clark Kerr Campus with a modern training and competition facility."
11 59. On August 6, 2018, Petitioner CENA sent a letter to the University requesting that the
12 University address how it would ensure that the proposed beach volleyball facility not be used for
13 major spectator events, notice of any landscaping or other significant site improvements, CENA's
14 concern that intercollegiate athletic use was not addressed in previous site plans for the Clark Kerr
15 Campus, and that any changes in use be approved by nearby property owners consistent with the
16 Declaration of Covenants and Restrictions dated April 23, 1982.
17 60. On August 13, 2018, the University held a community open house regarding an
18 earlier version of the Project. Petitioners CENA and DHNA attended the community open house.
19 During the open house, the University did not respond to the issues raised by CENA in its letter
20| dated August 6, 2018. The CENA and DHNA representatives were told that the campus counsel
21 would be responding to the issues identified in CENA's August 6, 2018 letter.
22 61. On August 22, 2018, Petitioner CENA sent a document request to the University
23 pursuant to the California Public Records Act, Gov. Code § 6250 et seq. CENA requested "all public
24 records concerning the conception, planning and possible construction of the proposed Volleyball
25 Courts at the Clark Kerr Campus, including records concerning the total costs of the project." CENA
26 also requested "all public records concerning alternative sites that were studied for the project and
27 concerning the relocation of current activities on the proposed site." As of the date of this lawsuit,
28

17 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 CENA has not received any response to the August 22, 2018 document request with the exception of
2 a confirmation of receipt.

3 62. On August 23, 2018, Petitioners CENA, DHNA and PHA sent a follow up letter to
4 the University posing several additional issues relating to the legality of constructing the new
5 proposed field house; concerns regarding the 400 person capacity of the proposed facility; the
6 inconsistency of the Project with mitigation measures adopted in the 1979 EIR; the impacts of new
7 field lights, and concerns regarding spillover parking.
8 63. On or about September 5, 2108, the University published a "Summary of Submitted
9 Questions and University Responses" on the University's website.
10 64. On September 14, 2018, Charles R. Olson of the law firm Lubin Olson &
11 Niewiadomski LLP, an outside legal counsel for the University, responded to CENA, DHNA and
12 PHA's letter dated August 23, 2018.
13 65. On January 4, 2019, Respondent Vini Bhargava, on behalf of the University, issued a
14 Notice of Exemption ("NOE") determining that the Project was exempt from environmental review
15 under CEQA. The University provided no opportunity for the public to review or comment on its
16 decision to apply a Class Categorical Exemption to the Project.
17 66. On January 22, 2019, Petitioners sent the University a notice of their intent to file an
18 action under CEQA challenging the exemption determination.

19 67. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
20 within the meaning of CCP § 1086, in that Respondents' approval of the Project and the associated
21 exemption, and failure to prepare an EIR or mitigated negative declaration for the Project, are not
22 otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy. Accordingly, Petitioners seek
23 this Court's review of Respondents' approval of the Project and exemption of the Project from
24 CEQA, to rectify the violations of CEQA.

25 68. Unless enjoined, Respondents will implement the Project despite their lack of
26 compliance with CEQA and violation of mitigation measures applicable to projects on the Clark
27 Kerr campus. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm by Respondents' failure to take the required
28 steps to comply with CEQA's procedures and protect the environment.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA - Illegal CEQA Exemption; CCP § 1085, PRC § 21168.5)
3 69. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set 4 forth herein.

5 70. Respondents and DOES 1 through 10 abused their discretion and failed to act in the
6 manner required by law by exempting the Project from CEQA review by issuing a Class 3
7 categorical exemption for the Project.
8 71. The Respondents' decision to approve the Project based on the Class 3 Categorical
9 Exemption is inconsistent with the terms of the exemption and not supported by substantial
10 evidence. The Class 3 Exemption does not apply to a Project proposing to entirely remove an
11 existing intramural and practice softball field and construct a new intercollegiate beach volleyball
12 complex with courts covering an approximately 14,000 square feet area, a 3,000 square feet building 13 to house player locker rooms, rest rooms and storage, about 3,000 square feet of concrete paving, a 14 spectator berm that could accommodate up to 400 spectators, four approximately 40 foot tall field
15 lights, a public address system, the demolition of a separate building on the historic landmarked
16 Clark Kerr campus, and the hosting of intercollegiate beach volleyball matches and tournaments,
17 summer camps, and other special events, including their accompanying crowd noises, cheering, PA 18 announcements and other loud noises. Nor is the existing softball field being converted to another
19 use with minor modifications. The type, scope and operation of the Project are inconsistent with the
20 criteria established for the Class 3 Categorical Exemption.
21 72. Respondents further abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
22 required by law because the "unusual circumstances" exception prohibits use of a categorical
23 exemption for the Project. The circumstances of the Project are unusual for the Category 3 24 Exemption because the general circumstances of the "New Construction or Small Structures"
25 exemption facilities do not include intercollegiate athletic facilities, sporting events including
26 spectators, cheering crowds, a public address system and powerful field lights. Nor do projects
27 exempt under Class 3 involve the demolition of structures. Nor do the general circumstances of
28 exempt facilities under Class 3 include projects that violate mitigation measures adopted pursuant to

19 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 CEQA. Each of these unusual components for the Project within the Category 3 Exemption risk
2 significant noise, visual and traffic impacts that do not exist for the general class of projects subject
3 to Category 3.

4 73. Respondents further abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
5 required by law because the Project involves the demolition of a building on the Clark Kerr campus,
a registered a historic site. As a result, the Project may cause a substantial adverse change in the
7 significance of that historical resource and cannot be exempted under the Class 3 Exemption.
8 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2.)

9 74. By exempting the Project from CEQA review, Respondents abused their discretion
10 and failed to act in a manner required by law.
11 75. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion
12 by issuing a categorical exemption for the Project and approving the Project in reliance on that
13 categorical exemption.

14 76. Respondents' adoption of the categorical exemption and approval of the Project must
15 be set aside.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
17 (Failure to Comply with Duty to Comply with and Implement Mitigation Measures Adopted Under CEQA; CCP § 1085, PRC § 21168.5) 18
77.
19 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
forth herein.
20
78.
21 Respondents and DOES 1 through 10 abused their discretion, breached mandatory

22 duties, and failed to act in the manner required by law in violation of CEQA and Code Civ. Proc. §§

23 1085 or 1094.5 by proceeding with a Project that violates mitigation measures adopted by the

24 University in the 1979 EIR and by failing to require compliance with the 1979 EIR's adopted

25 Mitigation Measures, by concluding that the Project could proceed pursuant to a Class 3 Exemption

26 and failing to conduct additional environmental review including initial study, EIR and/or negative
declaration of the Project's potential significant impacts. 27
79.
28 The Project fails to implement Mitigation Measure No. 25(f) which provides that
"[n]o University activities involving spectators will be scheduled." (DEIR, p. 380.) The Project fails

20 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I to implement Mitigation Measure 25(e) which provides that "No rock concerts or other noisy
2 activities will be scheduled in the recreation facilities." Lastly, the Project fails to implement
3 Mitigation Measure 26(d) which provides that "[t]he attractive series of outdoor spaces will be
4 maintained in their present condition."

5 80. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion
6 and proceeded in a manner inconsistent with law by adopting an exemption and proceeding with the
7 Project in violation of the University's mitigation measures previously adopted in the 1979 FEIR
pursuant to CEQA. Accordingly, Respondents' approval of the Project and the associated
9 exemption must be set aside.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondents and Real Party in Interest)

12 81. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference as if set forth again

13 in full.

14 82. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,

15 Respondents will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance with CEQA. Petitioners

16 will suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failure to take the required steps to comply with

17 CEQA's procedural requirements and protect the environment. Declaratory relief is appropriate

18 under Code of Civil Procedure 8 1060, injunctive relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure

19 con 525 et seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq. and

20 1094.5 et seq. and under Public Resources Code § 21168.9, to prevent irreparable harm to the

21 environment.

22 PRAYER

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

24 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to:

25 a. Set aside their approval of the Project;

26 b. Set aside the Notice of Exemption and Class 3 Categorical Exemption for the

27 Project;

28 C. Set aside any and all other actions approving or granting any permits,
entitlements, financing, or other approvals referring or related to the Project

21 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

unless and until Respondents have prepared, circulated, and considered a
2 legally adequate CEQA document prior to any subsequent action taken to
3 approve the Project.

4 2. For an order staying the effect of Respondents' actions issuing a Notice of Exemption
5 for the Project, approving any permits or other entitlements for the Project, and authorizing any
6 financing for the Project pending the outcome of this proceeding.
7 3. For a declaratory judgment declaring Respondents' approval of the Project and the
8 accompanying Class Exemption is contrary to law and/or in violation of Respondents' mandatory
9 duty by failing to implement and violating one or more mitigation measures adopted by the
10 University in the previous 1979 EIR.
11 4. For the costs of suit.

12 5. For an award of attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and any
13 other applicable provisions of law.
14 6. For any other legal and equitable relief as this Court deems just and proper.

RE: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality Act Regarding the January 4, 2019 Notice of Exemption for the Clark Kerr Campus Beach Volleyball Complex
To The Regents of the University of California, Chancellor Christ, and Ms. Bhargava:
Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 21167.5, that Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods, Claremont Elmwood Neighborhood Association, Panoramic Hill Association, Dwight Hillside Neighborhood Association, and Phillip Bokovoy (collectively "Petitioners") intend to file a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), PRC § 21000 et seq., against Respondents and Defendants The Regents of the University of California, Carol T. Christ, Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley, Vini Bhargava, Director of

Notice of Intent to File Suit Under CEQA Re: Beach Volleyball Complex January 22, 2019
Page 2 of 4
Physical and Environmental Planning of the University of California, Berkeley, and Janet Napolitano, President of the University of California, challenging the January 4, 2019 Notice of Exemption executed by Ms. Bhargava for the Clark Kerr Campus Beach Volleyball Complex.
The Notice of Exemption relies upon a Class 3 Categorical Exemption for "New Construction or Small Structures." See 14 Cal. Admin. Code § 15303. "Class 3 consists of construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure." ld.

Petitioners will allege, among other things, that the construction and operation of the facility will include large events that do not qualify for the Class 3 Categorical Exemption. The facility is intended to host intercollegiate beach volleyball events, including playoffs and invitational tournaments. These events will occur during the day and in the evenings. The facility and events will include amplified sound and additional lighting and will accommodate up to 400 fans, which will create crowd and event noises, none of which is contemplated at all by the Class 3 exemption. The facility will attract additional parking that will further overwhelm traffic in the surrounding neighborhood. Accordingly, the exempted project is not merely the construction and location of a new small facility that would qualify for the Class 3 exemption, but the execution of a plan to host major intercollegiate spectator events on the Clark Kerr Campus.
Petitioners will further allege that, assuming the project fits within the Class 3 exemption, the proposed volleyball complex creates an unusual circumstance based on, among other features, its size, the nature of the events that will be held at the facility, its inconsistency with the applicable covenants governing the use of the Clark Kerr Campus, the location within 150 feet of the nearest residences, and a demonstration that it will have a significant effect on the environment. Petitioners will allege that the University's determination that the unusual circumstances exception to the Class 3 exemption (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2) does not apply to the project is not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners will further allege that substantial evidence of a fair argument demonstrates there is a reasonable possibility of a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances of the volleyball complex, including but not limited to noise impacts, air quality impacts, traffic impacts, lighting impacts, and inconsistency with applicable land use requirements.
The petition will seek relief requesting (1) a stay of the University's exemption decision; (2) a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction restraining the University from initiating construction of the volleyball complex pending trial; (3) a peremptory writ of mandate, permanent injunction and declaratory relief directing the University to vacate the exemption determination and suspend implementation of the project until the University has prepared an environmental review in compliance with

CEQA; and (4) the costs of suit, award of attorneys' fees and other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper.
Petitioners urge the University to rescind their exemption determination for the volleyball complex, conduct the appropriate environmental review, and to prepare the appropriate CEQA document for the complex as required by law. The 35-day statute of limitations for challenging the University's exemption requires Petitioners to file their case no later than February 8, 2019. Petitioners propose that the University meet with Petitioners as soon as possible to discuss their concerns regarding the proposed volleyball complex and to explore possible resolutions that might obviate the need for Petitioners to proceed with filing the above-described action.
