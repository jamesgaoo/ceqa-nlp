INTRODUCTION

1. This lawsuit challenges the failure by Respondents City of Santa Cruz and City
Council of the City of Santa Cruz (collectively referred to herein as "Respondents") to enforce

6 the requirement of a voter-adopted initiative measure that requires new developments to

7 include a share of price-restricted affordable housing in new housing developments (Measure

8 O). While Respondents pay lip service to the need for affordable housing, what Respondents

9 actually do is to use the need for such affordable housing as an argument to endlessly promote

10 market-rate development within the City of Santa Cruz. Such market-rate development fails to

11 quell or dampen the need for affordable housing. Contrary to the impression that Respondents

12 have given by their promotion of market-rate housing, providing more market-rate housing

13 does not actually provide a solution to the housing woes besetting the community, and does not

14 alleviate the need for affordable housing. In fact, as long as market-rate housing in the City of

15 Santa Cruz, or even the County of Santa Cruz, is less expensive than housing in Santa Clara

16 County (the address of the economic juggernaut infamously known worldwide as Silicon

17 Valley), and as long as there is a world-class university, Airbnb and second homeowners, Santa

18 Cruz will remain steadfastly unaffordable. No amount of market-rate development in an

19 attractive California coastal area will dampen prices such that homes are affordable. Indeed,

20 Respondents ignore the economic realities of homebuilding. Density in San Francisco did not

21 reduce the price of homes any more than it did in it the New York City Borough of Manhattan.

22 The high cost of land and labor in California, and Santa Cruz, and the fact that developers only

23 build when demand is strong, means that housing affordability will remain a perennial

24 problem. Measure O, the growth management initiative adopted by the voters in 1979 that also

25 created the City's Greenbelt, recognized the folly of mindless growth and mandated an

26 affordable housing requirement for new development. Measure O recognized that there was

27 "an already existing housing crisis in the City of Santa Cruz... ." (See Exhibit A, p. 2, attached

28 hereto.)

1,

2. Forty years after the passage of Measure O, affordability is still an issue. It is
2 not a new issue, as Respondents appear to believe, nor will the housing affordability crisis be
3 solved with the Respondents' recent attempts to undermine the policies of Measure O and
make Santa Cruz a free-for-all for developers where waivers from requirements for affordable
5 housing and environmental concerns are granted. Instead of promoting market-rate housing
that does nothing to help alleviate the affordability crisis, Respondents must meet their
7 obligations as ordained by the City's electorate in 1979. Instead of abandoning the electorate
8 and allowing developers a free pass to avoid providing affordable housing while constructing
market-rate housing for those who can afford the price, it must set aside housing that is actually
10 affordable.
11 3. Petitioners Shelley Hatch and Ron Pomerantz (Petitioners) bring this mandamus
12 action in the public interest. Petitioners challenge the September 25, 2018 and October 9, 2018
13 approval by Respondent City Council of Ordinance No. 2018-13 amending Chapter 24.16 of
14 the Santa Cruz Municipal Code related to Inclusionary Housing (hereinafter referred to as the
15 /"Ordinance"), and challenge the December 11, 2018 approval by Respondent City Council of a
16 large residential development project at 100 Laurel Street, 305, 309 & 313 Front Street and
17 802, 806, 810, 812, 816 Pacific Avenue (Application No. CP18-0079) (hereinafter referred to
18 as the "Project") pursuant to the newly-minted Ordinance and approval of an associated
19 exemption from environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
20 (CEQA). The Project consists of a Nonresidential Demolition Authorization Permit,
21 Sequential Lot Line Adjustment, Design Permit, Special Use Permit, Coastal Development
22 Permit, Revocable License for an Outdoor Extension Area, Heritage Tree Removal Permit and
23 Street Tree Removal to combine seven parcels, remove two Heritage Trees, remove one
24 Nonheritage Street Tree, demolish five commercial buildings, and construct a six-story,
25 311,311 Square foot mixed-use building with 205 residential apartments and 10,656 square
26 feet of ground-floor commercial space on property located within the CBD/CZ-O/FP-O Zone
27 District and within the Pacific Avenu Retail District and Front Street/Riverfront Corridor Sub-

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 areas of the Downtown Plan.

2 4. Petitioners allege that the Ordinance and the Project violate Measure O, a voter
3 adopted initiative passed by the electorate in 1979. Measure O requires, inter alia, that "It
4 shall be the policy of the City of Santa Cruz that at least 15% of those housing units newly
5 constructed for sale or rental each year shall be capable of purchase or rental by persons with
6 average or below average incomes." Measure O as submitted, and ultimately adopted by the
7 voters, is attached hereto as Exhibit A. Petitioners allege that the Ordinance allows waivers or
8 reductions of inclusionary housing requirements in violation of Measure O, and that the Project
9 received such a waiver and reduction pursuant to the illegal Ordinance, and that the Ordinance
10 also reduces the percentage of required affordable housing outside the arbitrarily designated
11 Downtown Development Area contrary to the express terms and voter intent of Measure O.
12 5. Finally, Petitioners challenge the approval of the Project on the grounds that the
13 Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA--Pub.
14 Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), because, inter alia, Respondents erroneously determined
15 that the City Downtown Plan Amendments EIR and the General Plan 2030 EIR adequately
16 addressed the Project, and the Project qualifies for Statutory Exemption/Limited
17 Environmental Review for projects consistent with General Plan, Community Plan or Zoning
18 Action pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21083.3 and CEQA Guidelines section
19 15183. Therefore, Respondents' environmental determination and approval of the Project
20 constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.

22 22. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs through 21 as if fully

23 set forth herein.

24 23.

25 As stated supra, Measure O is a voter adopted measure that clearly and

26 explicitly states that "It shall be the policy of the City of Santa Cruz that at least 15% of those

27 housing units newly constructed for sale or rental each year shall be capable of purchase or

28 rental by persons with average or below average incomes." The Ordinance violates,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

7

contravenes, misapplies and directly conflicts with Measure O. The Ordinance allows, inter
2 alia, a waiver from the 15% voter-adopted inclusionary housing requirement under certain
3

4 circumstances, including but not limited to, allowing developers to claim a waiver of or

5 reduction of the 15% requirement due to financial hardships for rental housing projects where

6 land was purchased and "development plans are initiated" prior to an arbitrary date of October

7 2018. Moreover, the Ordinance reduces the percentage of required affordable housing

8 outside the arbitrarily designated Downtown Development Area contrary to the express terms
9 and voter intent of Measure O. These waivers and reduced percentages violate the express
10

11 terms of Measure O and voter intent.

12 24. The courts have established a rule of law requiring any amendment or change of

13 a voter-adopted measure to meet the strictest standard so as to avoid any evasion of the will of

14 the People. The test applicable is whether these changes "may conflict" with Measure O.
15 In determining whether a particular action constitutes an amendment [of a voter-
16 adopted measure], we [the courts] keep in mind that "[i]t is the duty of the courts to

17 jealously guard [the people's initiative and referendum power]." "It has long been our
judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power whenever it is challenged in
18 order that the right [to local initiative or referendum] be not improperly annulled."

19 (San Mateo County Landowners' Association v. County of San Mateo (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th

20 523 (fn..7) citing DaVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal. 4th 763, 775-776, quoting Associated

21 Home Builders, etc., Inc. V. City of Livermore (1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 591; See also Proposition
22 103 Enforcement Project v. Charles Quackenbush (1998) 64 Cal.App. 4th 1473.) Proposition
23

24 103 Enforcement Project v. Charles Quackenbush distills the strict standard of review, largely

25 from two California Supreme Court cases nearly 20 years apart, as follows:

26

27 Any doubts should be resolved in favor of the initiative and referendum power, and amendments which may conflict with the subject matter of initiative measures must be
28 accomplished by popular vote, as opposed to legislatively enacted ordinances, where

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

8

the original initiative does not provide otherwise. (De Vita v. County of Napa, supra, 9
2 Cal.4th at p. 7765, 38 Cal.Rptr. 699, 889 P.2d 1019; Mobilepark West Homeowners Assn. v. Escondido Mobilepark West, supra, 35 Cal.App.4th at p. 41, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d
3 393.)

4 (Emphasis added). Thus, it is clear from appellate precedent that all doubts must be resolved
5 in favor of requiring a popular vote if the subject matter of voter-adopted legislation is
6
subsequently addressed by the City Council. This requirement has been held to be of 7

8 constitutional dimension.

9 When a statute enacted by the initiative process is involved, the Legislature may amend 10 it only if the voters specifically gave the Legislature that power.... (Cal. Const., Art. II,
11 Sec. 10, subd.(c); Amwest Surety Ins. Co. v. Wilson (1995) 11 Cal.4th 1243, 1251,48 Cal.Rptr.2d 12, 906 P.2d 1112].) The purpose of California's constitutional limitation
12 on the Legislature's power to amend initiative statues is to "*protect the people's initiative powers by precluding the Legislature from undoing what the people have 13 done without the electorate's consent." (Huening v. Eu (1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 766,
14 781, 282 Cal.Rptr. 664 (conc. and diss. Opn. Of Raye, J.).
15 (Proposition 103 Enforcement Project v. Charles Quackenbush, supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at

16 1483-1484).

17 An amendment has been defined as "any change of the scope or effect of an existing
18 statute, whether by addition, omission, or substitution of provisions, which does not wholly terminate its existence, whether by an act purporting to amend, repeal, revise, or
19 supplement, or by an act independent and original in form, ...' An amendment of an
initiative may be accomplished by some other action other than by the subsequent 20 enaction of a statute; the question is whether the action in question adds to or takes
21 away from the initiative. (See e.g., Franchise Tax Board v. Cory, [(1978)] 80 Cal.App.3d [772,]. 773, 777 [initiative enacted by voters was amended by "control
22 language" in budget item, which, in part significantly restricted the manner in which audits were to be conducted] . To give effect to the constitution, it is as much the
23 duty of the courts to see that it [the initiative] is not evaded as that it is not directly violated."
24

25 (Proposition 103 Enforcement Project v. Charles Quakenbush, supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at 1484

26 (emphasis added).) The Respondents thwarted and fundamentally undermines the will of the

27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 people by effectively amending Measure O through an implementing ordinance without a vote
2 of the people.

4 25. The Respondents' failure to comply with the wishes of the voters was a failure

5 to proceed in a manner required by law.

7 VII

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of Measure O and the California Constitution Against Respondents the Real
10 Parties for Approval of the Project

11
26. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 25 as if fully 12

13 set forth herein.

14 27. As stated above, the Ordinance violates Measure O. The Ordinance was applied

15 to the Project, and the Project was granted a waiver pursuant to the Ordinance reducing Real
16 Parties' obligation to provide affordable housing from 15% to 5.5%. Said waiver provision in
17 the Ordinance, and its application to the Project, violated Measure O.
18
28.
19 Assuming, arguendo, that the exception was legal, the findings before

20 Respondent City Council are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The waiver

21 a requires a finding of financial hardship and that the waiver is in the public interest. The
22 proposed findings include bald assertions that:

23 The City's consultant, Keyser Marston Associates (KMA) reviewed the pro forma and
24 determined that, based on the prices paid for the properties, which were acquired under the assumption that no inclusionary housing requirements would be applied to the 25 rental project pursuant to the 2009 Palmer Sixth Street Properties vs. City of Los
26 Angeles decision (that was subsequently nullified by AB 1505, effective January 1, 2018), and associated construction costs, the project can feasibly sustain a 5.5 percent
27 inclusionary requirement.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT ÖF MANDAMUS

10

1 In applying the waiver from the affordable housing requirement mandated by the voters, there
2 is no substantial evidence in the record to support the findings made by the Respondent City 3

4 Council that there is undue financial hardship or that the waiver is in the public interest.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
7

8 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.]
9 29. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully
10 set forth herein.
11 30. Respondents' approval of the Project constitutes an abuse of discretion because,
12 inter alia, the Respondents claimed an exemption from environmental review asserting that the
13 Project qualifies for Statutory Exemption/Limited Environmental Review for projects
14 consistent with General Plan, Community Plan or Zoning Action pursuant to Public Resources
15 Code section 21083.3 and CEQA Guidelines section 15183. However, the Real Parties were
16 granted Design and Development Variations from the physical design and development
17 policies of the Downtown Plan. Respondents failed to analyze the impacts of these variations.
18 The EIR for the General Plan was too broad to consider the impacts of the Project, and the
19 Downtown Plan assumed that certain designs and development standards would be met. The
20 deviation from the standards set forth in the Downtown Plan affect, inter alia, aesthetics and
21 community character. Moreover, Respondent City Council was not provided with the
22 Downtown Plan EIR when it deliberated on the Project's approval and determined that no
23 additional environmental document needed to be prepared, nor did it seek to review that
24 document in making its determinations and findings.
25 31. Due to all the above flaws, Respondents' actions constitute an abuse of
26 discretion. Respondents must prepare project-specific environmental review that conforms
27 with all of the procedural and substantive requirements set forth under CEQA. Approval of the
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

11

1 Project was an abuse of discretion.

8 33. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the

reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code 11 of Civil Procedure § 1021.5,

12 and other provisions of the law.

14 X

15 INJUNCTION
16 34. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 33 as if fully 17
set forth herein.
18

19 35. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply
20 with Measure O and CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.
21 36. a As a result of the above-alleged violations of Measure O and CEQA,
22 Respondents have failed to conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and,
23 thus, have failed to
24 proceed in a manner required by law in approving the Ordinance and

25 Project.

26 37. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

27 Measure O and CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

12

provisions of law, including the California Constitution and planning and zoning laws.
2 Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform their
3

4 duty to comply with Measure O and CEQA.

5 38. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

6 are threatening to proceed with implementation of the Ordinance and development of the

7 Project in the near future. Said implementation of the Ordinance and the Project will
8 irreparably harm the ability to provide affordable housing pursuant to the voter mandates of
9 Measure O and the environment and will result in significant and unmitigated adverse
10

11 environmental impacts.

12 39. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

13 of the Ordinance and the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure, degrade, and

14 impact the affordable housing and environmental values of the City of Santa Cruz, the County
15 of Santa Cruz and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent
16

17 injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

18 40. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

19 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with implementation of the Ordinance

20 and development of the Project.

21 41. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
22 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the
23

24 Ordinance and the Project and approval of the environmental determination.

VIA HAND DELIVERY

Honorable Martine Watkins and City Council
c/o City Clerk
City of Santa Cruz
809 Center Street, Room 9
Santa Cruz, CA 95060

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Dear Mayor Watkins and Members of the City Council:
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Shelley Hatch and Ronald Pomerantz will commence litigation against the City of Santa Cruz and the City Council of the City of Santa Cruz.
The litigation challenges the City Council's September 25, 2018 and October 9, 2018 approval of Ordinance No. 2018-13 amending Chapter 24.16 of the Santa Cruz Municipal Code related to Inclusionary Housing, and the December 11, 2018 approval of a development project at 100 Laurel Street, 305, 309 & 313 Front Street and 802, 806, 810, 812, 816 Pacific Avenue (Application No. CP18-0079).
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, the California Constitution and a local voter-adopted initiative, Measure O, that requires new developments to include a share of price-restricted affordable housing in new housing developments.

Very truly yours,
