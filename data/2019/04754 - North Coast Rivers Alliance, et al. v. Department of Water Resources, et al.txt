26 (collectively "Conservation Groups") hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate against defendant
27 and respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and by this Verified Petition for Writ of
28 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorney's Fees ("Verified

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees

Petition") hereby allege as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

4 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC') section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), the Delta Reform Act

5 ("DRA"), Water Code section 85000, et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action

6 to challenge DWR's November 13, 2018, Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report

7 ("FEIR") for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project ("Project"), and December 11, 2018, Project

8 approval. In taking these actions DWR violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust

9 Doctrine.

10 2. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public agencies to

11 examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect

12 California's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency

13 actions.

14 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider

15 alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does neither.

16 4. The Project extends the terms of the State Water Project ("SWP") contracts to December

17 31, 2085, without adequately examining the environmental impacts of doing so, without studying a

18 reasonable range of alternatives, and without compliance with other state law protecting the

19 environment.

20 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

21 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

22 ("CCP") sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus);

23 PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California

24 Constitution.

25 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers)

26 and 395 (actions generally) because DWR's offices are located in Sacramento.

27 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with

28 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 2 -

1 served DWR with notice of this suit.

2 PARTIES

3 8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit

4 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California: North Coast Rivers was-

5 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of
excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and

7 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds
for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North

9 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will

10 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the

11 Project.

12 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt

13 organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the communities

14 that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR

15 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR

16 seeks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has
17 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection
18 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR
19 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.

20 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to

21 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.

22 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS

23 (*PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

24 San Francisco, California. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

25 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined
26 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial

27 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's

28 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 3 -

-

2 salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

3 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing

4 livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta
and its associated ecosystems.

5 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
6 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats

7

8 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in

9 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento

10 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in

11 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich

12 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco

13 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DWR's Project approval because it would threaten

14 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected

ecosystems.

15 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
16 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The

17

18 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural

19 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of

20 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (*Delta"). The

21 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced
Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
22 environmental harms that implementation of the Project will allow.

23

24 13. Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

25 ("DWR") is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of

26 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on November

27 13, 2018, and approval of the Project on December 11, 2018, was subject to and violated the

28 requirements of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency
under CEQA for environmental review of the Project.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 4 -

14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to
2 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

3 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the

4 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in

5 part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

6 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe

7 respondents have been ascertained.

8 15. Real party in interest State Water Contractors ("SWC") is a non-profit corporation

9 composed of and representing public water agencies throughout California that have contracted with
10 DWR to receive SWP water. The Project purports to amend the contract terms that govern DWR's
11 delivery of water to SWC members.

12 16. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to
13 PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any specific real parties in
14 interest exist. However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is
15 necessary, petitioners have identified SWC as a potential real party in interest. The true names and
16 capacities of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore
17 sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners are
18 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real
19 parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
20 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe real parties
21 in interest have been ascertained.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 17. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
24 their substantial beneficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.
25 18. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
26 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
27 required by law.

28 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

/Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 5 -

1 the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

2 DWR's Certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project, and ordering it to comply with the laws

3 whose violation is alleged herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are

4 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other

5 legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the
6 environment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct.

7 20. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual

8 controversy exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

9 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitioners are
10 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is

11 therefore necessary and appropriate.

12 21. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of

13 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project

14 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental

15 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to DWR's failure to take the required

16 steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et

17 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

18 LEGAL BACKGROUND

19 CE0A

20 22. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

21 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

22 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

23 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

24 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

25 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible
26 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)
27 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.

28 23. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

|Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 6-

[governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

2 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. Mountain

3 Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; PRC §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D),

4 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects
not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
6 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

24. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary
projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is a "public agency" and a "state agency" as defined in a CEQA. PRC §
9 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.

10 25. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

11 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the

12 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and

13 Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory

14 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and recognized under CEQA

15 Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the

16 California Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2),
17 15300-15333 and 15354.

18 26. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that

19 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those effects and
20 suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve

21 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant environmental effects. PRC §§
22 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.

23 27. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid

24 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA's
25 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,
26 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only

27 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.

The Delta Reform Act

2 28. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature

3 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and

4 California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water

5 Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that ''the Delta' .. . is a critically important

6 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the

7 California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North

8 and South America." Water Code § 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization

9 of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a), emphasis added.

10 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,

11 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water

12 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state

13 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.

14 29. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta

15 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight

16 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

17 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state

18 over the long term.
(b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the
19 California Delta as an evolving place.

20 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy

21 estuary and wetland ecosystem.

22 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.
(e)
23 Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

24 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.

25 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency

26 preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.

27 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.

28 § Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 8 -

30. The Legislature also declared that:

2 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting

3 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for 4 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

6 Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

7 The Public Trust Doctrine

8 31. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
10 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

11 32. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
12 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
13 they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
14 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
15 Court went on to explain:

16 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative 17 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

18 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foresecable harm to public trust uses. In sO

19 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, SO far as consistent with the public interest, the
20 uses protected by the trust.

21 Id., citations omitted.

22 33. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

23 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and
24 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
25 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

26 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the
27 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
28 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 9 -

] which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

2 34. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

3 the public trust doctrine . . . . L] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

4 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

5 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. v. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A]

6 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

7 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at 570.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 35. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and
10 international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest
11 and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in

12 peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of

13 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." Id.

14 36. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
15 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for
16 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California (or "State") Water Project ("SWP").

17 Second, for too long, agricultural diverters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off

18 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are

19 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,

20 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

21 37. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

22 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant

23 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in

24 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run

25 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been
26 driven perilously close to extirpation.

27 38. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered

28 Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population declines,

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 10 -

1 declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its

2 tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared

3 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

4 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat

5 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of

6 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical

7 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fed.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58

8 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

9 39. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and diversions

10 that would have destroyed the free-flowing rivers of California's North Coast and removed additional

11 essential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steelhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was

12 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre feet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,

13 DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all

14 but the wettest of water years.

15 40. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water

16 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that

17 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas

18 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils

19 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and

20 sodium chlorides and sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries

21 threatens the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

22 41. DWR's existing waters supply contracts with the SWC begin to expire in 2035 and the last

23 ends by 2042. DWR states that an extension of these contracts is necessary to finance capital

24 expenditures for the SWP through the use of revenue bonds. DWR entered into a negotiation process
25 regarding potential terms for its contract extensions, and petitioners provided detailed comments

26 regarding the environmental impacts and considerations that must be addressed during the contract

27 extension process that became the Project, including comments dated July 3, 2013, July 10, 2013, and

28 January 29, 2014, by PCFFA, and March 3, 2014 by PCFFA and the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.

1 42. On or about September 12, 2014 DWR issued a Notice of Preparation notifying the public

2 that it would act.as the lead agency for the preparation of an EIR for the Project. That Notice of

3 Preparation identified the Project as "amending certain provisions of the State Water Resources

4 Development System (SWRDS) Water Supply Contracts."

5 43. In response to the Notice of Preparation, in October 2014, petitioners PCFFA, IFR, North

6 Coast Rivers, San Francisco Fishermen, and other environmental groups, agencies, and members of the

7 public submitted detailed scoping comments to DWR. Commentors raised concerns regarding the scope

8 of DWR's Project and exclusion of interrelated decisions and approvals. Commentors raised concerns

9 regarding the ways in which climate change and sea level rise will occur during the Project's term and

10 the need to examine how the Project's impacts would change over time. Commentors requested that

11 DWR disclose and analyze the Project's potential changes regarding responsibility for fish, wildlife and
12 recreation mitigation measures. And commentors requested that DWR study alternatives that reduced

13 total contract amounts in light of the SWP's historic over-allocation and likely reduction in available
14 water over the duration of the Project, and that established water conservation standards for SWP water,
15 among other concerns.

16 44. In August 2016, DWR released its Draft EIR for the Project. The Draft EIR failed to

17 address many of the concerns raised during the scoping process.

18 45. Petitioner PCFFA provided detailed comments on DWR's Draft EIR via letter dated

19 October 17, 2016. These comments highlighted DWR's failure to address the Project's impacts, refusal

20 to study appropriate Project alternatives, and improper piecemealing of its environmental analysis.

21 46. PCFFA and IFR submitted additional comments on the Project that DWR received on or

22 about August 13, 2018.

23 47. IFR, North Coast Rivers and San Francisco Fishermen, along with other concerned
24 organizations, submitted additional comments regarding the Project that DWR received on or about

25 September 25, 2018.

26 48. On November 13, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth certified the FEIR.

27 49. On December 11, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth approved the Project.

28 50. DWR's Notice of Determination was received by the Governor's Office of Planning and

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Violation of CEQA)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 51. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

6 reference.

7 52. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, on

8 the grounds that DWR committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner

9 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.

10 53. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a

11 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential
12 alternatives to the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter

13 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and

14 potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).

15 The FEIR's Analysis Is Improperly Segmented

16 54. CEQA requires agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may have

17 significant environmental impacts. Guidelines § 15064(a)(1). CEQA defines "project" to mean "the

18 whole of an action." Guidelines § 15378(a). "The term 'project' refers to the activity which is being

19 approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The

20 term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." Guidelines § 15378(c).

21 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when

22 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc. for

23 Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." Guidelines co

24 15003(h), see also Guidelines § 15378(a), (c).

25 55. CEQA thus intends to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become submerged

26 by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on the
27 environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local Agency

28 Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees • 13 -

56. Here, instead of studying all of its interdependent actions together, DWR has improperly

2 segmented its analysis of the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

3 Management and California WaterFix from its analysis and consideration of the Project. DWR

4 circulated a Draft EIR for the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water
Management and California Waterfix for public comment in October 2018. Yet DWR's Project

6 approval is necessary for its implementation of WaterFix and its related contract amendments.

7 57. This segmentation violates CEQA's demand for unified and comprehensive environmental

8 review:

o Theoretical independence is not a good reason for segmenting the environmental analysis

10 of the two matters. Doing so runs the risk that some environmental impacts produced by the way the two matters combine or interact might not be analyzed in the separate and
11 environmental reviews. Furthermore, if the two matters are analyzed in sequence . the combined or interactive environmental effects are not fully recognized until the review

12 of the second matter, the opportunity to implement effective mitigation measures as part of the first matter may be lost. This could result in mitigation measures being adopted in

13 the second matter that are less effective than what would have been adopted if the matters had been analyzed as a single project.

14 Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214,

15 1230. DWR's segmented review subverts CEQA's informational purposes.

16 DWR's No Project Alternative Violates CEQA

17 58. The CEQA Guidelines direct that "[t]he 'no project' analysis shall discuss the existing

18 conditions at the time the notice of preparation is published … as well as what would be reasonably

19 expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the project were not approved . . . ." (Guidelines :

20 15126.6(e)(2).)

21 59. DWR's No Project Alternative improperly assumes that the SWP contracts would be

22 renewed absent the Project, and that all water deliveries would occur with or without the Project. As

23 such the scenario examined in the environmental documents does not describe a situation where an

24 agency a approval is not granted. Instead it describes a scenario where a different Project alternative is

25 approved, and SWP water deliveries continue. DWR has not examined the environmental conditions of

26 the Project against an appropriate No Project Alterative where these deliveries are not made. This failure

27 violates CEQA.

28 ///

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees . 14 -

DWR Failed to Fully Consider A Reasonable Range of Alternatives and
Dismissed Feasible Alternatives from Review
2

3 60. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even

4 if they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

5 Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

6 61. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow
7 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

8 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible

O alternatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project

10 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.

11 Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).

12 62. The FEIR fails to study a reasonable range of alternatives, including an alternative that

13 significantly reduces deliveries, or an alternative that implements conservation targets. Instead, DWR
14 dismissed any reduced contract quantity alternatives or water conservation target alternatives from

15 detailed analysis before it prepared its Draft EIR.

16 63. All but one of the Alternatives studied in the FEIR contemplate the same level of water

17 deliveries, and only vary in end year and financial structure. For this reason, DWR concludes that

18 Alternatives 2 through 6 have the same impacts as the Project. Alternative 7 would extend the end-date

19 of the contracts to 2085 but allows some current contractors to "choose not to sign." None of these

20 Alternatives are sufficiently distinct to provide a reasonable range of alternatives under CEQA.

21 64. Because none of the Alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive

22 exports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the FEIR failed to analyze a reasonable range of

23 alternatives as CEQA requires.

24 The FEIR Improperly Concludes That the Project Has No Impacts

25 65. DWR concludes that the Project will have no impact on any resource topics "because it

26 would amend and add financial provisions" to its SWP contracts and "would not create new water

27 management measures, alter the existing authority to build or modify existing SWP facilities, or change

28 water allocation provisions" of those contracts. ES-4. But DWR overlooks the essential purpose of the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 15 -

1 Project's contracts - to deliver water through the SWP. DWR's SWP water deliveries have impacts to

2 the source and receiving watersheds, including impacts on important habitat, yet DWR fails to consider

3 these impacts as impacts of the Project. DWR's failure to address the impacts of Project approval
violates CEQA.
66. DWR also improperly concludes that the Project has no cumulative impacts. Id. But DWR
6 has failed to examine the closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future

7 projects that, when taken with the Project's water deliveries, will result in significant cumulative

8 impacts. This violates CEQA.

9 DWR Fails to Analyze Changed Circumstances

10 67. DWR's FEIR relies upon the 1986 Coordinated Operating Agreement ("COA") between

11 DWR and the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to describe the operating criteria for

12 the SWP, and assumes that Project operations will be constrained by the 1986 COA. Yet as DWR

13 prepared the FEIR, it was actively renegotiating the COA with Reclamation, and executed an addendum

14 to the COA the day after it approved the Project. The FEIR fails to address this reasonably foreseeable
15 change in SWP operations as either part of the Project itself or a closely related and reasonably
16 foreseeable probable project, despite its likely significant cumulative impacts.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

20 68. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
21 reference.

22 69. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., was passed by the Legislature in

23 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water

24 infrastructure are in crisis" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the
25 state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was

26 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provide

27 for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the

28 Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
|Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 16 -

legally enforceable Delta Plan." Id. § 85001(c).

2 70. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered

3 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

4 action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship

5 Council. Water Code § 85225.

6 71. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined

7 by PRC section 21065 that:

8 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.
9 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency.

10 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

11 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce 12 risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

13 Water Code § 85057.5(a). While the Delta Reform Act states that "[r]Joutine maintenance and operation

14 of the State Water Project" is not a covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption

15 because it is neither routine maintenance nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).

16 72. The 2013 Delta Plan prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set

17 aside by the Sacramento Superior Court because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reform

18 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated

19 with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring

20 more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with the Delta Reform Act."

21 Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. The Delta

22 Stewardship Council's appeal of this decision is pending before the Third District Court of Appeal (Case

23 No. C082944). In addition, petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's

24 2018 Delta Plan Amendments, as those amendments violate CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public

25 Trust Doctrine and other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacrament Superior Court Case Nos.
26 34-2018-80002898, 34-2018-80002900, 34-2018-80002901, 34-2018-80002904.

27 73. DWR denies that the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act. FEIR 2-100.

28 But under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve the Project without first making a determination

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 17 -

of consistency with the Delta Plan. Water Code § 85225. And because approval of the Project continues l
2 DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the
Delta Reform Act's coequal goals, the Project is inherently inconsistent with what would be required by
4 any valid Delta Plan.

5 74. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings

6 as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,
7 its approval must be set aside. Water Code § 85225.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)
10 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
11 75. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

12 reference.

13 76. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
14 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
15 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

16 77. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
17 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions

18 they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
19 sO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society
20 Court went on to explain:

21 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of
22 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause
23 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so

24 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the
25 uses protected by the trust.

26 Id., citations omitted.

27 78. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

28 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 18 -

general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

2 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

3 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the

4 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

5 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

6 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

7 79. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and

8 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Despite public comment regarding the Project's

9 impacts to public trust resources, DWR declined to address or examine the issue in its FEIR.

10 80.. Feasible alternatives exist that would mitigate or avoid these significant impacts, including,
11 but not limited to a reduced Table A alternative, or an alternative that incorporates water conservation

12 goals. Such alternatives would reduce diversions, have beneficial effects on fish and wildlife, and attain
13 most of the Project's basic objectives.

14 81. By approving the Project despite the fact that feasible alternatives exist that would preserve
15 public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, DWR abdicated its affirmative statutory and
16 constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever feasible,"
17 based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on public trust
18 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside
21 Project Approvals as Contrary to CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5)
22 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)
23 82. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
24 reference.

25 83. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to
26 approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085
27 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:

28 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law;

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |lDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 19 -

1 b. such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

2 C. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record
3 before DWR.

4 84. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects, among

5 others:

6 a. DWR violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

7 b. DWR violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged hereinabove; and

8 C. DWR violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged hereinabove.

9 85. DWR's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures required by
10 CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded DWR's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of
11 discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:

14 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR from taking any action to
15 carry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;
16 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to set aside and vacate its approval of the
17 Project, and certification of its FEIR;

18 3. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful;

19 4. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all activity implementing the
20 Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it has taken all

21 actions necessary to bring its approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA, the Delta
22 Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and the Code of Civil Procedure;

23 5. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

25 FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION, and the WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE
26 (collectively "Conservation Groups") hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate against defendant
27 and respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and by this Verified Petition for Writ of
28 Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorney's Fees (*Verified

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees

Petition") hereby allege as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), Public Resources Code (*PRC') section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), the Delta Reform Act

5 ("DRA"), Water Code section 85000, et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action

6 to challenge DWR's November 13, 2018, Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report

7 ("FEIR") for the Water Supply Contract Extension Project (*Project"), and December 11, 2018, Project

g approval. In taking these actions DWR violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust

9 Doctrine.

10 2. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public agencies to

11 examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect
12 California's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency

13 actions.

14 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider

15 alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does neither.

16 4. The Project extends the terms of the State Water Project ("SWP") contracts to December

17 31, 2085, without adequately examining the environmental impacts of doing so, without studying a

18 reasonable range of alternatives, and without compliance with other state law protecting the
19 environment.

20 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

21 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
22 ("CCP") sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus);

23 PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California

24 Constitution.

25 6. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers)

26 and 395 (actions generally) because DWR's offices are located in Sacramento.

27 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a

28 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely

|Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 2 -

served DWR with notice of this suit.

2 PARTIES

3 8. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE (*North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit

4 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was

5 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effects of

6 excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and

7 other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds

8 for recreational, aesthetic, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North

9 Coast Rivers and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will

10 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the

11 Project.

12 9. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt

13 organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the communities

14 that depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR

15 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR

16 seeks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has

17 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection

18 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR

19 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.

20 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to

21 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.

22 10. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS

23 ("PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

24 San Francisco, California. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

25 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined
26 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial

27 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's

28 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 3 -

1 salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

2 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing
3 livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta

4 and its associated ecosystems.

5 11. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
6 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats

7 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in
8 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento

9 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in
10 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich
11 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco
12 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the DWR's Project approval because it would threaten
13 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries resources of the Delta and its connected
14 ecosystems.

15 12. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
16 territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The
17 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionally dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural
18 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of
19 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (*Delta"). The
20 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced
21 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
22 environmental harms that implementation of the Project will allow.

23 13. Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

24 ("DWR") is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of
25 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on November

26 13, 2018, and approval of the Project on December 11, 2018, was subject to and violated the
27 requirements of CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency
28 under CEQA for environmental review of the Project.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 4 -

1 14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to
2 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

3 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the
4 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in

5 part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if

6 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe
7 respondents have been ascertained.

8 15. Real party in interest State Water Contractors ("SWC") is a non-profit corporation

Q composed of and representing public water agencies throughout California that have contracted with
10 DWR to receive SWP water. The Project purports to amend the contract terms that govern DWR's
11 delivery of water to SWC members.

12 16. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to
13 PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that any specific real parties in
14 interest exist. However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is
15 necessary, petitioners have identified SWC as a potential real party in interest. The true names and
16 capacities of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore
17 sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners are
18 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named real
19 parties in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
20 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe real parties
21 in interest have been ascertained.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 17. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
24 their substantial beneficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.
25 18. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
26 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

27 required by law.

28 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 5 -

-

2 the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

3 DWR's Certification of the FEIR and approval of the Project, and ordering it to comply with the laws

4 whose violation is alleged herein, the environmental interests of petitioners and the public that are

5 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other
legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the
6 environment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct.

7

8 20. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
controversy

q exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

10 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitioners are

11 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is
therefore necessary and appropriate.

12

13 21. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because approval of

14 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project

15 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental

16 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to DWR's failure to take the required

17 steps to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et

18 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

LEGAL BACKGROUND

19 CEOA

20

21 22. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

22 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

23 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

24 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

25 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

5 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
6 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

7 24. All California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary
projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is a "public agency" and a "state agency" as defined in CEQA. PRC §

o 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.

10 25. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

11 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the

12 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and

13 Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory

14 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and recognized under CEQA

15 Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the

16 California Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2),

17 15300-15333 and 15354.

18 26. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that a

19 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those effects and

20 suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve

21 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant environmental effects. PRC §§
22 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096, 15120-15132, 15160-15170.

23 27. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid

24 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guidelines 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA's

25 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,
26 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only
27 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. v. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.

The Delta Reform Act

2 28. To address the indisputably perilous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature

3 enacted the Delta Reform Act, declaring that "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and

4 California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water
Code § 85001(a), emphasis added. The Legislature found that "the Delta' is a critically important

6 natural resource for California and the nation. It serves Californians concurrently as both the hub of the
California water system and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North
and South America.3 Water Code $ 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization
of the state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code 85001(a), emphasis added.
10 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,
11 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water
12 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state
13 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.
14 29. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta
15 ecosystem and ensuring water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight
16 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

17 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of the state

18 over the long term.

19 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta as an evolving place.

20 (c) Restore the Delta ecosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a healthy
21 estuary and wetland ecosystem.

22 (d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water use.

23 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

24 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.
25 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta by effective emergency
26 preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.

27 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility, accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.
28 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 8

30. The Legislature also declared that:

2 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeting California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing in
3 improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiency. Each region that depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for
4 water through investment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional 5 coordination of local and regional water supply efforts.

6 Water Code § 85021, emphasis added.

7 The Public Trust Doctrine

8 31. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable

9 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are

10 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

11 32. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted

12 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions

13 they . consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
14 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society

15 Court went on to explain:

16 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative 17 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

18 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the 19 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the

20 uses protected by the trust.

21 Id., citations omitted.

22 33. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

23 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

24 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

25 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

26 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] .. . the

27 preservation of those lands in their natural state, sO that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

28 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees -9 -

which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

2 34. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

3 the public trust doctrine ... [,] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

4 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

5 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. v. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A]

6 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

7 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Id. at 570.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 35. "[Tjhe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and
10 international significance, containing irreplaceable resources." PRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest

11 and most productive estuarine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in

12 peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of

13 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current and future generations." Id.

14 36. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two

15 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for

16 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and the California (or "State") Water Project ("SWP").

17 Second, for too long, agricultural diverters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off

18 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substances into groundwater and the rivers that are

19 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,

20 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

21 37. Due to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to

22 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant

23 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in

24 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run

25 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been

26 driven perilously close to extirpation.

27 38. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered

28 Species Act ("ESA") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population declines,

/Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 10 -

1 declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its

2 tributaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared

3 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA in 2005. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

4 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat

5 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of
6 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical

7 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fed.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt were declared endangered in 1993 (58

8 Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

0 39. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and diversions

10 that would have destroyed the free-flowing rivers of California's North Coast and removed additional

11 essential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steelhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was

12 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre feet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,

13 DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all

14 but the wettest of water years.

15 40. In addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water

16 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that

17 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas

18 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated soils

19 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and

20 sodium chlorides and sulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaries

21 threatens the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.

22 41. DWR's existing waters supply contracts with the SWC begin to expire in 2035 and the last

23 ends by 2042. DWR states that an extension of these contracts is necessary to finance capital

24 expenditures for the SWP through the use of revenue bonds. DWR entered into a negotiation process

25 regarding potential terms for its contract extensions, and petitioners provided detailed comments

26 regarding the environmental impacts and considerations that must be addressed during the contract

27 extension process that became the Project, including comments dated July 3, 2013, July 10, 2013, and
28 January 29, 2014, by PCFFA, and March 3, 2014 by PCFFA and the Winnemem Wintu Tribe.

F 42. On or about September 12, 2014 DWR issued a Notice of Preparation notifying the public

2 that it would act as the lead agency for the preparation of an EIR for the Project. That Notice of

3 Preparation identified the Project as "amending certain provisions of the State Water Resources

4 Development System (SWRDS) Water Supply Contracts."

5 43. In response to the Notice of Preparation, in October 2014, petitioners PCFFA, IFR, North

6 Coast Rivers, San Francisco Fishermen, and other environmental groups, agencies, and members of the

7 public submitted detailed scoping comments to DWR. Commentors raised concerns regarding the scope

8 of DWR's Project and exclusion of interrelated decisions and approvals. Commentors raised concerns

9 regarding the ways in which climate change and sea level rise will occur during the Project's term and
10 the need to examine how the Project's impacts would change over time. Commentors requested that
11 DWR disclose and analyze the Project's potential changes regarding responsibility for fish, wildlife and
12 recreation mitigation measures. And commentors requested that DWR study alternatives that reduced
13 total contract amounts in light of the SWP's historic over-allocation and likely reduction in available
14 water over the duration of the Project, and that established water conservation standards for SWP water,

15 among other concerns.

16 44. In August 2016, DWR released its Draft EIR for the Project. The Draft EIR failed to

17 address many of the concerns raised during the scoping process.

18 45. Petitioner PCFFA provided detailed comments on DWR's Draft EIR via letter dated

19 October 17, 2016. These comments highlighted DWR's failure to address the Project's impacts, refusal

20 to study appropriate Project alternatives, and improper piecemealing of its environmental analysis.
46. PCFFA and IFR submitted additional comments on the Project that DWR received on or 21

22 about August 13, 2018.

23 47. IFR, North Coast Rivers and San Francisco Fishermen, along with other concerned
24 organizations, submitted additional comments regarding the Project that DWR received on or about
25 September 25, 2018.

26 48. On November 13, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth certified the FEIR.

27 49. On December 11, 2018, DWR Director Karla Nemeth approved the Project.
28 50. DWR's Notice of Determination was received by the Governor's Office of Planning and

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Violation of CEQA)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 51. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

6 reference.

7 52. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, on

8 the grounds that DWR committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner

9 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.

10 53. The purpose of an EIR is to provide agencies and the public with information about a
11 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential

12 alternatives to the project. PRC § 21061. The EIR must "include a detailed statement" describing, inter

13 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and

14 potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).

15 The FEIR's Analysis Is Improperly Segmented

16 54. CEQA requires agencies to prepare EIRs regarding the impacts of "projects" that may have

17 significant environmental impacts. Guidelines § 15064(a)(1). CEQA defines "project" to mean "the

18 whole of an action." Guidelines § 15378(a). "The term 'project' refers to the activity which is being

19 approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The

20 term 'project' does not mean each separate governmental approval." Guidelines § 15378(c).

21 Accordingly, agencies "must consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when
22 determining whether [the action] will have a significant environmental effect (Citizens Assoc. for

23 Sensible Development of Bishop Area V. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151)." Guidelines §

24 15003(h), see also Guidelines § 15378(a), (c).

25 55. CEQA thus intends to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become submerged

26 by chopping a large project into many little ones - each with a minimal potential impact on the
27 environment - which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local Agency
28 Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 13 -

2 56. Here, instead of studying all of its interdependent actions together, DWR has improperly

3 segmented its analysis of the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

4 Management and California WaterFix from its analysis and consideration of the Project. DWR

5 circulated a Draft EIR for the State Water Project Water Supply Contract Amendments for Water

6 Management and California Waterfix for public comment in October 2018. Yet DWR's Project

7 approval is necessary for its implementation of WaterFix and its related contract amendments.

8 57. This segmentation violates CEQA's demand for unified and comprehensive environmental

review:

50 10 Theoretical independence is not a good reason for segmenting the environmental analysis of the two matters. Doing so runs the risk that some environmental impacts produced by

11 the way the two matters combine or interact might not be analyzed in the separate environmental reviews. Furthermore, if the two matters are analyzed in sequence and

12 the combined or interactive environmental effects are not fully recognized until the review of the second matter, the opportunity to implement effective mitigation measures as part

13 of the first matter may be lost. This could result in mitigation measures being adopted in the second matter that are less effective than what would have been adopted if the matters had been analyzed as a single project.

14

15 Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214,
1230. DWR's segmented review subverts CEQA's informational purposes.

16 DWR's No Project Alternative Violates CEQA

17

18 58. The CEQA Guidelines direct that "[t]he 'no project' analysis shall discuss the existing

19 conditions at the time the notice of preparation is published .. . as well as what would be reasonably
expected to occur in the foreseeable future if the project were not approved . . .." (Guidelines §
20 15126.6(e)(2).)

21

22 59. DWR's No Project Alternative improperly assumes that the SWP contracts would be

23 renewed absent the Project, and that all water deliveries would occur with or without the Project. As

24 such the scenario examined in the environmental documents does not describe a situation where an

25 agency approval is not granted. Instead it describes a scenario where a different Project alternative is

26 approved, and SWP water deliveries continue. DWR has not examined the environmental conditions of

27 the Project against an appropriate No Project Alterative where these deliveries are not made. This failure
violates CEQA.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Il Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 14 -

P DWR Failed to Fully Consider A Reasonable Range of Alternatives and Dismissed Feasible Alternatives from Review
2

3 60. Under CEQA, an EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even

4 if they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or be more costly."

5 Guidelines § 15126.6(b).

6 61. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about each alternative to allow

7 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

8 Agencies must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible

9 alternatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines § 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project
10 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.
11 Guidelines § 15021(a)(2).

12 62. The FEIR fails to study a reasonable range of alternatives, including an alternative that
13 significantly reduces deliveries, or an alternative that implements conservation targets. Instead, DWR
14 dismissed any reduced contract quantity alternatives or water conservation target alternatives from

15 detailed analysis before it prepared its Draft EIR.

16 63. All but one of the Alternatives studied in the FEIR contemplate the same level of water

17 deliveries, and only vary in end year and financial structure. For this reason, DWR concludes that
18 Alternatives 2 through 6 have the same impacts as the Project. Alternative 7 would extend the 7 end-date
19 of the contracts to 2085 but allows some current contractors to "choose not to sign." None of these
20 Alternatives are sufficiently distinct to provide a reasonable range of alternatives under CEQA.

21 64. Because none of the Alternatives substantially reduce the existing level of excessive

22 exports, and none restore the Delta's "natural flows," the FEIR failed to analyze a reasonable range of
23 alternatives as CEQA requires.

24 The FEIR Improperly Concludes That the Project Has No Impacts

25 65. DWR concludes that the Project will have no impact on any resource topics "because it
26 would amend and add financial provisions" to its SWP contracts and "would not create new water

27 management measures, alter the existing authority to build or modify existing SWP facilities, or change
28 water allocation provisions" of those contracts. ES-4. But DWR overlooks the essential purpose of the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IlDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 15 -

1 Project's contracts to deliver water through the SWP. DWR's SWP water deliveries have impacts to

2 the source and receiving watersheds, including impacts on important habitat, yet DWR fails to consider

3 these impacts as impacts of the Project. DWR's failure to address the impacts of Project approval

4 violates CEQA.

5 66. DWR also improperly concludes that the Project has no cumulative impacts. Id. But DWR

6 has failed to examine the closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future

7 projects that, when taken with the Project's water deliveries, will result in significant cumulative

8 impacts. This violates CEQA.

9 DWR Fails to Analyze Changed Circumstances

10 67. DWR's FEIR relies upon the 1986 Coordinated Operating Agreement ("COA") between
11 DWR and the United States Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to describe the operating criteria for
12 the SWP, and assumes that Project operations will be constrained by the 1986 COA. Yet as DWR
13 prepared the FEIR, it was actively renegotiating the COA with Reclamation, and executed an addendum
14 to the COA the day after it approved the Project. The FEIR fails to address this reasonably foreseeable
15 change in SWP operations as either part of the Project itself or a closely related and reasonably
16 foreseeable probable project, despite its likely significant cumulative impacts.
17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

19 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

20 68. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
21 reference.

22 69. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq., was passed by the Legislature in
23 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water

24 infrastructure are in crisis" and that "[r]esolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization of the
25 state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was
26 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provide
27 for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the
28 Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state agencies to develop a

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 16 -

1 legally enforceable Delta Plan." Id. con 85001(c).

2 70. The Delta Reform Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered

3 action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

4 action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship

5 Council. Water Code § 85225.
71. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a plan, program or project" as defined

7 by PRC section 21065 that:

8 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.

Q (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the state or a local public agency.
10 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

11 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

12 goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Delta.

13 Water Code § 85057.5(a). While the Delta Reform Act states that "[rJoutine maintenance and operation
14 of the State Water Project" is not a covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption
15 because it is neither routine maintenance nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).
16 72. The 2013 Delta Plan prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set
17 aside by the Sacramento Superior Court because it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reform
18 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated
19 with achieving reduced Delta reliance, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring
20 more natural flows, and increased water supply reliability, in accordance with the Delta Reform Act."

21 Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. The Delta
22 Stewardship Council's appeal of this decision is pending before the Third District Court of Appeal (Case
23 No. C082944). In addition, petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's
24 2018 Delta Plan Amendments, as those amendments violate CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, the Public
25 Trust Doctrine and other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacrament Superior Court Case Nos.
26 34-2018-80002898, 34-2018-80002900, 34-2018-80002901, 34-2018-80002904.

27 73. DWR denies that the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act. FEIR 2-100.

28 But under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve the Project without first making a determination

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for |Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 17 -

1 of consistency with the Delta Plan. Water Code § 85225. And because approval of the Project continues

2 DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without any attempt to address the Project's conflict with the

3 Delta Reform Act's coequal goals, the Project is inherently inconsistent with what would be required by

4 any valid Delta Plan.

5 74. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings
as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,

7 its approval must be set aside. Water Code § 85225.

10 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

11 75. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

12 reference.

13 76. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable

14 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
15| particularly important and applicable to the Delta."

16 77. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted

17 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
18 they consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,

19 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society

20 Court went on to explain:

21 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative 22 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state 23 may have to approve appropriations despite foresecable harm to public trust uses. In so

24 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

26 Id., citations omitted.

27 78. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

28 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

/Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for IDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees - 18 -

1 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
2 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For

3 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] .. . the

4 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

5 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

6 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."

7 79. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and

8 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation. Despite public comment regarding the Project's
impacts to public trust resources, DWR declined to address or examine the issue in its FEIR.

10 80. Feasible alternatives exist that would mitigate or avoid these significant impacts, including,
11 but not limited to a reduced Table A alternative, or an alternative that incorporates water conservation
12 goals. Such alternatives would reduce diversions, have beneficial effects on fish and wildlife, and attain

13 most of the Project's basic objectives.

14 81. By approving the Project despite the fact that feasible alternatives exist that would preserve
15 public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, DWR abdicated its affirmative statutory and
16 constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever feasible,"
17 a based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on public trust
18 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. v. State Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

21 Project Approvals as Contrary to CCP §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

22 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

23 82. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
24 reference.

25 83. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to
26 approve the Project and to certify the FEIR thereon, because such approvals violate CCP sections 1085
27 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among others:

28 a. such approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law;

Terified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
I/Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and for Attorneys' Fees 19 -

H b.

2 such approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

C.

3 before DWR. such approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

4

5 others: 84. DWR failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects, among

6 a. DWR violated CEQA as alleged hereinabove;

7 b. DWR violated the Delta Reform Act as alleged hereinabove; and

8 C.

9 DWR violated the Public Trust Doctrine as alleged hereinabove.

10 85. DWR's actions in approving the Project without complying with the procedures required by

11 CCP sections 1085 and 1094.5 exceeded DWR's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of
discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for relief as follows:

14 1.

15 For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR from taking any action to

carry out the Project pending, and following, the hearing of this matter;

16 2.

17 For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to set aside and vacate its approval of the
Project, and certification of its FEIR;

18 3.

19 4. For declaratory relief declaring the Project, its approval, and its FEIR to be unlawful;
For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all activity implementing the
20 Project that could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until it has taken all

21

22 actions necessary to bring its approval of the Project and its FEIR into compliance with CEQA, the Delta
Reform Act, the Public Trust Doctrine and the Code of Civil Procedure;

23 5. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

24 6. For costs incurred in this action; and

California Rules of Court (CRC) as follows:*

The judges assigned to civil writ cases listed in a Notice Of Related Case filed and served
pursuant to CRC 3.300(d) identify which one of them is assigned to the earliest filed case, information which should be included in the Notice of Related Case pursuant to CRC 3.300(c)(2). That judge proceeds under CRC 3.300(h)(1)(A) to determine whether the cases are related
within the meaning of CRC 3.300(a).
If the judge assigned to the earliest filed case determines that the cases are related, the judge orders the cases related and assigned to his or her department. That order is filed in each of the related cases and served on the parties to each of the related cases pursuant to
CRC 3.300(i). In addition, an Amended Notice of Case Assignment, reassigning to the judge each of the related cases not previously assigned to him or her,. is filed and served upon all parties to each reassigned case. Courtesy copies of the order and Amended Notice(s) of Case
Assignment are sent to the judges previously assigned to any of the related cases.
If the judge assigned to the earliest filed case determines that the cases are not related within the meaning of CRC 3.300(a), the judge issues a minute order stating and briefly explaining the determination. This minute order is filed in each of the cases listed in the Notice of Related Case
and is served on all parties to the listed cases pursuant to CRC 3.300(i).

In response to an order determining that the cases are not related, any party to any of the cases listed in the Notice of Related Case may file a motion pursuant to CRC 3.300(h)(1)(D) to have the cases related. The motion must be filed with the Presiding judge or a judge designated
by the Presiding Judge.

to the Procedures for Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs, an ex parte
application for a stay order includes the following supporting documents and papers:
"Endorsed copy of the petition.
Points and authorities, declarations and other supporting documents, including
relevant portions of the administrative record if available.
Proposed order to show cause why the administrative decision under review in the proceeding should not be temporarily stayed pending a hearing on the merits of the writ petition (OSC). This proposed OSC should contain: blank spaces for the date and time of the hearing on the OSC, an order for service of the OSC and any supporting papers not previously served
a with a blank space for a date of service prior to the hearing on the OSC, and
an order staying the administrative decision pending the hearing on the OSC.
Proposed stay order. Notice of hearing on the petition with blank spaces for date and time (unless the stay is being requested in conjunction with an application for an alternative writ).
Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3.1204.

In addition, CCP § 1094.5 (g) and (h) require that proof of service of a copy of the application on the respondent accompany an application for a stay. See
subdivisions (g) and (h) for required manner of service.

2. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an ex parte hearing date and time and to determine whether the assigned writ department requires any of the documents or papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing. Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

3. Notify respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the hearing on the ex parte stay application in accordance with rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include the details of
this notification in the declaration regarding notice prepared pursuant to rule 3.1204.
Note: The court prefers at least 48 hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, will accept less notice.
If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in Step to be filed before the ex parte hearing, file and serve the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing. (See rule 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court).

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 4 of 11 4

At the ex parte hearing, depending on the nature of the factual and legal issues raised by the stay application and the practical exigencies of the matter, the court will either rule on the stay application immediately or issue the proposed OSC with or without a temporary stay order pending the hearing on the OSC at a specified date and time.
If the court grants a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court will sign and file the proposed stay order and set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The court clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the
petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, in the alternative writ.

If the court denies a stay at the ex parte hearing or the hearing on the OSC, the court, upon petitioner's request, will set a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition. The clerk will record the hearing date and time in the notice of hearing on the petition, or if the court has ordered the issuance of an alternative writ, in the alternative writ.

Applying for a
Temporary Stay
in Traditional Mandate
Proceedings (CCP § 1085):
Step Action

1. Follow the statutory and regulatory provisions for obtaining a temporary restraining order (TRO), an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued (OSC), and/or a preliminary injunction, set forth in the Code of Civil Procedure (including but not limited to CCP §§ 525, 526, 527, 528 and 529) and rule 3.1150 of the California Rules of Court. These provisions constitute rules of practice for temporary stays in mandate proceedings brought under in CCP § 1085 in the absence of temporary
stay provisions specific to such mandate proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

2. When following the statutory and regulatory procedures for obtaining a TRO and/or an OSC, comply with the ex parte procedures outlined above in "Applying for a Temporary Stay in Administrative Mandate Proceedings" and in rule 3.1201 et seq. of the
California Rules of Court.

3. If no TRO or OSC is sought, notice a motion for a preliminary injunction following the procedures set forth below in "Bringing Motions Before the Hearing on the Merits"

Note that a temporary stay in proceedings on a petition for a writ of prohibition may be obtained by following the procedures set forth below under "Setting a Hearing on the Merits of a
Petition, (2) Securing issuance of alternative writ." An alternative writ of prohibition, unlike an
alternative writ of mandate, stays specified action by the respondent until further order of the court. (See CCP §S 1087, 1104.)

Bringing Motions before
The Hearing on the
Merits of a Writ Petition:

Motions on the pleadings and other pretrial matters brought in civil actions -- including
motions for change of venue, demurrers, motions to strike, motions to dismiss, discovery
motions, and motions for summary judgment -- may generally be brought in writ
proceedings. (See CCP § 1109.)

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page of 11

Motions addressing the merits of the petition in whole or in part should be calendared for a hearing at the same time as the hearing on the merits. Motions directed at resolving issues preliminary to and distinct from the issues related to the merits of the petition, such as untimeliness of the petition under an applicable statute of limitations, should be calendared before the hearing on the merits of a writ petition. The court, in the exercise of its discretion to control the order of litigation before it, may advance the hearing on a motion to a date before the hearing on the merits or may postpone a motion to the hearing on the merits when such advancement or postponement will promote the efficient conduct
and disposition of the proceeding.

Because a writ petition is usually disposed of by a hearing on the merits which is limited to oral argument on written briefs and documentary evidence, the usefulness of a motion for
summary judgment or summary adjudication in economically disposing of an unmeritorious case or claim is substantially reduced in writ proceedings. Thus, before bringing a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication, counsel should carefully evaluate whether the purpose of the motion can be achieved more directly and completely through a hearing on the merits of the petition.

Step Action

Contact the assigned writ department to reserve a date and time available on the
department's calendar for a hearing on the motion. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Some assigned writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays.

2. Notice the motion in accordance with the civil law and motion procedures in
CCP § 1005 and in compliance with the California Rules of Court, including rules
3.1110 through 3.1113, 3.1115, 3.1116, 3.1300, and 3.1320 through 3.1324.
Comply with the page limits for memoranda set forth in rule 3.1113.

If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the notice of motion must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

Setting a Hearing
on the Merits of a
Writ Petition:
If a hearing on the merits of a writ petition has not been set in conjunction with an ex parte hearing on an application for a temporary stay, it may be set either by (1) noticing a hearing on the petition or (2) securing issuance of an alternative writ. Note: The court prefers, as more efficient and economical for both itself and the parties, the procedure of noticing a hearing a on the petition.

The date set for a hearing a on the merits of a writ petition, whether by notice or alternative writ, should allow the parties to file briefs in accordance with the following schedule established in Local Rule 2.26(D):
Opening brief: Due 45 days before the hearing
Opposition brief: Due 25 days before the hearing
Reply brief: Due 15 days before the hearing

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 6 of 11

Note that Local Rule 2.26(D) limits the length of opening and opposition briefs to 30 pages and reply briefs to 20 pages instead of the page limits in rule 3.1113 of the California Rules of Court.
The date of the hearing on the merits may be expedited and the briefing schedule shortened upon an application setting forth circumstances warranting an expedited hearing. The application for an expedited hearing may be made orally at a hearing for a temporary stay or alternative writ or on an ex parte basis in accordance with rule 3.1201 through 3.1206 of the California Rules of Court.

(1) Noticing a hearing on a writ petition

Step Action

1. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for a hearing on the writ petition. Prior to reserving a date, contact the other parties to the writ petition and determine their availability on the date. Writ petitions are normally heard on Fridays.

2. Prepare and file a notice of hearing on the writ petition specifying the reserved hearing date and time. If the assigned writ department uses the tentative ruling system, the notice of hearing must contain tentative ruling language available from the department.

File the notice of hearing either at the civil front counter in Room 102 or by mail
addressed to the Civil Division - Room 102, 720 9th Street, Sacramento, CA 95814.

4 Serve a copy of the notice of hearing on respondent(s) and real party(ies) no later than the time allowed for filing and serving the opening brief. If not previously served, the
writ petition, the Notice of Assignment, and this Guide should also be served no later
than the time for filing and serving the opening brief.

(2) Securing issuance of an alternative writ

The alternative writ is an order to show cause that calendars a writ petition for a hearing
on the merits. With the exception of an alternative writ of prohibition issued pursuant to CCP § 1104, the alternative writ does not, in and of itself, accomplish a stay or afford any
affirmative relief.

Note that, with the alternative writ method, two writs may be issued in the proceeding.
First, the alternative writ is issued to set a hearing on the merits of the petition. Second, a
peremptory writ may issue after the hearing on the merits.
Step Action

1. Prepare an ex parte application for an alternative writ. Specify "Ex Parte" in the title
of the application.

As provided in rules 3.1201 and 3.1202 of the California Rules of Court and this guide, an ex parte application for an alternative writ includes the following supporting
documents and papers:
Endorsed copy of the petition.
Points and authorities and any other supporting documents.
Proposed order directing issuance of alternative writ.
Proposed alternative writ with blank spaces for the date and time of a hearing
on the petition. (Include a signature block for the clerk, not the judge.)
Declaration regarding notice, as specified in rule 3.1204.

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 7 of 11

2. Contact the assigned writ department to reserve an available date and time for an ex parte hearing on the application for an alternative writ and to determine whether the
department requires the papers listed above in Step 1 to be filed before the hearing.
Note that some writ departments hear writ matters only on Fridays. Also note that, absent a showing of good cause or waiver by the respondent(s) and real party(ies),
some departments will not issue an alternative writ unless the writ petition and
application for the alternative writ have been served on respondent(s) and real party(ies) at least five days before the ex parte hearing. (See CCP § 1088, requiring service of copy of petition in conjunction with application for alternative writ; CCP § 1107, providing a five-day period for respondent(s) and real party(ies) to respond to a writ petition after receiving service of the petition.)

P

3. Notify the respondent(s) and real party(ies) of the date and time of the ex parte hearing on the alternative writ pursuant to rule 3.1203 of the California Rules of Court. Include
the details of this notification in the declaration regarding notice pursuant to rule 3.1204.
Note: The court prefers at least 48 hours' notice but, upon a showing of urgency, will accept less notice.

4. If the assigned writ department does not require any of the documents listed above in
Step 1 to be filed before the hearing, file and serve on all parties the documents and papers as soon as possible and no later than the time of the hearing.

If the court grants the application for an alternative writ, the court signs and files the proposed order directing issuance of the alternative writ that sets the petition for a hearing
on the merits. The clerk then issues the proposed alternative writ with the date and time of the hearing and provides it to the petitioner after the petitioner has paid the issuance fee in Room 102. The writ must be served upon respondent(s) and real party(ies) in the same manner as a summons a in a civil action unless the court expressly orders otherwise.
(See CCP §S 1073, 1096.) Once served, the writ must be filed with a proof of service.

Applying for a
Continuance:

After a hearing has been set on a motion or on the merits of a petition, it may be continued only upon approval of the court. If the continuance requires a change in the briefing schedule, such change must also be approved.

Step Action

Present a telephone request for a continuance of the hearing to the clerk in the assigned writ department, including the reason(s) for the continuance and any necessary changes in the briefing schedule. Present the request as far in advance of the scheduled hearing
date as possible.

Upon the court's approval, the clerk will provide available dates on the court's calendar
to which the hearing may be continued.

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 8 of 11 8

2. Promptly confer with all counsel to agree upon a mutually convenient hearing date from among the dates provided by the clerk and any necessary changes in the briefing
schedule.

If counsel cannot agree to a continuance, a new hearing date and/or changes in the briefing schedule, the party seeking the continuance may apply for a continuance by noticed motion.

3. Promptly present to the court a stipulation signed by all parties, including the reason for the continuance, the agreed upon hearing date and any agreed upon changes in the briefing schedule, with a proposed order.

Pay the filing fee for the stipulation and order pursuant to subdivision (c) of
Government Code section 70617 in Room 102.
When the stipulation and order has been signed and filed by the court, serve the
stipulation and order on all parties.

Note that these procedures do not apply when a motion is dropped from the calendar by the moving party. In such circumstances, the moving party must telephonically notify the court and all other parties as far as possible in advance of the date on which the motion is to be heard and send a confirming letter to the court with copies to the other
parties.

Dismissing a
Writ Petition:

Step Action

Promptly notify the assigned writ department pursuant to rule 3.1385 of the California
Rules of Court when a writ proceeding is settled or otherwise disposed of.

2. File a dismissal of the writ proceeding in the assigned writ department within 45 days after the date of the settlement pursuant to rule 3.1385(b) or after the date specified in the notice of conditional settlement pursuant to rule 3.1385(c).

Lodging an
Administrative Record:

Step Action

When securing a date and time for a hearing on the merits of the petition, inform the clerk in the Issigned writ department about the size of the administrative record in the
case. Determine the department's preferences regarding the format, binding and
container for the administrative record.

Guide to Procedures For Prosecuting Petitions for Prerogative Writs

Revised 1.1.2014 Page 9 of 11

2. Lodge the administrative record with the assigned writ department no later than 25 days prior to the hearing on the merits of a writ petition. If the record is not lodged by this time, some assigned writ departments may take the matter off calendar.
Consult with the assigned writ department if you wish to lodge the administrative record more than 25 days before the hearing on the merits of a writ petition.

3. Attach a cover sheet to the administrative record and any boxes containing the record
that lists the:
Case name,
Case number,
Date and time of the hearing.

At the hearing on the merits of the petition, the court will mark the administrative record
as an exhibit and admit it into evidence. At the conclusion of the proceedings on the
petition, the court may return the administrative record to the party who lodged it or .
destroy it pursuant to CCP § 1952 through 1952.3 and subdivision (i) of CCP § 1094.5.
The Hearing on the Merits:
All hearings on writ petitions proceed by way of oral argument. If a party wishes to
present oral testimony at the hearing, the party must obtain permission pursuant to rule 3.1306 of the California Rules of Court.

If the assigned writ department uses a tentative ruling system and posts a tentative ruling on the court day before the hearing on the writ petition, a party desiring to be heard must contact the clerk and request oral argument by the time designated in the posted tentative ruling. When requesting oral argument, the party must advise the clerk that all other parties have been notified.

Appearing by
Telephone:

Parties may appear by telephone in accordance with Local Rule 2.04.

Note that some assigned writ departments permit telephonic appearances in hearings on
motions only on a limited basis and in hearings on in the merits of a writ petition only under
compelling circumstances.

Dear Attorney General Becerra,

We are in receipt of your letter of January 11, 2019 returning the documents in the above

Our intent in delivering the documents to the Office of the Attorney General was not to
accomplish service of process upon Respondent/Defendant Department of Water Resources

with a complete set of the initiating case documents, consistent with Code of Civil Procedure
section 388 and Public Resources Code section 21167.7. Believing these documents should be
delivered to your office pursuant to those statutes, we return them (sans the Summons, which
was inadvertently included in the earlier service) for your information.

Veky truly TL dAU Stephan C. Volker Attorney for Petitioners and Plaintiffs North Coast Rivers Alliance, et al.
