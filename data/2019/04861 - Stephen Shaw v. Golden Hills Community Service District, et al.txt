28

SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 PRELIMINARY ITEMS

2 1. Plaintiff and Petitioner STEPHEN SHAW is a resident and landowner within Kern

3 County, California, specifically within the boundaries of Defendant and Respondent GOLDEN

4 HILLS COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT ("GOLDEN HILLS" or "Respondent").

5 2. Defendant and Respondent GOLDEN HILLS COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT

6 is a community services districted created per the California Community Services District Law

7 pursuant to Gov. Code, § 61000 et seq. and is the Lead Agency related to this complaint.

8 3. Defendant, JOHN BUCKLEY, an individual, is now, and all times mentioned in this

9 complaint was an individual residing in Kern County, California and is a member of the board of
10 directors of GOLDEN HILLS directing and controlling the acts set forth below.

11 4. Defendant, DAVID BENHAM, an individual, is now, and all times mentioned in this

12 complaint was an individual residing in Kern County, California and is a member of the board of
13 directors of GOLDEN HILLS directing and controlling the acts set forth below.
14 5. Defendant, MARILYN WHITE, an individual, is now, and all times mentioned in

15 this complaint was an individual residing in Kern County, California and is member of the board

16 of directors of GOLDEN HILLS directing and controlling the acts set forth below.
17 6. Plaintiff is unaware of the true names and capacities of defendants Does through
18 10, inclusive, and each of them, and therefore sues them by those fictitious names. In addition to

19 language in charging allegations that includes fictitiously named defendants, Plaintiff is informed

20 and believes, and on that basis, alleges, that each of those defendants named as a Doe was in some
21 manner responsible for, participated in and/or contributed to the misconduct alleged against all
22 Defendants/Respondents as set forth herein causing the injury and damage suffered by Plaintiff as
23 alleged in this complaint.

24 7. Plaintiff is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Defendant was the
25 agent of the other Defendants, and in doing acts herein alleged, was acting within the scope of

26 such agency. Because of the agency relationship between Defendants, and each of them, each
27 Defendant had actual or constructive knowledge of each of the acts of the other Defendants.

28 8. The purpose of the Board of Directors for GOLDEN HILLS is primarily to act as a

2
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 management body for the protection, maintenance, development, architectural control, and

2 improvement of the areas of GOLDEN HILLS and owes fiduciary duties to the its members and

3 landowners.

4 VENUE

5 9. Venue is proper in this Court because GOLDEN HILLS is located in Kern County

6 and pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 and

7 21168.5. Venue is also proper in that at the defendants reside within Kern County. Among other

8 things, Respondent's Project threatens prime natural resources and the environment located within

9 the County of Kern.

10 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

11 10. Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. (14 Cal. Code Regs.
12 §15201)

13 11. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Cal. Pub. Res.
14 Code §§ 21000, et seq.) and the Guidelines implementing the same (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000,
15 et seq.), SHAW brings this action and challenges the actions by Respondent GOLDEN HILLS in
16 certifying and/or adopting a Notice of Exemption (NOE) related to its Nature Park Restoration
17 Project ("Project"), and its decision to implement the action by citing to an inapplicable categorical
18 exemption to avoid CEQA review: (1) Class 1, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301 (use of District

19 facilities, etc.) ("CEQA Guidelines"); and undertaking a wholly different project beyond any scope
20 of any prior projects or prior approvals.

21 12. The Project approved by GOLDEN HILLS will among other actions, construct
22 fencing and barriers that will have disproportionate impact on the environment and on SHAW and
23 his property and will separate privately owned lots, create damage to wildlife and scenic resources

24 among other significant impacts which threaten the environment.
25 13. In an email Dated May 10, 2019, Defendant JOHN BUCKLEY stated that "all of the
26 park will eventually be fenced, this is just the start". GOLDEN HILLS has not publicly disclosed
27 the connected nature of the current fencing proposal and the ultimate plan to fence the entirely of

28 the nature park.

3
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

14. Some of the areas proposed for fencing near Plaintiff's property are wetlands, which

2 were not disclosed or considered on which the District's CEQA action was based. Further, the

3 District has not discuss any impacts of fencing on mammals. This District is near Tehachapi that is

4 home to many mammals and migratory routes.

5 15. GOLDEN HILLS' stated rationale for the current fencing proposal is to protect the

6 nature park from damage by unauthorized off-highway vehicles but has not clearly articulated how

7 the desired fencing placement is related to the stated rationale.

8 16. GOLDEN HILLS' fencing proposal includes adding fences on GOLDEN HILLS

9 property even in locations where existing fencing exists on adjacent private property already serves

10 as a barrier to off-highway vehicle incursions.

11 17. Three of the five Board of Directors for GOLDEN HILLS voted in favor to adopt the
12 NOE and approve the Project-Defendant, JOHN BUCKLEY; Defendant, DA VID BENHAM, and
13 Defendant, MARILYN WHITE (hereinafter referred to as "DIRECTOR DEFENDANTS").

14 SHAW is informed and believes based upon the prospective mapping of the proposed barriers and
15 damage to wildlife and scenic resources, that such barriers will not be placed near the DIRECTOR
16 DEFENDANTS' residential properties nor block their access to public spaces within the district

17 areas subject to the Project. In addition, no barriers appear to be placed near the properties owned

18 by Respondent's Standing Finance Committee. SHAW has been a strong supporter of conservation

19 and has engaged Respondent's Board of Directors on serious issues in the past.

20 18. Respondent has provided no rationale for this seemingly disproportionate and
21 arbitrary selection of barriers and fencing locations as such actions are arbitrary, capricious, and

22 unreasonable and without justification.

23 19. Petitioner is informed and believes that the intended Project and actions by
24 Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 will in fact result in irreversible environmental consequences that
25 require the appropriate review.

26 20. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 1
27 has not met their obligations under CEQA to ensure that an agency's actions are reviewed before
28

SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 decisions are made and actions undertaken. As here, where Respondent and DOES 1 to 10

2 determined that its action was exempt from CEQA.

3 21. Through this action Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate commanding Respondent and

4 DOES 1 to 10 - to set aside its certification or adoption of its NOE for the Project, its approval of the
5 Project based thereon, its implementation of the Project in whole or in part, and related relief.

6 Petitioner, as well as others in the community, will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if the
7 Court does not grant the requested relief. Petitioner also seeks a preliminary and permanent
8 injunction barring Respondent from undertaking any activity with regard to the Project and any
9 activity which could potentially alter the physical and natural environment in Kern County, pending
10 proper and complete environmental review as required by CEQA.
11 22. This action involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
•12 Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a substantial benefit on the public, and will result
13

14 in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with all legal

15 requirements applicable to the Project, including CEQA.
23.
16 As the Lead Agency on the Project, Respondent GOLDEN HILLS is responsible for

17 preparation of an environmental document that adequately and accurately describes the Project and

18 its impacts, and, if necessary, evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid

19 any significant environmental impacts. Respondent is responsible for implementing and

20 complying with the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the

21 CEQA Guidelines with respect to the Project.
24.
22 Petitioner is beneficially interested in Respondent's performance of its duties to

23 apply all applicable laws and consider rationally and in good faith all record evidence in deciding

24 whether to approve public projects.
STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
25
25.
26 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this

27 Petition, and/or Respondent has failed to provide the notice required by law, and thus Petitioners

28 have fully exhausted their administrative remedies.

26. Petitioner has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions

precedent to the filing of this Complaint and Petition and Respondent has made a final

2 determination and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by state or local law.

3 27. Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 took final action with respect to its approval of the

4 Project and, on May 16, 2019, and May 20, 2019 filed a Notice of Exemption purportedly in

5 compliance with CEQA. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Exemption is attached hereto as

6 Exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by this reference.

7 28. Pursuant to California Government Code §§ 905(i) & 905.1, this action is not

8 subject to the California Torts Claim Act and such other claims have been submitted to Respondent

9 that have been rejected.

10 29. The Parties had previously entered a Tolling Agreement that provided for July 26,
11 2019 as the last day to pursue claims.

12. 30. Concurrently with the filing of this Petition, Petitioner shall serve a copy of this
13 Petition on the California Attorney General's office pursuant to Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and
14 Code of Civil Procedure $388. (See attached Exhibit 2 incorporated by 2 this reference.)

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
CEQA

20 Mandamus

21 (As Against GOLDEN HILLS only and Does 1 to 10)

22 57. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates herein by this reference paragraphs 1 through

23 32 of this Complaint as though fully and completely set forth herein;

24 58. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Legislature

25 declared its intention that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the

26 environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their

27 duties; accordingly, CEQA is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the

28 environment within the reasonable

(2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322.) scope of the statutory language. (Mejia v. City of Los Angeles

9
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

59. A Lead Agency has a to make a threshold determination of CEQA's applicability.

2 "The first tier is jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to
3 determine whether CEQA applies to a proposed activity. (Guidelines, §§ 15060, 15061.)" (Davidon
4 Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 112.) CEQA applies if the activity is a

5 "project" under the statutory definition, unless the project is exempt. (See §§ 21065, 21080.) "If the

6 agency finds the project is exempt from CEQA under any of the stated exemptions, no further
7 environmental review is necessary." (Davidon Homes, p. 113.) In such cases, the agency may file a

8 notice of CEQA exemption, if it chooses to do so. (Guidelines, § 15062, subd. (a).)

9 60. If the project is not exempt-either because it does not fall within an exempt

10 category or because an exception makes the exemption unavailablethen the agency must proceed
11 to the second tier and conduct an initial study. (Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce v. City of
12 Santa Monica (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 786, 792; see Guidelines, § 15063.)
13 61. The second tier of the process, the initial study, serves several purposes. One purpose
14 is to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an environmental impact report (EIR).
15 (Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (c)(1); Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131
16 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1180.) Another of the initial study's purposes is to eliminate unnecessary

17 environmental impact reports. (Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (c)(7).)
18 62. "CEQA excuses the preparation of an EIR and allows the use of a negative
19 declaration when án initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may
20 have a significant effect on the environment." (San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society v.
21 Metropolitan Water Dist. (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 382, 389-390, citing Guidelines, § 15070. See also
22 Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21064, 21080, subd. (c).) In certain situations where a straightforward
23 negative declaration is not appropriate, the agency may permit the use of a mitigated negative
24 declaration. (See § 21064.5; Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (f)(2); San Bernardino Valley Audubon
25 Society, at p. 390, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 836.)

26 63. If the project does not qualify for a negative declaration, "the third step in the
27 process is to prepare a full environmental impact report...." (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose,
28 supra, at p. 113, citing §§ 21100 and 21151, and Guidelines, §§ 15063, subd. (b)(1) & 15080;

10
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Gentry v. City of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1372.)

2 64. The California Supreme Court has "repeatedly recognized that the EIR is the 'heart

3 of CEQA.' " (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6

4 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) As the court observed more than three decades ago, "since the preparation of

5 an EIR is the key to environmental protection under CEQA, accomplishment of the high objectives

6 of that act requires the preparation of an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of

7 substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact." (No Oil, Inc. v.

8 City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.) Other cases have since confirmed the statutory

9 preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR. (See, e.g., Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v.
10 City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689, 703; League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic

11 Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 905.)

12 65. "Choosing the precise time for CEQA compliance involves a balancing of competing
13 factors. EIRs and negative declarations should be prepared as early as feasible in the planning
14 process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet late
15 enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (Guidelines, § 15004,
16 subd. (b). See also, e.g., Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
17 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.) As a general rule, "public agencies shall not undertake actions
18 concerning the proposed public project that would have a significant adverse effect or limit the

19 choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance."
20 (Guidelines, § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)

21 66. When a project is exempt, however, a somewhat different timing rule applies. "When
22 a public agency decides that a project is exempt from CEQA ..., the agency may file a notice of
23 exemption. The notice shall be filed, if at all, after approval of the project." (Guidelines, § 15062,
24 subd. (a), italics added.) "A notice of exemption may be filled out and may accompany the project
25 application through the approval process" but it "shall not be filed ... until the project has been

26 approved." (Id., subd. (b). See also Guidelines, § 15061, subd. (d).)

27 67. "A 'project' is an activity subject to CEQA." (Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (d).) As
28 relevant here, "project" means activity by a public agency that "may cause either a direct physical

11
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment

2 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065, subd. (a).) "The word 'may' in this context connotes a

3 reasonable possibility." (Citizen Action to Serve All Students v. Thornley (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d
4 748, 753.) "'Environment' means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be
affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of

6 historic or aesthetic significance." (§ 21060.5.)

68. The statutory definition of a CEQA project "is amplified in the Guidelines," which

8 clarify that a project means ' "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

9 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in
10 the environment....' (Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a).)" (Association for a Cleaner Environment v..
11 Yosemite Community College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 629, 637; see also, e.g., Lighthouse
12 Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1180.)
13 69. To maximize environmental protection, the concept of a "project" is broadly defined
14 under CEQA. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p.
15 1180.)

16 70: "It is the intent of the Legislature that all agencies of the state government which
17 regulate activities of private individuals, corporations, and public agencies which are found to affect

18 the quality of the environment, shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to
19 preventing environmental damage, while providing decent home and satisfying living
20 environment for every Californian." (Pub. Resources Code, §21000, subd. (g).)
21 71. Long-term protection of the environment is a fundamental criterion of CEQA. (Pub.
22 Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (g).)

23 72. The basic purposes of CEQA are to inform governmental decision makers and the
24 public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities, identify ways

25 that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced, prevent such damage by the

26 imposition of mitigation measures or the adoption of alternative activities that avoid such damage,
27 and disclosure to the public of the reasons for approving an activity with significant, unmitigable
28 environmental effect. (CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a).)

12
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

73. CEQA applies when a public agency proposes to "approve" a project. (Pub.

2 Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).) The term "approval" refers to a public agency decision that

3 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §
4 15352(a).) CEQA applies to "discretionary projects." (Pub. Resources Code ,§ 21080, subd. (a);

5 Cal: Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15357.) Projects with elements both discretionary and ministerial must be

6 treated as discretionary. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, 15268(d).)

7 74. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on

8 the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with

9 CEQA. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15004(b)(2). The "lead agency," which is the public agency
10 which has the principal responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for determining, in
11 consultation with other relevant state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative
12 a declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Resources
13 Code, 8§ 21067; 21080.1, subd. (a); 21080.3, subd. (a).)
14 75. The CEQA Guidelines, codified in title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, set

15 forth the procedure that a lead agency must follow when it commences consideration of a project. If
16 an agency determines that a discretionary activity may result in a reasonably foreseeable direct or.
17 indirect physical change to the environment, it must begin CEQA review by considering whether a

18 project is exempt pursuant to a categorical or statutory exemption. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §
19 15061.) If an agency determines that a project is exempt, it must file a Notice of Exemption setting
20 forth for the public the basis of a claimed exemption. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15062.) If a project
21 IS not found to be exempt, the agency may prepare an Initial Study to determine if the project may
22 a have a significant effect on the environment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063.) If there is
23 substantial evidence that any aspect of a project may cause a significant effect on the environment,
24 the agency must prepare an EIR analyzing the potential impacts, individually and cumulatively, of
25 the project on the environment.

26 76. This action challenges the continuing violation of the California Environmental

27 Quality Act ("CEQA") by Respondent because they have entirely failed to perform any of the

28 required environmental review.

13
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

77. Here, the proposed action and project will permanently damage the environment.

2 78. Furthermore, unlike statutory exemptions, regulatory exemptions (also known as

3 "categorical" exemptions) "shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility

4 that the activity will a have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (14

5 Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2.)

6 79. Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 proposal is not a minor alteration of an existing
7 facility having no impact on the environment within CEQA's guideline's categorical exemption

8 from CEQA requirements. (See Pub.Res.Code § 21084(a); Cal.Code Regs. title 14, § 15301.)

9 80. This principle of interpretation is embodied in the Guidelines, which state that

10 CEQA should be interpreted to "afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the

11 reasonable scope of the statutory language. [Citation.]" (Guidelines, § 15003, subd. (f).)

12 81. The Guidelines provide that categorical exemptions may not be used (i) where there
13 is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment (ii) due
14 to unusual circumstance. (Guideline §15300.2, subd. (c).) A significant effect is a "substantial, or
15 potentially substantial, adverse change...' (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068.) This means that an
16 activity a has a significant effect if it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment."
17 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083.)

18 82. The Guidelines do not define "unusual circumstances." That requirement was
19 presumably adopted to enable agencies to determine which specific activities-within: class of

20 activities that does not normally threaten the environment-should be given further environmental
21 evaluation and hence excepted from the exemption.

22 83. An agency should decide whether a project is eligible for categorical exemption as
23 part of its preliminary review of the project (Guidelines, §§ 15060 and 15061), not in the second
24 phase when mitigation measures are evaluated. In determining whether the significant effect

25 exception to a categorical exemption exists, "[i]t is the possibility of a significant effect ... which is

26 at issue, not a determination of the actual effect, which would be the subject of a negative
27 declaration or an EIR.

28 84. In McQueen v. Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 1136,

14
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 the court reiterated that categorical exemptions are construed strictly, shall not be unreasonably

2 expanded beyond their terms, and may not be used where there is substantial evidence that there

3 are unusual circumstances (including future activities) resulting in (or which might reasonably

4 result in) significant impacts which threaten the environment.

5 85. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable
6 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
7 circumstances.

8 86. Public Resources Code Section 21084 provides several additional exceptions to the

9 use of categorical exemptions. Pursuant to that statute, none of the following may qualify as a
10 categorical exemption: (1) a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but
11 not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources within a scenic
12 highway (this does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation for a project for
13 which, a negative declaration or EIR has previously been adopted or certified; (2) a project located
14 on a site included on any list compiled pursuant to Government Code section 65962.5 (hazardous

15 and toxic waste sites, etc.); and (3) a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the
16 significance of a historical resource.

17 87. Petitioner seeks an alternative writ of mandamus, a peremptory writ of mandamus,
18 temporary and permanent injunctive relief, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees and other appropriate

19 relief under CEQA and as otherwise provided by law.

20 88. This petition involves the enforcement of an important right affecting the public
21 interest and successful prosecution of this Petition will confer substantial benefit on the general
22 public.

23 89. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Code of
24 Civil Procedure section 1085, which provides that a writ of mandate "may be issued by any court to
25 any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the

26 law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station," and Code of Civil

27 Procedure section 1087, which provides that "[t]he writ may be either alternative or peremptory."
28

15
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 90. Petitioner also seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Public

2 Resources Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9.

3 91. Public Resources Code section 21168.9 authorizes a court, after determining that a
4 respondent agency has violated CEQA, to issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the agency
5 to void or suspend decisions regarding which the agency failed to comply with CEQA, or to take
6 other steps necessary to bring its decision into compliance with CEQA. Petitioner requests that, 7

8 pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of section 21168.9, the court issue a peremptory writ requiring

9 Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 to void its action certifying the NOE.

10 92. Section 21168.9, subdivision (b), provides that "[t]he trial court shall retain
11 jurisdiction over the public agency's proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ until the

12 court has determined that the public agency has complied with [CEQA]."

13 93. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate on the grounds that, by
14 determining to carry out the NOE actions purporting to be in compliance with CEQA, Respondent
15 and DOES 1 to 10 prejudicially abused its discretion within CEQA.
16 94. Petitioner also requests injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 526,
17 527, which provide that the court may issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary
18 injunction.
19 95. Petitioner requests permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Civil Code §3422,
20 wherein the court may issue a permanent injunction.
21 96. Respondent's actions and DOES 1 to 10 will result in irreparable harm to Petitioner
22 and the public at large in that the Project, as approved, will cause significant environmental impacts
23 that were not disclosed or adequately addressed by any decision-maker or board.
24 97. Petitioner has no speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

26
interest. Accordingly, if Petitioner is successful, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the

SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 region and ultimately the state, and therefore should be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys'
2 fees. (Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5.)

3 99. Petitioner also brings this action pursuant to Government Code §800, providing up to
4 $7,500.00 in attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency decisions.
5 100. CEQA is intended to ensure that public agencies make informed judgments
6 concerning matters within their discretion a that may have a significant adverse impacts. (Pub. Res.
7 Code § 21006; State CEQA Guidelines §§ 15022(a)(1) & 15003(c).)
8 101. This purpose is effectuated by mandating that public agencies: (1) Gather
9 information concerning existing conditions and potential environmental effects of a proposed
10 measure before rendering a decision. State CEQA Guidelines § 15004(a); (2) Consider the
11 cumulative effects of the proposed measure and other similar measures. State CEQA Guidelines §
12 15130. (3) Consider alternatives to the proposed measure. State CEQA Guidelines §15126.6. (4)
13 Evaluate and adopt feasible mitigation measures to lessen or eliminate the potential adverse
14 environmental impacts of the proposed measure. State CEQA Guidelines $ 15126.4. (5) Provide
15 the public with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed measure in light
16 of its potential environmental effects. State CEQA Guidelines § 15203.
17 102. GOLDEN HILLS did not give the public any time to comment. GOLDEN HILLS
18 simply reviewed selected information and then chose to claim that its Project was exempt as an
19 existing facility.
20 103. In summary, the core purpose of CEQA is to inform governmental decision-makers
21 before they make decisions. Compliance with CEQA informs governmental decision-makers and
22 the public about the potential significant environmental effects of a proposed activity and assists the
23 governmental decision-makers in reaching an informed, environmentally-conscious decision about
24 a proposed activity.
25 104. The CEQA Guidelines further provide that categorical exemptions are not available,
26 even if a project otherwise fits one of the classes of categorical exemption listed in the State CEQA
27 Guidelines, in either of the following two circumstances: (1) When the cumulative impact of
28 successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant (CEQA Guidelines !
17
SHAW'S COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 15300.2(b)); or (2) When there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant

2 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances (§ 15300.2(c)).

3 105. The Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 failed to satisfy a core purpose of CEQA: i.e., to

4 evaluate and adopt feasible mitigation measures that would reduce or eliminate the potential adverse
5 environmental effects as detailed above.

6 106. WHEREFORE Petitioner prays for relief as set forth below.
