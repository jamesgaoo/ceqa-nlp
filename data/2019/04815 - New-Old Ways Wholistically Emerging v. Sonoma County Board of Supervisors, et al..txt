24 Pursuant to this Court's Order Granting Motions of the Law Offices of Stephan Volker to Withdraw
25 and to Intervene filed April 23, 2019, the Law Offices of Stephan Volker (the "Volker Firm") hereby
26 submits its Complaint in Intervention and alleges as follows:
27 I. INTRODUCTION

28 1. Intervenor Law Offices of Stephan Volker ("Volker Firm") respectfully seeks recovery of

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION SCV 252985

P its reasonable attorney fees in this matter. The Volker Firm brought this public interest citizen suit and
2 pursued the lengthy administrative process that preceded it to assure that the sensitive and highly
3 degraded ecosystem of upper Mark West Creek and its beleaguered salmon populations, as well as the
4 overused and under-maintained rural road network that serves this remote mountainous community,
5 receive the careful environmental review required by law before the winery project ("Project") proposed
6 by Cornell Farms, LLC ("Cornell") could be approved by the respondent Sonoma County Board of
7 Supervisors ("County"). It was a daunting challenge, because the County and Cornell took the position
8 that the Project would cause no significant environmental impacts, and therefore an environmental impact
9 report ("EIR") need not be prepared, despite the fact that previous grading near the Project site had
10 caused a massive landslide into the creek, and water levels in the creek had been dropping for years due
11 to groundwater pumping by other vineyard developments, imperiling endangered salmon.

12 2. This was a factually and legally complex proceeding involving an initial Administrative
13 Record ("AR") of 11,535 pages, a supplemental Administrative Record ("PR," for "post-remand") of
14 1,575 pages, and a three-year period of administrative proceedings during which the Volker Firm was, on
15 behalf of the petitioner New-Old Ways Wholistically Emerging ("petitioner"), required to and did -
16 fully exhaust petitioner's administrative remedies in order to preserve its right to seek this Court's review.
17 During the lengthy but necessary administrative review process, the Volker Firm submitted 13 detailed
18 comment letters totaling 127 pages, excluding their voluminous exhibits. (Corrected Declaration of
19. Stephan C. Volker in Support of Petitioner's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs filed November 20,
20 |2017 (*Volker Declaration") at 1 12.) Those comments ultimately persuaded the County to reject the
21 position of its staff, the County Board of Zoning Adjustment ("BZA") and Cornell that no EIR was
22 needed. (Id. 17.) However, because the EIR the County finally prepared did not adequately address all
23 the Project's adverse impacts, and because the County failed to afford petitioner a fair hearing, the Volker
24 Firm was impelled to seek court review to enforce the law. (Id. 11 3, 6-10.)

25 3. Litigation proved to be as challenging and even more prolonged than the administrative
26 proceedings, requiring three-phase process in which this Court twice issued interlocutory remand orders
27 directing the County to correct its violation of the procedures required by law and report back to the Court
28 to demonstrate compliance with the Court's remand orders before proceeding further with consideration

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 2 - SCV 252985

[of the Project. During that lengthy litigation, the Volker Firm filed 23 significant pleadings, motions,
2 memoranda and other court submissions totaling over 300 pages. (Volker Decl. 11 14-28.)

4. This very substantial effort persuaded this Court to twice order remands - first, to remedy
4 the County's violation of petitioner's fair hearing rights, and second, to remedy the County's failure to
5 |conduct an adequate CEQA review of the Project's "growth-inducing impacts, traffic-related impacts and
6 road degradation, and responses to comments on traffic impacts." (Hon. Gary Nadler, Statement of
7 |Decision filed April 29, 2015 at 47:1-2.) The Court found these CEQA violations sufficiently serious to
8 "order[] that all work on the Project be suspended pending further proceedings." (Id. at 47:7-8.) The
9 County then prepared an Addendum to its EIR to remedy these CEQA violations.
10 5. Because petitioner is thus the prevailing party in this proceeding and achieved the entire
11 remedy it sought - a fair hearing, invalidation of the EIR, and suspension of the County's Project
12 approval pending the County's compliance with law - petitioner enforced important rights affecting the
13 public interest and its counsel - the Volker Firm - is entitled to recover all of the time it reasonably spent

14 in the successful prösecution of this action, including the necessary administrative proceedings, at
15 reasonable market rates.

16 6. Accordingly, the Volker Firm filed a motion for attorney's fees and litigation costs ("Fee
17 Motion"), supported by a detailed memorandum and declarations of counsel, of client member Laura
18 Waldbaum, and of attorney fee expert Richard M. Pearl on November 17, 2017. However, before the Fee
19 Motion could be heard as calendared on January 5, 2018, this Court, per the Honorable Nancy Shaffer,
20 /vacated that hearing date and, by subsequent Order filed March 15, 2018, ruled that petitioner's Fee
21 Motion was "premature" but that "[w]Jhen this matter is final, the prevailing party(ies) may file a request
22 for attorneys' fees, or an augmented request for fees, and a cost bill." (Order on Motion for
23 Reconsideration of Final Order of County Board's Motion for Determination of Compliance with
24 Statement of Decision, filed March 15, 2016, at 4:23-27.) Thereafter, Judge Shaffer issued her Order on
25 Issues for Reconsideration; Modified Briefing Schedule on March 27, 2018, which directed the parties to
26 |submit further briefing regarding issues related to the adequacy of the County's Addendum prepared in
27 response to the Court's Statement of Decision filed April 29, 2015 and related matters.
28 7. As directed by Judge Shaffer's March 15 and March 27, 2018 Orders, the Volker Firm

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 3 - SCV 252985

1 submitted further supplemental briefing on April 18, 2018 and May 23, 2018. Following further
2 |argument, Judge Shaffer issued Orders dated June 5, 2018, September 4, 2018 and September 14, 2018,
3 the last of which granted the motion of the County and Cornell for an order determining the County's
4 compliance with Judge Nadler's Statement of Decision. (Amended Final Order on Motion for Order
5 Determining County Board's Compliance with Statement of Decision, filed September 14, 2018, at 36:5-
6 6.)

7 8. Nineteen days later, on October 3, 2018, the Volker Firm filed a Notice of Petitioner's
8 Loss of Corporate Status. In that notice, the Volker Firm advised this Court and all counsel that
9 petitioner's corporate status had been suspended, and indicated that "[i]n the event that [petitioner]
10 NOWWE fails to revive its corporate status within a reasonable period of time, the undersigned counsel
11 intends to (1) withdraw from further representation of NOWWE pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
12 section 284(2) and California Rules of Court, rule 3.1362, and (2) thereafter file a motion to intervene on
13 behalf of the Law Offices of Stephan Volker for the purpose of securing, either by settlement or by
14 |motion, an award of its reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in successfully prosecuting this action as
15 permitted under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, Lindelli v. Town of San Anselmo (2006) 139
16 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1512, 1512-1513, and Ruiz v. California State Auto. Ass'n Inter-Ins. Bureau (2013)
17 222 Cal.App.4th 596, 610.3 (Notice of Petitioner's Loss of Corporate Status filed October 3, 2018, at
18 2:22-3:1.) The Volker Firm's notice also indicated that if judgment were entered in the interim, "[s]uch a
19 motion may be made after judgment," citing Henry M. Lee Law Corp. v. Superior Court (2012) 204
20 Cal.App.4th 1375, 1382. (Id. at 3:1-2.)
21 9. Thereafter, because petitioner failed to revive its corporate status, the Volker Firm moved
22 to withdraw as its counsel and also to intervene in this matter for the purpose of securing an award of its
23 attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("C.C.P.") section 1021.5. By Order filed April 9,
24 2019, this Court, per the Honorable Arthur A. Wick, granted the Volker Firm's motions to withdraw as
25 |counsel and to intervene. (Order After Hearing 3/20/2019, filed April 9, 2019.) Pursuant to that Order,
26 the Volker Firm prepared a Proposed Order conforming to the Order of the Court, submitted it to the
27 County and Cornell for review, and, following counsel's approval of the Proposed Order as to form,
28 submitted it to this Court for approval. On April 23, 2019, this Court approved and signed the Proposed

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION SCV 252985

1 Order submitted by the Volker Firm. That Order directed the Volker Firm to file its Complaint in
2 Intervention within 20 days, by May 13, 2019. Accordingly, the Volker Firm respectfully submits this
3 Complaint In Intervention.

4 II. VENUE AND JURISDICTION

5 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
6 1021.5 (public interest attorney's fees) and article VI, section 10, of the California Constitution (original
7 jurisdiction of superior courts).

8 11. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393 (actions
9 Jagainst public officers), 394 (actions against counties and local agencies) and 395 (actions generally)
10 because the County has its offices in Sonoma County and because the Project is located in Sonoma
11 County.

12 12. This Complaint in Intervention is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations
13 because it was timely filed pursuant to this Court's Order Granting Motions of Law Offices of Stephan
14 Volker to Withdraw and to Intervene filed April 23, 2019.

15 13. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388, the Volker Firm is serving the California
16 Attorney General with a copy of this Complaint in Intervention, and consistent with Public Resources
17 Code section 21167.5, the County has previously been afforded notice of this action, and has been served
18 land made appearances in this proceeding.

19 III. PARTIES

20 14. Intervenor Law Offices of Stephan Volker ("Volker Firm") is a public interest
21 environmental law firm operating as a sole proprietorship whose attorneys are duly licensed to practice
22 law under the laws of California. The Volker Firm brings this Complaint in Intervention to recover its
23 attorney fees and litigation costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the governing case
24 law including Lindelli v. Town of San Anselmo (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1499, 1505, and this Court's
25 Order Granting Motions of Law Offices of Stephan Volker to Withdraw and to Intervene filed April 23,
26 2019 in this matter. The Volker Firm successfully prosecuted the underlying proceeding and secured
27 enforcement of public rights that have conferred a substantial benefit on the public as alleged herein. The
28 Volker Firm has a substantial beneficial interest in recovering its attorney fees and litigation costs under

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION SCV 252985

F Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

2 15. Respondent and Defendant Sonoma County Board of Supervisors ("County" or "Board")

3 is the governing body of the County of Sonoma ("County"). The County is charged by law with serving

4 as the lead agency for the Project under CEQA, and assuring compliance with CEQA and the other laws
5 whose violation has led to the Volker Firm's successful prosecution of the underlying proceeding. As
6 alleged in more detail elsewhere in this Complaint in Intervention, on December 11, 2012, the County
7 approved the Project and certified its EIR. The County has the duty to administer and assure compliance
8 with the requirements of the United States and California Constitutions, and California statutes including
9 CEQA and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 before approving the Project. As alleged
10 elsewhere, in purporting to approve the Project, the County failed to comply with these Constitutions and

11 laws.

12 16. The true names and capacities of respondents and defendants DOES I-X, inclusive, are
13 unknown to the Volker Firm who therefore sues said respondents and defendants by such fictitious names
14 (pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 474. The Volker Firm will, with leave of court if necessary,
15 amend this Complaint in Intervention when the true names and capacities of said DOE respondents and
16 defendants have been ascertained.

17 17. Real Party in Interest Cornell Farms, LLC is named as a real party in interest because it
18 Japplied for and received the Project approvals challenged herein. It is referred to herein as either
19 /"Cornell" or as one of the "Real Parties in Interest." Cornell shares responsibility with the County for
20 paying the Volker Firm its attorneys fees and litigation costs incurred during the Volker Firm's successful
21 prosecution of the underlying proceeding, as well as in securing the recovery of its attorney fees and
22 costs, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and cases thereunder. (See, e.g., San
23 Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Inc. v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 738, 756.)
24 18. The Volker Firm is unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest
25 DOES XI-XX, inclusive, and sues such real parties herein by fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 474. The Volker Firm is informed and believes, and based on such information and
27 belief alleges, that the fictitiously named real parties are entities or individuals who have a direct and
28 substantial economic interest in, or are the recipients of, the County's approval of the Project. When the

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 6 - SCV 252985

1 true identities and capacities of these real parties have been determined, the Volker Firm will, with leave
2 of court if necessary, amend this Complaint in Intervention to insert such identities and capacities.

3 IV. STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY.

4 19. Mark West Creek, which runs adjacent to the parcels upon which the Project would be
5 located, is designated critical habitat for steelhead trout and coho salmon. (Administrative Record
6 ("AR") lodged with the Court on July 18, 2013, at 1128-1130 (Draft EIR).) In recent years, summer
7 flows in Mark West Creek have declined to such an extent that in August 2011 the California Department
8  of Fish and Game had to remove juvenile steelhead from the North Fork of Mark West Creek (the
9 tributary closest to the Project site) to prevent their death from the imminent dewatering of the creek,
10 /which occurred a few days later. (AR 6691-6693, 6698-6706 (photographs); AR 583.) A ten-year study
11 of steelhead in Mark West Creek found "any reduction in summer low flows, either from natural drought
12 or water withdrawals, is likely to reduce juvenile fish survival." (AR 2718 (emphasis added).)

13 20. According to the State Water Resources Control Board, Mark West Creek is already fully
14 appropriated during May, June and July, months during which the Project EIR admits that groundwater
15 pumping for the Project would increase while stream flows are ordinarily "very low (<0.1 m⅗) or
16 intermittent." (AR 7306, 2710.) Groundwater supplies in this watershed have deteriorated so severely
17 that nearby wineries have been forced to truck in water during the ordinarily wet month of December.
18 (AR 6664.) The North Fork of Mark West Creek - which passes about 800 feet north of the Project's
19 production well - has repeatedly dried up in the summer, as well as in the fall. (AR 11646, PR 205-206.)
20 21. The a Project is a winery that would consume at least 135,500 gallons of water per year, and
21 also consume between 23,000 and 92,600 gallons annually to establish and maintain its landscaping. (AR
22 1095-1098.)

23 22. The Project is located on an unstable hillside that is extraordinarily prone to landslides.
24 |(AR 1049-1051, 1059.) Previous landslides in the area - including a 2005-2006 landslide near the
25 Project location on Cornell's property into the North Fork of Mark West Creek - were caused by
26 improperly sited leach fields. (AR 436-445, 587-588, 768-769, 830-831.) The Project would utilize fill
27 material on hillsides; such fills are prone to fail during earthquakes and heavy rainfall. (AR 781.)
28 23. St. Helena Road, which would serve the Project's construction traffic, is a dangerous,

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 7 - SCV 252985

P narrow, and winding road that is on the verge of collapse. (AR 1020-1021.) The Project would send
2 thousands of heavy trucks onto St. Helena Road, damaging the road and posing hazards to the public.
3 (AR 927 (2,250 round trips or 4,500 one-way trips).) The EIR failed to adequately analyze this impact.
4 (AR 1020-1021.)

5 24. Commencing in October 2009, the Volker Firm submitted numerous, detailed comment
6 letters to the County Board of Zoning Adjustment ("BZA") and to the County Board of Supervisors
7 objecting to the County's proposal to approve the Project without preparing an EIR. (Volker Decl. 117-
8 8.) The Volker Firm ultimately persuaded the Board of Supervisors to order preparation of an EIR, which
9 commenced in 2012. (Id. 19.) The Volker Firm then submitted extensive scoping comments and
10 subsequent comments on the EIR's deficiencies. (Id. 1110-11.)

11 25. On December 11, 2012, the Board of Supervisors purported to approve the Project over
12 the Volker Firm's objections and without affording petitioner fair hearing. (Id.) To secure the County's
13 compliance with the law, the Volker Firm filed this action on December 31, 2012. In response to
14 Cornell's first demurrer, in which the County joined, the Volker Firm amended its petition to clarify and
15 strengthen its unfair hearing allegations. The County and Cornell then demurred to petitioner's First
16 Amended Verified Petition. The Volker Firm's opposition to their demurrer was successful and this
17 Court ordered the County and Cornell to answer petitioner's unfair hearing allegations. (Hon. Gary
18 Nadler, Order After Hearing on Respondent and Real Party in Interest Demurrer to First Amended
19 Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed December 3, 2013, at 2-7.)

20 26. Rather than answer those allegations, on December 9, 2013, the County and Cornell
21 requested an interlocutory remand. Petitioner opposed this request on the grounds that it would be more
22 efficient to secure all of this Court's rulings on all of the Verified Petition's allegations at the same time,
23 in one final judgment. However, the Court agreed with the County and Cornell that interim relief was
24 appropriate, and approved their requested Interlocutory Remand on January 29, 2014. Pursuant to that
25 First Interlocutory Remand, on May 20, 2014, the Board of Supervisors held a second public hearing on
26 petitioner's opposition to the Project, at which time it heard further evidence and argument (including a
27 written submission and oral presentation by the Volker Firm), corrected its prior misstatements of fact,
28 land then reapproved the Project.

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 8- SCV 252985

27. Pursuant to the parties' Stipulation and this Court's Scheduling Order filed June 11, 2014,
2 on July 15, 2014, the Volker Firm filed its Second Amended and First Supplemental Verified Petition,
3 updating the case to challenge the Board of Supervisors' reapproval of the Project. On September 2,
4 2014, the Volker Firm filed its Opening Trial Brief, and on October 7, 2014, Cornell and the County filed
5 their separate Opposition Briefs. The Volker Firm then filed its separate Reply Briefs to the County's and
6 Cornell's Opposition Briefs on October 27, 2014. Cornell and the Volker Firm filed their respective
7 |requests for a Statement of Decision on December 18, 2014, and January 9, 2015. On January 13, 2015,
8 Judge Nadler heard the first day of argument on the merits, following which it directed preparation of
9 supplemental briefs. Judge Nadler heard the second day of merits arguments on February 2, 2015. Then,
10 pursuant to this Court's direction, on February 20, 2015, the Volker Firm filed its Supplemental Brief,
11 and on February 23, 2015, the County and Cornell filed their Joint Supplemental Brief. On February 27,
12 2015, the Volker Firm filed its Reply Supplemental Brief, and on March 2, 2015, the County and Cornell
13 filed their Joint Reply Brief.

14 28. On April 29, 2015, Judge Nadler issued his Statement of Decision "find[ing] the Board of
15 Supervisors' decision [approving the Project] to violate CEQA, specifically [with regard to] growth-
16 inducing impacts, traffic-related impacts and road degradation, and responses to comments on traffic
17 impacts." (Id. at 47:1-2.) Accordingly and as the Volker Firm requested, this Court ordered "that all
18 work on the Project be suspended pending further proceedings." (Id. at 47:7-8.) All parties treated this
19 ruling as a second interlocutory remand. (Volker Decl. 11 23-24.) Indeed, on May 5, 2015 Cornell hand-
20 delivered a letter to Judge Nadler stating Cornell's position that because of the limited and specific nature
21 of the remand orders in Judge Nadler's Statement of Decision,

22 "the Statement of Decision is thus in the nature of an interlocutory order and remand,
23 contemplating suspension of work pending further County proceedings on the [Cornell] Project, and it does not direct the entry of a final judgment. CEQA provides trial courts

24 with flexibility to order such lesser remedies suspending Project activities while ordering specific actions required for CEQA compliance. (E.g., Schenck v. County of Sonoma

25 (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 949, 960-961.)

26 May 5, 2015 Letter from Cornell to Judge Nadler (Corrected Volker Declaration filed September 20,
27 2017 ("Volker Declaration")) at page 1.

28 29. Cornell cannot escape its admission. As Cornell conceded, and as the Honorable Nancy

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION SCV 252985

1. Judge Shaffer has repeatedly ruled, Judge Nadler's Statement of Decision was "an interlocutory order and
2 remand" that is proper under Schenck v. County of Sonoma, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at 960-961. Judge
3 Shaffer ruled on March 15, 2018 that petitioner's Fee Motion filed November 17, 2017 was "premature,"
4 and "[w]hen this matter is final, the prevailing party may file a request for attorney's a fees, or an
5 augmented request for fees, and a cost bill." (March 15, 2018 Order at 4:23-27.) Judge Shaffer reiterated
6 this ruling three months later, holding again that Judge Nadler's "Statement of Decision was .. . in the
7 nature of [an] interlocutory order and remand," consistent with the Court of Appeal's holding in Schenk.
8 (Hon. Nancy Shaffer, Amended Order filed June 5, 2018 at 3:24-26, citing Schenk, 198 Cal.App.4th at
9 |960-962.)

10 30. In Schenck, the petitioner challenged Sonoma County's approval of a beverage distribution
11 facility because the County's mitigated negative declaration was not sent to a responsible agency. The
12 Honorable Robert Boyd of this Court decided petitioner's mandamus petition by "issuing an order . . .
13 that directed the County to provide notice to the BAAQMD [Bay Area Air Quality Management
14 DistrictJ" to remedy its defective notice. (Schenck, 198 Cal.App.4th at 960.) "The County subsequently
15 provided notice to the BAAQMD, received a response, and issued a Certificate of Compliance with the
16 court's order." (Id.) The petitioner then attacked Judge Boyd's order as "an improper interlocutory
17 remand," claiming that the trial court was "required to set aside Project approval for failure to provide
18 notice to a responsible agency.™ (Id.) The Court of Appeal rejected petitioner's argument, finding
19 |nothing in the trial court's order that contravenes the remedial procedures sanctioned by CEQA," and
20 holding that Public Resources Code "[s]ection 21168.9 "provides alternative remedies which allow the
21 trial court to tailor the remedy to fit the violation." (Id. at 961, quoting San Bernardino Valley Audubon
22 Society v. Metropolitan Water Dist. (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1097, 1102.) The Court of Appeal stated:

23 "The statute provides 'that "If court finds .. that any determination, finding or decision

24 of a public agency has been made without compliance with this division, the court shall enter an order that includes . [1] . [a] mandate that the determination, finding, or

25 decision be voided by the public agency, in whole or in part" or "[a] mandate that the public agency take specific action as may be necessary to bring the determination, finding,

26 or decision into compliance with this division.' (§ 21168.9, subd. (a)(1), (3).)' (Schellinger Brothers v. City of Sebastopol (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 1245, 1266.

27 Here, the trial court fashioned a remedy appropriate to the perceived violation. The

28 County was directed to provide notice to the BAAQMD, and the court retained jurisdiction to take measures necessary to determine compliance with CEQA. The court's order was

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 10 - SCV 252985

consistent with equitable principles and section 21168.9, subd. (a)(3), as a specific lesser remedy needed to bring the agency's action into compliance with CÉQA. 961.1 [Id. at 2

31. Likewise here, as in Schenck, the trial court properly entered an order directing "the
4 Respondent to set aside its decision and remand[ing] the matter back to Respondent to reconsider the
5 specific issues on which this court finds the decision to violate CEQA . . . . In the event that Respondent
6 proceeds with further consideration on these points, it shall return to the court to seek a determination that
7 it has complied with CEQA." (Statement of Decision filed April 29, 2015 at 46:27-47:6.) Here, as in
8 |Schenck, "[a] writ of mandate was granted" to require the County's compliance with CEQA. (Schenck,
9 198 Cal.App.4th at 956.) Here, as in Schenck, "[t]he court retained jurisdiction over the matter to
10 ultimately determine the issue of the County's compliance with . CEQA." (Id.) And here, as in
11 Schenck, Judge Nadler properly issued a writ of mandate that constituted a proper interlocutory remand.
12 32. Pursuant to the Court's Second Interlocutory Remand, the County set aside its previous
13 approvals of the Project on August 18, 2015. (County's Supplemental Administrative Record ("SR")
14 lodged September 29, 2016 at 0065.) The County then prepared an Addendum to the EIR to rectify the
15 CEQA violations found by the Court, to which the Volker Firm objected in a 10-page comment letter
16 submitted one week before the Board's public hearing on the Project and the Addendum. (SR 0449-
17 0825.) On August 2, 2016, the Board approved the Addendum and the Project over the Volker Firm's
18 written and oral objections. (SR 068-0069 (approval), 0870-0752 (hearing transcript).)

19 33. The County and Cornell then filed a motion requesting this Court's "Order Determining
20 County Board's Compliance With Statement of Decision" on September 29, 2016. The Volker Firm filed
21 its Opposition on November 22, 2016, and Cornell and the County filed their Reply on November 30,
22 2016. Prior to its hearing of the motion on December 14, 2016, this Court, per the Honorable Nancy
23 Shaffer, issued a tentative ruling finding, consistent with the Volker Firm's objection, that the
24 Addendum failed to rectify the EIR's deficiencies. On March 14, 2017, Judge Shaffer issued a 27-page
25 Order on Motion for Order Determining County Board's Compliance With Statement of Decision that
26 found the Addendum's "analysis of traffic safety and road degradation still appears to fail to meet the
27 requirements of this Court's order or CEQA." (Id. at 27:3-4.)

28 34. However, at the conclusion of that ruling Judge Shaffer did agree to accept further briefing

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 11 - SCV 252985

1 on the matter. On April 3, 2017, all parties submitted their Supplemental Briefs, and on April 13, 2017,
2 all parties filed their Oppositions to the Supplemental Briefs submitted by their opponents. On June 22,
3 2017, Judge Shaffer heard further argument concerning the adequacy of the Addendum. On September
4 20, 2017, this Court issued its Final Order, finding that although the Addendum did not rectify all of the
5 EIR's deficiencies, its failure to do so was not prejudicial. (Hon. Nancy Shaffer, Final Order on Motion
6 for Order Determining County Board's Compliance with Statement of Decision, filed September 20,
7 2017, at 10:13-27 ("the court finds that use of an addendum to cure deficiencies in an EIR is improper

8 [But] the Addendum procedure actually used in this case was procedurally sufficient and did
9 comply with this court's order"); 23:11-26:20 ("There is more analysis [in the Addendum] than the
10 original EIR provided, but the analysis provided is still deficient. It is not supported by substantial
11 levidence or by full reasoned analysis." The Addendum fails to provide evidence and analysis showing
12 why it is "acceptable in any way to take 19 months of intense [construction truck] traffic and spread it out
13 Jover 20 years" and therefore "this analysis still violates CEQA."), 30:3-10 (The Addendum's "analysis of
14 road-degradation impacts is deficient for the reasons explained and thus violates CEQA"), 30:12-31:12
15 (original "condition [of approval] #79 . . . . mitigates any possible impact on road deterioration . . . . and
16 thus, there is no prejudicial error resulting from the insufficient analysis of degradation impacts") and
17 31:14-19 (therefore "the objections to the [County's and Cornell's] motion are overruled" and "[t]he
18 County Board has complied with the Statement of Decision and CEQA").)
19 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS UNDER

21 CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 1021.5 AND 1032-1033.5 FOR BOTH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND THE MERITS AND FEE LITIGATION)

22 (Against Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

23 35. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by this reference.
24 36. Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 provides in pertinent part that courts may award
25 |attorneys' fees and litigation costs

26 "to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has
27 resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general
28 public or large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement . are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 12 - SCV 252985

1 the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any."
2 (Id.)

3 37. The Volker Firm satisfies all of these criteria. First, this litigation resulted in enforcement
4 |lof "an important right affecting the public interest." It is settled law that compliance with CEQA confers
5 la significant public benefit sufficient to warrant the award of attorneys' fees under section 1021.5. (See,
6 e.g., Schwartz V. City of Rosemead (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 547, 558 (CEQA's effectuation is an
7 "important right" within the meaning of section 1021.5); RiverWatch v. County of San Diego (2009) 175
8 /Cal.App.4th 768, 782 (" River Watch") (rejecting the respondents' efforts "to minimize the benefits this
9 [CEQA] litigation conferred on the general public").)

10 38. Second, the necessity of private enforcement is indisputable, since no public agency
11 brought an enforcement action within the limitations period. Indeed, the public agency most responsible
12 for assuring that the Cornell Project was lawfully reviewed - the County - is - the agency that violated
13 |CEQA's requirements. Therefore private enforcement was necessary. Relatedly, no private party could
14 be expected to bring the action out of its own financial self interest, since the party most financially
15 interested in the Project was its proponent, who would receive income should the Project be built.
16 39. By contrast, the public - including members of petitioner - had no direct financial stake in
17 the Project. Rather, the environmental harms that the Project would impose on them are necessarily
18 diffuse. As NOWWE member Laura Waldbaum has attested, "[n]either NOWWE, nor any of its officers,
19 members and supporters, has any direct financial interest in this litigation." (Waldbaum Declaration filed
20 September 17, 2017 1 2.) "NOWWE authorized this litigation to assure that all of the environmental
21 impacts of the proposed Cornell Winery project are fully disclosed to the public," and to "assur[e] that the
22 |Cornell Winery project's impacts on Mark West Creek and its tributaries, and on their dependent fish and
23 wildlife, are given full consideration and mitigation." (Id. 13.) Consequently, the financial burden on
24 petitioner in this case was "out of proportion to its individual stake in the matter." (Woodland Hills
25 Residents Ass'n v. City Council of Los Angeles (1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 941.)
26 40. Accordingly, all the criteria for an award of attorney fees and litigation costs under section
27 1021.5 are satisfied here. This Complaint in Intervention explains below why the substantial time the
28 Volker Firm expended in successfully prosecuting this litigation was reasonably, necessarily and

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 13 - SCV 252985

1 efficiently spent. Therefore the Volker Firm is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and
2 litigation costs for all time reasonably spent.

3 A. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

4 41. The time spent in administrative proceedings is recoverable if "they were the first step in
5 the litigation and thus were 'useful and of a type ordinarily necessary' to litigation." (2 R. Pearl,
6 |California Attorney Fee Awards (Cont. Ed. Bar 2011) 3d Ed. (*2 Pearl") § 9.7 (quoting Best v.
7 California Apprenticeship Council (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1448, 1461).) Public Resources Code section
8 21177 required petitioner to timely exhaust its administrative remedies. That section directs that

9 "[a]n action or proceeding shall not be brought pursuant to [Public Resources Code]
10 Section 21167 unless the alleged grounds for non-compliance with this division [i.e., CEQA] were presented to the public agency orally or in writing by any person during the
11 public comment period provided by this division or prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice of determination."
12 (Id., at subd. (a).) The CEQA cases directing dismissal of lawsuits challenging an agency's compliance
13 with CEQA because the petitioner failed to exhaust its administrative remedies are legion. (See, e.g.,
14 Park Area Neighbors v. Town of Fairfax (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1442, 1446-1447 (court dismissed
15 neighborhood association's challenges to a housing development because it failed to raise its CEQA
16 objections with sufficient specificity prior to project approval to preserve them for litigation).) Courts
17 lapply the exhaustion doctrine to both the evidence and the law on which a petitioner intends to rely in
18 court. (See Barthelemy v. Chino Basin Municipal Water District (1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1609, 1620-
19 1621.)

20 42. Thus, the Volker Firm was clearly obliged to submit detailed comments raising all of the
21 factual and legal arguments that might be advanced in any subsequent litigation in order to preserve those
22 issues for judicial review. (Id.) Moreover, counsel's work in preparing multiple detailed comment letters
23 persuaded the County to prepare an EIR, thereby conferring a substantial public benefit and also
24 narrowing the issues for this Court's subsequent review. Had petitioner's counsel not made these detailed
25 comments, the County would not have prepared an EIR, and the deficiencies in that EIR would not have
26 been corrected.

27 43. For these reasons, it is undisputed that there was a "need for exhaustion of administrative
28 remedies" before petitioner could challenge the County's approval of the Cornell Project. Thus the

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 14 - SCV 252985

F |Volker Firm's time spent in those adjudicatory proceedings is compensable. (Land v. Anderson (1997)
2 55 Cal.App.4th 69, 84; Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (Nursery Prod.)
3 (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 896 ("CBD Nursery") (noting fee award included counsel's time spent in

4 prior administrative proceedings).) Accordingly, the Volker Firm is entitled to recover its fees and costs
5 reasonably incurred in the County's lengthy administrative review process. As documented in the Volker
6 /Declaration, the Volker Firm spent 390.2 hours in the administrative proceedings on the Project during
7 the period August 10, 2009 through December 4, 2012. (Id. at Exhibit 2 (summary) at pages 1-2 and
8 Exhibit 3 (detail) at pages 1-15.)

B. MERITS LITIGATION

10 44. The Volker Firm's work on the merits litigation comprised three primary phases, and two
11 accompanying interlocutory remands, as recounted above and, with accompanying hourly totals for each
12 attorney, in the Volker Declaration (11 14-28 and Exhibits 2-3). The first phase began with counsel's
13 review of the County's extensive Administrative Record and preparation of petitioner's Verified Petition,
14 which was filed on December 31, 2012, and continued through the County's reapproval of the Project
15 after an interlocutory remand. Relying on their familiarity from the administrative proceedings with
16 many of the facts and legal issues relevant to the case, the Volker Firm conducted its review and prepared
17 the comprehensive Verified Petition - which raised every issue that the Volker Firm subsequently
18 litigated in its Opening and Reply Trial Briefs - in an efficient 48.2 hours. (Volker Decl. T 15, Exh. 2
19 (summary) at page 2, and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 16-17.)

20 45. Petitioner was then forced to defend against Cornell's first demurrer and ex parte
21 applications and motions challenging petitioner's requested discovery including the deposition of key
22 witness with the California Department of Water Resources, Christopher Bonds, to refute Board of
23 Supervisor Chairwoman Shirlee Zane's erroneous statements - made during the Board's hearing on the
24 Project - that Mr. Bonds told her the EIR's analysis of water use was adequate, and the Project's impacts
25  on groundwater were positive. (See First Amended Verified Petition and Complaint filed July 30, 2013 at
26 10:18-11:16). Defending against the County's and Cornell's challenges to this lawsuit and ultimately
27 preparing a First Amended Verified Petition to address the lone, limited issue on which the Court
28 sustained the demurrer, required the Volker Firm to expend 227.3 hours. (Volker Decl. 116, Exh. 2

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 15 - SCV 252985

(summary) at page 2 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 17-27.)

2 46. After the Volker Firm filed petitioner's First Amended Verified Petition on July 30, 2013,
3 Cornell and the County demurred yet again. The Volker Firm opposed the joint demurrer on October 24,
4 2013, and on December 3, 2013, the Volker Firm prevailed when this Court ordered the County and

5 Cornell to answer petitioner's unfair hearing allegations. (Hon. Gary Nadler, Order After Hearing on
6 Respondent and Real Party in Interest Demurrer to First Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate, filed
7 December 3, 2013, at 2-7.) Rather than answer these allegations and the evidence the Volker Firm would
8 present via the scheduled deposition of DWR expert Christopher Bonds, Cornell made an ex parte
9 application for an order staying the deposition of Mr. Bonds, and then moved, on December 9, 2013, for
10 an interlocutory remand to the Board of Supervisors and order staying the deposition. In opposing
11 Cornell and the County's second demurrer, Cornell's ex parte application and its motion for interlocutory
12 remand, the Volker Firm reasonably expended 103 hours. (Volker Decl. 1 17, Exh. 2 (summary at page 2
13 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 28-33.)

14 47. Despite petitioner's position that all its claims should be adjudicated together to achieve a
15 more efficient, comprehensive remand to the Board, on January 29, 2014 the Court approved Cornell and
16 the County's requested interlocutory remand. Pursuant to that First Interlocutory Remand, on May 20,
17 2014, the Board held a second public hearing on petitioner's opposition to the Project, at which time it
18 heard further evidence and argument, corrected its prior misstatements of fact, and then reapproved the
19 Project. (PR 014.) In total, including the 67.9 hours expended during the first remand period and the
20 378.5 hours spent during the first litigation period (to recap, 48.2 hours (1 35 above) plus 227.3 hours (f
21 36 above) plus 103.0 hours (1 37 above) and 67.9 hours (1 38 above), the Volker Firm spent 446.4 hours
22 on the first litigation and first remand phases. (Volker Decl. 1 18, Exh. 2 (summary) at pages 2-3 and
23 Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 16-36.)

24 48. The second phase of the litigation commenced after the Board's reapproval of the Project
25 following the first remand, and continued through April 29, 2015, when Judge Nadler issued his
26 Statement of Decision ordering a second remand of this case. Following the Board's reapproval of the
27 Project on May 20, 2014, the Volker Firm filed petitioner's Second Amended and First Supplemental
28 Verified Petition ("Second Amended Petition") on July 15, 2014. Again relying on its familiarity with

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 16 - SCV 252985

the original administrative proceedings and with the facts and legal issues subsequently developed
2 through the first remand period, the Volker Firm was able to efficiently complete its review and prepare
3 the Second Amended Petition in 49 hours. (Volker Decl. 1 19.)

4 49. On September 2, 2014, the Volker Firm filed petitioner's Opening Trial Brief on the
5 allegations of the Second Amended Petition. To conduct the necessary factual and legal research, and
6 prepare the brief, petitioner's counsel expended 103.2 hours. The Volker Firm also reasonably spent 71.5
7hours preparing and filing on October 24, 2014, its two Reply Briefs responding to Cornell and the
8 County's respective Opposition Briefs, for a total of 174.7 hours. (Volker Decl. 11 20-21, Exh. 2
page 3 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 40-44.) 9 (summary) at

10 50. After completing the principal briefing on the merits, Cornell and the Volker Firm filed
11 their respective requests for a statement of decision on December 18, 2014 and January 9, 2015. Then,
12 on January 13, 2015, Judge Nadler heard the first day of argument on the merits, following which the
13 court directed preparation of supplemental briefs. Judge Nadler heard the second day of merits arguments
14 on February 2, 2015. Then, pursuant to Judge Nadler's direction, on February 20, 2015, the Volker Firm
15 filed Petitioner's Supplemental Brief, and on February 23, 2015, the County and Cornell filed their Joint
16 Supplemental Brief. On February 27, 2015 the Volker Firm filed its Reply Supplemental Brief, and on
17 March 2, 2015, the County and Cornell filed their Joint Reply Brief. During this period, the Volker Firm
18 expended 301.4 hours. (Volker Decl. 1 22, Exh. 2 (summary) at page 4 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 44-
19 50.)

20 51. On April 29, 2015, Judge Nadler issued his Statement of Decision "find[ing] the Board of
21 Supervisors' decision [approving the Project] to violate CEQA, specifically [with regard to] growth-
22 inducing impacts, traffic-related impacts and road degradation, and responses to comments on traffic
23 impacts." (Id. at 47:1-2.) Accordingly, and as the Volker Firm had requested, Judge Nadler ordered "that
24 all work on the Project be suspended pending further proceedings." (Id. at 47:7-8.) All parties treated
25 this ruling as a Second Interlocutory Remand. (Volker Decl. 11 23-24.) After the County set aside its
26 previous approvals of the Project on August 18, 2015, the County prepared an Addendum to the EIR to
27 rectify the CEQA violations found by the Court, to which the Volker Firm objected in a 10-page
28 comment letter submitted one week prior to the Board's public hearing on the Project and Addendum, as

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 17 - SCV 252985

1  permitted by Public Resources Code section 21177(b), which provides for submission of objections
2 prior to the close of the public hearing on the project." (SR 0449-0825.) On August 2, 2016, the Board
3 reapproved the Project over the Volker Firm's objections (including the oral objections of the
4 undersigned at the Board's hearing). (SR 068-0069 (approval), 0870-0752 (hearing transcript).) In total,
5 including the 172.7 hours expended during the second remand phase (Volker Decl., Exh. 2 (summary) at
6 lpage 4, Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 51-56), the Volker Firm spent 697.8 hours on the second litigation and
7 second remand phases. (Volker Decl. 1 25, Exh. 2 (summary) at pages 3-4 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages
8 37-56 (to recap, 49.0 hours (1 39 above) plus 174.7 hours (140 above) plus 301.4 hours (f 41 above) plus
9 172.7 hours during the second remand phase.)

10 52. The third and final phase of the litigation commenced following the Board's second
11 reapproval of the Project on August 2, 2016. After the Board's reapproval, the County and Cornell filed
12 motion on October 3, 2016, requesting this Court's "Order Determining County Board's Compliance
13 With Statement of Decision." The Volker Firm filed its opposition on November 22, 2016. On March
14 14, 2017, this Court, per the Honorable Nancy Shaffer, issued a 27-page Order on Motion for Order
15 Determining County Board's Compliance With Statement of Decision that found the Addendum's
16 "analysis of traffic safety and road degradation still appears to fail to meet the requirements of this
17 Court's order or CEQA." (Id. at 27:3-4.)

18 53. However, at the conclusion of that ruling, the Court agreed to accept further briefing on
19 the matter. On April 3, 2017, all parties submitted their supplemental briefs, and on April 13, 2017, all
20 parties filed their oppositions to the briefs submitted by their opponents. On June 22, 2017, Judge
21 Shaffer heard further argument concerning the adequacy of the Addendum and then issued its Final Order
22 lon September 20, 2017. The Volker Firm spent 249 hours on litigation phase 3. (Volker Decl. 1 27,
23 Exh. 2 (summary) at page 4 and Exh. 3 (detail) at pages 57-62.)
24 54. The total time spent by the Volker Firm in all phases of the merits litigation through
25 September 27, 2017 was thus 1,393.2 hours (to recap, 48.2 hours (1 35 above) plus 227.3 hours (T 36
26 above) plus 103.0 hours (1 37 above) plus 68.9 hours (1 38 above) plus 49.0 hours (f 390 above) plus
27 174.7 hours (1 40 above) plus 301.4 hours (141 above) plus 172.7 (1 42 above) plus 249.0 hours (11 43-
28 144 above). To put this into perspective, just to review the massive Administrative Record (totaling

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION • 18 - SCV 252985

F 13,110 pages for the original and supplemental records) a single time - a prerequisite in record review
2 cases such as this one - would take one attorney approximately 437 hours, reading an average of 30

3 single-spaced pages per hour. Reviewing the record was only the beginning. From there, the Volker

4 Firm had not only to marshal the facts and law to successfully argue and brief the case on the merits,
5 through three separate litigation phases, but also to fend off demurrers, ex parte applications, motions and
6 lother attempts by Cornell and the County to dismiss, limit or delay petitioner's case. Among other efforts
7 during the five-year litigation period, in addition to necessary legal and record research, the Volker Firm
8 lhad to review and prepare opposition to Cornell's and the County's submissions, prepare petitioner's
9 Verified Petition, First Amended Verified Petition, Second Amended Verified Petition, Opening and
10 Reply Trial Briefs, supplemental trial briefs, prepare for and present at the numerous hearings before this
11 Court and the County BZA and Board, and prepare the supplemental briefs leading up to Judge Shaffer's
12 Final Order filed September 20, 2017. The time spent by the Volker Firm on these myriad and difficult
13 tasks was reasonable, and should be fully compensated.

14 55. Following Judge Shaffer's entry of her Final Order on Motion for Order Determining
15 County Board's Compliance with Statement of Decision filed September 20, 2017, the Volker Firm
16 |timely filed a Motion for Reconsideration or for New Trial or to Vacate Judgment on October 23, 2017.
17 This filing was necessarily delayed by the extended closure of the Sonoma County Superior Court due to
18 the catastrophic wildfires that engulfed the County commencing on Sunday, October 8, 2017. On
19 December 15, 2017, Judge Shaffer granted the Volker Firm's Motion for Reconsideration. Thereafter,
20 pursuant to Judge Shaffer's rulings, the parties engaged in extensive supplemental briefing to address
21 questions raised by Judge Shaffer regarding whether the County's Addendum satisfied the requirements
22 lof CEQA and the rulings of the Court. The Volker Firm submitted its Opening Supplemental Brief on
23 Issues for Reconsideration on April 18, 2018, Cornell and the County filed their Joint Opening
24 |Supplemental Brief in Opposition thereto on May 10, 2018, the Volker Firm filed Petitioner's Reply
25 Supplemental Brief on Issues for Reconsideration on May 23, 2018, and the County and Cornell filed
26 their Joint Brief in Response to Petitioner's Reply Supplemental Brief on May 30, 2018. The parties also
27 Jappeared before Judge Shaffer on June 5, 2018. Judge Shaffer issued her Order on Motion for
28 Reconsideration of Final Order on County Board's Motion for Determination of Compliance with

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 19 - SCV 252985

P |Statement of Decision on September 4, 2018. Additionally, in response to the Memorandum of Costs
2 filed by Cornell on October 10, 2017, the Volker Firm filed petitioner's separate Memorandum of Costs
3 on October 23, 2017, and its Motion to Tax Costs claimed by Cornell and Supporting Memorandum and
4 Declaration on October 24, and November 2, 2017, and following Cornell's filing of its Motion to Strike

5 and Tax petitioner's Memorandum of Costs on November 3, 2017, the Volker Firm filed its
6 Memorandum and Declaration in Opposition to Cornell's Motion to Strike and Tax Memorandum of
7 Costs on November 16, 2017.

8 C. FEE MOTION

56. Since the Volker Firm is entitled to recover its attorneys' fees and litigation costs for its
10 successful prosecution of this matter, it is also entitled to recover fees and costs incurred during
11 Ipreparation of its fee motion filed November 17, 2017 (and corrected November 20, 2017) and
12 subsequent submissions that were and are reasonably necessary to recovery of its fees and costs including
13 this Complaint in Intervention. (Serrano v. Unruh (1982) 32 Cal.3d 621, 639 ("Serrano IV); Hogar
14 Dulce Hogar v. Community Development Comm'n (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1371 ("Hogar")
15 (reversing reduction in fees incurred in securing fee recovery). The Volker Firm will file and serve
16 complete documentation and detailed itemization of its fees and costs incurred in preparing and
17 prosecuting its Fee Motion and Complaint in Intervention at least 16 court days prior to the hearing on the
18 motion.

19 57. Because petitioner is the successful party and achieved its primary litigation objective - a
20 fair hearing before the Board, and an order decertifying the EIR, and a writ of mandate vacating the
21 County's approvals of the Project - its former counsel - the Volker Firm - is entitled to a fully
22 compensatory fee. The fact that petitioner did not win on all of its theories of recovery is irrelevant to its
23 status as the prevailing party entitled to recovery of a "fully compensatory" fee. "It is settled that
24 plaintiffs may be considered "prevailing parties" for attorney's fee purposes if they succeed on any
25 significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the party sought in bringing suit.""
26 (Graciano v. Robinson Ford Sales (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 140, 153, quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart 461
27 U.S. 424, 433 (1993) ("Hensley").) Since petitioner succeeded on several "significant issues" and
28 achieved the entire relief sought in its First a Amended Verified Petition - a fair hearing before the Board,

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 20 - SCV 252985

1 decertification of the EIR, and vacation of the Project approvals - its counsel should recover a "fully
2 compensatory" fee as the prevailing party. (1 Pearl §§ 2.45, 2.86; 2 Pearl §§ 9.3, 9.50.)

3 58. "The California Supreme Court has . instructed that attorney fee awards under section
4 1021.5 'should be fully compensatory,' and absent "circumstances rendering the award unjust, an...
5 award should ordinarily include compensation for all the hours reasonably spent. '" (CBD Nursery, 185
6 Cal.App.4th at 897 (emphasis in original) (quoting from Ketchum v. Moses (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1122, 1133
7 ("Ketchum")) and affirming award of fees including 1.5 multiplier despite petitioner's limited success,
8 noting that reduction for issues lost would impede policy of encouraging attorneys to act as private
9 Jattorneys general); accord, Serrano IV, 32 Cal.3d at 632 (adopting federal rule that "absent facts
10 rendering the award unjust, parties who qualify for a fee should recover for all hours reasonably spent,
11 including those on fee-related matters").)

12 59. As stated in Wallace v. Consumers Cooperative of Berkeley, Inc. (1985) 170 Cal.App.3d at
13 836, 846, "it is settled . that a party need not prevail on every claim presented in an action in order to
14 be considered a successful party within the meaning of the section." Accordingly, "a party who has won
15 substantial relief should not have his [or her] attorney's fee reduced simply because the court did not
16 adopt each contention raised." (Sokolow v. County of San Mateo (1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 231, 248
17 ("Sokolow"), quoting Hensley, 461 U.S. at 439-440.) Here, petitioner achieved the principal relief sought

18 a fair hearing before the Board, decertification of the EIR and vacation of the Project approvals.
19 Because petitioner achieved substantial success on several significant issues - and their unsuccessful
20 theories were directly related to their successful theory - the Volker Firm is entitled to a fully
21 compensatory fee. (Sokolow, 213 Cal.App.3d at 248; Sundance v. Municipal Court (1987) 192
22 |Cal.App.3d 268, 273 ("Sundance"); CBD Nursery, 185 Cal.App.4th at 898.)

23 60. "It is only when a plaintiff has achieved limited success, or has failed with respect to
24 distinct and unrelated claims, that a reduction from the lodestar is appropriate." (Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th
25 at 1369, citing Sokolow, 213 Cal.App.3d at 250.) "Where a lawsuit consists of related claims, a plaintiff
26 who has won substantial relief should not have his attorney's fee reduced simply because the court did
27 |not adopt each contention raised." (Hensley, 461 U.S. at 440.) "To reduce the attorneys' fees of a
28 (successful party because he did not prevail on his arguments, makes it the attorney, and not the defendant,

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 21 - SCV 252985

1 Iwho pays the cost of enforcing that public right." (Sundance, 192 Cal.App.3d at 273.)

2 61. "The principle that attorney fees should not be reduced solely because a litigant did not
3 Isucceed on all claims or theories is based on the practical reality that 'it is impossible for an attorney to
4 determine before starting work on a potentially meritorious legal theory whether it will or will not be
5 laccepted by a court years later following litigation." (Hogar, 157 Cal.App.4th at 1369, quoting
6 Sundance, 192 Cal.App.3d at 273.) "Attorneys generally must pursue all available legal avenues and
7 theories in pursuit of their clients' objectives . . . ." (Sokolow, 213 Cal.App.3d at 250.)

8 62. The rule that attorney fee awards "should be fully compensatory" was adopted by
9 California courts in order to encourage counsel to vindicate public rights, even where the law is
10 undeveloped and unsettled and, consequently, it is difficult to predict which claims will be successful.
11 For example, in Bernardi v. County of Monterey (2006) 167 Cal.App.4th 1379, 1394-1398 ("Bernardi"),
12 the court upheld the plaintiff's counsel's recovery of a fully compensatory fee for all the time it spent
13 litigating a Public Records Act request, even though it only succeeded in obtaining roughly one-third of
14 the documents it sought. (167 Cal.App.4th at 1390-1391, 1394-1398.) The court specifically rejected the
15 defendants' arguments that the lodestar amount should be reduced by two-thirds to reflect plaintiff's
16 "partial success" since it only obtained a small portion of the documents it sued to obtain. (Id. at 1390-
17 1391.)

18 63. Instead, the court held that in calculating the "lodestar" amount, the successful plaintiff's
19 "attorney fees awards 'should be fully compensatory." (Id. at 1394, quoting Ketchum, 24 Cal.4th at
20 1133.) The court pointedly disagreed with the defendants' claim that an attorney fee award "must always
21 be proportionate to the prevailing party's degree of success." (Id. at 1397.) The Court recognized that
22 denying attorney fees where the plaintiff* did not succeed in all its arguments "would chill efforts to
23 enforce the public rights™ sought to be enforced. (Id., quoting Los Angeles Times v. Alameda Corridor
24 Transportation Authority (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1381, 1391.)

25 64. For the same reason, "[a] rule requiring an award of attorney fees to be commensurate with
26 the degree of success" would be inappropriate here, because it would likewise have a "chilling effect" on
27 petitioner's enforcement of the public's rights to a fair hearing and to the County's compliance with
28 CEQA. (Bernardi, 167 Cal.App.4th at 1397-1398; State Water Resources Control Board Cases I

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 22 - SCV 252985

1 °("SWRCB I') (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 674, 777, 779; State Water Resources Control Board Cases II
2 (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 304, 310-311, 317-319.)

3 65. Similarly in River Watch, 175 Cal.App.4th at 772-773 the Court of Appeal upheld the trial
4 court's ruling awarding petitioners compensation for all of the time their counsel reasonably spent on all
5 their claims even though they had lost three out of four separate and distinct claims, and lost on most of
6 the theories on which they based their fourth, partially successful, CEQA claim. (River Watch, 175
7 |Cal.App.4th at 783.) Petitioners had alleged violations of CEQA, a solid waste siting regulation, the San
8 / Diego County general plan and zoning ordinance, and "Proposition C," a local initiative measure. (175

9 Cal.App.4th at 772-773.) But they lost on all their claims save only the CEQA cause, as to which they
10 lprevailed a on a small number of their many arguments. (Id. at 772-773, 783.) Yet the trial court allowed
11 petitioners a full recovery for all time reasonably spent - i.e., after deducting "excessive" hours - on all
12 their claims. (Id. at 774, 783.)

13 66. On appeal, the respondents argued that the trial "court abused its discretion in failing to
14 reduce the attorney fee award by 50 percent to account for RiverWatch's . . . lack of success in numerous
15 issues in the case." (Id. at 782.) The Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that "[t]here is no merit in this
16 argument." (Id.) It explained that "the 'successful' party under section 1021.5 is generally . the party
17 that "succeed[s] on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought
18 in bringing suit." (Id. at 783, citations omitted.) "Prevailing counsel who qualify for an award under
19 section 1021.5 are entitled to compensation for all hours reasonably spent." (Id. (emphasis added), citing
20 |Serrano IV, 32 Cal.3d at 632-633.) Therefore the court affirmed the trial court's award to petitioners for
21 all of their time reasonably spent on all of their claims - including the vast majority that they lost. (Id.)

22 67. So too here, the Volker Firm is entitled to recover a fully compensatory fee for all hours
23 reasonably spent on all of petitioner's claims, since it achieved "substantial" success by (1) impelling the
24 County to rehear the matter on fair hearing grounds and then, after the Project was reapproved, (2)
25 securing this Court's order decertifying the EIR and vacating the Project approvals based on petitioner's
26 success on CEQA issues.

27 68. The "lodestar" figure is calculated by multiplying the number of hours reasonably spent by
28 each billing professional (i.e., attorney, law clerk, or paralegal) multiplied by the reasonable hourly rate

COMPLAINT IN INTERVENTION - 23 - SCV 252985

1  for each biller. (Id.) An agreement by public interest counsel to represent plaintiffs at a lower rate or at
2 no charge does not impact the rate. (Serrano IV, 32 Cal.3d at 643; San Bernardino Valley Audubon
Society v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 738, 755.) The reasonable market value of
4 the services rendered is the appropriate measure of the award. (Serrano IV, 32 Cal.3d at 643.)
69. In Serrano IV, the California Supreme Court held that the market value of public interest
6 Jattorneys' services should be set by comparison to the prevailing billing rates of comparable private
7 attorneys. (Id. at 643; California Common Cause v. Duffy (1987) 200 Cal.App.3d 730, 755.) Public
8 interest attorneys are thus entitled to market rates charged by "large law firms" because "compensation at
9 a lesser rate would result in a windfall to the defendants.' (Building a Better Redondo, Inc. v. City of
10 Redondo Beach (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 852, 873, quoting Serrano IV, 32 Cal.3d at 642 (original
11 emphasis).) Here, the appropriate legal market with which to compare rates is the Bay Area, the
12 metropolitan area in which the case was adjudicated. And to the extent that local Sonoma County
13 attorneys might have lower average rates than attorneys in more urban parts of the Bay Area, NOWWE
14 member Laura Waldbaum confirms in her declaration that "no local attorneys had sufficient experience in
15 this specialized field," so "all of the firms [NOWWE's local legal advisor] recommended were from
16 outside the local Sonoma County area." (Waldbaum Declaration 1 5.) Ms. Waldbaum's declaration is
17 sufficient and competent evidence that [petitioner] acted in good faith and [that] hiring qualified
18 counsel" in the Sonoma County "area was impracticable." (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
19 San Bernardino (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 603, 618.) Accordingly, it is proper to award counsel the
20 prevailing hourly rate in the Bay Area. Fee expert Richard Pearl has confirmed that the rates sought here
21 are "well within" the market rates for this area. (Pearl Declaration 11 9, 11.)

22 70. Petitioner prevailed twice on the merits of this proceeding, securing all of the relief sought
23 a remand for a fair hearing, decertification of the EIR, and vacation of the Project approvals. Doing SO

24 enforced important rights affecting the public interest and conferred a significant non-pecuniary benefit
25 on the public. Private enforcement was necessary. And, any environmental benefit to petitioner was
26 lenjoyed by the public as well, and that diffuse public benefit was vastly outweighed by the very
27 substantial and therefore undue financial burden of this litigation on petitioner.
