18

19 Plaintiff and Petitioner Vallco Property Owner LLC (*VPO"), for its complaint and
20 petition for writ of mandamus against Defendant and Respondent City of Cupertino (the "City')
21 and Does 1-10, alleges as follows:

22 INTRODUCTION

23 VPO is the owner of a 50.82-acre property (the "Vallco Site" or the "Site") located in the
24 City of Cupertino. In August 2019, the City amended its General Plan to prohibit all office uses

25 on the Site, and to restrict the amount of housing that can be developed on the Site to only a
26 fraction of its previous capacity. These General Plan amendments and corresponding zoning
27 changes caused the City's General Plan to be out of compliance with California housing law. In
28 adopting these changes, the City also violated the California Environmental Quality Act

17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2 Case No.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- ("CEQA"). Furthermore, in its haste to amend the General Plan, the City failed to follow
2 procedures required before a general plan can be amended.

3 PARTIES

4 1.

5 VPO is a limited liability company. VPO is the owner of the Site, which is located

6 between Interstate 280 and Stevens Creek Boulevard in Cupertino, California.

2. The City is a California municipality.

3. VPO is currently unaware of the names of the persons, entities and capacities sued
herein as Does 1-10, and therefore sues these defendants by fictitious names. VPO will amend

COBLENTZ PATCH DUFFY & BASS 8 LLP €991'686'§ this complaint to state the true names and capacities of these fictitiously named defendants when
10| ascertained.

11 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

12 4. The Site is located in the northeastern portion of the City of Cupertino. An indoor

FAX ONE MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA 94|04,5500 8

13 shopping mall, known as the Vallco Fashion Mall, was constructed on the Site in the 1970s. Over

0085 16€ SI+ 14 the subsequent decades, the mall's business boomed, and then faded. By the mid-2000s, the mall
15

16 was in a precarious economic position; the City recognized that the Site could no longer sustain a

17 viable shopping mall, and needed to be redeveloped to some other use. In approximately 2012,
the City began to study a complete redevelopment of the mall to a mixed-use, "town-center" style
18 development, complete with office, residential, and retail uses. This concept was consistent with
19 the City's General Plan as then written, which allowed for a variety of uses on the Site, including
20 office uses.

21 5. VPO acquired the Site in 2014, with the reasonable expectation of developing it as
22 a large, mixed-use office, residential, and retail project.

23 6. The City amended its General Plan, including provisions related to the Site, in late
24 2014 (the "2014 General Plan"), shortly after VPO acquired the Site. The 2014 General Plan
25 designated the Site for commercial, residential, and office uses. The 2014 General Plan allocated
26

27 two million square feet of office space to the Site; it also retained the existing retail square footagc
of approximately 1.2 million square feet, and imposed a new requirement that any redevelopment
28 of the Site include at least 600,000 square feet of retail space.

17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2 2 Case No.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

7. The 2014 General Plan also established the number of residential units that could
2 be developed on the Site. Although it allocated 389 residential units to the Site, the General Plan

3 allowed the City to allocate residential units from other parts of the City to the Site without further
amendment to the General Plan. The only limit on the number of residential units was a density of
5 35 units per acre, a standard that had been in place since at least 2005. Because residential units

6 could be built anywhere across the approximately 51-acre Site, the number of residential units that

7 could be built on the Site under the 2014 General Plan was 1,778, which could be increased to a
8 maximum of 2,402 units pursuant to the State density bonus law.

8. d11 ssvg 9 The Housing Element of the 2014 General Plan identified the Site as a "Priority
10 Housing Site" on the City's Regional Housing Needs Assessment ("RHNA") housing inventory,

11

48 FAX 415.989.1663 94104-5500 WINBOLITVO 'OOSIONYAS NYS 'OOO€ ILINS 'LI3MLS AHIWODINOW 3NO and allocated 389 residential units to the Site for RHNA purposes.

12 9. The 2014 General Plan set out two potential "scenarios" with respect to the Vallco
AdJ0O HO1Vd ZIN37800 13 Site and compliance with the RHNA. Under "Scenario A," which would apply if a specific plan

14 and rezoning were adopted for the Vallco Site by May 31, 2018, 389 units could be built on the
415.391.4800 15 Site pursuant to a specific plan. Under "Scenario B," which would apply if a specific plan and
16 rezoning were not adopted for the Vallco Site by May 31, 2018, the City would remove the Vallco

17 Site from the Priority Housing Site inventory, and replace it with other sites or increase the density
18 or allowable units on existing priority sites.

19 10. The Housing Element of the 2014 General Plan also required 15 percent of the
20 residential units built at the Site to be offered at low- or very-low below-market rates, or, if not

21 allowed by law, would require payment of the Housing Mitigation Fee.

22 11. In conjunction with the office, retail, and residential square footage allocated to the
23 Site, the 2014 General Plan additionally required "a complete redevelopment of the existing
24 Vallco Fashion Mall into a vibrant mixed-use town center," including:

25 a. "high-quality office space arranged in a pedestrian-oriented street grid with

26 active uses on the ground floor, publicly-accessible streets and plazas/green

27 space";

28 b. "residential on upper floors. [with] a mix of units for young

24 parking in surface lots, underground structures, and above-ground

25 12. The 2014 General Plan provided that the Site would be developed pursuant to a
26 specific plan to be adopted at a later date. The specific plan was to be tailored to some futurc,
27 planned redevelopment of the Site that would be acceptable to VPO and the City, and consistent
28 with the General Plan.

13. Prior to adopting the 2014 General Plan, the City prepared and certified an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the 2014 General Plan amendments (the *2014 General
3 Plan EIR"). The 2014 General Plan EIR was a program EIR, prepared pursuant to section 15168
of the CEQA Guidelines. The 2014 General Plan EIR states that additional environmental review
would be needed when specific projects are proposed. 94104:5500 14. From 2014 to 2018, a community group known as Better Cupertino opposed VPO's
plan to redevelop the Site. Better Cupertino proposed no alternative development plan for the

8 Site, instead urging retention of the existing, infeasible mall uses, or development of the Site in a
far less intensive manner than VPO (and the 2014 General Plan) contemplated. d77 BASS 10 15. In 2015, VPO submitted an application for a project, named "The Hills of Vallco,"
11 that proposed to include 2 million square feet of office, 800 residential units, and 600,000 square

48 €991'686'9It xvJ SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFOR TREET, SUITE 3000, 12 feet of retail. In response, an affiliate of Better Cupertino circulated an initiative petition for a
COBLENTZ AJENO HOIVc 13 General Plan amendment that, if passed, would have precluded The Hills of Vallco project.
14 Additionally, the initiative, known as Measure C, would have, among other things, restricted uses
0085'168 SI5 15 at the Site to the existing 1.2 million square feet of retail and would have prohibited residential
16 and office uses. City Mayor Scharf, who was at that time a candidate for City Council, was one of
17 the sponsors of Measure C, which did not pass.

18 16. In 2017, the City commenced a new process to prepare a City-initiated specific

ONE MONTGOMER 19 plan for the Site. After months of work, and dozens of public meetings, including several before
20 the Planning Commission and City Council, and over the strong objections of Better Cupertino, in
21 the fall of 2018, VPO obtained entitlements to proceed with two alternative redevelopment
22 schemes for the Site.

23 17. First, the City adopted a specific plan for the Site (the "Specific Plan Project").
24 The Specific Plan Project contemplated a range of development densities, including up to 1.75
25 million square feet of office, 2,923 residential units, and 485,000 square feet of retail and civic
26 uses, as well as a number of community benefits and amenities. The City prepared and certified
27 an EIR for the Specific Plan Project, as contemplated by the 2014 General Plan EIR.
28 18. Second, VPO submitted an application to develop 1.8 million square feet of office

5 Case No. 17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

space, and 2,402 residential units (half of which are affordable), pursuant to Senate Bill 35 ("SB
2 35," and the "SB 35 Project"). Under SB 35, a project application that meets certain objective
3 criteria (for example, at least two-thirds of the square footage must be dedicated to residential
4 uses) is subject only to ministerial processing, and a city may not exercise its discretionary

criteria set forth in SB 35, and approved that alternative development scheme as well.

19.

Better Cupertino, and VPO and the City were essentially prohibited from moving forward with

d77 BASS 94104-5500 FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA NVS STREET, SUITE 3000, AHIWODLNOW 3NO 5 authority to reject it. In mid-2018, the City concluded that the SB 35 Project met the objective

development of that project. As a consequence, the SB 35 Project became the only approved
10 development scheme for the Site.
0087'16€'Slt FAX 415.989.166 11 20. In 2018, Better Cupertino filed a lawsuit challenging the SB 35 Project and asking

45 12 the Court to set aside the City's approval of the SB 35 Project (the "SB 35 Litigation"). The SB ZIN37800 PATCH DUFFY 13 35 Litigation is ongoing.

14 21. Liang Chao and John Willey--respectively, a co-founder of Better Cupertino, and a
15 long-time member and officer of Better Cupertinowere elected to the Cupertino City Council in
16 November 2018. When Chao and Willey were elected to the Council, they joined Steven
17 Scharfanother Better Cupertino member, who was elected to the Council in 2016 and Darcy
18 Paul, a Council member also affiliated with Better Cupertino, who has consistently voted in
19 opposition to redevelopment of the Site. Following the November 2018 election, the City
20 withdrew its support for both the Specific Plan Project and the SB 35 Project. On May 7, 2019,
21 the City Council voted to repeal the specific plan for the Site and to rescind the Specific Plan
22 Project approvals (which had been the subject of Better Cupertino's referendum), rather than allow
23 the citizens of Cupertino to vote on them. In the SB 35 litigation, the City terminated its joint
24 defense agreement with VPO, changed its lead counsel, and filed a statement of "non-opposition"
25 to the petition, essentially consenting to a judgment that would overturn the SB 35 Project
26 approval.

27 22. The City also withdrew its support for any redevelopment of the Site under the
28 2014 General Plan, and decided to amend the General Plan for the Site.

23. On June 18, 2019, the City Council held a study session at which it instructed City
2 Staff to generate proposals to downzone the Site by removing the two million square feet of
3 allocated office use, and limiting the amount of residential allowed. However, due at least in part

4

ONE MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNTI 94104-5500 to requirements that any development on the Site include affordable housing and substantial
5 infrastructural improvements (see infra 1 11), office use is a critical economic component of any
6 large-scale development of the Site. No significant redevelopment of the Site can occur without a
7 substantial office component. VPO submitted a letter prior to the study session objecting to the

COBLENTZ PATCH DUFFY & BASS 48 LLP 8 potential amendments to the General Plan as violating Housing Element requirements.

9 24.

FAX 415.989.1663 Just over one month later, on July 30, 2019, the Cupertino Planning Commission
10 held a public hearing regarding proposed General Plan amendments with
11 corresponding proposed zoning amendments (the "Amendments"). respect to the Site, and

12 25. The Amendments proposed a number of significant and restrictive changes to the

0087'168'SIt 13 General Plan provisions applicable to the Site, and to the Site's zoning. Under the proposed
14 Amendments, the Site would be downzoned to remove the office allocation entirely--from two
15 million square feet to zero square feet. Residential development would be confined to a 13.1-acre
16 portion of the Site. Only 459 residential units (plus, potentially, a density bonus) could be
17 developed on that portion, and at least 15% of those units would have to be affordable in
18 accordance with the City's below-market-rate housing program. Development of those units
19 would be by right, without any environmental review. City Staff made no recommendation before
20 or at the Planning Commission hearing for the location of the 13.1-acre portion (or portions) of the
21 Site. Additionally, the Amendments would restrict development on the rest of the Site-
22 approximately 38 acres-to retail uses only, and maintain the requirement to include a minimum
23 of 600,000 square feet of retail development.
24 26: The Amendments did not propose to modify portions of the General Plan that
25| impose significant burdens on development. The General Plan would continue to require:

27

28 Fifteen percent of residential units to be offcred at below-market rates;
Major Site-wide improvements and a "complete redevelopment" of the Site,

17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2 including a "Town Center layout," a "high quality public realm," a new "street grid" internal to the Site, transit facilities, off-site bicycle/pedestrian

5

6 27. 600,000 square feet of retail use.

7 Nor did the Amendments propose to modify the 2014 General Plan Housing

8 Element. The Amendments did not change either of the two "scenarios" for RHNA compliance

d11 SSv8 9 with respect to the Site, nor did they change the Housing Element's requirement that 15 percent of

28.

11 The purpose and effect of the proposed Amendments was to ensure that the Site

8 could not be developed in an economically feasible manner. Under the restrictions imposed by the

COBLENTZ PATCH DUFFY 12

13 Amendments, no project could be designed that would allow VPO to realize a reasonable return on

14 its investment. Indeed, developing the Site in the manner contemplated by the General Plan as

008†'168'Sl5 15 amended would result in a loss of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. The City did not prepare

any

16 economic analysis before the Planning Commission hearing of whether any project would be
viable under the new land uses and development regulations.

17 29.

18 At the Planning Commission hearing, Commissioner R. Wang-who supported the

19 Amendmentsadmitted that the purpose of the Amendments was to gain "leverage" over VPO.

20 In disallowing all economically feasible development of the Site, the City created a situation in

21 which further amendment of the General Plan would be required in order for VPO to achieve any

14 ON 22 economically productive use of its property. In other words, the Amendments were not a

23 legitimate planning exercise. Their purpose was to enable the City to extract concessions from
VPO.

24 30.

25 Two motions to recommend the Amendments failed before the Planning

26 Commission. The two Planning Commissioners who voted against the motions expressed concern

27 about the rushed nature of the proposals, and the fact that they would likely render any

28 redevelopment of the Site economically infeasible. All Commissioners agreed that they lacked
information sufficient to identify the 13.1-acre portion of the Site that should be designated for

economic feasibility and additional public engagement. The Planning Commission did not
recommend removing the office allocation or limiting residential to only 13.1 acres of the Site, nor

6 did it endorse any of the other Amendments.

why this new language was added. Nor did it suggest that the Site has any higher likelihood of
22 containing tribal cultural resources than other areas of the City, so as to justify imposing this 21

17 Vallco Site was to give the City "negotiation power" over VPO. By eliminating the office
18 allocation completely, Willey explained, the City was forcing VPO to approach the City Council
19  to ask for another General Plan amendment that would contain an office allocation.

20 39. When it adopted the Amendments, the City Council also adopted an addendum to
21 the 2014 General Plan EIR, which concluded that the Amendments warranted no further
22 environmental analysis.

1 compliance set forth in the Housing Element, the Amendments state that the purpose of allowing
2 459 units to be built by-right is "to accommodate the City's Regional Housing Need Allocation.»

3 The Amendments further state that the City considered removing the Vallco Site as a Priority

4 Housing Site, but decided instead to "retain" the Site.

5 41. After the City adopted the Amendments, Mayor Scharf claimed that the
Amendments were necessary to meet the City's RHNA obligations in light of concerns raised by

8 the City on August 2, 2019. Specifically, HCD wrote to warn the City of its "potential violation of

d77 BASS €99I'686'§It FAX OnE MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA DoSS-t0lt6 7 the California Department of Housing and Community Development (*HCD") in a letter sent to a

9 state housing element law." HCD admonished the City that it must "look for opportunities to

10 support the development of new housing within the community," and reminded the City of its

11 "responsibility to zone adequate sites to accommodate housing needs." This letter was sent at

48 12 least a month after the City began its targeted effort to downzone the Site. The City's effort to DUFFY HOLVd ZIN37800 13 downzone the Site was not a response to HCD's concerns, as Mayor Scharf claimed.

14 42. The 2014 General Plan contemplated that, when a specific project was proposed for
415.391.4800 15 the Site, the City would prepare and certify a project-level EIR. The Amendments changed that
16 scheme. Under the Amendments, VPO may develop 459 residential units on the 13.1-acre portion
17 of the Site by right, and without any further environmental review. The City's exercise of its
18 discretion to make that residential development by right is, itself, a CEQA project that required
19 environmental analysis. But the City did not prepare and certify a project-specific EIR or a
20 supplemental EIR when it adopted the Amendments. Rather, it adopted an addendum to the 2014

21 General Plan EIR, concluding that "the proposed modifications would not result in new significant
22 environmental effects beyond those identified in the [2014 General Plan EIR], would not
23 substantially increase the severity of significant environmental effects identified in the [2014
24 General Plan EIR], and thus would not require major revisions to the [2014 General Plan EIR]."
25 The City concluded that "a subsequent EIR is not required and an addendum to the [2014 General
26 Plan EIR] is the appropriate CEQA document to address the proposed modifications to the
27 [General Plan] project."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 1
(Writ of Mandate to Compel Compliance with California's Housing Element Law, 2 Government Code 88 65580-65589.8; Code of Civil Procedure § 1085)

3 43. Paragraphs 1 through 42 are incorporated as though set forth here in full.

4 44. California law requires municipalities to plan for, and to take concrete, affirmative

5 steps to facilitate, housing for all income levels, including affordable housing for low-income and
oogS-+OIN6 VINGOJITVO 'OOSIONVAS NYS 000E ILInS '1338L9 MONTGOMERY 6 very-low-income residents. Approximately every eight years, each city is assigned its "fair share"
7 allocation of the housing need for the region, which is known as its RHNA. (Gov. Code §§ 65583

8 et seq.)

9 45. The City must then prepare an inventory of land that is suitable and reasonably d17 ssvg FAX 415.989.|663 10 available for housing development sufficient to meet its RHNA allocation. That inventory must
11 only include "land suitable and available for residential development, including vacant sites and

48 12 sites having realistic and demonstrated potential for redevelopment during the planning period to
AJ:nO HOLVd ZIN37800 13 meet the locality's housing need for a designated income level[.]" (Gov. Code § 65583(a)(3).)
14 "The inventory shall specify for each site the number of units that can realistically be
008†'16€'9I 15 accommodated on that site[.l" (Gov. Code §§ 65583.2(c), 65583.2(c)(2) (number of units listed
16 for particular site must be "adjusted" to account for "the realistic development capacity for the

17 site").) In other words, it must be physically and economically feasible to develop the allocated
18 number of residential units on each designated site, within the relevant eight-year period.

19 46. Cities must also take steps to remove local governmental constraints to affordable
20 housing development.

21 47. The Housing Element of the 2014 General Plan identified the Vallco Shopping
ONE 22 District Special Area as a "Priority Housing Site" on the City's RHNA housing inventory, and
23 allocated 389 residential units to the Site. Those units are necessary for the City to fulfill its
24 RHNA allocation. The Housing Element of the 2014 General Plan also required 15 percent of the
25 units to be offered at low- or very-low below-market rates, or, if an on-site requirement is
26 unlawful, to pay a housing mitigation fee.

27 48. The Amendments did not modify the City's Housing Element, and the Site remains
28 a Priority Housing Site. The Amendments did, however, render the Site unsuitable, and

the City's General Plan requires that 15 percent of the residential units be affordable, restricts the

MONTGOMERY STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNI 94104-5500 remaining 38 acres of the Site to infeasible retail use, requires massive Site-wide improvements,
but no longer permits the office uses that are an essential economic driver of the residential and

52. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Procedure 1085)

53. Paragraphs 1 through 51 are incorporated as though set forth here in full.

18 "[T]he general plan and elements and parts thereof must "comprise an integrated,
17 internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency." (Gov. Code

19 § 65300.5.) As required by law, the City's General Plan is composed of nine elements, including

ONE the Land Use and Community Design Element and the Housing Element. (Gov. Code
20| §§ 65302(a), (c).) The Amendments, which only modified the Land Use and Community Design
21 Element of the General Plan, caused the Housing Element of the General Plan to be inconsistent
22 with the Land Use and Community Design Element of the General Plan. This horizontal

24 23 | inconsistency caused by the Amendments violates Section 65300.5 of the Government Code.
54. The City's Housing Element continues to contemplate that the Site be developed
25 through a specific plan, or be removed from the Priority Housing List. The Housing Element of
26 the General Plan provides for two potential "scenarios" with respect to the Vallco Site and
27 compliance with the RHNA. Under "Scenario A," which would apply if a specific plan and
28 rezoning were adopted for the Vallco Site by May 31, 2018, 389 units would be built on the Site

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF Case No.

1 pursuant to a specific plan. Under "Scenario B," which would apply if a specific plan and

2 rezoning were not adopted for the Vallco Site by May 31, 2018, the City would remove the Vallco
3 Site from the Priority Housing Site inventory and replace it with other sites or increase the density

4 or allowable units on existing priority sites.

5 55. Contrary to these provisions, the Land Use and Community Design Element as

d11 BASS 0SS-50lt6 VINBOSITVO 'OOSIONYES NYS 'OOOE BLINS 'LI38LS AHGWOSLNOW 3NO 6 modified by the Amendments now provides that the City will comply with RHNA, not through a
7 Vallco specific plan as contemplated in Scenario A, or by replacing the Vallco Site with other sites
8 as contemplated in Scenario B, but instead by allowing by-right development of 459 residential
9 units without a specific plan.

10 56. The City created an inconsistency when it failed to amend the Housing Element to
11 reflect the General Plan Amendments. This change to the Housing Element would have required

18 FAX 415.989.1663 12 the City to circulate the amendment to HCD for review and comment for a 60-day period. The
AdáNO HOLVd ZIN37800 13 City did not follow this required process; instead, the provisions in the Land Use and Community
14 Design Element for satisfying the City's RHNA obligation using the Vallco Site are now
415.391.4800 15  inconsistent with the provisions in the Housing Element on the same subject.

16 57. VPO is beneficially interested in having the City comply with all applicable
17 provisions of the law and their legal duties, as set forth herein.

18 58. VPO has no plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for the violations alleged.

19 59. VPO requests relief, as set forth below.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Writ of Mandate to Compel Compliance with Government Code § 65863.6; Code of Civil 21 Procedure § 1085)

22 60. Paragraphs 1 through 59 are incorporated as though set forth here in full.

23 61. When a city council passes zoning regulation, it is required to "consider the

24 effect" of the ordinance "on the housing needs of the region in which the local jurisdiction is
25 situated," and to "balance these needs against the public service needs of its residents and
26 available fiscal and environmental resources." (Gov. Code 65863.6(a).) Whenever the number
27 of housing units that could be developed on a site is reduced, the law requires that the reduction be
28 based on findings that the limitation promotes "public health, safety, and welfare . which justify

2 reducing the housing opportunities of the region." (Gov. Code § 65863.6(a).) The City violated
these requirements when it passed the Amendments.

3 62.

4 The Amendments facially reduced the number of residential units that could be

5 developed on the Site, from 1,778 to 459. As a practical matter, they reduced the number to zero

AHIWOOLNOW 3NO STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA 94104-5500 by rendering any development on the Site infeasible.

6 63. The City made this reduction without conducting the balancing required under
7 Section 65863.6 of the Government Code, and without making any accompanying findings that
8 the reduction in housing opportunities is justified because it will promote public health, safety, and

d77 15 DUFFY & BASS PATCH COBLENTZ 9 welfare.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Mandate to Compel Compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act;

16 Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5)

67.

17 68. Paragraphs through 66 are incorporated as though set forth here in full.
Approval of the Amendments violated CEQA, in that the City was required to, but
18 did not, prepare a project-specific analysis. The City's reliance on an addendum to the 2014
19 General Plan EIR was improper.

20 69. The 2014 General Plan EIR was a program EIR, prepared pursuant to Section
21 15168(a) of the CEQA Guidelines, that did "not evaluate the impacts of individual projects under
22 the General Plan.3 The 2014 General Plan EIR states that "subsequent projects will require a
23 separate environmental review."

24 70. The Amendments authorize a subsequent project on the Vallco Sitedevelopment
25 of 459 residential units- by right, and without separate environmental review.

26 71. Environmental review was required before adoption of the Amendments. It is
27 reasonably probable that the Amendments' restriction of the residential units to a 13.1-acre portion
28 of the Site may give rise to significant environmental impacts that were not examined in the 2014

17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2 15 Case No.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 General Plan EIR. The 2014 General Plan EIR studied the allocation of 800 residential units on

2 the Vallco Site, presuming that the units could be dispersed throughout the Site. The 2014
3 General Plan EIR did not consider the traffic, air-quality, density, or noise impacts of confining
4 almost half of that number of units to only 25 percent of the Site. Nor did the 2014 General Plan

5
OOSS-POIT6 VINBOUITVO 'ODSIONVAS NVS '000€ 3LINS 'A33MLS AHFWOOLNOW 3NO consider whether new mitigation measures would be required due to these potential effects.

6 72. The 2014 General Plan EIR also did not study the comparative traffic, air quality,

7 density, or noise impacts of the various alternative locations for the 13.1-acre residential portion of

8 the Site. Locating the residential units in one area, versus another, will cause significant

d77 ssvg environmental impacts that will vary in type and magnitude. For example, the residential
415.391.4800 XV3 415.989.1663 10 developments will cause outsized impacts on intersections that are directly adjacent to the
11 development. Differences arising from the different proposed locationsand any potential
12 mitigation-were required to be studied.
COBLENTZ PATCH DUFFY 13 73. Because the Amendments made residential development at the Site by right, there
14 will be no opportunity for the City to conduct environmental review of those impacts, impose
15 additional conditions of approval, or impose any mitigation measures on the development. The
16 City was therefore required to, but did not, conduct a project-specific analysis before adopting the
17 Amendments.

18 74. Approval of the Amendments also violated CEQA because the City was required
19 to, but did not, prepare and certify i Supplemental EIR. The City's reliance on an addendum to
20 the 2014 General Plan EIR was improper.

21 75. CEQA requires analysis and disclosure of the environmental impacts that a
22 "project" may cause. A project for CEQA purposes is "an activity which may cause either a direct
23 | physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the
24 environment, and which is any of the following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by any public
25 agency. (b) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in part, through
26 contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies.

27 (c) An activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other
28 entitlement for use by one or more public agencies." (Pub. Res. Code § 21065.)

17571.004 4813-4251-4086.2 16 Case No.

76. An agency may prepare an addendum, rather than a Supplemental EIR, only if
or none of the conditions described in 2 solely "minor technical changes or additions are necessary
3 [CEQA Guidelines] Section 15162 calling for the preparation of a subsequent EIR or negative
declaration have occurred." (CEQA Guidelines § 15164(b).) A Supplemental EIR must be
prepared if "one or more of the following events occurs: (a) Substantial changes are proposed in
the project which will require major revisions of the environmental impact report. (b) Substantial
changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken
which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report. (c) New information,
which was not known and could not have been known at the time the environmental impact report d77 BASS 10

11 77. The City was required to prepare a Supplemental EIR because the 2014 General

48 ONE MONTGOMER' STREET, SUITE 3000, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA 94104-5500 6

was certified as complete, becomes available." (Pub. Res. Code § 21166.)

12 Plan EIR does not adequately address the significant environmental impacts that may be caused by
AdáNO HO1VC COBLENTZ €991'686 SIt XVJ 13 the Amendments.

14 78. The Amendments' elimination of all office space is a substantial change that
415.391.4800 15 renders any Site development infeasible, meaning that the Site has been condemned to remain a
16 vacant, half-demolished mall, with no prospect of either redevelopment or future use. It is
17 reasonably foreseeable that this will lead to blight in the vicinity of the Site. The 2014 General
18 Plan EIR did not study that potential for blight.

19 79. In 2014, the Vallco Mall was 82 percent occupied. The General Plan proposed in
20 2014 was, in contrast to the Amendments, designed to facilitate and encourage redevelopment of
21 the Vallco Site to "create a new 'downtown' for Cupertino." If left unmodified, the General Plan
22 would have permitted that level of development.

23 80. Today, the Vallco Mall is almost completely vacant, and a portion has been
24 demolished. The Amendments render redevelopment of the Site infeasible, and make protracted
25 vacancy of the property likely. A long period of vacancy at the Site is likely to give rise to urban
26 decay, dumping of refuse, graffiti, vandalism, and abandoned vehicles, both at the Site and at the
27 surrounding properties. Such blight would constitute a significant environmental impact.

CONTEXT
The Vallco Shopping District Special Area encompasses Cupertino's most significant commercial center, formerly known as the Vallco Fashion Park. This Special Area is located between Interstate 280 and Stevens Creek Boulevard in the eastern part of the city. The North Blaney neighborhood, an established single-family area, is adjacent on the west side of the Vallco Shopping District. Wolfe Road bisects the area in a north- south direction, and divides-Vallee-Shopping Distriet into-distinet subareas: Vallee Shopping Distriet Gateway West and Vallee-Shopping Distriet Gateway East. In recent years there has been some façade improvement to the Vallco Fashion Mall; however, there has been no major reinvestment in the mall for decades. Reinvestment is needed to upgrade or replace older buildings and make other improvements so that this commercial center is more competitive and better serves the community. Cufrently, the major tenants-of the mall inelude amovie-theater, bowling alley and Hhree-national retailers.-The Vallco Shopping District is identified as a separate Special Area given its prominence as a regional commercial destination and its importance to future planning/redevelopment efforts expected over the life of the General Plan.

VISION
The Vallco Shopping District will continue to function as a major regional and community destination. The City envisions this area as a new mixed-use "town center" and gateway for Cupertino. It will include an interconnected street grid network of bicycle and pedestrian-friendly streets, more pedestrian-oriented buildings with active uses lining Stevens Creek Boulevard and Wolfe Road, and publicly-accessible grade: level parks and plazas that support the pedestrian-oriented feel of the revitalized area. New development in the Vallco Shopping District should be required to provide buffers between adjacent single-family neighborhoods in the form of boundary walls, setbacks, landscaping or building transitions.

STRATEGIES:
LU-19.3.1 LU 19.1.1: Master Developer.
Redevelopment of the portion of the site with the Regional Shopping designation
pursuant to the specific plan will require a master developer in order remove the
obstacles to the development of a cohesive district with the highest levels of urban
design.

LU-19.3.2 LU 19.1.2: Parcel Assembly.
Parcel assembly and a plan for complete redevelopment of the site is required prior to

LU-19.3.4 LU 19.1.6: Connectivity.
Provide a newly configured complete street grid hierarchy of streets, boulevards and
alleys that is pedestrian-oriented, connects to existing streets, and creates walkable
urban blocks for buildings and open space. It should also incorporate transit facilities,
provide connections to other transit nodes and coordinate with the potential expansion
of Wolfe Road bridge over Interstate 280 to continue the walkable, bikeable boulevard
concept along Wolfe Road. The project should also contribute towards a study and
improvements to a potential a Interstate 280 trail along the drainage channel south of the freeway and provide pedestrian and bicycle connections from the project sites to the
trail.

SECTION III

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED:
After careful consideration of the, maps, facts, exhibits, testimony and other evidence submitted in this matter, the City Council hereby adopts the Municipal Code amendments based on the findings described above, the public hearing record, subject to the conditions specified below:
Section 1. The recitals set forth above are true and correct, and are hereby incorporated herein by this reference as if fully set forth in their entirety.
Section 2. The City Council finds the following as set forth by Municipal Code 19.152.020.C:

1. That the proposed zoning is in accord with Title 19 of the Municipal Code and the City's Comprehensive General Plan (Community Vision 2040) and the proposed amendments are internally consistent with Title 19 of the Municipal Code.
The Housing Element of the General Plan calls for the City to permit at least 389 dwelling units in the Vallco Shopping District Special Area. The General Plan Amendments (adopted at the August 20, 2019 City Council meeting with Resolution Nos. 19-109 and 19-110) modify the Land Use Element of the General Plan to remove office as a permitted use within the Vallco Shopping District Special Area and define development standards that will allow residential development by right on 13.1 acres at a maximum density of 35 dwelling units per acre. The proposed municipal code amendments would rezone the properties within the Vallco Shopping District Special Area for consistency with the General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA-2019-02, and other relevant portions of the Municipal Code.

2. The proposed zoning is in compliance with the provisions of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The City has prepared a Second Addendum Final EIR for the General Plan Amendment, Housing Element Update, and Associated Rezoning Project that analyzes the potential environmental effects of the proposed zoning amendments. The City Council has exercised its independent judgment and reviewed and considered the information in the Second Addendum, which

3

concludes that no further environmental review is required for the proposed zoning amendments
to comply with CEQA.
3. The site is physically suitable (including, but not limited to, access, provision of
utilities, compatibility with adjoining land uses, and absence of physical constraints) for
the requested zoning designation(s) and anticipated land use development(s).
The sites being rezoned have access to utilities and are compatible with adjoining land uses. To
the extent that there are deficient utilities, the City has adopted mitigation measures to ensure
that any future development would need to provide the appropriate utilities to accommodate the development. The proposed zoning would implement the Housing Element and the Land Use Element of the General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA- 2019-02, which include development standards to permit at least 389 residential units and
complementary commercial uses on the site, which are compatible with anticipated land use
development in the area.
4. The proposed zoning will promote orderly development of the City.
The sites being rezoned will promote orderly development in the City by allowing a critical mass
of development to be proposed along the City's Priority Development Area (PDA) in which
future development is anticipated without exceeding the vision for housing and complementary commercial development required in the Housing Element and Land Use Element of the General
Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA-2019-02.
5. That the proposed zoning is not detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals
and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of subject
parcels.
The proposed zoning is not detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals and general welfare
since these are conforming changes that are necessary to implement the Housing Element and
Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-
2019-01 and GPA-2019-02. Additionally, where health or safety impacts have been identified in
the Final EIR,; mitigation measures have been identified which would be applicable to any
development on these sites.
Section 3. The City Council approves the Amendments to the Municipal Code
(Application No. MCA-2019-01) as shown in Exhibit A and authorizes the staff to make* grammatical, typographical, numbering, and formatting changes necessary to assist in
production of the final published Municipal Code.
Section 4. If any portion of this Ordinance or its application is for any reason held to be invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional, by a court of competent
jurisdiction, that portion shall be deemed severable, and such invalidity, unenforceability or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remaining portions of the Ordinance, or its application to any other person or

circumstance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted each section, sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance, irrespective of the fact that any one or more other sections, sentences, clauses or phrases of the Ordinance be declared invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional.
Section 5. The City Council directs the Director of Community Development to file a Notice of Determination with the Santa Clara County Recorder in accordance with CEQA and the CEQA guidelines.
Section 6 This Ordinance shall not take effect unless and until General Plan
Amendment GPA-2019-02 becomes effective.

SECTION III

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED:
After careful consideration of the, maps, facts, exhibits, testimony and other evidence submitted in this matter, the City Council hereby adopts the Master Zoning Map amendments based on the findings described above, the public hearing record, subject to the conditions specified below:
Section 1. The recitals set forth above are true and correct, and are hereby incorporated herein by this reference as if fully set forth in their entirety.
Section 2. The City Council finds the following as set forth by Municipal Code 19.152.020.C:

1. That the proposed zoning is in accord with Title 19 of the Municipal Code and the City's Comprehensive General Plan (Community Vision 2040) and the proposed amendments are internally consistent with Title 19 of the Municipal Code.
The Housing Element of the General Plan calls for the City to permit at least 389 dwelling units in the Vallco Shopping District Special Area. The General Plan Amendments (adopted at the August 20, 2019 City Council meeting with Resolution Nos. 19-109 and 19-110) modify the Land Use Element of the General a Plan to remove office as a permitted use within the Vallco Shopping District Special Area and define development standards that will allow residential development by right on 13.1 acres at a maximum density of 35 dwelling units per acre. The proposed municipal code amendments would rezone the properties within the Vallco Shopping District Special Area for consistency with the General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA-2019-02, and other relevant portions of the Municipal Code.

2. The proposed zoning is in compliance with the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
The City has prepared a Second Addendum Final EIR for the General Plan Amendment, Housing Element Update, and Associated Rezoning Project that analyzes the potential environmental effects of the proposed zoning amendments. The City Council has exercised its independent judgment and reviewed and considered the information in the Second Addendum, which

3

concludes that no further environmental review is required for the proposed zoning amendments
to comply with CEQA.
3. The site is physically suitable (including, but not limited to, access, provision of
utilities, compatibility with adjoining land uses, and absence of physical constraints) for
the requested zoning designation(s) and anticipated land use development(s).
The sites being rezoned have access to utilities and are compatible with adjoining land uses. To
the extent that there are deficient utilities, the City has adopted mitigation measures to ensure
that any future development would need to provide the appropriate utilities to accommodate the
development. The proposed zoning would implement the Housing Element and the Land Use
Element of the General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA- 2019-02, which include development standards to permit at least 389 residential units and complementary commercial uses on the site, which are compatible with anticipated land use
development in the area.
4. The proposed zoning will promote orderly development of the City.
The sites being rezoned will promote orderly development in the City by allowing a critical mass of development to be proposed along the City's Priority Development Area (PDA) in which
future development is anticipated without exceeding the vision for housing and complementary commercial development required in the Housing Element and Land Use Element of the General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA-2019-01 and GPA-2019-02.
5. That the proposed zoning is not detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals
and general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of subject
parcels.
The proposed zoning is not detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals and general welfare
since these are conforming changes that are necessary to implement the Housing Element and Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, as amended by General Plan Amendments GPA- 2019-01 and GPA-2019-02. Additionally, where health or safety impacts have been identified in the Final EIR, mitigation measures have been identified which would be applicable to any
development on these sites.
Section 3. The City Council approves amendments to the Master Zoning Map
as shown in Exhibit A.
Section 4. If any portion of this Ordinance or its application is for any reason held to be invalid, unenforceable or unconstitutional, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that portion shall be deemed severable, and such invalidity, unenforceability or unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
the remaining portions of the Ordinance, or its application to any other person or circumstance. The City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted each section,
sentence, clause or phrase of this Ordinance, irrespective of the fact that any one or more

4

other sections, sentences, clauses or phrases of the Ordinance be declared invalid,
unenforceable or unconstitutional.

Section 5. The City Council directs the Director of Community Development to file a Notice of Determination with the Santa Clara County Recorder in accordance with CEQA and the CEQA guidelines.
Section 6 This Ordinance shall not take effect unless and until General Plan
Amendment GPA-2019-02 becomes effective.

INTRODUCED at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of Cupertino the 20th day of August, 2019 and ENACTED at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of Cupertino the 3rd day of September, 2019 by the following vote:

1 The zoning on assessors' parcels in the table below was amended in September 2018 (Ord. Z-2018-2178) in connection with the City's approval of the Vallco Specific Plan. The adoption of that Zoning Ordinance has been challenged and thus the validity of the zoning code amendments therein is uncertain. See, e.g.; Midway Orchards
v. County of Butte (1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 765. The table shows the zoning as adopted in September 2018, and the
parcels' zoning as existing before that date.
