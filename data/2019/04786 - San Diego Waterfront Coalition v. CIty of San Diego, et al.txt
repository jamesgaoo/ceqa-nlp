12 formed and operating under the laws of the State of California and has an interest in the subject matter
13 of this lawsuit.

14 Background Information

15 6. On or about June 15, 2018, and without holding a public hearing:

16 A. CITY passed Resolution no. R-311809, "A RESOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL

17 OF THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO STATING FOR THE RECORD THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS

18 REVIEWED AND CONSIDERED THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE ADDENDUM TO

19 THE FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE SAN DIEGO CONVENTION

14 A CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR, FOR THE DISTRICT TO ENTER INTO LEASE
15 AMENDMENTS AND AGREEMENTS WITH FAL, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TITLE CONDITIONS
16 (COLLECTIVELY, ALTERNATIVE B CLOSING)."

17 7. Resolution no. R-311809 and Resolution no. R-311810 are collectively identified in this
18 pleading as "CITY Resolutions."

19 Jurisdiction, Venue, and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

20 8. Plaintiff is bringing this action and seeks review by and relief from this Court under
21 Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 860 et seq., 1060 et seq., and 1084 et seq. However, Plaintiff
22 does not have sufficient information at this time to allege that this lawsuit should be prosecuted as a
23 reverse-validation lawsuit under Section 860 and is doing so solely in an abundance of caution.'

24

25 - No matter how any portion of this pleading's allegations or prayer is construed, in no way does Plaintiff intend to assert a claim or seek relief that is inconsistent with the following parameters: (1)
26 Plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or for a class of which Plaintiff's members residing within CITY's and/or the State of California's 27 geographical jurisdiction are themselves members. (2) This lawsuit seeks to enforce at least one important right affecting the public interest and to confer at least one significant benefit, whether 28 pecuniary or non-pecuniary, on the general public or a large class of persons. (3) Private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on Plaintiff in relation to its stake in the
matter. The causes of action alleged in this pleading are examples and are not intended to set forth

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

H 9.

2 Venue in this Court is proper because the obligations, liabilities, and violations of law
alleged in this pleading occurred in the City of San Diego.

3 10. Plaintiff has no plain, speedy, adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since its
4 members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Defendants'

5 violations of the law, as alleged in this pleading. The Resolutions also rest on Defendants' failure to
6 satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those laws. Even when Defendants
7 are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in approving projects under those laws, they
8 remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise their discretion within the limits of and in a
9 manner consistent with those laws. Defendants have had and continue to have the capacity and ability
10 to pass the Resolutions within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Defendants
11 have failed and refuse to do so and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner
12 that is not consistent with those laws.

13 11. Plaintiff and its members also have a beneficial right and interest in Defendants'
14 fulfillment of all their legal and public duties, as alleged in this pleading.
15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:
Resolutions' Non-Compliance with California Constitution

17 (Against All Defendants)
12.

18 13. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

19 Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions authorize

20 the execution of various written agreements by CITY and PORT. In addition:

A. At least $5 million in public money will be paid to FAL in exchange for, among
21 other things, its dismissal of a lawsuit against CITY and SDCCC; its assignment of its leasehold interest
22 in certain tidelands controlled by PORT to CITY and/or SDCCC; its agreement to refrain from
23

24 opposing the "For a Better San Diego" citizens' initiative proposing to raise CITY's transient
occupancy tax; and its dissolution of FAL's existing political action committee formed to oppose the
25 initiative. The initiative is purportedly sponsored by private citizens. If passed and determined to be

26

27

28 an exhaustive list of every act or omission that renders the CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution illegal and invalid.

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 5

1 legally valid, the initiative would provide CITY with a substantial portion of the funding needed to
2 satisfy CITY's financial obligations under the written agreements.

3 B. The initiative contemplates an expansion of the San Diego Convention Center

4 in a location that has not yet been subject to environmental review under the California Environmental

5 Quality Act.

6 C. CITY and SDCCC's collective liability to FAL in the lawsuit is substantially less

7 than CITY and/or SDCCC will pay to FAL under the written agreements.
8 14. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not
9 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories
10| of liability):
11 A. The CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution violate(s) Section 6 of
12 Article 16 of the California Constitution, Section-93 of the San Diego City Charter, and/or Government
13 Code Section 8314. For example:

14 1. The $5 million (or more) to be paid by CITY is purportedly consideration

15 for the dismissal of FAL's lawsuit against CITY and SDCCC and for CITY's right to exercise an option

16 over FAL's leaschold interest in certain tidelands within PORT's jurisdiction.

17 2. Neither CITY nor SDCCC has any liability whatsoever to FAL as alleged
18 in FAL's lawsuit against them. Any suggestion that the money to be paid by CITY to FAL is
19 consideration given to FAL for its dismissal of the lawsuit is illusory, collusive, and fraudulent because

20 CITY and SDCCC know that they have no liability to FAL. The parties to the contracts contemplated
21 by the Resolutions, with the active participation and assistance of SDCCC, have conspired and colluded

22 to fabricate a phony claim by FAL against CITY that would be pursued in litigation in order to provide

23 a pretext for paying money to FAL, to rationalize the expenditure of public funds that could not
24 otherwise be lawfully authorized.

25 3. The value of the option rights over FAL's leasehold interest acquired by
26 CITY pursuant to the Resolutions is substantially less than $5 million. FAL's leasehold interest expires
27 on June 30, 2024, at which point it automatically converts to a month-to-month lease, and the lease

28 agreement expressly provides that PORT has no obligation to give any approvals for any redevelopment

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF ETC. Page 6

l before or after the expiration date. CITY failed to obtain an objective appraisal of the leasehold's value
2 through June 30, 2024, in its current condition (i.e., without assuming redevelopment of the leased

3 premises).

4 4. Pursuant to one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions,

5 public money will be spent by CITY, PORT, and/or SDCCC, under the pretext of a "settlement" or
6 "option" payment to FAL, to influence the outcome of a ballot measure over the expansion of the San
7 Diego Convention Center. In the absence of FAL's commitment not to oppose such a ballot measure

8 and disbanding of its political action committee to defeat the measure, CITY, PORT, SDCCC, and/or

9 and the other proponents of the ballot measure would have to expend additional monies to counter the
10 opposition funded by FAL. FAL's political silence is being purchased through the Resolutions.
11 15. There is a good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
12 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends

13 that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
*, 14 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of
* 15 the issue.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: Resolutions' Non-Compliance with San Diego City Charter Section 93 17 (Against All Defendants)

18 16. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

19 17. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not
20 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories

21 of liability):

22 A. The CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution violate(s) Section 6 of
23 Article 16 of the California Constitution,; Section 93 of the San Diego City Charter, and/or Government
24 Code Section 8314. For example:

25 1. The $5 million (or more) to be paid by CITY is purportedly consideration

26 for the dismissal of FAL's lawsuit against CITY and SDCCC and for CITY's right to exercise an option

27 over FAL's leasehold interest in certain tidelands within PORT's jurisdiction.

28

SECONd AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 7

2. Neither CITY nor SDCCChas any liability whatsoever to FAL as alleged

2 in FAL's lawsuit against them. Any suggestion that the money to be paid by CITY to FAL is
consideration given to FAL for its dismissal of the lawsuit is illusory, collusive, and fraudulent because

4 CITY and SDCCC know that they have no liability to FAL. The parties to the contracts contemplated
by the Resolutions, with the active participation and assistance of SDCCC, have conspired and colluded

6 to fabricate a phony claim by FAL against CITY that would be pursued in litigation in order to provide
a pretext for paying money to FAL, to rationalize the expenditure of public funds that could not

8 otherwise be lawfully authorized.

3. The value of the option rights over FAL's leasehold interest acquired by
10 CITY pursuant to the Resolutions is substantially less than $5 million. FAL's leasehold interest expires
11 on June 30, 2024, at which point it automatically converts to month-to-month lease, and the lease
12 agreement expressly provides that PORT has no obligation to give any approvals for any redevelopment
13 before or after the expiration date. CITY failed to obtain an objective appraisal of the leasehold's value
14 through June 30, 2024, in its current condition (i.e., without assuming redevelopment of the leased
15 premises).

16 4. Pursuant to one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions,
17 public money will be spent by CITY, PORT, and/or SDCCC, under the pretext of a "settlement" 0r
18 "option" payment to FAL, to influence the outcome of a ballot measure over the expansion of the San

19 Diego Convention Center. In the absence of FAL's commitment not to oppose such a ballot measure
20 and disbanding of its political action committee to defeat the measure, CITY, PORT, SDCCC, and/or
21 and the other proponents of the ballot measure would have to expend additional monies to counter the
22 opposition funded by FAL. FAL's political silence is being purchased through the Resolutions.
23 18. There is good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
24 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends
25 that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
26 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of
27 the issue.

28 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: Resolutions' Non-Compliance with Government Code Section 8314

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 8

1 (Against All Defendants)

2 19. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

3 20. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not

4 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories

5 of liability):

6 A. The CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution violate(s) Section 6 of
7 Article-1 of the California Constitution, Section 93 of the San-Diego City Charter, and/or Government

8 Code Section 8314. For example:

1. The $5 million (or more) to be paid by CITY is purportedly consideration
10 for the dismissal ofFAL's lawsuit against CITY and SDCCC and for CITY's right to exercise an option

11 over FAL's leasehold interest in certain tidelands within PORT's jurisdiction.

12 2. Neither CITY nor SDCCC has any liability whatsoever to FAL as alleged

13 in FAL's lawsuit against them. Any suggestion that the money to be paid by CITY to FAL is
14  consideration given to FAL for its dismissal of the lawsuit is illusory, collusive, and fraudulent because

15 CITY and SDCCC know that they have no liability to FAL. The parties to the contracts contemplated

16 by the Resolutions, with the active participation and assistance of SDCCC, have conspired and colluded
17 to fabricate t phony claim by FAL against CITY that would be pursued in litigation in order to provide
18 a pretext for paying money to FAL, to rationalize the expenditure of public funds that could not
19| otherwise be lawfully authorized.

20 3. The value of the option rights over FAL's leasehold interest acquired by

21 CITY pursuant to the Resolutions is substantially less than $5 million. FAL's leasehold interest expires

22 on June 30, 2024, at which point it automatically converts to a month-to-month lease, and the lease

23 agreement expressly provides that PORT has no obligation to give any approvals for any redevelopment
24 before or after the expiration date. CITY failed to obtain an objective appraisal of the leasehold's value
25 through June 30, 2024, in its current condition (i.e., without assuming redevelopment of the leased
26 premises).

27 4. Pursuant to one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions,

28 public money will be spent by CITY, PORT, and/or SDCCC, under the pretext of a "settlement" or

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 9

"option" payment to FAL, to influence the outcome of a ballot measure over the expansion of the San

2 Diego Convention Center. In the absence of FAL's commitment not to oppose such a ballot measure

3 and disbanding of its political action committee to defeat the measure, CITY, PORT, SDCCC, and/or

4 and the other proponents of the ballot measure would have to expend additional monies to counter the

5 opposition funded by FAL. FAL's political silence is being purchased through the Resolutions.

6 21. There is a good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
7 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends

8 that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
9 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of

10 the issue.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION:
Resolutions' Non-Compliance with San Diego City Charter Section 99 12 (Against All Defendants)

13 22. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

14 23. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not
15 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories
16 of liability):

17 A. The CITY Resolutions violate Section 99 of the San Diego City Charter. For
18 example:

19 1. CITY's financial obligations include the incurring of indebtedness that

20 exceeds its income and revenue for the fiscal year in which the indebtedness is incurred. However,
21 CITY did not obtain voter approval of the indebtedness, did not levy a tax to cover the interest that
22 accrues on the indebtedness, and has not established a sinking fund to a cover the principal on the
23 | indebtedness.

24 2. CITY's financial obligations under one or more of the written agreements
25 contemplated by the Resolutions will exceed five years. However, CITY did not approve any of those
26 written agreements by ordinance; they were approved only by resolution.
27 24. There is a good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
28 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 10

that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that

2 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of

3 the issue.

4 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION:
Resolutions' Non-Compliance with Government Code Section 1090
5 (Against All Defendants)

6 25. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

7 26. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not
8 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories
of liability):

10 A. The CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution violate(s) Government Code

11 Section 1090-and/or the common-law prohibition against conflicts of interest. For example:

12 1. At least one officer or employee of CITY, PORT, and/or SDCCC has a
13 financial interest in one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions and participated in
14 the making of the contract(s).

15 • 27. There is 1 good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
16 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends
17 that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that

18 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of

19 the issue.

20 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION:

21 Resolutions' Non-Compliance with Common Law's Conflict-of-Interest Prohibition (Against All Defendants)

22 28. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.

23 29. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Resolutions do not
24 comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not limitation (including alternative theories

25 of liability):
26 A. The CITY Resolutions and/or the PORT Resolution violate(s)Govemnment Eode
27 Section 1090 andfor the common-law prohibition against conflicts of interest. For example:

28

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 11

1 1. At least one officer or employee of CITY, PORT, and/or SDCCC has a
2 financial interest in one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions and participated in

3 the making of the contract(s).

4 30.

5 There is a good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the

6 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends
that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that
7 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of

8 the issue.

o SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION:
10 Resolutions' Non-Compliance with Laws Prohibiting Taxpayer Waste (Against All Defendants)
11 31.

12 32. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated into this paragraph by reference.
Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that CITY's payment of any
13 money under one or more of the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions would constitute an illegal

14 waste of taxpayer. For example:

15 A.

16 An essential assumption in adopting the CITY Resolutions and authorizing the
contracts was that a ballot measure to raise CITY's transient occupancy tax to provide funding for an
17 expansion of the San Diego Convention Center would be on the November 2018 ballot.

18 B. No such ballot measure was on the November 2018 ballot.

19 C.

20 Whatever benefits (if any) CITY anticipated from voter approval of such ballot

21 measure in November 2018 when CITY approved the Resolutions and authorized the contracts will
never materialize.

22 D. Based on the failure of the essential assumption to be true, CITY's expenditure
23 of money under the contracts contemplated by the Resolutions will provide no public benefit
24 whatsoever.

25 33. There is a good-faith dispute between Plaintiff, on the one hand, and Defendants, on the
26 other hand, as to whether the preceding allegations in this cause of action are true. Plaintiff contends
27

28 that they are at least partly true. Plaintiff is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 12

1 Defendants contend that none of them is true. The parties therefore require a judicial determination of

2 the issue.

3 Prayer

4 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Plaintiff respectfully prays for the following relief against

5 Defendants (and any and all other parties who may oppose Plaintiff in this proceeding) as the Court

6 deems appropriate:

7 A. A judgment determining or declaring that the Resolutions do not comply with all

8 applicable laws in at least some respect, rendering the Resolutions null and void, invalid, or otherwise
9 without legal effect;

10 B. Injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from taking any of the action contemplated by

11 the Resolutions unless and until Defendants comply with all applicable legal requirements, as

12 determined by the Court;

13 C. Issuance of a writ of mandate requiring CITY and PORT to rescind the Resolutions,
14 unless and until CITY and PORT have fully complied with all other applicable laws as determined by
15 this Court;

16 D. A constructive trust in favor of CITY and/or PORT on all monies paid out under the
17 authority of the Resolutions, and an order directing each recipient thereof jointly and severally to make
18 restitution to CITY and/or PORT for all such monies as determined by the Court;

19 E. All legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding, including
20 but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure; and
21 F. Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
