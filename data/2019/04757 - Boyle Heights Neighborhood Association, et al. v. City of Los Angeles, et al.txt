VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOUAWNP Petitioners, Boyle Heights Neighborhood Association and Carlos Montes, allege:

Introduction

1. By this action, Petitioners, Boyle Heights Neighborhood Association and Carlos
Montes, challenge the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles and its
Department of City Planning (the City) in approving land-use entitlements and
environmental documents for construction of KIPP Promesa Preparatory School
(the Project), an elementary-level charter school proposed to be built on a site

10 consisting of three lots at 443 South Soto Street and 432 and 440 South Breed

11 Street in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles (the Project Site).

12 2. The Project will harm nearby residents and the public by allowing a new school

13 on the Project Site that will add considerable traffic to the nearby streets,

14 particularly when students are dropped off and picked up. This impact will

15 worsen traffic that already slows to a crawl during rush hour.

16 3.

17 The Project will have other deleterious effects on the neighborhood, including

18 increased noise, impacts on parking, hydrology, and water quallty, and increased-

19 air pollution and greenhouse-gas effects.

20 4. In approving the Project, the City relied on the environmental analysis in an

21 Initial Study (IS) and Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), which failed to

22 adequately analyze several potentially significant environmental impacts, in

23 violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

24 5.

25 The Project is inconsistent with the applicable general plan.

26 6. Several significant environmental impacts of the Project will not be mitigated

27 into insignificance by the mitigation measures proposed with the MND. CEQA

28 therefore requires that the Project's MND and approval be set aside and that the

29 City prepare an Environmental Impact Report for the Project.

30
31 Parties

32 7. Petitioner Boyle Heights Neighborhood Association (BHNA) is an

33 unincorporated association composed of residents and people who work in Boyle

34 Heights. Members include longtime families with children who attend and have

35 graduated from local schools, as well as people who work in local schools,

VERIPIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

W businesses, and organizations. The purpose of the BHNA is to work to improve
the quality of life for Boyle Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. Its goals
include improving the neighborhood's health, environment, and living

0r conditions (including improved low-cost housing); supporting and advocating

6 for public education; and fighting pollution, traffic and pedestrian congestion,

7 and police abuse. The BHNA works as an advocate to demand local government

8 meets the needs of the neighborhood. The BHNA advocates for poor working-

9 class immigrant families and longtime residents who face the impact of

10 gentrification. The BHNA brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of

11 the public. Its members have strong beneficial interest in protecting the quality

12 of life in Boyle Heights, and in this case because the actions taken by the City, and

13 challenged in this case, affect them directly as neighbors of the Project and

14 members of the public at large.

15
16 8. Petitioner Carlos Montes is a member and an organizer of the BHNA. He is a

209838 longtime Boyle Heights resident who lives two blocks from the Project Site, and a
nationally recognized immigrant-rights, antiwar, pro-public-education Chicano
activist and former political prisoner. His family immigrated from Mexico. He
graduated from Hollenbeck Middle School, attended Roosevelt High School, and
graduated from Garfield High School, and his younger sister was born at former
Lincoln Hospital in Boyle Heights. Mr. Montes is a current member and past
23 president of the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Council. He has worked to

24 improve the quality of life in Boyle Heights by advocating for improved city
services promoting social and recreational programs, and for improved
25
26 neighborhood park and library facilities. He has been a longtime advocate for
public education, organizing efforts to relieve overcrowding at Roosevelt and
27
28 Garfield High Schools by working to open two new high schools, Mendez High

29 School in Boyle Heights and Torres High School in East Los Angeles. He

30 organized parents to oppose the takeover of Garfield High School by Green Dot,
and took part in the campaign to stop a colocation of charter schools at Roosevelt

31 High School and Marianna Avenue Elementary School. He has been an advocate

32 for the environment and public health in the community, working to close the

33 Exide battery recycling plant, to improve clean-up of lead contamination, and to

34 fight against a proposed trash incinerator. Mr. Montes is currently retired and a

35 community organizer with Centro CSO in Boyle Heights, and a writer for

- 2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOAWNY www.fightbacknews.org. Mr. Montes has a strong beneficial interest in protecting
the quality of life, environment, and public health in Boyle Heights, and in this
case because the actions taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect him
directly and detrimentally as a resident of Boyle Heights and as a member of the
BHNA. Mr. Montes submitted comments during the Project's environmental
review process and testified at the public hearing on the Project

9. Respondent City of Los Angeles (City) is municipal corporation and charter
city.
10
11 10. Real party in interest KIPP LA Schools is, on information and belief, an

12 organization that operates public charter schools in the greater Los Angeles Area,

13 and an applicant for the entitlements being challenged in this case.

14
15 11. Real party in interest TA Los Angeles 443 SSS LP is, on information and belief, a

16 limited partnership that, together with KIPP LA Schools, are the applicants for
the entitlements being challenged in this case (Applicants).

17
18 12. Petitioners are currently unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties

19 in interest Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious

20 names. Does through 10 are agents of Applicants who are responsible in some

21 manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or entities

22 who claim some legal or equitable interest in the subject matter of this action.

23 Petitioners will amend this petition to show the true names and capacities of

24 Does through 10 when such names and capacities become known.

25 Jurisdiction and Venue

26
27 13. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code

28 of Civil Procedure (CCP) S$ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code
§ 21167.
29
30 14. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within

31 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as

32 limited civil cases in CCP §S 86, 86.1, or 87.

33
34 15. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP § 394 because Respondent City of Los

35 Angeles is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County, which

- 3 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

AWNH is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.
16. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,
including exhaustion of all available administrative remedies.

5 The Project
6

7 17. The Project at issue in this case is the proposed construction, use, and
maintenance of a three-story public charter elementary school for TK through 8 fourth grade, named KIPP Promesa Preparatory. 9

10 18. The Project Site consists of three lots of approximately 54,141 square feet (1.28
11 acres) of lot area. The property contains an existing 40,000 square-foot hospital
92 building, which formerly operated as Promise Hospital of East Los Angeles. The hospital building has been vaca ted since December 2017. The Project would
14 include demolition of the existing hospital building and accessory structures.
15
16 19. The Project Site is located within the area of the Boyle Heights Community Plan,
2098 4 part of the City of Los Angeles General Plan. The Community Plan designates the
Project Site for Low Medium II Residential land uses. One portion of the Project
Site is zoned [Q]R4-1-CUGU, and the remainder of the Site is zoned RD1.5-1-
CUGU.

20. Real party in Interest KIPP LA Schools operates the existing KIPP Promesa 22 Preparatory at two locations within five miles of the Project Site, with students in
23 TK, kindergarten, and first through third grades, and total combined enrollment
24 of approximately 450 students. Applicants propose to consolidate the two
25 existing campuses at the Project Site, in a single school building with a maximum
26 capacity of 625 students.
27
28 21. The proposed school building would contain three stories in approximately
41,000 square feet. The building would have 33 classrooms, an administrative 29

30 area, and other rooms and facilities. The school would employ up to 33 teachers.

31 22. The Project would contain a surface parking area for 33 vehicle parking spaces
32 and 102 bicycle parking spaces. The outdoor area would have : student drop-
33 off/pick-up area and a recreation area. The parking and drop-off/pick-up area
34 would be accessed from Breed Street. For student drop-off and pick-up, vehicles

3 would enter a driveway loop and queue until students can be dropped off or
picked up.

4
OoNO 23. The Applicants seek, and the City has approved, the following discretionary
entitlements (the Project Entitlements) in Case No. CPC-2017-4617-VZC-CU:

a. Vesting zone change to permit the removal of a "Q" condition and the
rezoning of the portion of the property zoned [Q]R4-1-CUGU to
(T)RD1.5-1-CUGU.

10
11 b. Conditional use permit to permit the operation of KIPP Promesa

12 Preparatory at the Project Site.

13
14 24. Department of City Planning staff approved a mitigated negative declaration

15 (MND) for the Project, dated May 9, 2018, based on an Initial Study (IS)
checklist.

16

17 25. According to the IS checklist, the City concluded that environmental impacts

18 would be potentially significant in the areas of hazards and hazardous materials,

19 noise, public services, and transportation/traffic. The City concluded that in all

20 other areas considered, environmental impacts would be less than significant, or

21 there would be no environmental impacts.

22
23 26. The proposed MND concluded that all impacts identified as potentially

24 significant would be less than significant with mitigation incorporated. The

25 proposed Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) includes one

26 mitigation measure each in the areas of hazards and hazardous materials and

27 noise, two mitigation measures in the area of public services, and three mitigation
measures in the area of transportation/traffic.

28
29 Project Approval Process

30
31 27. On August 31, 2018, the City of Los Angeles Planning Commission approved the

32 Project Entitlements, adopted the MND and MMRP, and adopted findings and
conditions of approval for the Project.

33
34 28. On September 19, 2018, Petitioner Carlos Montes filed an appeal of the Planning

35 Commission's action, appealing the Project Entitlements and MND to the City
Council.

- 5 -

F

2
3 29. The appeal was heard by the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management

4 (PLUM) Committee, which recommended denial of the appeal at a regular
meeting on November 6, 2018.

5

6 30. On December 4, 2018, the City Council denied the appeal and sustained the

7 Planning Commission action. On December 6, 2018, the City filed a Notice of

Cp Determination for its approval of the Project.

9 First Cause of Action

10
11 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

12 31. Petitioners incorporate 99 1-29 above as though set forth here.

13

14 32. In adopting the MND, the City violated the California Environmental Quality
Act, Public Resources Code $5 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA

15
16 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. $$ 15000-15387 plus appendices) in significant
ways, some of which are described in the following paragraphs.

17
18 33. The City has failed to prepare a legally adequate Initial Study and Mitigated

19 Negative Declaration because those documents do not adequately describe the

20 Project and its environmental impacts. The conclusions in the IS checklist are not

21 supported by proper analysis or record evidence in many cases. The lack of

22 evidence supporting conclusions of insignificance in the MND supports a fair

23 argument that the Project may have significant environmental impacts.

24

25 34. The City has also failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's significant

26 adverse environmental impacts in multiple areas, including traffic, air quality,
greenhouse gases, parking, hydrology and water quality, and noise.

27

28 35. The record contains substantial evidence that the Project, as approved, may have

29 significant environmental impacts, so CEQA requires an Environmental Impact
Report (EIR) to be prepared.

30

31

32 36. The City abused its discretion by approving this Project using an MND that does
not comply with CEQA.

33

34 37. Under CEQA, the baseline should be the physical conditions on the ground at the

35 time the MND is prepared. The Project Site contains a hospital building that was
vacant when the MND was prepared, so that vacant building represents the

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 baseline from which the Project's environmental impacts are to be calculated.
2

3 Traffic

4 38. The Project, an elementary school with 625 students, will generate significant
5 automobile traffic. The Traffic Impact Study prepared by KOA Corporation,
6 dated September 29, 2017 (Traffic Study), estimates the Project will generate 806
7 trips per day, but errs in subtracting out the "Former Use Credit" for the former
8 hospital on site by identifying the Former Use Credit as 529 trips per day. The
9 CEQA baseline for the Project is a vacant building with zero trips per day, not a
10 working hospital causing 529 trips per day, SO the traffic estimates should be 806
11 trips per day, not 277 trips per day.
12

13 39. The proper trip-generation figure is almost a factor of three higher than the one

14 used in the Traffic Study, invalidating the conclusions of that study, and all

15 conclusions in the MND based on the Traffic Study.

16 40. A large proportion of the elementary school's students will arrive or leave by
17 automobile. The Project includes a loop in the outdoor area of the Site that will
18 be used for dropping off and picking up students. The entrance and exit to this
19 loop are on Breed Street. Dropping off and picking up the majority of the 625
20 students, using a single line of automobiles, is likely to cause the line of cars to
21 back up significantly onto Breed Street. The Traffic Study does not analyze how
22 quickly the school will be able to move cars through the loop and how long the
23 line of waiting cars on Breed Street will be. This is a potentially significant
24 environmental effect, which should have been analyzed in the MND.
25
26 41. For reasons including the procedure for dropping off and picking up students,

27 the Project will have significant, unmitigated adverse effects on traffic.

28 42. The impact of the drop-off/pick-up procedure, a potentially significant impact,
29 will not be sufficiently mitigated by the mitigation measures in the MMRP or by
30 the Project's conditions of approval.
31
32 43. Traffic cumulative impacts are not properly analyzed in the Traffic Study or the

33 MND. Traffic is a significant environmental problem in the area of the Project

34 Site, partly as a result of existing schools in the Project's vicinity. The added

35 traffic in trips per day from the Project is enough to make a noticeable

- 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

0P contribution to the overall traffic problems, and is cumulatively considerable.
The drop-off/pick-up procedure will exacerbate traffic impacts in the area. The
3 Project's cumulative traffic impacts are therefore significant.
4

5 44. The Project's impacts on traffic are significant, and the mitigation measures do

6 not reduce those impacts to insignificance, so an EIR is required.
7 Air Quality
8

9 45. The MND does not analyze the air-quality effects of vehicles idling to drop off

10 and pick up students. The City should have determined how many vehicle-hours

11 of idling will be required for the drop-off and pick-up process. The procedure by

12 which students will be dropped off and picked up may result in many vehicles

13 running while waiting in traffic before and after dropping off or picking up

14 students, for a total of many hours per day of vehicle idling time.

15 46. This extensive vehicle idling will have significant air-quality impacts from
16 emitted pollutants including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon
17 dioxide. The MND does not properly analyze these effects.
18 983 47. The number of vehicle trips attributable to the Project is significant. The MND
inadequately analyzed the impact of these vehicle trips, including because the
Traffic Study inaccurately calculated the Project's trip generation figure. The
22 impacts of the added vehicle trips on air quality may be significant, but those

23 impacts were not properly considered or analyzed in the MND.

24 48. The air in Los Angeles County violates federal air-quality standards. According
25 to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the county is in "extreme" non-
26 attainment for ozone. The Project will add to the ozone pollution. By adding
27 hundreds of hours of vehicle idling, and a significant number of additional
28 vehicle trips per day, the Project will make cumulatively considerable
29 contribution of criteria air pollutants, so the Project may have significant
30 cumulative air-quality impacts.
31
32 49. The MMRP does not provide for mitigation measures that will mitigate these air-

33 quality impacts to a less-than-significant level.

34 50. The Project's impacts on air quality are significant, and the mitigation measures
35

- 8 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F

2 do not reduce those impacts to insignificance, so an EIR is required.

3 Greenhouse Gases

4

5 51. The IS and MND fail to meet CEQA requirements to consider whether the

6 Project's increased greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions compared to the existing

7 environmental setting-a vacant buildingexceed a threshold of significance.

8 The IS and MND contain no threshold of significance, violating CEQA.

9 52. Cars waiting in line to drop off or pick up students will result in many vehicle-

10 hours of idling every school day, and will emit significant amounts of CO2 per

11 year. The IS and MND fail to factor these GHG emissions into their GHG

12 analysis. The City has violated CEQA by failing to properly analyze them.

13
14 53. The MND fails to analyze the greenhouse-gas emissions of the new school

15 building that will be constructed as part of the proposed Project. The emissions

16 from this large building will be significant. The MND states that because the

17 Project will be required to follow the City of Los Angeles's current building code,

18 it will be consistent with statewide greenhouse-gas reduction goals and policies,

19 and its greenhouse-gas impacts will therefore be less than significant. This

20 significance standard is inadequate under California law to establish that the

21 Project's greenhouse-gas impacts are less than significant.

22 54. The evidence in the record supports a fair argument based on substantial

23 evidence that the Project may have significant GHG impacts, which the Project's

24 mitigation measures will not reduce to a less-than-significant level, so CEQA

25 requires the City to prepare an EIR for the Project.

26 Parking
27
28 55. The Project will have significant adverse effects on local parking. The Project will

29 supply 33 parking spaces, one per classroom. This is far too few parking spaces to

30 support the Project's parking needs, because the Project will employ more than

31 33 staff members, including teachers and other staff, and parents, student

32 teachers, and others will occasionally attend conferences, participate in classroom

33 instruction, or be on campus for other reasons, increasing the need for parking to

34 serve the Project.

35 56. Because the Project will have inadequate parking for its own uses, it will cause

- 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F4 0 00 impacts on parking in the vicinity, where parking is already limited. The MND
failed to analyze these impacts.

4 57. A project's contribution to parking deficit must be analyzed if it affects traffic,

5 air quality, or other physical environmental impacts. The Project would do so.

6 Traffic, air quality, and emergency-vehicle access are heavily impaired in the

7 Project area. The City should have analyzed cumulative impacts in these areas as
8 a result of the Project's contribution to a parking deficit.

9 Hydrology and Water Quality
10
11 58. The Project will cover the Project Site almost completely with impermeable

12 surfaces, so almost all rainwater that falls on the Site will run off into the storm
5 drains. The MND does not discuss how much the Project will increase the
14 proportion of impermeable surfaces on the Project Site and does not support its
15 conclusion that impermeable surfaces resulting from the Project's development
16 would not significantly change the volume of stormwater runoff.

17 59. The MND assumes, with no analysis or factual support, that because the City will 09838 follow the relevant regulations, NPDES standards, and the City's Stormwater and
Urban Runoff Pollution Control regulations, runoff from the Project Site will not
increase in speed or amount in a manner that would result in flooding. The MND
should have analyzed the hydrological effects of the impermeable surfaces to be
constructed as part of the Project, which will likely cause a significant adverse 23 effect on hydrology in the Project vicinity.
24

25 60. The Project will allow hundreds of cars per day to drive on the Project Site,

26 including for student drop-off and pick-up. This vehicle traffic will deposit tire
27 rubber, motor oil, heavy metals, and toxic chemicals on the impermeable surfaces
888 of the Project. These pollutants will be washed into the storm drains when it
rains, resulting in pollution of the stormwater flowing off the site. The MND does
not analyze the effect of this pollution on water quality. This is a potentially
31 significant environmental impact, which the MND failed to properly analyze, and

32 for which no mitigation has been proposed.

33 61. The Project's impacts on hydrology and water quality may be significant, and the
34 mitigation measures do not reduce those impacts to insignificance, so an EIR is
35

10 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

--

2 required.

3 Noise

4

5
6 62. Because the existing noise level in the vicinity of the Project already exceeds the

cn ~ noise level allowed under the Los Angeles Municipal Code, the MND adopted the
existing noise levels as its significance threshold, such that any additional noise
contributed by the Project would be a significant environmental impact, unless
those noises could be mitigated to not exceed the existing noise levels.

10
11 63. The MND concludes the City's Noise Ordinance and the proposed mitigation

12 measures will reduce noise impacts to a less-than-significant level, but fails to

13 explain or support that conclusion. The Noise Ordinance alone does not ensure

14 noises will not be produced that exceed existing noise levels. The single noise-

15 mitigation measure, XII-90, requires outdoor public address systems to be

16 inaudible beyond the boundaries of the Project Site, but does not provide

17 mitigation for any other noises generated as a result of the Project. The Project

18 would generate noises including many children playing outside during recess,

19 engine noise and car horns from the vehicles dropping off or picking up students

20 or stuck in traffic, and noise from exterior landscaping and cleaning. These

21 sources would not be mitigated and would therefore result in increased noise in

22 the vicinity of the Project. Noise would therefore be a significant environmental

23 impact, requiring an EIR to be prepared.

24 Second Cause of Action

25 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law

26
27 64. Petitioners incorporate 99 1-29 above as though set forth here.

28 65. Boyle Heights Community Plan Map Footnote No. 2 limits the Project Site to use

29 as a hospital. The Project is a school, not a hospital, so the use approved is

30 inconsistent with the Community Plan, which is the portion of the Los Angeles

31 General Plan that is applicable to the Project Site.

32

33 66. The City has violated the Planning and Zoning Law, Gov. Code $$ 65000-

34 66499.58, by approving a project, including a zone change and Conditional

35 Use Permit, inconsistent with the applicable general plan.
