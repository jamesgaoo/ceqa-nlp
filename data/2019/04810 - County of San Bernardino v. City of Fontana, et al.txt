PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

EXHIBIT A

Petitioner and Plaintiff COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO ("County" or "Petitioner")
2. alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. The County brings this action to challenge the decision by the City of Fontana
5 ("City") to approve' the West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project ("Project"), an

6 approximately 3,500,000 square foot industrial logistics facility proposed to be located adjacent

7 to a residential community.

8 2. The Project Approvals re-zone a site designated for residential development to
.9 allow for the construction and operation of a massive industrial warehouse complex which will
10 have significant long-term environmental impacts on the entire region, but in particular the
11 adjacent community of Bloomington within unincorporated San Bernardino County.
12 3. The City's approval of the Project serves as the culmination of a seven-year
13 process requiring two recirculations of the draft EIR and beset by inadequate environmental
14 review in violation of the procedural and substantive mandates of the California Environmental

15 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections 21000, et seq., the California Planning

16 and Zoning Law ("PZL"), Government Code sections 65000, et seq., and the California
17 Subdivision Map Act ("SMA"), Government Code sections 66410, et seq. Foremost among these
18 concerns is the City's failure to properly prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the
•19 Project in violation of CEQA.

20 4. The Second Recirculated DEIR estimated that the Project would generate 6,382
21 new daily vehicle trips including heavy truck trips - that would be directed onto County-

22 maintained roadways twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, resulting in significant

23 immitigable air quality, greenhouse gas ("GHG"), noise and traffic impacts. In fact, the Project

24

25 The City's approvals include certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), and
26 approval of a Mitigation Monitoring Reporting Program ("MMRP"), a Statement of Overriding Considerations (*SOC*), a General Plan Amendment, Zone Change, Specific Plan Amendment, 27 Development Agreement, and Tentative Parcel Map (collectively, the "Project Approvals").
28

2
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

could generate a far greater volume of traffic, depending on the specific industrial uses developed
2 at the Project Site.

3 5. Throughout the seven-year history of the Project, the County made repeated

4 efforts to inform the City of its substantial concerns, including the environmental and practical
deficiencies with the Project, and proposed less impactful alternatives to the Project.
Nonetheless, the City failed to address these shortcomings or modify the Project.

7 6: The County identified a feasible alternative that would limit the number of heavy

8 truck trips on over-burdened County streets and reduce significant impacts of the Project, instead
9 of initially directing 100% of the truck trips on County streets at a rate far in excess of the street
10 capacities. The City ignored this alternative without consideration.

11 7. Instead, the City's attempt to resolve impacts to County facilities and residents by
12 incorporating unenforceable off-site mitigation improvements on County-owned streets only
13 serves to compound the litany of environmental deficiencies plaguing the Project.
14 8. The County, along with other governmental agencies, local residents, non-profit
15 public interest organizations and advocacy groups, State legislators and concerned members of
16 the public documented numerous violations of CEQA and other applicable laws during the
17 administrative proceedings leading up to the certification of the EIR and the City's approval of

18 the Project. Nevertheless, no changes were made to the Project.

19 9. The County also alerted the City of its violations of other laws, including
20 California's "open meeting" laws for its undisclosed revisions to the Project's Development
21 Agreement prior to the City Council meeting and failing to provide adequate notification to the
22 general public of these substantial revisions before considering and approving the Project.
23 Despite the County's request for transparency, the City failed to cure and correct this inadequate
24| disclosure to the public.

25 10. Because the City failed to comply with CEQA, among other violations of law, the

26 County petitions this Court for a writ of mandate, directing the City to vacate and set aside the
27 Project Approvals, require the City to fully comply with CEQA by preparing an adequate EIR
28 a and a supported SOC and other findings required by state law, and to restrain Real Party from

3
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 conducting any and all activities authorized under the Project Approvals to avoid the unnecessary

2 adverse environmental consequences of this Project.

3 PARTIES

11. Petitioner and Plaintiff the County of San Bernardino is a political and

5 geographical subdivision of the State of California with its principal offices located in the City of
6 San Bernardino, California. The Project's proposed truck traffic and the majority of the Project's
anticipated environmental impacts lie within the County's boundaries, and in particular, the
8 County's unincorporated community of Bloomington ("Bloomington"). The County also is a

9 responsible agency under CEQA as it has discretionary approval regarding off-site transportation
10 and utility improvements required for the Project.

11 12. Respondents and Defendants the City and its elected City Council are collectively
12 referred to in this Petition as the City. The City is the lead agency under CEQA and the City
13 Council constitutes the elected decision-making body of the City responsible under CEQA to
14 evaluate the environmental impacts of the Project and to review the Project's consistency with the
15 applicable General Plan and Specific Plan. The City issued the Project Approvals that are the
16 subject of this Petition and Complaint.

17 13. The County is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in
18 Interest UST-CB Partners, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of
19 business in Orlando, Florida and conducting business, vis a vis the Project, within the County.
20 The County is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that UST-CB Partners, L.P. is the
21 Project applicant. The County is informed and believes and thereon alleges that UST-SB

22 Partners, L.P.'s agent for service of process is CT Corporation System which resides at 111
23 Eighth Street, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10011.

24 14. The County is unaware of. the true names, identities and capacities, whether
25 individual, corporate, associate or otherwise of any Real Party in Interest sued herein as a DOE,

26 and the County will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities when
27 ascertained. Each of the Real Parties in Interest, including those identified by fictitious names,

28 1S, and at all times herein relevant was, acting for itself and/or as the agent, servant and employee

4
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

of each of their Co-Parties in Interest. For the purposes of this Petition, the term "Real Party in
Interest" or "Real Party" shall include cach of the DOE Real Parties in Interest.

15. The County has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law in that, unless this
Court grants the relief requested, the City's action will result in immediate and irreparable harm
to County residents and County facilities without proper consideration and application of policies
illustrated in CEQA to prevent environmental harms that present substantial risks to life and

7 property as described in this Petition. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could
adequately compensate the County for this harm.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 16. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Public Resources Code Sections 21167,

11 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5. This Court has the
12 authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the City to vacate and set aside its approval of the
13 Project and certification of the EIR for the Project under Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085
14 and 1094.5.

15 17. Venue for the CEQA actions contained in this Petition properly lies in the San
16 Bernardino County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 395(a), because

17 Respondents City and City Council have their principal place of business in the City of Fontana,
18 County of San Bernardino, and additionally pursuant to Section 393(b), because the primary
19 location of both the project and the majority of its associated impacts is the County. is
20 STATEMENT OF FACTS

21. 18. The West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project is proposed to develop and
22 use an approximately 291-acre vacant site at the base of Jurupa Hills ("Project Site"), originally

23 programmed for residential, school and open space uses, for an approximately 3,500,000 square
24 foot heavy truck-based industrial logistics facility for warehouse distribution uses.

25 19. The Project Site, located in Southeastern-most portion of the City, is surrounded
26 on three sides (north, east and south) by primarily low-density residential communities and on the
27 fourth side (west) by the undeveloped Jurupa Hills. The Project Site also shares its borders with
28 two neighboring jurisdictions: the County (Bloomington) on the east and north and the City of

5
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Jurupa Valley ("Jurupa Valley") on the south.

20. Bloomington is located directly adjacent on its western boundary to the City. An
established single-family residential neighborhood of Bloomington is located directly east of the
Project Site on Locust Avenue, extending from Jurupa Avenue on the north to 7th Street on the

south.

21. Much of the southwest part of Bloomington around the Project Site is zoned and
designated for low-density residential uses, from Tamarind Avenue on the western boundary to
Cedar Avenue on the cast, from Slover Avenue on the north down to the boundary Jurupa Valley
to the south. A number of elementary schools and child care centers are located a short distance
10 from the proposed Project site and located along proposed heavy truck routes for the Project.
11 22. Also affected from construction and operation of this Project would be existing
12 residential communities in the City and surrounding communities, including Bloomington and
13 Jurupa Valley. The Project would expose the County's residents and the general public to
14 significant risks to a human health without a full and accurate assessment of the environmental and

15. health impacts of the Project. Bypassing proper application of the CEQA, the PZL and the SMA
16 in violation of these statutes' plain language and purpose deprived these citizens of their right to
17 informed participation in the process and full understanding of the actual impacts caused by the
18 Project.

19 The Original Project

20 23. The Project Site initially was intended to provide approximately 1,154 residential
21 units via approval of the Valley Trails Specific Plan (*VTSP*) by the City,
22 24. Approved by the City Council on June 12, 2007, the VTSP was envisioned as a
23 master-planned community containing housing, a 13.8 acre elementary school, and private and
24 joint-use recreational facilities, including a 3.7 acre community recreation center, 20.4 acres of
25 neighborhood parks, and a comprehensive trail system part of almost 70 acres of dedicated open
26 space. A varying mix of detached and attached housing types, including townhomes, duplexes,
27 triplexes and single-family homes was programmed to meet a range of future homebuyers.
28 /11

PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

25. Under the VTSP approval, the Project Site contained a 2003 Fontana General Plan

2 land use designation of R-PC (Residential, Planned Community) consistent with the proposed

3 residential uses for the Project Site and the surrounding area.

4 26. However, subsequent to approval of the VTSP Project, Real Party's predecessor-
5 in-interest purchased the Project Site with the intention to develop the proposed industrial

6 logistics complex.

27. Despite the proposed change from residential to industrial uses at the Project Site,

8 the current 2015-2035 Fontana General Plan ("City General Plan Update"), the first
9 comprehensive update to the City's general plan in .15 years and recently approved by the City in
10 November 2018, continues to designate the Project Site for residential uses. Fo

11 28. The residential land use designation for the Project Site in the current City General
12 Plan Update is not consistent with the Project's industrial use.
13 The West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project

14 29. The Project, as first conceived in 2012 and as described above, proposes entirely
15 industrial uses over approximately 235 acres on nine non-contiguous parcels, with the remaining

16 56 acres of the surrounding hillside to the west set aside as open space.

17 30. Under the Project, Real Party would develop and operate the industrial warehouse
18 and logistics facility at the Project Site, including seven massive warehouse structures, ranging in
19 size from approximately 100,000 square feet to over 1,000,000 square feet each. The height of
20 the warehouse structures range from 30 feet to up to 75 feet.

21 31. The Project intends to direct 100% of its vehicular and heavy truck through
22 residential areas in the County and Jurupa Valley. This plan will result in significant
23 environmental consequences to these communities related to air quality, GHG emissions,
24 transportation impacts and noise impacts without proper analysis of the actual impact.
25 32. The Project has required three iterations of its Draft EIR ("DEIR"), releasing

26 DEIR in April 2014, a First Recirculated DEIR in December 2014 and a Second Recirculated

27 DEIR in February 2018.

28 111

7
PETITION'AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

33. During the public comment periods for each successive DEIR, multiple
commenters, including the County, provided public comments identifying the procedural
deficiencies and analytical errors in the EIR as well as highlighting the significant and
unmitigated negative environmental impacts of the Project on, among other things, air quality,
traffic, and noise. However, with each successive DEIR, the Project changed very little.
34. Following release of the initial DEIR in April 2014, nine commenters, including
the County, Jurupa Valley, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and representatives of
multiple labor unions, provided comments regarding deficiencies in the EIR for the Project,
including improper analysis related to air quality, GHG emissions, biological resources, and
1.5 transportation impacts and inadequate mitigation and alternatives. Based on the comments, the 11 City had to revise the analysis in the EIR, requiring a recirculation of the document.
12 35. Upon again receiving nine in-depth comments on the First Recirculated DEIR' in
13 December 2014, including a letter from Southern California Air Quality Management District
14 ("SCAQMD") calling into question the EIR's air quality assumption and mitigation measures, the
15 to City had to again revise the analysis in the EIR, requiring another recirculation of the document.
16 36. In February 2018, the City released a Second Recirculated DEIR, the third version

17 of the environmental document for the Project.

18 37. Nineteen commenters, including State and regional agencies, such as the
19 California Department of Transportation (*Caltrans"), the California Air Resources Board
20 ("CARB"), SCAQMD and the West Valley Water District, public interest organizations, such as
21 Sierra Club, Endangered Habitats League and Center for Biological Diversity, the County and
22 Jurupa Valley as well as multiple affected individuals provided comments, recommendations or
23 corrections regarding the Project.

24 38. Based on the multiple comments and recommendations received on the Second
25 Recirculated DEIR, the City was required to prepare significant additional analysis for the EIR,

26 including a revised Traffic Impact Analysis, Noise Study and a revised Health Risk Assessment.
27 Based on the additional studies and analysis undertaken, potential impacts of the Project
28 increased. However, the City failed to recirculate the DEIR.

8
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

39. Despite the numerous environmental documents released for the Project and the

2 multiple revisions to technical studies for the Project, the size and scope of the Project has not
3 decreased little since 2012 and the impact of the Project on the community and, in particular,

4 County facilities and residents reinains the same.

5 40. The 2018 Second Recirculated DEIR was accompanied by the Mitigation and
6 Monitoring Reporting Program ("MMRP*), which sets forth the Project's proposed mitigation

7 and monitoring requirements. Nonetheless, the City determined the Project would have non-

8 mitigatable significant and unavoidable environmental impacts on air quality, GHG emissions,
transportation and noise. The significant negative impacts of the Project are borne primarily by

10 the County.

11 41. The County provided detailed comments on each version of the DEIR, identifying
12 both legal and technical inadequacies with the Project, and included comments by individual
13 departments and divisions of the County, with expertise on various impacts, detailing the
14 shortcomings of the City's analysis of, among other things, transportation, land use, hydrology,
15 mitigation, alternatives and inadequate findings. The County's comments included, but are not

16 limited to the following:

17 (1) The Project Description is inconsistent and vague;

18 (2) The City failed to acknowledge recommendations from responsible

19 agencies, including the County;

20 (3) The EIR failed to apply proper environmental "baselines" which
21 precluded meaningful and adequate analysis of the Project's impacts
22 related to, among other things, traffic, biological resources (e.g,

23 burrowing owls), noise, air quality and GHG emissions;

24 (4) The DEIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental
25 impacts, including but not limited to impacts related to
26 transportation, air quality, GHG emissions, aesthetics, noise.

27 hydrology and land use.

28

9
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 (5) The DEIR failed to provide substantial evidence in support of its

2 conclusions and findings regarding the level of significance of the
3 Project's impacts and the efficacy of proposed mitigation measures;
4 (6) The stated CEQA objectives for the Project are overly narrow and
5 misleading;

6 (7) The DEIR improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation

7 measures and incorporated unenforceable mitigation measures;

8 (8) The DEIR failed to consider reasonable range of alternatives and
rejected feasible alternatives that would meet most Project
10 objectives;
11 (9) The DEIR improperly incorporated mitigation measures as Project
12 design features;
13 (10) The Final EIR inadequately responded to comments;
14 (11) The DEIR and FEIR were SO fundamentally flawed as to preclude
15 meaningful public review, failed to adequately serve as an

16 informational document, and should have been revised and

17 recirculated with additional information;

18 (12) The Project violates the PZL by failing to analyze the Project

19 with the appropriate City General Plan;

20 42. Other commenters, including various State agencies such as SCAQMD, Caltrans,
21 and CARB, and regional public interest organizations, such as Sierra Club and Center for

22 Community Action and Environmental Justice, were also highly critical of the Project, its DEIR

23 and its underlying studies.

24 43. On March 26, 2018, following public release of the Second Recirculated DEIR in

25 February 2018, the County submitted two letters to the City objecting to the approval of the

26 Project on numerous grounds, as described above.

27 44. In October 2018, the City circulated an 826-page Final EIR for the Project,
28 including responses to the 19 comments received, an errors and additions section and more

10
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 analysis, based on the comments. The City did not include the revised Traffic Impact Analysis or

2 the revised Health Risk Assessment with the Final EIR.

3 45. On December 17, 2018, after the City responded to the County's comments on the

4 DEIR, the County sent a third letter to the City because the Response to Comments' failure to
address important errors with the DEIR and implement recommendations by the County, a

6 responsible agency, regarding the Project's impacts.

7 46. On December 18, 2018, the Planning Commission of the City, held a public
8 hearing to consider the Project and the FEIR. The City Department of Planning staff provided an
9 Action Report to the Planning Commission and recommended the Planning Commission deny the
10 Project based on the "concerns raised by the San Bernardino County Land Use Department and
11 other agencies, and the findings" prepared for the Project. City Planning staff recommended the
12 Planning Commission "forward a recommendation to the City Council to deny the West Valley
13 Logistics Center Specific Plan project." (Emphasis added.)

14 47. City Planning staff based the recommendation of denial of the Project on the fact
15 that "the benefits of the proposed Project do not outweigh its significant and unavoidable traffic
16 impacts" and that "the project is inconsistent with the General Plan on multiple grounds."

17 48. At its December 18, 2018 meeting, by a vote of 3 a to 2, the Planning Commission
18 ordered City Planning staff to remove the recommendation of denial and bring the Project back to

19 the Planning Commission with an approval recommendation that the Planning Commission
20 | "recommend approval to the City Council of the proposed project until street improvements
21 along Locust Avenue, between Jurupa Avenue and Slover Avenue can be implemented consistent
22 with the Final Environmental Impact Report." The Planning Commission did not address the
23 City Planning Staff's conclusions regarding the Project's significant traffic impacts, its findings
24 in the SOC, or the Project's inconsistency with the General Plan.

25 49. On January 15, 2019, the Planning Commission held a second hearing on the
26 Project and recommended approval of the Project to the City Council with the condition that the
27 Project not be approved "until street improvements along Locust Avenue, between Jurupa
28 Avenue and Slover Avenue can be implemented consistent with the Final Environmental Impact

11
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Report." The Planning Commission by a 4-1 vote recommended approval of the Project to the

2 City Council. Again, the Planning Commission did not address the City Planning Staff's prior

3 conclusions regarding the Project's significant traffic impacts, its findings in the SOC, or the

4 Project's inconsistency with the General Plan.

50. On March 12, 2019, the City Council held a public hearing to consider the Project.

6 The City Planning Department Staff forwarded to the City Council the Planning Commission's
7 . recommendation to:

8 approve the West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project, including the FEIR, MMRP and SOC; General Plan Amendment 9 No. 11-026; Zone Change No. 11-016; Specific Plan Amendment
10° No. 11-003; Development Agreement No. 11-002; and Parcel Map No. 19156 (TPM No. 13-005), subject to all'conditions of approval to be adopted and mandated by the City Council, with the further 11 recommendation that the City Council not approve the Project until
12 street improvements consistent with mitigation measures TRA-1, 1A, 1B, 1C, ID, and 1E have been agreed to by various jurisdictions.
13
51,
14 City Planning Staff also revised the previously unreleased Development

15 Agreement ("DA") for the Project in order to ensure transportation-related mitigation measures

16 were met and implemented.

52.
17 As provided in the City's Action Report to the City Council, the DA included the

18 following additional provisions:

19 3.8 Provision of Real Property Interests by CITY.
(C) OWNER acknowledges that some of the off-site mitigation 20 measures and conditions of approval necessary for this Project are to be constructed within the County of San Bernardino's jurisdiction. Owner
21 shall exercise good faith efforts to acquire the real property interests necessary to comply with such mitigation measures and conditions of 22 approval. To the extent OWNER iS unable to acquire the real property interests necessary to implement the off-site mitigation measures and 23 conditions of approval, where the necessary real property is located within
24 the County of San Bernardino's jurisdiction, OWNER will work with the
County of San Bernardino for the acquisition of the real

25 property. OWNER acknowledges that the County of San Bernardino retains all discretion given to it by law as to all matters pertaining to the
26 voluntary acquisition of any property interests or the County of San Bernardino's consideration of and use of its power of eminent domain, including as to those findings and determinations described in Code of 27 Civil Procedure Section 1245.230, Nothing contained in this section shall

28 diminish or otherwise affect the provisions of section 3.9 hereof, regarding the satisfaction of conditions of approval and mitigation measures.

12
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

3.9 Transportation and Traffic Mitigation Measures.

7 OWNER acknowledges and agrees that the MMRP contains on-site. and off-site transportation improvements (see Mitigation Measures TRA-la, 3 TRA-1b, TRA-le, TRA-ld and TRA-le) (collectively hereinafter "Required Transportation Improvements") and that these Required 4 Transportation Improvements are an essential component of the Project and that CITY would not have approved this Project without adequate 5 assurance that the construction of these Required Transportation Improvements will occur. CITY and OWNER have been informed that the
6 County of San Bernardino has objected to the construction of the Required
7 Transportation Improvements. As indicated in the MMRP, and OWNER hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its successors in interest to the Property, that CITY shall not issue any discretionary or ministerial entitlements including, without limitation, any grading permits, building
9 permits, final map, or otherwise, for the Project until such time as the County of San Bernardino has agreed in writing to allow the Required
10 Transportation Improvements to be constructedas necessary in its jurisdiction, or accepts required payment of development impact fees or
11 fair share payments, and all required off-site property interests necessary for the construction of the Required Transportation Improvements have
12 been acquired by OWNER, County of San Bernardino, or CITY.

13 53. Multiple letters, including a' letter from the County dated March 11, 2019, were
14 submitted on the Project, and multiple individuals, including individuals representing California
15 State Senator Connie Leyva, California State Assemblymember Eloise Gomez Reyes, California
16 State Assemblymember Freddie Rodriguez, Jurupa Valley, the Center for Community Action and
17 Environmental Justice, local labor unions, and residents in the surrounding community, spoke at

18 the hearing on the Project.

19 54. Despite the outpouring of opposition to the Project and its environmental impacts,

20 the City approved the Project and certified the FEIR.
21 55. Throughout this process, hundreds of public comments have been submitted on
22 this Project, the vast majority of which indicated opposition to the Project.

23 56. The County is informed and believes that the City also approved a revised
24 Development Agreement at the March 12, 2019 City Council hearing but did not inform the
25 public of significant changes made to the DA provisions provided above.

26 57. The City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the Project's EIR on or

27 about March 14, 2019.

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 58. The County has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting written and

3 oral comments and testimony on the Project to Respondents requesting compliance with CEQA,
4 including the completion of full and adequate environmental review. All issues raised in this

5 Petition were raised before Respondent by the County, other members of the public, and/or public
6 agencies prior to approval of the Project.

7 59. The County has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior

8 service of a notice upon Respondents indicating their intent to file this Petition. Proof of Service

9 of this notification is attached as Exhibit A.

10 60. The County has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-
11 captioned proceeding pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2).
12 61. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
13 21167 and 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 15112 (hereinafter, "CEQA Guidelines").

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violation of California Environmental Quality Act
16 (Public Resources Code §§ 21000, et seq.)
17 62. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
18 above, inclusive.

19 63. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decisionmakers to document

20 and consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made
21 and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in
22 public decisions." Pub. Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (d). CEQA "was intended to be

23 interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within
24 the reasonable scope of the statutory language." CEQA Guidelines § 15003, subd. (f), citing
25 Friends of Mammoth v. Bd. of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247.

26 64. An EIR is, above all, an informational document. The purpose of an EIR is to
27 "provide public agencies and the public in general with detailed information about the effect
28 which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment." Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.

•14
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

65. The EIR should be prepared with "a sufficient degree of analysis to provide
2 decisionmakers with information which enables them to make decision which intelligently takes
UJ account of environmental consequences." CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.

66. CEQA further requires the lead agency to adequately consider alternatives to the
Project, to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, to determine that proposed
6 mitigation measures will or will not be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the
Project's significant environmental impacts, and, if necessary, to make an adequate SOC for
those significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable. Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002.1,

10 subd. (b), 21100, subd. (b)(3); CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15092, 15093, and 15126.6.

67.

11 CEQA also requires a cooperative process of analysis followed by responsive

12 modification to the project based on public participation and comments from responsible
agencies. CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15201, 15204, and 15132.

13 68.

14 For the following reasons, the City's approval of the Project failed to comply with

15 CEQA, was arbitrary and capricious, not supported by the evidence, and not in accordance with
applicable law:
16 Failure to Provide an Adequate Description of the Project

17 69. CEQA requires an accurate, stable and consistent description of the proposed
18  project. CEQA Guidelines, § 15124.

19 70. The EIR for the Project fails to provide an accurate, stable and consistent
20|| definition of the Project and fails to describe the true
21 scope of the Project, precluding an accurate
depiction of the Project's impacts on the environment.

22 71.

23 The Project Description is unclear about the actual use of the Project Site. The

24 EIR only refers to the Project as a "logistics center including warehouse distribution and support
office uses within warchouse buildings." However, different types and sizes of various
25 warehouse structures have different uses and result in different impacts on the environment
26

27 related to transportation, noise and air quality and GHG emissions. The Project Description

28 mischaracterizes the nature and classification of the warehouse buildings to be constructed at the
Project Site.

15
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

72. The City's failure to describe the 1,000,000 square foot warehouse building as a

2 more intensive and higher trip-generating "Fulfillment Center", instead of a "High-Cube

3 Transload and Short-Term Storage Warehouse", generally reserved for smaller facilities, creates

4 cascading effects by underestimating impacts throughout the analysis in the EIR.

5 73. Without more detail about the actual uses involved in the Project, the
6 environmental analysis cannot be. accurately provided to the decisionmakers and the general
public, and, thus is prejudicial to public review and an accurate analysis of the Project's
8  environmental impacts.
9 74. The Project Description also fails to provide the proposed operating hours for the
10 Project. Although the EIR intermittently references that the operation will be ongoing twenty-
11 four hours, seven days a week, it does not provide any guidance as to peak hours of operation,
12 and what structures will be used or how many trucks will be operating throughout different times.
13 of the day or night. It therefore becomes impossible to properly ascertain the true environmental
14 impacts of the Project when there is an entirely unrestricted project operation.

15 75. The Project Description indicates the Project will be built out "as the market

16 demands." However, there is no completion or final built-out date provided in the Project

17 Description. With no schedule for the orderly construction of the Project components, the public

18 is left with a "moving target" on how the environmental impacts of the Project will actually affect

19 them.

20 76. The Project proposes numerous off-site infrastructure improvements, which are
21 actual mitigation measures, as part of the Project Description. These improvements are located
22 on County roadways and other facilities outside of the Project Site and are not located within the

23 City of Fontana.

24 77. Further, these off-site improvements are unenforceable, have not been approved

25 by the County, a Responsible Agency, and cannot be considered part of the Project without

26 confirmed assurances from the County as to feasibility of such improvements. This is precisely
27 the type of amorphous project description impermissible under CEQA.

28

16
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Failure to Properly Include Responsible Agencies

2 78. CEQA. defines a responsible agency as "a public agency, other than the lead

3 agency which has responsibility for carrying out or approving a project." Pub. Resources Code, §

4 21069.

5 79. The term "responsible agency" includes all public agencies other than the lead
6 agency which have discretionary approval over the project. CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.

7 80. The County is a local public agency with discretionary authority over the use and
8 improvements of its streets and related facilities.

81. Under CEQA, Lead Agencies are encouraged to "[c]onsult[ with state and local
10 responsible agencies before and during preparation of an environmental impact report so that the
11 document will meet the needs of all the agencies which will use it." CEQA Guidelines, § 15006,
12 subd. (g).

13 82. In the unincorporated Bloomington Community, the County maintains the streets
14 and associated facilities proposed as truck routes for the Project. The County would be required
15 to approve Real Party's request to widen and/or modify the streets proposed as mitigation for the
16 Project's significant transportation impacts. In addition, the County would need to decide

17 whether to file eminent domain actions for certain parcels to widen the streets along the Project's
18 proposed truck routes if the property owners do not agree to the sale of their property interests.
19 Therefore, the County is a responsible agency for the Project with to respect to approvals of off-site
20 infrastructure improvements proposed within the County as required by mitigation measures
21 outlined in the EIR.

22 83. The County was not listed as a responsible agency for the Project when the DEIR
23 was circulated. While the City and the County have held meetings and exchanged
24 correspondence regarding the Project, the County was deprived of its ability to act as responsible
25 agency, for example, its right to request data and information to be fully informed regarding the
26 Project's environmental impacts. Pub. Resources Code, § 21160.
27 84. The City also ignored its obligation to integrate CEQA review with the
28 requirements of the County's General Plan and other applicable governing documents related to

17
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the County's jurisdiction, and gave little consideration to the County's comments,
2 recommendations and needs:

3 85. The City failed to require Real Party to provide a copy of the certified, final EIR to

4 the County, as responsible agency. CEQA Guidelines, § 15095.

5 86. The City's failure to properly include the County as a responsible agency was

6 arbitrary, capricious and not in accordance with law:
7 Failure to Develop and Apply Proper Environmental Baselines

8 87. Under CEQA, an EIR is deficient without an adequately developed baseline
because the true impact of the project cannot be disclosed. CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15125,
10 15126.2, subd. (a).

11 88. The Draft EIR failed to include an in-depth analysis of conditions as they exist
12 today to allow the public and responsible agencies to understand the potential future impacts of
13 the Project associated with air quality, GHG emissions, biological resources, noise and traffic.
14 This lack of baseline data prevents the EIR from being an adequate informational document for
15 decision making by precluding the EIR from fully evaluating the Project's environmental
16 impacts.

17 89. The Draft EIR established the environmental baseline for the Project based only

18 on a limited biological survey of certain portions of the site regarded as most likely to contain

19 species in 2013 and 2014. The survey was conducted via meandering transects and focused on

20 the edges of the Project Site. Large portions of the site, apparently including the bulk of the area
21 where construction will occur, were not considered, because they were deemed unlikely to
22 possess sensitive species, even though the special-status wildlife species, including Cooper's
23 Hawk and burrowing owls were observed, and the potential for birds to nest in omamental trees

24 to be. removed during construction represents a potential direct impact to sensitive species.
25 Moreover, the species lists generated by the survey are based only on incidental observations,
26 making it difficult to ascertain with certainty what species are present.
27 90. It is therefore difficult to be certain what sensitive species might be present on the
28 site prior to the commencement of the Project. Without a satisfactory environmental baseline, it

18
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 is impossible to judge potential significant impacts or generate adequate mitigation measures.

2 91. The Draft EIR fails to properly quantify baseline GHG emissions. The Draft EIR
3 "models" the baseline emissions by relying on generic emissions factors in CalEEMod (an air
quality model). Mere projections of baseline information are insufficient for baseline analysis.

5 92. The Draft EIR fails to explain how even its adequate modeling of baseline

6 emissions was done, simply stating the values in a summary table, with "no discussion or

7 explanation. Although some information can be gleaned from technical modeling files buried in

8 the appendices, such information is unintelligible to the layperson.

9 93. With regards to Noise, the City's use of the Traffic Impact Analysis to develop the
10 baseline is not a reliable predictor of transportation impacts because it is based on mere

11 projections of baseline information. This is insufficient under CEQA.

12 94. The Draft EIR does not provide substantial evidence to support the
13 baseline/existing conditions of the Project Site from which to analyze the Project's impacts and
14 therefore fails as an informational document in violation of CEQA.

15 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts

16 95. CEQA requires that an EIR disclose and analyze all possible significant
17 environmental impacts of a proposed project. Pub. Resources Code, § 21100, subd. (b)(1);

18 CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.

19 96. The EIR failed to address or inadequately analyze impacts, including but not
20 limited to the deficiencies described below.

21 97. As a result, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its
22 discretion by failing to fully disclose and analyze the Project's environmental impacts.

23 98. The EIR's methodological errors related to the Project's transportation impacts

24 affect the entire analysis, and underestimate the "scope and magnitude" of the Project's

25 significant and unavoidable transportation environmental impacts.

26 99. The City's improper decision to analyze the 1,000,000 square foot warehouse
27 building as a "High-Cube Transload and Short-Term Storage Warehouse" instead of the more
28 intensive and higher trip-generating "Fulfillment Center" is the most obvious methodological

19
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 error in the Transportation analysis.

2 100. Without any guarantee or legal constraint that the proposed warehouse buildings

3 will ultimately be constructed with the use and size exactly as analyzed in the EIR, the Project

4 could result in a far more significant impact than concluded in the environmental documents for
this Project.

6 101. The City's Transportation analysis also suffers from unsupportable assumptions of
heavy truck trip distributions along proposed truck routes. The 2017 Traffic Impact Analysis'

8 assumptions incorrectly affect the analysis of the actual transportation impact and may result in

9 new and or more severe transportation impacts when corrected.

10 102. The City's decision to adopt LOS E minimum acceptable threshold for the Slover

11 Avenue and Cedar Avenue intersection, in lieu of the LOS D threshold typically implemented by

12 the County pursuant to the County General Plan's Circulation and Infrastructure Element,
13 improperly affects the results of the transportation analysis and determines no impact when in all
14 likelihood, a significant impact would occur.

15 103. The City's revised Health Risk Assessment, based on an updated Project Traffic
16 Impact Analysis, and using the proper California Office of Environmental Health Hazard

17 Assessment Guidelines (2015) which account for age-weighted factors for early life exposures,

18 not only improperly calculated the risk the surrounding community but required recirculation in

19 and of itself.

20 104. Many commenters, including the SCAQMD, suggested feasible mitigation

21 measures to reduce air quality and GHG impacts, however, the Project failed to implement these

22 measures.

23 105. Regardless of whether the cancer risk from the Project is environmentally

24 significant or not, and irrespective of the significant and unavoidable air quality and GHG

25 impacts indicated in the environmental documents for the Project, the EIR fails as an

26 informational document because it fails to provide detailed analysis regarding the Project's

27 impacts to adequately inform the public of risk. The numbers provided in the EIR do not

28 translate the risk into "potential health impacts" or give a "sense of the nature and magnitude of

20 PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the 'health and safety problems caused by the physical changes' resulting from the Project."
106. The Project introduces massive warehouse buildings, up to 75 feet in height, in
what was initially proposed to be restricted-height residential zone adjacent to a single-family
residential neighborhood. No other warchouses or buildings as large are currently located in this
5 immediate area.

6 107. The EIR fails as an informational document as it fails to include consistent and
accurate viewpoints from which to assess a potential impact. The EIR completely disregarded

8 the most important viewpoint from the residential area east of the Project looking west at the
Project and the mountains beyond. This neighborhood would be the most affected area from an
10 aesthetics standpoint.
11 108 Renderings within the EIR fail to accurately describe a potential impact. These
12 renderings which purport to simulate the visual impacts of the development are clearly inaccurate

13 (they show the top of the 40-foot building as the maximum height required for clearance when in

14 fact the Project buildings may be up to 75-feet tall) and do not demonstrate how the development
15 will actually be perceived due to misleading angles and lines of sight.

16 109. The EIR entircly fails to analyze the Project's visual impacts from light and glare.
17 The EIR admits the Project's operations would be ongoing twenty-four hours day, seven days a
18 week, and that the buildings, street and loading areas would introduce additional sources of light
19 and glare. However, it fails to properly analyze whether this light would have a significant

20 impact, and instead summarily concludes, without any substantial evidence to support its claim,
21 the landscaping and screening wall will mitigate the impacts.

22 110. The EIR improperly categorizes "sensitive receptors" by limiting the definition of

23 a sensitive receptor to only "residences, schools, hospitals, and similar uses." The EIR fails to

24 consider numerous sensitive receptors directly adjacent to the proposed truck routes, including
25 child day care centers and assisted living facilities. Failure to consider the proximity of sensitive
26 receptors to primary truck routes was clearly erroneous and thus the EIR's conclusion of a less

27 than significant impact is not supported by substantial evidence.
28 ///

21
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

111. The EIR's failure to properly classify the types of warehouses to be constructed at

2 the Project Site also renders invalid the noise analysis. Should the Project ultimately be built-out

3 to a include a Fulfillment Center, the vehicle and heavy truck trips would be expected to increase
from than analyzed in the EIR, thereby increasing noise impacts associated with that traffic.

112. The City also fails to consider valid and practical mitigation measures and
6 insufficiently responded to concerns regarding mitigation measures related to noise, including:
prohibiting truck traffic between 11th and 7th street to reduce potential operation and traffic

8 related noise impacts to the Bloomington residential community located east of the Project Site

9 and relocating access to buildings 1 and 2 north of the Bloomington residential community
10 located east of the Project Site instead of north of 11th street along Locust Avenue. The failure to

11 consider these practical and potentially noise-reducing mitigation measures in the EIR is violation
12 of CEQA.

13 113. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on hydrology and
14 drainage. Despite the County's multiple requests and recommendations related to potential
15 downstream impacts from runoff caused by the Project, the EIR continues to improperly analyze
16 this potentially significant impact.

17 114. The EIR's Hydrology Study does not properly address significant drainage issues
18 related to the site and surrounding community. The EIR's conclusory statements that the
19 Project's "100-year flow would be reduced to 90 percent of the existing 25-year peak flow rate"
20 do not provide substantial evidence or meet the requirements of CEQA when it is unclear when
21 appropriate storm drains and other drainage features would be installed and operational as part of
22 the Project.

23 115. Neither the EIR nor the underlying Hydrology Study identify when storm drains

24 will be constructed. iS There is no analysis regarding downstream impacts during construction that

25 could occur until such time as the proposed storm drains are operational.

26 116. The EIR fails to acknowledge or analyze its consistency with the City's recently
27 certified General Plan Update. The City released the City General Plan Updäte Draft EIR prior to
28 the release of the Project Final EIR, and certified the City General Plan Update prior to public

22
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

hearing on the Project. The EIR's failure to acknowledge and analyze the goals and policies of
the Draft City General Plan Update, despite its release prior to circulation of the Project's Final
EIR constitutes procedural violation of CEQA for failure to analyze the Project's consistency

4 with the most updated planning document in the City.

117. The EIR failed to properly analyze impacts to biological resources caused by the
Project. The EIR fails to properly analyze impacts to burrowing owl communities, Cooper's

7 Hawk, as well as multiple other species.

118. In addition, the EIR's conclusion that wildlife movement between the Jurupa Hills

on the west and Rattlesnake Mountain on the east will not be impacted is erroneous and without
10 substantial evidence.

11 119. •Mitigation measures proposed to reduce biological resources impacts are wholly
12 inadequate to reduce significant impacts to biological resources.
13 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Cumulative Impacts

14 120. CEQA requires an EIR for a proposed project consider reasonably foresecable
15 cumulative impacts from a project. Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100; CEQA Guidelines, § 15130.

16 The EIR fails to provide an adequate cumulative impacts assessment for the Project.
17 121. The EIR does not adequately assess the cumulative impacts on transportation,

18 noise biological resources, air quality, GHG emissions and utilities and fails to include all other

19 closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects.
20 Failure to Adequately Prepare an Alternatives Analysis

21 122. CEQA requires an EIR to examine a range of reasonable alternatives that would

22 feasibly obtain most of the project objectives, but avoid or substantially lessen any significant

23 adverse effects of the project. CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6.

24 123. CEQA requires an EIR include a reasonable range of alternatives for a proposed a
25 project that will foster informed decision-making and public participation. CEQA Guidelines.

26 § 15126.6.

27 124. The City erroneously rejects feasible alternatives as infeasible. The City failed to
28 make findings supported by substantial evidence of infeasibility of project alternatives to reduce

23
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Project's significant and unavoidable impacts related transportation, air quality, GHG

2 emissions, and noise while accomplishing most project objectives, including proposals made by

3 the County. In particular, transportation impacts may be feasibly avoided by incorporating

4 additional alternative truck routes entering and exiting the Project Site.

5 125. The EIR also fails to consider a reasonable range of alternatives by improperly
6 dismissing feasible alternatives, including those suggested by the publie, and relying upon an
7 long, but improperly selected list of Project objectives to justify the elimination of feasible

8 alternatives.

126. The EIR does not include an alternative which requires heavy truck trips for
10 inbound and outbound Project traffic to use only City streets, thus localizing impacts to the City.
11 The failure to identify an alternative that avoids the initial direction of 100% of Project traffic on
12 County streets, and uses an alternative western access route via Alder Avenue in and out of the

13 Project Site as provided in the VTSP and the City General Plan Update, is not supported by
14 substantial evidence. By modifying the Project to include the Alder Avenue extension, the
15 transportation, air quality, GHG and noise burden on the communities east and north of the

16 Project undoubtedly would be reduced and/or eliminated.

17 127. Morcover, the Project's reliance on economic factors to determine infeasibility of
18 alternatives, particularly Alternative 2 (No Project/Build VTSP) and Alternative 5 (Reduced
19 Intensity Logistics Center), violates CEQA requiring the EIR to include an economic analysis to

20 provide substantial evidence of infeasibility.

21 128. CEQA requires that an environmentally superior alternative be identified among

22 the alternatives considered. When the "No Project" alternative is the environmentally superior

23 alternative, CEQA requires the EIR identify an environmentally superior alternative among the

24 other alternatives. CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6, subd. (e).

25 129. By developing two "No Project" alternatives, including Alternative 2, the build-
26 out of the VTSP, the City intentionally avoids CEQA mandates to identify a truly feasible
27 environmentally superior project.
28 ///

24
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

130. Build-out of the VTSP is not a "No Project" alternative, but instead a feasible

2 alternative to the Project. This alternative should have been analyzed as such, and not as a "No

3 Project" alternative.

4 131. When analyzed correctly, Alternative 2 (No Project/VTSP), not the Alternative 5

5 (Reduced Intensity Logistics Center) as selected by the City, would be the environmentally

6 superior alternative. While both the Reduced Intensity Alternative and the No Project/Buildout

7 of VTSP Alternative both would include eight reduced impacts, the Buildout. of the VTSP

8 Alternative would eliminate both significant - and unavoidable noise impacts as well as the

9 significant and unavoidable transportation impact (three impacts eliminated in total), while the
10 Reduced Intensity Alternative would not eliminate any significant and unavoidable impacts.

11 132. The Project's Selection of Alternative 5 (Reduced Intensity Logistics Center) is
12 entirely incorrect and prejudicially skews the analysis and consideration of the alternatives by the

13 public and decisionmakers.
14 Improper Use of Project Design Features in Lieu of Mitigation Measures

15 133. CEQA requires an EIR include, among other things, a detailed statement setting

16 forth "[a]ll significant effects on the environment of the proposed project" and "[m]itigation
17 measures proposed to minimize significant effects on the environment.3 Pub. Resources Code,

18 § 21100, subd. (b).

19 134. If a project may result in a potentially significant impact which may be reduced by
20 one or more mitigation measures, this triggers the need to adopt an enforceable mitigation
21 monitoring program. CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (d).

22 135. The EIR's incorporation of numerous project design features, provided as specific
23 plan features in the EIR, in lieu of mitigation measures for many potential impacts, blur the line
24 between actual project design elements and mitigation measures, thereby defeating the purpose of

25 CEQA in analyzing the environmental impact of a Project on the environment. The EIR's
26 improper incorporation of mitigation measures prior to analysis to foreclose the possibility of
27 significant impacts is precisely the type of action CEQA is designed to avoid.

28

25
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The EIR Includes Improper Mitigation

2 136. Once significant project impacts are identified, CEQA requires an EIR to include
mitigation measures to minimize, reduce and avoid such impacts. Pub. Resources Code, § 21002;

4 CEQA Guidelines, § 15126, subd. (e).

5 137. The EIR fails to adequately identify, analyze and/or adopt all feasible mitigation

6 measures and/or alternatives that would minimize direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on the
7 l environment and nearby communities affected by the Project.

8 138. The Project does not include sufficient mitigation measures to reduce significant

9 and unavoidable air quality impacts despite the SCAQMD's recommendations nor reduce

10 significant GHG emissions, transportation, noise and biological resources impacts despite the

11 County's recommendations and other commenters and responsible agency recommendations.
12 The Project Improperly Defers Mitigation

13 139. The County and other commenters indicated the EIR's analysis of and mitigation

14 for the Project's impacts on hydrology and water quality were inadequate for many reasons.
15 140. The EIR improperly defers impact analysis and the development of mitigation
16 measures in contravention of CEQA's requirements that mitigation measures be clearly defined

17 and enforceable.

18 The Final EIR Inadequately Responds to Comments

19 141. The City is required to provide a "good faith, reasoned analysis" in response to

20 comments on the EIR; "[c]onclusory -statements unsupported by factual information will not

21 suffice." CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (b).

22 142. a When a comment raises a significant environmental issue, the EIR must address

23 the comment "in detail giving reasons why" the comment was not accepted." CEQA Guidelines,

24 § 15088, subd. (c).

25 143. The City failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by the County, other

26 members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, the responses given to numerous comments
27 are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-responsive, contrary to the requirements of
28 CEQA. The responses often ignored or improperly dismissed identification of flaws in the City's

26
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 analysis and suggestions of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.

2 144. For example, the EIR failed to adequately address comments that the Project

3 consider Caltrans' Complete Street Implementation Action Plan 2.0 to reduce traffic congestion.

4 145. The City failed to provide an adequate rationale for rejecting alternatives to the

5 Project proposed by the County and other commenting agencies and persons. By failing to

6 provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed alternatives, Respondents failed to

7 proceed in the manner required by law.
8 The Statément of Overriding Considerations Is Not Supported By Substantial Evidence
146. Where no feasible mitigation measures or alternatives are available to avoid or
10 reduce a project's significant environmental effects, CEQA allows an agency approving a project
11 to adopt a SOC that describes how specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or

12 other benefits outweigh the significant environmental effects. CEQA Guidelines, § 15093.
13 147. In approving the Project and certifying the EIR, the City concluded that the Project
14 would result in significant unavoidable impacts. The City adopted a SOC for. the Project,
15 -asserting findings that specific considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures or
16 alternatives identified in the EIR for the Project's unavoidable significant impacts and 'that

17 economic, social, and other factors justify approval of the Project despite these unavoidable
18 significant impacts.

19 148. The SOC inaccurately estimates impacts to, among other things, hydrology,

20 biological resources, and aesthetics. The City's adoption of a SOC that purportedly justifies the
21 Project's significant adverse impacts on the environment is not supported by substantial evidence

22 and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law. Similarly, the finding that no

23 feasible alternatives or additional mitigation measures exist to eliminate or reduce the remaining

24 significant is effects is not supported by substantial evidence.

25 149. a As a result of the foregoing defects, City prejudicially abused its discretion by

26 adopting findings that do not comply with CEQA's requirements and approving the Project in
27 reliance thereon. Accordingly, both City's certification of the EIR and City's approval of the

28 Project must be set aside.

27
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of California Environmental Quality Act - Failure to Recirculate the EIR)

3 150. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

4 above.

151. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR to after a draft

6 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be amended and
recirculated for public review and comment.

8 152. Respondents added substantial changes and new information to the EIR after
circulation of the DEIR -- including, but not limited to, analyses and documents relating to air
10 quality impacts, transportation impacts, additional mitigation measures, and additional studies-

11 but prior-to the City's March 12, 2019 decision to certify the EIR as compliant with CEQA.
12 153. Despite the changes, Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR or any portion of
13 the EIR as required by CEQA, nor did Respondents provide this additional analysis to the public

14 for review and comment prior to certification of the EIR.

15 154. As a result of Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, the public and other
16 public agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the

17 approved Project, its substantial adverse environmental consequences, and the new information
18 regarding other unanalyzed environmental effects of the Project.

19 155. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Respondents failed to proceed in the
20 manner required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by
21 substantial evidence.

22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act -
24 Findings Not Supported by Substantial Evidence)

25 156. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

26 above.

27 157. CEQA requires that an agency's findings for approval of a project be supported by

28 substantial evidence in the administrative record and requires that an agency provide an

*, 28
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

explanation of how the record evidence supports the conclusions that it has reached. CEQA

2 Guidelines, §§ 15070, 15071.

3 158. The City violated CEQA and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by

4 adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law in that they are not supported by
substantial evidence in the record.

6 159. The determination that alternatives to the Project that would avoid or lessen the

7 significant impacts are infeasible or otherwise is not reasonable.

160. The determination that various mitigation measures that would avoid or lessen the

9 significant impacts of the Project are infeasible is not reasonable.

10 161. No substantial evidence supports City's findings adopted pursuant to CEQA,
11 including the findings that the Project will produce less than significant environmental impacts,
12 on hydrology, aesthetics, land use, and biological resources have been mitigated to less than
13 significant levels. CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION*

15 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)
16 162. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
17 above.

18 163. The City's approval of the Project violates the PZL, California's set of laws
19 pertaining to the regulation of land uses by local governments including: the general plan
20 requirement, specific plans, subdivisions, and zoning. The PZL requires each city to prepare and
21 adopt "…a comprehensive, long term general plan for the physical development of the…city, and
22 of any land outside its boundaries.." Gov. Code, § 65300. The Project approved by the City is

23 incompatible with the former 2003 City General Plan as well as the current City General Plan

24 Update.

25 164. The general plan is a jurisdiction's "blue print" for future development to which

26 all other land use decisions must conform. Accordingly, any City decision affecting land use and
27 development, including issuance of the Project Approvals for the Project, must be consistent with

28 the general plan, a requirement known as "vertical consistency".

29
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

165. The Project is inconsistent with the 2003 City General Plan, the applicable

2 General Plan document when the environmental review process began for the Project, because

3 the Project will conflict with numerous General Plan policies, including, but not limited to:

4 a. policies within the Land Use Element,

5 b. policies within the Circulation Element,

6 C. policies within the Air Quality Element

d. policies within the Noise Element

8 e policies with the Conservation Element

9 166.. These issues were not properly addressed by the EIR as the Project is wholly
10 inconsistent with the 2003 City General Plan. In this location, the Project is not compatible with
11 the General Plan and thus violates the PZL.

12 167. The EIR also fails to analyze the Project for consistency with the recently-enacted
13 City General Plan Update. The City General Plan Update and draft EIR for the City General Plan

14 Update, which has been in a development process since 2015, was released for public review on
15 9, June 9, 2018, prior to completion of the Final EIR for the Project.

16 168. The City General Plan Update was approved on November 13, 2018, prior to the
17 City Council hearing for the Project. Despite being the operative General Plan document for the
18 City, the Project did not analyze the Project for consistency with the City General Plan Update

19 nor amend the City General Plan Update.

20 169. Either way, the Project suffers from severe PZL defects: While unclear in the
21 resolutions of approval for the Project, if the Project amended the 2003 General Plan, with which
22 it was analyzed for consistency, the Project violates the PZL as the 2003 General was not the

23 operative General Plan at the time of approval of the Project. Moreover, if the Project amended
24 the City General Plan Update, the Project violates the PZL as the Project was not analyzed for
25 consistency with the City General Plan Update.

26 170. Nonetheless, the Project is inconsistent with the City General Plan Update because
27 the proposed Project will conflict with numerous General Plan policies, including, but not limited
28 to:

30
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. policies within the Land Use, Zoning and Urban Development Element,
2 b. policies within the Community Mobility Circulation Element,
3 C. policies within the Sustainability and Resilience Element

4 d. policies within the Noise and Safety Element

5 e. policies within the Housing Element

6 171. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner

7 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial

8 evidence. Accordingly, approval of the Project must be set aside.
9 The Project Is Inconsistent With the City's Regional Housing Needs Allocation Requirements,

10 172. Califomnia cities are required to identify in the Housing Element of their General
11 Plans how they will meet their fair share of needed housing in a Regional Housing Needs

12 Allocation ("RHNA").

13 173. The RHNA requires that a community's plan provides for housing units through
14 appropriate zoning and other efforts. The City's RHNA share for 2014-2021 is 5,977 new
15 housing units (including 40% or 2,416 affordable units)
16 174. The Project required the City to re-zöne 291 acres currently programed for
17 residential uses and originally proposed for 1,154 housing units. Due to the large number of

18 proposed housing units eliminated due to the rezone of Project Site, the City is in violation of

19 state law for failing to account for sufficient sites to provide appropriate zoning for residential

20 uses to meet its RHNA numbers. Accordingly, Respondents did not proceed in the manner
21 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial

22 evidence. Accordingly, approval of the Project must be set aside.

23 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violation of the Subdivision Map Act)

25 175. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

26 above.

27 176. Respondents' action in granting Real Party a tentative parcel map constitutes a

28 prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law

31
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and failed to support its decision by substantial evidence, as follows:

2 d. The proposed map is not consistent with the City's 2003 General Plan or the

3 City's General Plan Update;

4 b. The findings that the site is physically suitable for the type and density of

5 development proposed and the type of improvements will not cause serious

6 public health problems is not supported by substantial evidence.

7 177. As a result of Respondents' violations of the SMA, the County as well as members

8 of the general public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and

9 the Project is commenced in the absence of a full and adequate recirculated EIR, and absent
10 compliance with all other applicable provisions of SMA.

11 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

13 178. The County hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

14 above.

15 179. The actions of the City in approving the Project and of Real Party in beginning
16 construction of the Project covered by the approval violate the CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines,

17 the SMA and the City General Plan Update. Therefore, the County is entitled to declaratory and

18 equitable relief to restrain said violations.

19 180. An actual and present controversy now exists between the County, the City and

20 Real Party in that the County maintains the approval of the Project violates CEQA and the CEQA
21 Guidelines, the PZL, the SMA and the City General Plan, including the City General Plan

22 Update, and the City's Municipal Code. City and Real Party maintain the approval was properly

23 granted.

24 181. The County therefore seeks a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying

25 the EIR and approving the Project violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, the SMA

26 and the City General Plan, including the City General Plan Update, and the City's Municipal

27 Code.

28///

32
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

182. Unless enjoined and restrained by 'order of the Court from issuing the Project
Approvals, issuing any further ministerial permits or otherwise approving the Project, City will
permit the Project without proper environmental oversight, leading to the significant
environmental harm. Unless enjoined and restrained, Real Party will cause significant impacts to
the County.

0 183. CEQA is intended to inform decisionmakers and the public of potentially
significant environmental impacts before approvals for projects are given. Unless the City is
enjoined and restrained pending CEQA compliance, the public and decision makers will be

9 deprived of crucial information, and the public will be robbed of its statutory right to participate
10 in such considerations.
11 184. The County therefore prays for preliminary and permanent injunction against the
12 City and Real Parties and any of their agents from commencing work upon the Project unless and
13 until such time as City complies with their mandatory duties under CEQA and the CEQA
14 Guidelines, the PZL, the SMA, the City General Plan, including the City General Update, and the
15 City's Municipal Code.

16 185. The County has no adequate remedy other than that prayed for herein in that the
17 subject matter is unique and monetary damages would therefore be inadequate to fully
18 compensate the County for the consequences of the City's and Real Party's actions in their
19 continued failure to comply with the Government Code, CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, the
20| PZL, the SMA, the City General Plan, including the City's General Plan Update, and the City's
21 Municipal Code with respect to the Project. The County therefore seeks, and is entitled to,
22 injunctive relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, et seq., and to a stay, preliminary
23 and/or permanent injunction.

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 1. That the Court issue a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

26 1094.5 and 1085, ordering the City to set aside the Project Approvals and further
27 ordering City to take no further action that is not in full compliance with provisions

28 of the Government Code, CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, the PZL, the SMA,

33
PETITION AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the City General Plan, including the City General Plan Update, and City's

2 Municipal Code;

3 2. That the Court issue preliminary and permanent injunctive and declaratory relief to

4 prevent commencement of any construction of the Project;

5 3. That the Court award the County attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure

6 section 1021.5;

7 4. That the Court award the County costs; and

8 5. That the Court award such other and further relief as it may deem just and proper.

Re: West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project
Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action

Dear Mr. Hunt and Members of the City Council:

Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5, please take notice that the County of San
Bernardino intends to file in San Bernardino County Superior Court Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA", Public Resources Code
section 21000 et seq.) against Respondents and Defendants the City of Fontana and the City Council of the City of Fontana (collectively, the "City").
The Petition challenges the City's March 12, 2019 and March 26, 2019 approval of the West
Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan Project ("Project"), including certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR), Mitigation Monitoring Reporting Program (MMRP) and Statement of Overriding Considerations (SOC), and all Project entitlements, including without limitation General Plan Amendment No. 11-026; Zone Change No. 11-016; Specific
Plan Amendment No. 11-003; Development Agreement No. 11-002; Tentative Parcel Map
No. 19156 (TPM No. 13-005). The County seek a writ to void the approval of the Project on
the grounds that (1) the City failed to comply with the procedures and requirements of CEQA; (2) the FEIR failed to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts, including Air Quality, Biological Resources, Hydrology
and Water Quality, Traffic, and Noise; (3) the FEIR failed to adequately describe the Project and its Environmental Setting; and (4) the City failed to analyze or adopt feasible alternatives that would reduce the Project's significant environmental impacts. In addition, the action to will also allege that the City failed to comply with applicable provisions of the Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code 65000 et seq.), the City of Fontana General Plan, and the Subdivision Map Act.
