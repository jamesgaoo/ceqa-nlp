[California Environmental Quality Act 14

15 COUNCIL of the CITY OF SAN DIEGO; and 16 DOES 1 through 10, inclusive

18 Respondents.

20
1. 21 This case challenges the City of San Diego and City Council's (collectively

22 "City" or "Respondents) decision to approve a project forming undergrounding utility districts
for 11 neighborhoods, in reliance on a Notice of Exemption for both the formation of the 23 Districts and approval of the actual construction of the undergrounding projects.
24 2. Despite: project title that appears to limit the project to the formation of
25 underground utility districts, the text of the Notice of Exemption indicates that the CITY intends
26 such approval and the corresponding Notice of Exemption to cover all subsequent physical work
27 within the district.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 1 -

3. Petitioner's subsequent communications with CITY staff confirms that the CITY

2 does not believe that the physical implementation of the undergrounding project(s) require any

3 subsequent discretionary approvals or environmental review.

4 4. Petitioner files this petition, not out of a desire to prevent undergrounding, but to

5 ensure that the 11 neighborhoods impacted by the physical implementation of the project are

6 properly informed of the scope and description of the project, the potential impacts of the
undergrounding, and have fair opportunity to comment on the project to reduce and mitigate
7 potential impacts before the undergrounding occurs.
8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
9 5. Petitioner brings this matter under Code of Civil Procedure § § 1085, 1094.5 and
10 Public Resources Code §8 21168 and 21168.5.
11 6. Venue is proper in the Central District of the San Diego Superior Court because

12 the approvals and project will occur within the City of San Diego.

13 PARTIES

14 7. Petitioner MARGARET "MAGGIE" MCCANN is an individual who lives within

1,5 the City of San Diego, in neighborhood commonly known as Kensington. Her neighborhood

16 tis encompassed within the project.
8.
17 Respondent CITY OF SAN DIEGO is a Charter City in the State of California

18 Notice of Exemption in violation of CEQA.
19 9.. The CITY COUNCIE of the CITY OF SAN DIEGO is the elected
20 decisionmaking body of the CITY OF SAN DIEGO, and is responsible for approving the project
21 111 reliance on a Notice of Exemption in violation of CEQA.

2,2 10. The names and capacity of DOES 1-10 are unknown. DOES 1-5 are either
23 unelected decisionmakers or otherwise responsible for the violations of CEQA. DOBS 6-10 are

24 unknown potentially interested parties, including utility companies. It is unknown whether such

25. parties, including San Diego Gas and Electric, have a sufficient interest in the City's decision to
participate in the proccedings. It is alleged on information and belief that DOES 1-10 are
26 neither necessary nor indispensible parties and are not required to be named pursuant to Public
27 Resources Code § 21167.6.5.

- PRELIMINARY ALLEGATIONS

2 11.

12. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

3 Petitioner participated in the administrative process for the approval challenged

4 herein, and submitted written comments setting forth the concerns raised in this action. The

5 issues presented in this action were brought to the attention of the Respondents during the

6 administrative review process by Petitioner, other members of the public, or internally.
13.
7 Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies in compliance with Public
Resources Code section 21177.

8 14.

9 To the extent that there was any failure to exhaust administrative remedies,

10 Respondent is estopped from asserting such defense based on the deceptive project title and/or

11 vague project description. Such title and project description failed to inform Petitioner and the
public that there would be no further opportunity to administratively or legally object to the

12 physical implementation of the project. The project description failed to provide fundamental

13 information about the project, necessary for intelligent public comment on the impacts of the

14 project.

15 15. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action in

16 compliance with' the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing

17 Respondents with notice of this action prior to filing the lawsuit, and by filing a proof of service

18 with the court at the time of filing this action.
16. In conjunction with the filing of this lawsuit, Petitioner has filed a request for
19 Respondents to prepare the administrative record, which shall be served personally within 10
20 days of filing of the lawsuit. Petitioner reserves the right to request to prepare the record himself.
21 18. Within 10 days of filing this Petitioner will provide the California Attorney

22 General with notice of this action and request that the Attorney General intervene in this action

23 because of the importance of this case to the citizens of San Diego and the State of California.

24 19. Petitioner requested that Respondents enter into settlement negotiations to avoid

25 litigation, but Respondents failed to contact Petitioner and waive the statute of limitations.

20.
26 Petitioner is entitled to

1021.5 in that: attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

27 a.

28 The successful prosecution of this lawsuit will result in the enforcement of
important rights affecting the public interest and will confer significant benefits upon the public

1 or a large class of persons. Petitioner seeks to enforce provisions of important state

2 environmental laws for the benefit of the public and to rectify certain procedural improprieties

3 which will benefit all future participants in the decision making process employed by

4 Respondents

b.
5 the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to
make the award appropriate; and,
6
C. Such fees will not be paid out of any recovery.
7 21. The action of respondents herein complained of were arbitrary and capricious and
8 petitioner is entitled to recover attorney's fees pursuant to Government Code § 800.

9

10 ADMINSTRATIVE PROCESS

11 22. It is alleged on information and belief, that on or about July 10, 2018, CITY staff

12 posted a "Notice of Right of Appeal" its determination that the project was exempt from CEQA

13 in the office of the Development Services Department.

14 23. It is alleged on information and belief that the City failed to notify homeowners

15 within the project boundaries that City Staff had made determined that the project was exempt

16 from CEQA. No hearing appeared to be scheduled before a hearing officer either before or after

17 posting the Notice of the Right to Appeal.
24.
18 The City of San Diego filed a Notice of Exemption on or about July 30, 2018.
25. On or about the end of December 11, 2018, the CITY COUNCIL initially 19 considered the project, which was described in the agenda as Item 334: 20
Creation of Utilities Undergrounding Districts in the communities of
21 University City (1S), Mission Beach (2S3), Kensington (3AA), Teralta (3AA1), Normal Heights (3BB, 3BB2), Encanto (4R1), 22 Clairemont Mesa (6K, 6K2), Allied Gardens (7R1) and Del Cerro (7U).

23
26. It is alleged, on information and belief, that the City did not notify any of the 24 planning groups for the neighborhoods or any homeowners of the project. It is further alleged on
25 information and belief that no members of the public appeared or submitted comments at the
26 December 11, 2018 hearing in favor or opposing the project.
27 27. On December 11, 2018, the City Council passed a resolution to schedule a public
28 hearing on the project for January 29, 2019 and for the City to provide notice.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 4 -

1 28. In December of 2018, the City mailed notice to homeowners within the Project

2 areas.

3 29. The notice sent to Petitioner, stated "NOTICE OF CITY COUNCIL PUBLIC

4 HEARING TO ESTABLISH AN UNDERGROUND UTILITY DISTRICT"

5 30. The notice informed Petitioner and the community that formation of the utility

6 district would create an obligation for San Diego Gas & Electric, and other utilities providing

7 overhead utility services "to remove all overhead utility services from the streets and/or alleys

8 and replace them with underground services."
31. The notice failed to inform Petitioner and the community that the formation of the
9 underground utility district included the approval of all subsequent construction, and that no
10 further approvals would be required for the physical construction of the project, including all
11 trenching and installation of above-ground transformers and other utilities, such as cable and
12 internet.
13 32. The notice failed to provide sufficient information concerning the physical
14 implementation of the project, including, but not limited to, the number and locations of above
15 ground cement pads and utility boxes.

16 33. The notice identified only one district "Residential Block Project 3AA (UU915)

17 Underground Utility District". The notice failed to notify the public of the 10 other

18 neighborhoods that were being formed simultaneously with Kensington, or the other districts that

19 had just gone through the mitigated negative declaration process and were up for approval at the

20 same meeting.

21 34. The notice also failed to inform the public of the filed Notice of Exemption and

22 the ability to comment on the environmental determination and impacts of the project.
35.
23 Upon review of some of the underlying documents, Petitioner discovered the
Notice of Exemption and the Notice of Right to Appeal. 24
36. But for the fact that Petitioner had previously commented on a mitigated negative 25 declaration for undergrounding utilities in Kensington just north of Adams Avenue in 2010, she
26 would not have understood that the notice also included physical implementation of the project.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 5 -

1 37. Despite what appeared to be a lapse in the ability to appeal City Staff's
2 determination, On January 28, 2019, Petitioner submitted substantive and procedural objections

3 to the notice.

4 38. Her objections included objections to the lack of proper notice and project

5 description, the use of a Notice of Exemption based on unusual circumstances, the potential for

6 significant impacts, to historical trees and houses, aesthetics and neighborhood character, air

7 quality/odor, greenhouse gases, and biological resources.
39.
8 Petitioner sent a second email objecting to the Notice of Exemption as
procedurally invalid and providing documentary back-up for her objections.
9 40. On January 29, 2019, the City Council heard Item 336, which was described on
10 the agenda as: Creation of Utilities Undergrounding Districts in the communities of University
11 City (1S), Mission Beach (2S3), Kensington (3AA), Teralta (3AA1), Normal Heights (3BB, 3BB2),
12 Encanto (4R1), Clairemont Mesa (6K, 6K2), Allied Gardens (7R1) and Del Cerro (7U)."
13 41. The staff presentation on the project was less than three minutes long.
14 42. One member of the community appeared at oral argument in opposition, arguing
15 that it was premature to file a Notice of Exemption and objected that there was insufficient
16 information, such as the location and size of the boxes, to properly comment on the project.
17 43. Supporters of the project also complained that they had insufficient information

18 about the project, including the number, size and location of the boxes. Some supporters

19 expressed concerns that utility companies would move the overhead lines from alleyways into.

20 streets and front yards, and objected that the boxes are magnets for graffiti.

21 44. City Staff admitted at the hearing that the design stage had not occurred. The

22 City promised to work with the community and San Diego Gas and Electric during the design

23 phase, but failed to promise that they would ensure that the utility lines would not be moved from
the rear of properties over the objections of the utility companies. 24 45. City Councilman Chris Ward asked that Kensington portion of the project be 25 segregated from the remaining neighborhoods based on the objections to the Notice of
26 Exemption and concerns over historical resources.
27 46. Although no vote occurred on Councilman Ward's request to separate Kensington
28 from the remainder of the project, City staff agreed and filed another Notice of Exemption on

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 6 -

- February 1, 2019, identifying only Kensington. Such action constitutes improper segmentation

2 of the project under CEQA.

3 47. At the same City Council meeting, the City Council set a hearing date of March 5,

4 2019, for the formation of additional utility districts and implementation undergrounding of

5 utilities. These projects were analyzed and mitigated under mitigated negative declarations, but

6 suffer from similar defects under CEQA such as vague project descriptions and inadequate

7 analysis of impacts, improper segmentation of similar projects and failure to analyze cumulative

8 impacts.

48.
9 To make matters even more procedurally confusing, a presentation posted on the

10 City of San Diego's Underground Utilities Program Website, identifies a CEQA process whereby

11 a Notice of Preparation of an EIR was to be posted on October 15, 2018, a scoping process

12 conducted in November of 2018, and the preparation of a draft EIR for undergrounding be
prepared in fall/winter of 2018 and 2019.
13 49.

14 Because of the confusion, Petitioner specifically sought to determine whether any

15 further discretionary approvals or other opportunities to challenge the environmental

16 determinations of the City would occur before implementation of the project. Petitioner was
informed that the CEQA determination was final and covered construction.

17

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
(McCann V. All Respondents)

20 50.

51. Petitioner re-alleges all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

21 Petitioner hereby challenges the CITY OF SAN DIEGO'S failure to comply with

22 CEQA for a project described as the "Creation of Utilities Undergrounding Districts in the

23 communities of University City (1S), Mission Beach (2S3), Kensington (3AA), Teralta (3AA1),

24 Normal Heights (3BB, 3BB2), Encanto (4R1), Clairemont Mesa (6K, 6K2), Allied Gardens

25 (7R1) and Del Cerro (7U)" and identified in the Notices of Exemption as Project No. 594590.
52.

26 Petitioner alleges that Respondents, and each of them, in approving the Project in

27 reliance on the Notice(s) of Exemption, failed to proceed as required by law under CEQA and
abused its discretion.

28 53. Respondents failed to properly notice the availability of a Notice of Exemption.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 7 -

54. Respondents failed to properly describe the Project in its notice to the

2 communities, including the fact that the decision would be the final, legally-challengeable,
3 discretionary decision approving the physical implementation of the Project.

4 55. Respondents violated CEQA because, over the objections of both opponents and
proponents, it approved the project in reliance on a Notice(s) of Exemption, prior to sufficient

6 design work and analysis of the project, Respondents, for example, claim to not know the

7 number, size, and locations of above-ground utility boxes. If Respondents know this
information, they failed to disclose such information in such a manner that it would allow the
8
public to intelligently comment.
9 56. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the project in reliance on a Notice of
10 Exemption, despite the fact that the Project falls outside of the categorical exemption to CEQA
11 because undergrounding may occur outside of the same site. (14 Cal. Code of Regs. § 15302.)
12 57. The Project fails to qualify for a categorical exemption because the Project may
13 have significant impacts due to unusual circumstances, including, but not limited to, impacts to
14 aesthetics, historical resources (both trees and houses). (14 Cal. Code of Regs. § 15301.) §
15 58. The Project fails to qualify for a categorical exemption, because the Project may
16 have significant cumulative impacts that were not disclosed or analyzed in conjunction with

17 other undergrounding projects in other parts of the CITY OF SAN DIEGO.

18 59. Respondents violated CEQA because it improperly segmented the Kensington

19 portion of the Project, based on concerns that Petitioner and others provided substantial evidence

20 to support that the Project may have significant impacts due to unique circumstances.

21 60. Respondents violated CEQA because, at the same meeting, it scheduled a public

22 hearing on mitigated negative declarations for undergrounding projects in other areas of the

23 City. Respondents knew, or should have known that such votes were inconsistent with a Notice
of Exemption that it had just relied upon and/or approved.
24 61. Petitioner is entitled to a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the CITY 25 COUNCIL to rescind its January 29, 2019 approval of the Project, and the Notice of Exemption
26 upon which it relies.
27 62. Petitioner is entitled to a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to
28 conduct a legally adequate environmental review, to provide legally sufficient notice and project

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
- 8 -

- description, including a description of the number, size and location of all above ground utility

2 boxes, and analyze and mitigate all significant impacts, including the cumulative impacts of all

3 undergrounding projects within the City.

4

5 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

6 WHEREFORE Petitioner prays for the following relief

1.
7 For a preliminary injunction prohibiting Respondents from taking any action to

8 carry out the physical construction of the project until this matter is resolved.
2.
9 For a peremptory writ of mandate directing:

10 (a) Respondents to vacate and set aside its notice of exemption(s) and

11 all other approvals for the Project
(b)
12 Respondents to suspend all activity that could result in any change

13 or alteration in the physical environment until respondents have prepared and certified a legally

14 sufficient environmental impact report for the project.
(c)
15 Respondents be ordered to prepare, circulate and consider an EIR

16 that complies with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the project;
3. For costs of suit incurred;

17 4. For an award of attorneys' fees, and;

18 5. For other or further equitable relief that the court considers just and proper.
