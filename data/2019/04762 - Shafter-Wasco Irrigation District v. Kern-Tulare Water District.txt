17 Respondent. (CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT)

18

19 Petitioner Shafter~Wasco Irrigation District ("Petitioner" or "SWID") files this Petition for
20 Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief ("Petition") and alleges as follows:
21 INTRODUCTION
22 1. Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process. (14 Cal. Code Regs.
23 §15201)
24 2. Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Cal. Pub. Res.
25 Code §§ 21000, et seq.) and the Guidelines implementing the same (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000,
26 et seq.). Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself and on behalf of the landowners and water
27 users within its boundaries. This Petition challenges the actions by Respondent Kern-Tulare Water
28 District ("Respondent" or "KTWD") certifying and/or adopting a Notice of Exemption (NOE)

SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

related to its Shafter Check Pumping Operations/Maintenance (Project), and its decision to

2 implement the vague action without public notice and citing two inapplicable categorical

3 exemptions to avoid CEQA review: (1) Class 1, 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15301 (use of District

4 facilities, etc.) ("CEQA Guidelines"); and (2) Class 4; §15304 (minor alterations to land involving
gardening, carnivals, Christmas trees, etc.).

6 3. Petitioner is informed and believes that the intended project and actions by

7 Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 will in fact result in irreversible environmental consequences by the

8 degradation of water quality within the Friant-Kern Canal (FKC) that will be pumped onto pristine

9 farmland within Petitioner's boundaries without notice.

10 4. Geography is important within this Petition. Both Petitioner and Respondent have

11 water delivery facilities to take surface water from the FKC to use within their districts. The FKC

12 runs approximately north and south along the eastern side of the southern San Joaquin Valley and

13 provides major water delivery system to water users throughout the Central Valley of California
14--and-high-quality-water is-generally-delivered-from the north flowing south in Kern.County._

SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 The map above is provided as a quick reference only, see Exhibit 1 attached and incorporated for

2 further review.

3 5. As illustrated, here Respondent is located north of Petitioner and has in the past

4 caused poor quality water to be brought from the south up the FKC with the use of the Shafter

5 Check (a major water pump to lift water up elevations) past Petitioner's facilities (turnout) whereby

6 the poor quality water is diverted from the FKC into Petitioner's facilities. This has occurred

7 without notice and the poor quality water flows into Petitioner's water system that its landowners

8 utilize to irrigate various crops within Petitioner's boundaries-crops and soils that are damaged by

9 the use of poor quality water that Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 1 is causing to be pumped into the

10 FKC and past Petitioner's facilities instead of the typical high quality FKC supplies.

11 6. The landowners within Petitioner's boundaries depend on water quality that will

12 sustain the viable and beneficial uses of the farmland within the region from the FKC.

13 7. If and when Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 takes action to improve and enhance its
14 pump, pipe, cage and surrounding area at the Shafter Check within the FKC, such Project will

15 enhance and enable Respondent to move substantial volumes of poor quality irrigation water north

16 with potentially significant water quality impacts to SWID's surface and groundwater irrigation
17 supplies and associated adverse impacts on soils and crops in SWID' District, landowners and
18 associated damages.

19 8. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondent and DOES to 10

20 has not met their obligations under CEQA to ensure that an agency's actions are reviewed before

21 decisions are made and actions undertaken. As here where Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 did not
22 notify the public or solicit public comment on its proposed actions and determinations that is action is
23 was exempt from CEQA nor even give notice to the public that it was considering any CEQA
24 actions.

25 9. Through this action Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate commanding Respondent and
26 DOES 1 to 10 1 to set aside its certification or adoption of its NOE for the Project, its approval of the
27 Project based thereon, its implementation of the Project in whole or in part, and related relief.
28 Petitioner, as well as its landowners and water users, will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if

3
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

the Court does not grant the requested relief. Petitioner also seeks a preliminary a and permanent

2 injunction barring Respondent from undertaking any activity with regard to the Project and any

3 activity which could potentially alter the physical and natural environment in Kern County, pending

4 proper and complete environmental review as required by CEQA.

5 10. This action involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
6 Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including without
7 limitation landowners and water users within Petitioner, and will result in the enforcement of
8 important public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with all legal requirements applicable to
the Project, including CEQA.
10 PARTIES
11 11. Petitioner, Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District, is located in the southern area of the
12 San Joaquin Valley generally in the northwest quadrant of Kern County. SWID is organized and
13 existing under and pursuant to Irrigation District Law (Wat. Code, §§20500 et seq.) and includes
14 approximately 38,766 acres and is situated between the Semitropic and North Kern Water Storage
15 Districts. SWID contains and benefits both the incorporated Cities of Wasco and Shafter.
16 12. Petitioner brings this action against Respondent, Kern-Tulare Water District in its
17 capacity as the Lead Agency on the Project and DOES 1 to 10. Respondent is presently and has
18 been organized and existing under California Water District Law (Wat. Code, §§34000 et seq.) As
19 the Lead Agency on the Project, Respondent is responsible for preparation of an environmental
20 document that adequately and accurately describes the Project and its impacts, and, if necessary,
21 evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental
22 impacts. Respondent is responsible for implementing and complying with the provisions of the
23 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines with respect to the
24 Project.
25 13. Petitioner is authorized pursuant to Water Code §22650 to commence and maintain
26 any action and proceeding to carry out its purposes or protect its interests. Petitioner has
27 continuously maintained a public project for the diversion, delivery and use of water for the
28 beneficial use of irrigation for agricultural users within its boundaries. Petitioner, its landowners
4
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 and water users, use surface water and groundwater existing in a common and interconnected

2 groundwater basin shared by all Petitioners located north of Kern River for reasonable and

3 beneficial use of irrigation, and other purposes. Respondent's approval of its Project harms

4 Petitioner, its landowners and water users, by threatening impairment of their reasonable and

5 beneficial use of the common and interconnected groundwater resources existing in the

6 groundwater basin.

7 14. SWID was formed in 1937 for the purpose of finding ways to replenish dwindling
8 groundwater supplies within the SWID's boundaries. From the period of 1921 to 1949 the

9 groundwater table progressively lowered 2.3 feet per year.

10 15. SWID formally applied to the United States Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation)
11 for Central Valley Project (CVP) water for the 37,528 acres within SWID's boundaries on February
12 5, 1946. SWID later entered into a water supply contract in 1955 with Reclamation to supply water
13 from the Friant Unit of the Federal Central Valley Project (CVP) by way of the Friant Kern Canal.
14 On February 11, 1955 the Board of Directors of the Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District executed a
15 contract with the United States providing for a water service contract and for construction by

16 Reclamation of an $8,366,979 distribution system for 50,000 acre-feet of Class I water and 39,600
17 acre-feet of Class II water.

18 16. The groundwater table decline increased to about six feet per year until the mid-
19 1970's, when the CVP and the State Water Project (SWP) were fully operational, SWID's
20 operations stabilized the decline. SWID then entered into several interim surface water renewal

21 contracts under the Central Valley Project Improvement Act of 1992 and other provisions of laws
22 and contracts. In 2001, a long-term 25 year contract was obtained with Reclamation.

23 17. From 2012 to 2015, the worst drought on record has hit California and the San

24 Joaquin River watershed. And, compounding drought related issues, regulatory restrictions on Delta
25 exports out of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to Reclamation CVP and Exchange
26 Contractors, and administration of exchange contracts that underpin CVP Friant contracts resulted
27 in two years (2014 and 2015) of zero water allocations for all Friant contractors. Thus energy
28 consumption has increased and groundwater levels in SWID have significantly declined, as

5
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 landowners in the district and surrounding areas have relied on more and deeper groundwater

2 pumping to make up for surface water allocation deficits.

3 18. Meanwhile, the State of California enacted fundamental groundwater regulations

4 (Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, or SGMA) in 2014. SGMA is intended to establish

5 "sustainable groundwater management" through the creation of Groundwater Sustainability

6 Agencies (GSAs) and the agencies' mandate to adopt and begin to implement Groundwater
7 Sustainability Plans (GSPs), for some basins, by as early as 2020.

8 19. SGMA's goal is to reach a sustainable level of groundwater storage within 20 years

o of adoption of the GSPs. The legislation identifies six undesirable conditions/results that must be

10 managed:

11

12 1) Chronic lowering of groundwater levels,

13 2) Significant and unreasonable reduction in groundwater storage,
Significant and unreasonable seawater intrusion,
14 3) 4y Significant and unreasonable degraded water quality,
15 5) Significant and unreasonable land subsidence, and
16 6) Depletions of interconnected surface water that has significant and

17 unreasonable adverse effects on beneficial uses of the surface water.

18 20. SWID overlies a closed groundwater basin and the introduction of degraded water

19 supplies tend to accumulate in the groundwater and become worse over time.

20 21. SWID is informed and believes that the proposed Project has the potential to

21 degrade FKC supplies, at a minimum, by increasing nitrates, salinity and arsenic in the water taken

22 by Petitioner from the FKC, however Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 made no 1 water quality

23 analysis related to the Project, and there is no analysis of the downstream water quality or

24 associated adverse impacts from the degradation. This analysis is required in CEQA; downstream

25 water quality-related effects of a project cannot simply be ignored in an environmental document.

SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 In addition, there must be compliance with the state (and federal) Antidegradation Policy, in light

2 of the existence of high quality of water in the FKC.2

3 22. Nitrates are an obvious concern, as highlighted by the Central Valley Regional

4 Water Quality Control Board Waste Discharge Requirements issued as part of the Irrigated Lands

5 Regulatory Program. Regarding salts, the Basin Plan for the Tulare Lake Basin region emphasizes

6 that salt is a crucial problem in the Tulare Lake Basin and the paramount water quality problem in

7 the Basin is the accumulation of salts. Both Petitioner and Respondent are aware of the policies

8 and other antidegradation conditions on other facilities including, the Delta-Mendota Canal and

9 associated selenium and the Total Dissolved Solids requirements.3

10 23. SWID and its water users and Respondent are also working within a variety of State
11 of California regulatory programs. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board
12 (CVRWQCB) mandates the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP) and the Central Valley
13 Salinity Alternatives for Long-Term Sustainability (CVSALTS) Program. Under the ILRP

14 regulations, the CVRWQCB is limiting the use of groundwater with high nitrate levels. In addition,
15 the CVSALTS Program is envisioned to limit the salt (TDS and/or EC) loading on agricultural
16 irrigated land.

17 24. The potentially significant impacts to SWID's growers and its water management
18 programs from the introduction of more poor quality by Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 into the

19 FKC at or near SWID's facilities (turnout) that exhibits a greater level of contaminants, including
20 higher salts, boron, and other constituents has not been addressed by Respondent even in light of
21 being presented lab test results during prior informal discussion about FKC water quality. (See
22 Exhibit 2 attached and incorporated by this reference.)
23 25. The Respondent's Project would enable or enhance the discharge of lower quality
24 into the FKC and then into SWID's turnout.

25 26. Petitioner is beneficially interested in Respondent's compliance and DOES to 10
26 with its duties and responsibilities under applicable laws, including CEQA. Petitioner is
27

28 See Asociacion de Gente Unida por el Agua v. Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1268.. See 2013 Delta-Mendota Canal Groundwater Pump-in Program Water Quality Monitoring Plan 7
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 beneficially interested in Respondent's performance of its duties to apply all applicable laws and

2 consider rationally and in good faith all record evidence in deciding whether to approve public

3 projects.

4 27. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 10 and

5 therefore sue such persons, entities and organizations by these fictitious names. Petitioner is

6 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that those persons, entities and organizations

7 fictitiously-named herein have an interest in the matters alleged in this action. When the true

8 identities and capacities of said persons, entities and organizations have been determined, Petitioner

0 will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 28. The Kern County Superior Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein

12 pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code §g 21168 and

13 21168.5.

1-4- -29. -Venue is appropriate-in-Kern-Gounty-pursuant-to-Cal.-Code-Giv. Proc- §§-393, 394 and

15 395 because Respondent is located within the County of Kern. Among other things, Respondent's
16 Project threatens prime agricultural farmland, landowners, water users, natural resources, a common
17 and interconnected groundwater basin, and the environment, all located within the County of Kern.
18 STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
19 30. There was no notice of any CEQA action to the public by Respondent and DOES
20 to 10.
21 31. In fact, upon review of the Respondent's Agenda for its Board Meeting on December
22 13, 2018 there were no action items even listed; however, it appears Respondent took action on the
23 NOE as to the General Manager's Report at Agenda Item. IV., section C. Off-Season Maintenance
24 Projects. See Exhibit 3 attached and incorporated; and excerpt below for quick reference:
25 IV. GENERAL MANAGER'S REPORT
26 A. Water Use Agreement with Setton Farms
27 B. Report from ACWA

28 C. Off-Season Maintenance Projects
D. Groundwater Sustainability Plan

SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 32. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this

2 Petition, and/or Respondent has failed to provide the notice required by law, and thus Petitioners

3 have fully exhausted their administrative remedies.

4 33. There have been no formal public proceedings or public notifications regarding the

5 NOE before it was adopted and certified by Respondent and no opportunity to express objections to

6 any purported exemptions. Respondent did not include any reference to the CEQA exemption in its

7 December 13, 2018 Agenda or notice (See Exhibit 3) nor has Respondent not solicited any public

8 comment on its review.

9 34. Petitioner has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions

10 precedent to the filing of this Petition and Respondent has made a final determination and no further

11 administrative appeal procedures are provided by state or local law.

12 35. Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 took final action with respect to its approval of the
13 Project and, on a December 21, 2018, filed a Notice of Exemption purportedly in compliance with
14 CEQA. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Exemption is attached hereto as Exhibit 4 and is
15 incorporated herein by this reference.

16 36. This action is brought within thirty (35) days of the filing of the Notice of Exemption
17 per Pub. Res. Code §21167(d); 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15112(c).

18 37. Pursuant to California Government Code §905(i), this action is not subject to the

19 California Torts Claim Act.

20 38. Concurrently with the filing of this Petition, Petitioner shall serve a copy of this
21 Petition on the California Attorney General's office pursuant to Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code
22 of Civil Procedure §388. (See attached Exhibit 5 incorporated by this reference.)
23 39. Petitioner also shall serve with this Verified Petition a notice of Election to Reserve a

24 its right to Prepare the Administrative Record, to the extent that any administrative record exists in
25 an action in which an agency has failed to take any actions in compliance with CEQA.

SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

NOTICE

2 40. On January 24, 2019, prior to commencement of this action, Petitioner served

3 written notice of commencement of this action on Respondent in accordance with the requirements

4 of CEQA, and more specifically, Public Resources Code $21167.5. A true and correct copy of this

5 notice and a proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit 6 and is incorporated herein by 6 this

6 reference.

7 41. On January 25, 2019, Petitioner served the Attorney General of the State of

8 California (Attorney General) with a copy of the Petition in accordance with the requirements of

o CEQA, and more specifically, Public Resources Code §21167.7. A true and correct copy of the

10 form of the notice to the Attorney General (without attachment) is attached hereto as Exhibit 5 and
11 is incorporated herein by this reference.

12 STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND

13 42. In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Legislature
14--deelared-its-intention-that-all-publie-ageneies-responsible-for regulating activities affecting the

15 environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their

16 duties; accordingly, CEQA is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the

17 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (Mejia v. City of Los Angeles

18 (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 322.)

19 43. A Lead Agency has a to make a threshold determination of CEQA's applicability.

20 "The first tier is jurisdictional, requiring that an agency conduct a preliminary review in order to
21 determine whether CEQA applies to a proposed activity. (Guidelines, §§ 15060, 15061.)" (Davidon

22 Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 112.) CEQA applies if the activity is a

23 "project" under the statutory definition, unless the project is exempt. (See §§ 21065, 21080.) "If the
24 agency finds the project is exempt from CEQA under any of the stated exemptions, no further

25 environmental review is necessary." (Davidon Homes, p. 113.) In such cases, the agency may file a

26 notice of CEQA exemption, if it chooses to do so. (Guidelines, § 15062, subd. (a).)

27 44. If the project is not exempt-either because it does not fall within an exempt

28 category or because an exception makes the exemption unavailable-then the agency must proceed

10
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

to the second tier and conduct an initial study. (Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce v. City of

2 Santa Monica (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 786, 792; see Guidelines, § 15063.)

3 45. The second tier of the process, the initial study, serves several purposes. One purpose
4 is to inform the choice between a negative declaration and an environmental impact report (EIR).
(Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (c)(1); Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131

6 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1180.) Another of the initial study's purposes is to is eliminate unnecessary

7 environmental impact reports. (Guidelines, § 15063, subd. (c)(7).)

46. "CEQA excuses the preparation of an EIR and allows the use of a negative

9 declaration when an initial study shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may
10 have a significant effect on the environment." (San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society v.
11 Metropolitan Water Dist. (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 382, 389-390, citing Guidelines, § 15070. See also

12 Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21064, 21080, subd. (c).) In certain situations where a straightforward
13 negative declaration is not appropriate, the agency may permit the use of a mitigated negative

14 § declaration. (See § 21064.5; Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (f)(2); San Bernardino Valley Audubon

15 Society, at p. 390, 83 Cal.Rptr.2d 836.)

16 47. If the project does not qualify for a negative declaration, "the third step in the

17 process is to prepare a full environmental impact report..." (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose,
18 supra, at p. 113, citing §§ 21100 and 21151, and Guidelines, §§ 15063, subd. (b)(1) & 15080;

19 Gentry v. City of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1372.)

20 48. The California Supreme Court has "repeatedly recognized that the EIR is the 'heart

21 of CEQA.' : (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1993) 6

22 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) As the court observed more than three decades ago, "since the preparation of

23 an EIR is the key to environmental protection under CEQA, accomplishment of the high objectives

24 of that act requires the preparation of an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of
25 substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact." (No Oil, Inc. v.

26 City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.) Other cases have since confirmed the statutory
27 preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR. (See, e.g., Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group V.

28 City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 689, 703; League for Protection of Oakland's etc. Historic

11
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 905.)

2 49. "Choosing the precise time for CEQA compliance involves a balancing of competing

3 factors. EIRs and negative declarations should be prepared as early as feasible in the planning

4 process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet late

5 enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (Guidelines, § 15004,

6 subd. (b). See also, e.g., Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California

7 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 395.) As general rule, "public agencies shall not undertake actions

8 concerning the proposed public project that would have a significant adverse effect or limit the
choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before completion of CEQA compliance."
10 (Guidelines, § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)

11 50. When a project is exempt, however, a somewhat different timing rule applies. "When

12 a public agency decides that a project is exempt from CEQA ..., the agency may file a notice of
13 exemption. The notice shall be filed, if at all, after approval of the project." (Guidelines, § 15062,
-14- subd. (a), italies added.) "A-notiee-of exemption-may-be-filled-out-and-may-accompany-the-project
15 application through the approval process" but it "shall not be filed ... until the project has been

16 approved." (Id., subd. (b). See also Guidelines, § 15061, subd. (d).)

17 51. *A 'project' is an activity subject to CEQA." (Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (d).) As

18 relevant here, "project" means activity by a public agency that "may cause either a direct physical

19 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment

20 39 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21065, subd. (a).) "The word 'may' in this context connotes a

21 reasonable possibility." (Citizen Action to Serve All Students v. Thornley (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d

22 748, 753.) " 'Environment' means the physical conditions which exist within the area which will be

23 affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of
24 historic or aesthetic significance." (§ 21060.5.)

25 52. The statutory definition of a CEQA project "is amplified in the Guidelines," which

26 clarify that a project means "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

27 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in
28 the environment....* (Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a).)" (Association for a Cleaner Environment v.

12
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Yosemite Community College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 629, 637; see also, e.g., Lighthouse

2 Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1180.)

3 53. To maximize environmental protection, the concept of a "project" is broadly defined

4 under CEQA. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz, supra, 131 Cal.App.4th at p.

5 1180.)

6 54. "It is the intent of the Legislature that all agencies of the state government which
7 regulate activities of private individuals, corporations, and public agencies which are found to affect

8 the quality of the environment, shall regulate such activities so that major consideration is given to

9 preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent home and satisfying living
10 environment for every Californian." (Pub. Resources Code, §21000, subd. (g).)
11 55. Long-term protection of the environment is a fundamental criterion of CEQA. (Pub.
12 Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (g).)

13 56. The basic purposes of CEQA are to inform governmental decision makers and the
14 public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities, identify ways
15 that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced, prevent such damage by the
16 imposition of mitigation measures or the adoption of alternative activities that avoid such damage,
17 and disclosure to the public of the reasons for approving an activity with significant, unmitigable
18 environmental effect. (CEQA Guidelines, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002(a).)
19 57. CEQA applies when a public agency proposes to "approve" a project. (Pub.
20 Resources Code, § 21080, subd. (a).) The term "approval" refers to a public agency decision that
21 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §
22 15352(a).) CEQA applies to "discretionary projects." (Pub. Resources Code ,§ 21080, subd. (a);
23 Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15357.) Projects with elements both discretionary and ministerial must be
24 treated as discretionary. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15268(d).)
25 58. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on
26 the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with
27 CEQA. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15004(b)(2). The "lead agency," which is the public agency
28 which has the principal responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for determining, in

13
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

consultation with other relevant state agencies, whether an environmental impact report, a negative

2 declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a project. (Pub. Resources

3 Code, §§ 21067; 21080.1, subd. (a); 21080.3, subd. (a).)

4 59. The CEQA Guidelines, codified in title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, set
forth the procedure that a lead agency must follow when it commences consideration of a project. If

6 an agency determines that a discretionary activity may result in reasonably foreseeable direct or

7 indirect physical change to the environment, it must begin CEQA review by considering whether a

8 project is exempt pursuant to a categorical or statutory exemption. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §

9 15061.) If an agency determines that a project is exempt, it must file a Notice of Exemption setting

10 forth for the public the basis of a claimed exemption. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15062.) If a project

11 is not found to be exempt, the agency may prepare an Initial Study to determine if the project may
12 a have a significant effect on the environment. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15063.) If there is
13 substantial evidence that any aspect of a project may cause a significant effect on the environment,
14- the-ageney-must-prepare-an-BIR-analyzing the-potential-impacts, individually-and-cumulatively,-of

15 the project on the environment.
16 60. This action challenges the continuing violation of the California Environmental

17 Quality Act (CEQA") by Respondent because they have entirely failed to perform any of the

18 required environmental review.

19 61. Here, the proposed action and project will permanently increase the pumping

20 capacities of poor quality water into the FKC in particular into SWID's water system. All done
21 without any public notice, no technical evaluations, no alternatives considered via a regulatory

22 exemption.

23 CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS

24 62. Furthermore, unlike statutory exemptions, regulatory exemptions (also known as

25 "categorical" exemptions) "shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility

26 that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (14

27 Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2.)

28 63. Respondent's and DOES 1 to 10 proposal to increase and enhance the pumping of

14
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 large quantities of poor quality water is not a minor alteration of an existing facility having no

2 impact on the environment within CEQA's guideline's categorical exemption from CEQA

3 requirements, in light of common knowledge that additional or enhanced pumping would create

4 water and soil degradation with no proposed mitigation measures-such will continue pollution of

5 the groundwater basin by importing lower quality water. (See Pub.Res.Code 21084(a); Cal.Code

6 Regs. title 14, § 15301.)

7 64. Respondent's Board made no findings period, let alone releasing more pollutants,
8 that existing safeguards have not prevented degradation to current water supplies. There is no staff

9 study related to the pollutants or how they could adversely affect groundwater, and Respondent's
10 Board did not have any data to determine full extent of pollutants being released, such required
11 discussion and a conclusion, as matter of law, that continued or enhanced pumping had potential to
12 degrade the quality of the environment and thus to have significant effect on environment
13 precluding application of categorical exemption from California Environmental Quality Act

14 (CEQA). (Pub.Res.Code § 21084(a).)

15 65. This principle of interpretation is embodied in the Guidelines, which state that

16 CEQA should be interpreted to "afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the

17 reasonable scope of the statutory language. [Citation.J" (Guidelines. § 15003, subd. (f).)

18 66. The Guidelines provide that categorical exemptions may not be used (i) where there
19 is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment (ii) due
20 to unusual circumstance. (Guideline §15300.2, subd. (c).) A significant effect is a "substantial, or
21 potentially substantial, adverse change...." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21068.) This means that an
22 activity has a significant effect if it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment."
23 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083.)

24 67. The Guidelines do not define "unusual circumstances." That requirement was
25 presumably adopted to enable agencies to determine which specific activities-within a class of

26 activities that does not normally threaten the environment-should be given further environmental

27 evaluation and hence excepted from the exemption.

28 68. The Respondent Board did not make the findings and determination that would have

15
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 been required to support a conclusion for any exemption as there was no notice or discussion.

2 69. An agency should decide whether a project is eligible for a categorical exemption as

3 part of its preliminary review of the project (Guidelines, §§ 15060 and 15061), not in the second

4 phase when mitigation measures are evaluated. In determining whether the significant effect

5 exception to a categorical exemption exists, "[i]t is the possibility of a significant effect ... which is

6 at issue, not a determination of the actual effect, which would be the subject of a negative

7 declaration or an EIR.

8 70. Here, Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 did nothing.

9 RELIEF REQUESTED

10 71. Petitioner seeks an alternative writ of mandamus, a peremptory writ of mandamus,

11 temporary and permanent injunctive relief, costs, reasonable attorneys' fees and other appropriate

12 relief under CEQA and as otherwise provided by law.

13 72. This petition involves the enforcement of an important right affecting the public
-14--interest and-successful-prosecution-of- this Petition-will confer substantial benefit on_the-general

15 public, and especially citizens within the zone near Shafter and Wasco and ultimately neighboring

16 landowners and water agencies.

17 73. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of iandate pursuant to Code of

18 Civil Procedure section 1085, which provides that a writ of mandate "may be issued by any court to

19 any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the

20 law specially enjoins, as duty resulting from an office, trust, or station," and Code of Civil Procedure
21 section 1087, which provides that "[t]he writ may be either alternative or peremptory."

22 74. Petitioner also seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Public

23 Resources Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9.

24 75. Public Resources Code section 21168.9 authorizes a court, after determining that a

25 respondent agency has violated CEQA, to issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the agency
26 to void or suspend decisions regarding which the agency failed to comply with CEQA, or to take
27 other steps necessary to bring its decision into compliance with CEQA. Petitioner requests that,
28

16
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of section 21168.9, the court issue a peremptory writ requiring
2 Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 to void its action certifying the NOE.
3 76. Section 21168.9, subdivision (b), provides that "[t]he trial court shall retain
4

5 jurisdiction over the public agency's proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ until the

6 court has determined that the public agency has complied with [CEQA]."

7 77. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate on the grounds that, by

8 determining to carry out the NOE actions purporting to be in compliance with CEQA, Respondent

9 and DOES 1 to 10 prejudicially abused its discretion within CEQA.

10 78. Petitioner also requests injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 526,

11 527, which provide that the court may issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction.

12 79. Petitioner requests permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Civil Code §3422, wherein

13 the court may issue a permanent injunction.

14 80. Respondent's actions and DOES 1 to 10 will result in irreparable harm to Petitioner

15 and the public at large in that the Project, as approved, will cause significant environmental impacts
16 that were not adequately addressed by any decision-maker or board or agency all without any notice

17 to the public.

18 81. Petitioner has no speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

19 82. This litigation involves the enforcement of an important right affecting the public
20 interest. Accordingly, if Petitioner is successful, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the

21 region and ultimately the state, and therefore should be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys'
22 fees. (Code of Civil Procedure $1021.5.)
23 83. Petitioner also brings this action pursuant to Government Code $800, providing up to
24 $7,500.00 in attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency decisions.
25

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

27 [Violation of California Environmental Quality Actl

28

17
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 84. Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 83 as though they were

2 set forth in full herein.

3 85. CEQA is intended to ensure that public agencies make informed judgments concerning

4 matters within their discretion that may have a significant adverse impacts. (Pub. Res. Code § 21006;
5 State CEQA Guidelines §§ 15022(a)(1) & 15003(c).)

6 86. This purpose is effectuated by mandating that public agencies: (1) Gather information
7 concerning existing conditions and potential environmental effects of a proposed measure before
8 rendering a decision. State CEQA Guidelines § 15004(a); (2) Consider the cumulative effects of the
9 proposed measure and other similar measures. State CEQA Guidelines § 15130. (3) Consider
10 alternatives to the proposed measure. State CEQA Guidelines §15126.6. (4) Evaluate and adopt
11

12 feasible mitigation measures to lessen or eliminate the potential adverse environmental impacts of the

13 proposed measure. State CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4. (5) Provide the public with a reasonable

14- opportunity to review and comment upon the proposed measure in light of its potential environmental

15 effects. State CEQA Guidelines § 15203.

16 87. In summary, the core purpose of CEQA is to inform governmental decision-makers

17 before they make decisions. Compliance with CEQA informs governmental decision-makers and the

18 public about the potential significant environmental effects of a proposed activity and assists the

19 governmental decision-makers in reaching an informed, environmentally-conscious decision about a

20 proposed activity.

21 88. The CEQA Guidelines further provide that categorical exemptions are not available,

22 even if a project otherwise fits one of the classes of categorical exemption listed in the State CEQA

23 Guidelines, in either of the following two circumstances: (1) When the cumulative impact of

24 successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant (CEQA Guidelines §

25 15300.2(b)); or (2) When there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect

26 on the environment due to unusual circumstances (§ 15300.2(c)).
27 89. There was no public notice on Respondent's Agenda of any action item, let alone any
28 CEQA action. The NOE was an afterthought.

18
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 90. Assuming arguendo and Respondent survives the notice defect, Respondent and
2 DOES 1 to 10 cannot rely on a Class 1 categorial exemption because the cumulative environmental
3 impacts of enhancing the Shafter Check (large pump) and thereby delivering more poor quality water
4 degrading the quality of the supply in the FKC and in SWID is significant and Respondent is on notice
5 of such problems and has records within their files and thus with no discussion, no analysis, no data
6 for determination prior to an NOE, the Class 1 categorical exemption is not available per Guidelines
7 §15300.2(b); and
8 91. There is a reasonable possibility that the NOE may have a significant effect a on the
9
per
10 environment due to unusual circumstances and thus a categorical exemption is not available
Guidelines 15300.2(c).
11
92.
12 Moreover, the Class 4 categorical exemption per §15304 relates to minor alterations

13 to land involving gardening, carnivals, Christmas trees, etc. and is inapplicable.

14 93. Because a categorical exemption is not available for the NOE, CEQA required the

15 Respondent and DOES to 10 to prepare an Initial Study for its action/project to determine whether

16 the action may have a significant adverse impact on the environment. (Guidelines § 15002(k)(2).) By

17 failing to prepare an Initial Study, Respondent and DOES 1 to 1 10 violated CEQA.

18 94. By failing to conduct an environmental review as required by CEQA, the Respondent

19 and DOES to 10 failed to satisfy CEQA's core purpose of ensuring informed decision-making by

20 its Board.

21 95. By failing to conduct environmental review as required by CEQA, the Respondent and

22 DOES 1 to 10 failed to satisfy another core purpose of CEQA: i.e., to evaluate and adopt feasible

23 mitigation measures that would reduce or eliminate the potential adverse environmental effects of

24 water degradation and other items detailed above.

25 96. By failing to conduct environmental review as required by CEQA, the Respondent

26 and DOES to 10 also compromised the core CEQA policy favoring public participation. Under
27 CEQA, Initial Studies/Negative Declarations must by law be made available for public review for a
28

19
SWID'S PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 minimum of 20 days before their adoption thus providing the public with adequate time to review

2 and comment upon these documents. (Guidelines 15105.)

3 97. Also, in order to fully protect the people's right to be informed, the Ralph M. Brown

4 Act, by its terms, requires the agenda of a regular meeting of a local agency, such as the Respondent,

5 be posted 72 hours before the meeting commences and contain "a brief general description of each

6 item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting, including items to be discussed in

7 closed session. A brief general description need not exceed 20 words.' (§ 54954.2, subd. (a).)

8 98. But, agenda drafters must give the public a fair chance to participate in matters of

9 particular or general concern by providing the public with more than mere clues from which they
10 must then guess or surmise the essential nature of the business to be considered by a local agency.

11 (Govt. Code $54954.2(a).)

12 99. As held by the Court of Appeal in Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202
13 Cal.App.3d 296:
14

15 While a fair argument of environmental impact must be based on substantial evidence, mechanical application of this rule would defeat the purpose of CEQA
16 where the local agency has failed to undertake an adequate initial study. The agency

17 should not be allowed to hide behind its own failure to gather relevant data. Thus, in Christward Ministry V. Superior Court, 184 Cal.App.3d 180, 197, the city adopted
18 an initial study and negative declaration concluding in brief, conclusory language that the project would not have a significant environmental impact. Ordering the
19 preparation of an EIR, the court commented, "the City's assertion it could find no

20 'fair argument' there would be any potentially significant environment impacts rests, in part, in its failure to undertake an adequate environmental analysis." CEQA places
21 the burden of environmental investigation on government rather than the public. If the local agency has failed to study an area of possible environmental
22 impact, a fair argument may be based on the limited facts in the record. Deficiencies

23 in the record may actually enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider range of inferences. (emphasis added.)
24 100. As here, no action items were listed on the Agenda, let alone any CEQA notices or
25 determinations. And Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 took no action to investigate any environmental

26 impacts. See Agenda Exhibit 3 and excerpt below.
27 IV. GENERAL MANAGER'S REPORT

28 A. Water Use Agreement with Setton Farms B. Report from ACWA C. Off-Season Maintenance Projects
D. Groundwater Sustainability Plan

3 101. Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 have access to ample data on associated water quality
in the FKC and failed to consider the cumulative impacts of its actions and is aware of at least

5 twelve projects and their impacts on water quality in the FKC:

6

7 5-year FKC Groundwater Pump-In Program
2. San Joaquin River Restoration Program Recapture and
8 / Recirculation EIR

18 Banked Water

19 1 102. Finally, Respondent and DOES 1 to 10 ignored Appendix G to the CEQA

20 Guidelines, which states in relevant part, "A project will normally have a significant a effect on the

21 environment if it will: .(y) Convert prime agricultural land to non-agricultural use or impair the

22 agricultural productivity of prime agricultural land. (emphasis added.) SWID is prime

23 agricultural land about to be significantly impacted environmentally by Respondent's project and
