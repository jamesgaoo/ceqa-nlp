VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Petitioner LA MIRADA AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION OF
2 HOLLYWOOD (hereinafter "Petitioner") seeks a writ a of mandamus, declaratory, and
injunctive relief against Respondents and Defendants City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles
4 City Planning Commission (sometimes collectively the "City"), and alleges as follows:
5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. This petition challenges the City's actions in approving: (a) three "Off-
7 Menu" Density Bonus incentives and a Waiver of Development Standards pursuant to Los
8 Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") § 12.22.A.25(g); (b) a Conditional Use permit
9 pursuant to LAMC § 12.24 to provide relief from the restrictions of LAMC § 12.11,
10 allowing 60 dwelling units in lieu of 36 units as otherwise permitted in the residential R4
APC J00L: 11
NETS Zone and allowing a 66.5-percent Density Bonus for a Housing Development Project in
12
LAW 'anuant oßuarey yYoN 91101-1504 which the density increase is greater than the 35-percent maximum permitted in LAMC §
13
AOSAA S SE 8 12.22.A.25; (c) a Determination that the project is a Streamlined Infill Project pursuant to asadena, 14 SB 35 allegedly in compliance with Government Code § 65913.4(a); and (d) a finding of
15 Statutory Exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and other
16 associated entitlements (collectively "Land Use Entitlements"). The entitlements would
17 allow the construction of an approximately 60-unit, 74-foot-tall, supportive housing
18 development in Hollywood, located at 5627 W. Fernwood Ave. ("Project"). The
19 entitlements granted by the City enable Real Parties to develop the Project in a manner not
20 otherwise allowed by the underlying zoning.
21 2. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating the City's determination
22 that the Project is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act, based upon
23 violations of CEQA. Petitioner further seeks a writ of mandamus, inter alia: (a)
24 invalidating and setting aside the Project; and (b) compelling the City to comply with
25 CEQA prior to consideration of any further resolutions, legislative actions or other
26 approvals concerning the Project.
27 3. Petitioner alleges that the City's determination that the Project qualifies as a
28 Streamlined Infill Project violates the provisions of California Government Code §
- 2 -

ERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

65913.4, and Public Resources Code § 21080. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus

2 invalidating and setting aside such approvals.
4. Petitioner further alleges that the City's approval of "off-menu" incentives
4 Government Code § 65915(d)(1)(B). for the Project violates LAMC § 12.22.A.25(g), and §
5 Petitioner seeks a writ of mandamus invalidating and setting aside such approvals.

24 12. The subject lot is the site of a vacant, two-level, 9,885 sq. ft. former office
25 building constructed in 1981. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon
26 alleges, that in 2005 Real Party PATH Ventures applied for and received City approval of

27 a variance to convert the a office building into a 65-bed homeless shelter in lieu of the 30
28 beds otherwise permitted. Petitioner's representative attended the January 6, 2005 public
- 4 -

hearing on the

2 variance application and spoke in opposition to the request. As a result of
Petitioner and others raising concerns to the City, Real Party's grant of the variance was

4 conditioned with several restrictions intended to mitigate impacts. Petitioner is informed
and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real Party in fact never followed the

6 restrictions placed upon the operation of its homeless shelter, instead allowing "loitering in

7 the area, drinking, panhandling, gambling, urinating in public and other lewd behaviors,

8 and (residents) using illegal drugs," as stated in testimony submitted into the record by a

9 security officer working at the time for a nearby homeless facility.

10 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real

APC 11 Party closed its homeless shelter at the subject location in early 2016.

EILSAEAS SK LAW FIR YOSL-LOLL6 Floor 'anuany oßuaJeN YoN 14.

12 On or about November 21, 2017, Real Party filed an expedited Master Land

8 13 Use Application with the City of Los Angeles Department of City Planning, proposing a

Pasadena, 14 project under the City's Transit Oriented Communities ("TOC"') Density Bonus ordinance

15 that required the following deviations from the underlying zoning: (1) 66.5 % increase in
the permitted density (from 36 units by-right to 60 units); (2) a reduction in LAMC-
16 required parking from 66 stalls to 14 stalls; (3) a 35% reduction in the required width of
17 side yards, from 9 feet to 5 feet 5 11 inches; (4) a 25% reduction in the required amount of
18

19 open space, from 6,025 sq. ft. to 4,519 sq. ft.; (5) a 35% reduction in the required rear yard

20 setback, from 18 feet to 11 feet, 9 inches; (6) 50% reduction in the required front yard

21 setback, from 15 feet to 7 feet, 6 inches; and (7) a Categorical Exemption from CEQA
(hereafter "TOC Project").
22 15.

23 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City

24 designated the application as Case Nos. DIR-2017-4872-TOC and ENV-2017-4873-CE.
16.

25 On or about December 21, 2017, a designee of the City's Director of

26 Planning approved the TOC Project under the TOC ordinance's Guidelines, and mailed

27 copies of the decision letter to property owners and tenants adjacent to the subject site,
with a final date to

28 appeal of January 5, 2018. No public hearings were conducted relative
to the proposed TOC Project, and the City's purported limitation of the right of appeal of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Density Bonus projects restricts appellants to persons either owning property adjacent to
2 the subject site, or those renting property adjacent to the subject site.
3 17. On or about January 5, 2018, a resident of an apartment complex adjacent to
4 the subject property filed a timely appeal of the City's approvals. Petitioner is informed
and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or about May 10, 2018, the City's Planning
Commission ("CPC") held a public hearing to consider the appeal, during which time
Petitioner's representative and others gave testimony in opposition to the TOC Project,
8 including comments that the project would result in specific adverse impacts to public
9 health and safety, and therefore must be denied. Following public testimony, the
10 Commission voted to deny the appeal and approve the Project.
Floor anuary oBuaJeW YuoN APC LAW FIRIA TUASAAOS SKE 11 18. On or about May 25, 2018, the CPC issued its Determination Letter POSI-LOLL6 12 approving the TOC Project and the Project's entitlements.
19. On or about June 7, 2018, Petitioner filed a timely appeal to the City S 13

Pasadena 14 Council under Public Resources Code § 21151(c) of the Commission's approval of the
15 Project as Categorically Exempt from CEQA, alleging that the proposed Project would
create significant impacts to public resources, particularly police resources, among other 16

17 environmental impacts. Despite Petitioner having filed a timely appeal and paid the
18 requisite fee, Petitioner's CEQA appeal was never scheduled by the City a for a hearing
19 before the City Council.
20 20. On or about June 27, 2018, the Successor Agency of the former Los
21 Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency ("CRA/LA") posted a Memorandum on its
22 website stating that the density limitations contained in the CRA/LA's Redevelopment
23 Plan Areas are not superseded by the City's TOC Guidelines. The Project site is located
24 within the CRA/LA's Hollywood Redevelopment Plan Area, which designates the site for
High Density Residential uses corresponding to a maximum density of 80 units per gross 25

gross area of the Project site is 26 acre including one-half of abutting streets. The

28 units with a 35% density bonus as permitted by State density bonus law. Petitioner is

clearance for Real Party's 60-unit Project, rendering the City's approval of the entitlements
3 moot.

4 21.

5 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that as a

6 result of the CRA/LA's rejection of the City's approval of the TOC Project, Real Party

7 subsequently filed a new application with the City on August 14, 2018, this time applying

8 as a Streamlined Infill Project ("SIP") pursuant to Government Code 65913.4. Real

9 Party's SIP application requested the same deviations from the underlying zoning
limitations, this time as the following entitlements: (1) three off-menu Density Bonus

APC WHIH MV1 NIELSH3ATS 3HL Floor 10 incentives for the reductions in required yard setbacks; (2) a Conditional Use permit to

Pasadena, and (4) an Exemption from CEQA, and that the City designated the application as Case
14 No. CPC-2018-7621-DB-CU-SIP.

; 15 22. On or about February 13, 2019, Petitioner submitted a letter to the City
16 outlining how the proposed Project is not eligible for streamlined review under
§ 17 Government Code § 65913.4, and that the application should therefore be denied.

18 23. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or
19| about May 3, 2019, the City's Planning Department deemed the Project application

20

21 complete, and scheduled a hearing on the entitlement requests at the City Planning
Commission meeting of June 27, 2019.

23 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or

24 about June 27, 2019, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider the

25 Project, during which time Petitioner's representative submitted additional evidence into
the record and gave oral testimony in opposition to the Project. Following public
26 testimony, the Commission voted to approve the Project.

to the Commission's actions.

- 26. On July 30, 2019, Petitioner filed timely appeal to the City Council of the
2 Commission's approval of the Project.

3 27. On or about August 8, 2019, the City sent Petitioner a letter dated August
4 stating that Petitioner's appeal "cannot be further processed under the provisions of Senate
5 Bill 35 (Government Code Section 65913.4)," and that "the Director of Planning hereby

6 terminates all proceedings relative to the subject appeal. ..."
7 28. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or

about August 2, 2019, a Notice of Statutory Exemption was recorded by the City with the
9 County Clerk.

10 29. Petitioner, other interested groups, and individuals made oral and written
11 comments in opposition to the Project. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative POSL-LOLL WHH MVI D004 HESANURCY OGLRSEHL ARION SIE IELSHBATIS 3HL 12 remedies.

8 13 30. Petitioner has performed all conditions imposed by law precedent to filing 'Buapesed 14 this action, including complying with the requirement of Public Resources Code § 21167.5
15 by sending notice to the City that this action would be filed.
16 31. a Petitioner will also serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney
17 General as required by law.
18 32. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to it in the
19 ordinary course of law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner and the
20 public generally will suffer irreparable harm if the City is not required to comply with
21 CEQA and the LAMC's regulations, and to vacate and set aside the above-described
22 Project approvals.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
24 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines; Does Not Comply with CEQA)
25 33. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
26 Paragraphs 1 through 32, inclusive, of this Petition.
27 34. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to comply with the requirements
28 of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on the

•

1 project and associated environmental documentation. An agency must provide sufficient
2 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
3 consequences when acting on proposed projects.
4 35. The City's action in approving a Statutory Exemption for the Project
5 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the City failed to proceed in the manner

6 required by law.

7 36. On its face, the CEQA exemption relied upon by Respondents does not
8 apply to the Project. The City exempted the Project from CEQA pursuant to Government
9 Code § 65913.4(a), stating that under Public Resources Code § 21080(b)(1), the Project is
10 statutorily exempt from CEQA as a ministerial project.
JOA4 HEENAROY ERRA AON S 215 11 37. The statutory exemption identified by the City does not apply to the Project. 91101-1504 12 Government Code § 65913.4(a)(5) provides that the density of an SB 35-eligible

8 13 development shall comply with objective density standards in the zone and land use 'euapesed 14 designation "excluding any additional density granted pursuant to the Density Bonus
15 Law in Section 65915[.]" Nothing in the Density Bonus Law in Government Code
16 65915, however, authorizes the 66.5% density increase granted to the Project. By
17 attempting to squeeze the Project into a narrow CEQA exemption that, on its face, does not
18 apply, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA.
19 38. a As a result of the City's violations of CEQA, Petitioner has been harmed in
20 that Petitioner and other members of the public were not fully informed about the
21 significant environmental impacts of the Project prior to the City's approval of the Project
22 a as Statutorily Exempt as a ministerial development.
23 39. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its
24 discretion by adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and by
25 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, the City's approval of the finding
26 that the Project is Statutorily Exempt from CEQA, and approval of the Project and the
27 Land Use Entitlements, must be set aside. Petitioner as well as members of the general
28 public will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the

2 compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.
3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation Of Senate Bill (SB) 35, Government Code § 65913.4) §
5 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
6 Paragraphs 1 through 39, inclusive, of this Petition.

7 41. A Streamlined Infill Project is required to satisfy all of the objective
8 planning standards enumerated in Government Code $ 65913.4.
9 42. Government Code § 65913.4 provides that a development "shall be deemed
10 consistent with the objective zoning standards related to housing density, as applicable, if
11 the density proposed is compliant with the maximum density allowed within that land use POSL-LOI Doy WHL MVT € 'anuany o6uaJeN YUoN NFELSNEATIS SHE 12 designation[.]" SB 35 Guidelines § 300(c)(1) elaborates that a development is consistent

8 13 with density requirements if it includes "up to the maximum density allowed within the Pasadena, 14 land use element designation of the parcel" after accounting for a density bonus under a
15 Density Bonus Law.
16 43. The Project, however, is not eligible for streamlined approval because the
17 66.5% density increase utilizing the conditional use authority in LAMC § 12.24.U.26
18 exceeds the 35% maximum density increase authorized in Government Code § 65915. The
19 Project fails to comply with the applicable objective zoning standards, whether calculated
20 based on the R4 Zone or the High Density Land Use Designation, and thus is not eligible
21 for ministerial review pursuant to SB 35.
22 44. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based therein alleges, that the
23 subject property consists of 14,303 sq. ft. of lot area within the R4 Zone. The by-right base
24 density of the subject property at the R4 density is 36 units. A 35% density bonus permits
25 a maximum of 49 units. The property is also located within the Hollywood Community
26 Plan Arca and the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan Area, which designate the site for High
27 Density Residential uses corresponding to a density of 80 units per gross acre including
28 one-half of abutting streets. The gross area of the Project site is approximately 19,588 sq.

2 ft., yielding a permitted "by-right" density of 36 units, and 49 units with a 35% Density

3 Bonus. The Project is therefore inconsistent with the objective zoning standards as

4 enumerated in Government Code § 65913.4.

45.

5 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based therein alleges, that the City's

6 waiving of yard, height, floor area, parking and open space standards is also in violation of

7 SB 35 and Government Code § 65913.4 because those deviations from the objective

8 zoning standards are inconsistent with the purpose of streamlined review. Petitioner is

9 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City abused its discretion in that

Floor THE SILVERSTEI LAW FIRM APC the findings required in the LAMC for the Project were ignored and instead morphed and

11
POSL-LOLL transmuted into a combined set of "off-menu" incentives and other entitlements which

'anuany oBUBJEW 4UON 12 lack any discernible objective standard of review. Further, as to the findings that were

8 13

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

& 15 46. (Violation Of SB 1818; Code of Civ. Proc. §g 1094.5(b) and 1085)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
16 Paragraphs 1 through 45, inclusive, of this Petition.
17 47.

18 Pursuant to the directive set out in Government Code § 65915(a), §

19 Respondent has enacted an ordinance intended to
Government Code §§ implement the directives set out in
65915-65918 (the "SB 1818 Density Bonus Law"). That
20 implementation ordinance (LAMC §12.22.A.25) establishes two sub-categories of
21 "concessions" or "incentives" (i.e., relief from the City's zoning laws and site development
22 standards).

23 48.

24 "deemed" Category One constitutes a set of 8 "on-menu" incentives which are

25 to represent "concessions" or "incentives" that, by definition, automatically
result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. (LAMC §
26 12.22.A.25(f)). No economic pro-forma justifying the need for the "incentives" or
27 "concessions" is required.
28 49. Category Two consists of all other "incentives" or "concessions" requested
- 11 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 which are not "on-menu." (LAMC § 12.22.A.25(g)(3)). This category of "off-menu"

2 incentives requires the project proponent to submit "a pro-forma or other documentation to

4 make the Restricted Affordable Units economically feasible". LAMC §
5 12.25.A.25(g)(3)(i)(a).

6 50. Respondent City and CPC have violated the SB 1818 Density Bonus Law

7 § (Government Code § 65915) by approving the Project's "off-menu" incentive items which

8 was unsupported by a competent economic pro-forma which affirmatively demonstrated
9 how and why the density bonus "incentives" and "concessions" sought are needed in order

10 to economically provide for the construction and operation of the affordable units
loor 11 contemplated under the project, after taking into account the significant amount of
'enuesy 09L-40LL6 Vo 'euapeseç PNE SCY SILVERSTEI EA S 12 government subsidies provided, as noted above.

13 51. Petitioner contends that the documentation submitted by real parties in
14 support of the alleged need for the relief from the zoning and site development standards

15 was deficient and not competent in that the documentation failed to identify any specific or
16 identifiable cost reductions which affirmatively demonstrated how, if or to what extent the
17 "concessions" or "incentives" sought were needed in order to provide for the affordable
18 housing units identified, particularly in light of evidence placed into the record by

19 Petitioner that Real Party is taking an approximately $6 million profit from the Project,
20 including charging the City more than $4.2 million for the subject site that cost Real Party
21 only $200,250.

22 52. § Government Code § 65915 and LAMC § 12.22.A.25 prohibit the grant of a
23 Density Bonus if doing so will result in a specific adverse impact upon public health and
24 safety or the physical environment. Petitioner alleges that Respondents abused their
25 discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law by failing to acknowledge
26 exhaustive evidence placed into the record showing that Real Party has a pattern and

27 practice of introducing significant criminal activity near its project sites by its poor
28 management of its facilities, with indisputable specific impacts to public safety.

2 Petitioner further alleges that Respondents abused their discretion and failed
to act in the manner required by law by failing to acknowledge significant public health

4 risks that will be created by developing the Project immediately across from one of the
most congested roadway segments in North America, the 101 Freeway. As noted in
objections submitted into the record, cars and trucks release over 40 different toxic air
contaminants, including diesel particulate, benzene, formaldehyde, 1.3-butadiene and

8 acetaldehyde. Levels of these pollutants are generally concentrated within 1,500 feet of

9 freeways and very busy roadways. Air filtration, inoperable windows, and foliage are

10 therefore ineffective in mitigating these overwhelming and pernicious health risks,

POSL-LOLLE 6 North Marengo Avenue, 3'° Floor DAV HNSLNKOY ASE  SH especially in a development such as the Project that features an open courtyard.
11 a Furthermore, in a study published in December of 2010 and reported widely by the media,
12

8 13 researchers from the USC Keck School of Medicine and Children's Hospital Los Angeles

Pasadena 14 announced that children born to mothers who live within 1,000 feet of a freeway have

15 twice the risk of autism. This risk was consistent even when researchers controlled for

16 several other factors that may affect prenatal development.
54.

17 The City's findings ignore the specific adverse impacts to public health of

18 such exposure to potential residents of the Project. As noted by Petitioner in objections

19 submitted to the City, the County of Los Angeles will not fund affordable housing projects

20 within 500 feet of a freeway, in acknowledgement of such health risks.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, and Improper Grant of CUP)
55.

23 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

24 Paragraphs 1 through 54, inclusive, of this petition and complaint.
56.

25 Petitioner alleges that Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act

26 in the manner required by law by failing to review and otherwise exercise their discretion
to uphold the density restrictions of the Hollywood Redevelopment Plan, which limits
27 residential density at a the subject site to a maximum of 80 dwelling units per acre, in order
28 to ensure that new development projects is sensitive to land use and development criteria.

P 57. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
2 CRA/LA did not issue a clearance for Real Party's prior 60-unit TOC Project due to its
3 density exceeding the limitations of the Redevelopment Plan. Petitioner alleges that the
4 City's use of a Conditional Use permit under LAMC § 12.24.U.26 to increase the Project's §
5 allowed density by 66.5% is merely another illegal attempt to make an end run around the
6 Redevelopment Plan, and that on its face, the approval is in conflict with the objective
7 zoning standards requirement of SB 35 and Government Code § 65913.4.
