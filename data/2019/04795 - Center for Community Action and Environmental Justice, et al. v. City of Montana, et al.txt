PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Petitioners hereby alleges at follows:

2 I. INTRODUCTION
3 1.
4 CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE,

5 SIERRA CLUB and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (collectively, "Petitioners") petition

6 this Court for a writ of mandate and Order under Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 and 1085,

7

8 directed to Respondents, CITY OF FONTANA and FONTANA CITY COUNCIL, ("Respondents" or

9 the "City"), setting aside Respondent's approval of the massive West Valley Logistics Center, which

10 consists of seven warehouses totaling over 3.4 million square feet ("Project").

2.
11 Project approvals included Specific Plan Amendment No. 11-003, General Plan

12 Amendment No. 11-026, Zone Change No. 11-016, Development Agreement No.11-002, and

13 Tentative Parcel Map No. 19156 (TPM No 13-005) to change the General Plan land use designation

14 from Residential Planned Community (R-PC), Medium Density Residential (R-M), Multi-Family

15

16 Residential (R-MF), Recreational Facilities (P-R) to Light Industrial (I-L) and Open Space (OS) and a

17 Zone Change to change the Zoning istrict Map from Valley Trails Specific Plan to West Valley

18 Logistics Specific Plan. The application also includes a Specific Plan Amendment to change the land

19 use to industrial to facilitate the development of the seven warehouse buildings on 212.1 adjusted

20 gross acres.

21 3. A number of government agencies, nonprofit organizations, individuals, and even the

22 County of San Bernardino and neighboring cities submitted detailed comments expressing grave

23

24 concerns about the Project and its expected significant environmental impacts. The California Air

25 Resources Board, for example, expressed concern about the Project's air quality impacts, noting that

26 [f]reight facilities, such as warehouse/distribution facilities, are frequented daily by volumes of heavy-duty diesel truck and equipment that emit toxic diesel

27 emissions and contribute to regional pollution, as well as global climate change.

28 Residential homes are immediately adjacent to the east and south of the proposed Project site. In communities already impacted by diesel pollution from existing
freight operations, the proposed land use change will exacerbate the adverse 2

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 health impacts already experienced by these residents.

2 4. The agency and public comments raise a number a of serious concerns about the Project
and its expected environmental and public health impacts. The Project, moreover, will substantially
and disproportionately impact a community of color that is already besieged by numerous other large

6 industrial projects, including warehouse/distribution facilities, in the area.

5. Petitioners contend the EIR unlawfully failed to adequately analyze the Project's
environmental and public health impacts, including impacts to air quality, traffic, special status

9 wildlife, and wildlife movement. The thousands of daily truck trips generated by this Project will
10 significantly contribute to the area's polluted air, which is among the worst in the nation. In addition,
11 the Project will contribute very substantially to the unfolding climate disaster by generating very 12

13 substantial levels of Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") emissions. Lastly, Petitioners contend the Project was

14 required to but failed to adequately consider the project's impact a on a community of color.

15 6. In this action, Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to

16 set aside all Project approval and their certification of a Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")
17 for the Project.
18 II. PARTIES

7. Petitioner CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL
20

21 JUSTICE (CCAEJ) is a membership-based California non-profit environmental health and justice

22 organization with its primary membership residing in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties.

23 CCAEJ's core mission is to bring people together to improve their social and natural environment, and

24 to empower the community to create safer and healthier places to live, work, learn, and play. CCAEJ
25 has its physical office in Jurupa Valley, immediately adjacent to the Project site. Many of CCAEJ's
26 members live in Fontana, Jurupa Valley, or San Bernardino County in the vicinity of the Project.
27

28 CCAEJ has identified Jurupa Valley as a "community at risk" for a variety of environmental

3

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 injustices, particularly for bearing a disproportionate share of the impacts from high polluting

2 industries, heavy-duty diesel truck and other mobile source emissions, and suffering other disparities
3 created by zoning and discriminatory and irresponsible land use planning and decision-making.
4

5 CCAEJ, along with co-petitioners, submitted numerous comments to the City of Fontana regarding

6 this Project, thereby raising serious concerns about this Project's detrimental impacts on the health and

7 welfare of the local disadvantaged residents.

8 8. Petitioner Sierra Club is a national non-profit organization with approximately 600,000

9 members nationally, including over 7,000 members in the San Gorgonio Chapter. Sierra Club is
10 dedicated to exploring, enjoying, protecting the wild places of the earth, to participating and
11 encouraging protection of the environment and restoration of the quality of natural and human
12

13 environments. Members of the San Gorgonio Chapter of the Sierra Club live, work, and recreate in the

14 vicinity of the Project, and will be affected by its construction and operation. Sierra Club submitted

15 extensive comments concerning this Project, urging the City not to approve the Project until and

16 unless the serious CEQA violations are addressed.

17 9. Petitioner and Plaintiff CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (the "Center") is a
18 non-profit, public interest corporation with over 69,000 members with offices in Oakland, Los
19 Angeles, and Joshua Tree, California, as well as offices in Arizona, Oregon, Colorado, and 20

21 Washington, D.C. The Center and its members are dedicated to protecting diverse native species and

22 habitats through science, policy, education, and environmental law. Center members reside in and own

23 property throughout California as well as San Bernardino County. The Center and its members would

24 be directly, adversely and irreparably harmed by the Projects and its components, as described herein,
25 until and unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition. The Center brings this action
26 on its own behalf, for its members, and in the public interest.

III. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS
20

21 14. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions précedent to filing the instant action and

22 have exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, by inter alia,

23 submitting written comments on the project and its environmental review at every step of the

24 administrative review process.
25 15. Petitioners have requested that the City not approve this Project and certify the EIR. Any
26 further attempts to pursue administrative remedies would be futile.
27

28 16. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5

5

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondent prior to filing this

2 petition and complaint.
3 17. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7
4

5 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition/Complaint to the state

6 Attorney General.

7 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law unless

8 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to comply with their duties and
set aside the approval of the Project until they have prepared a legally sufficient EIR. In the absence
10 of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of CEQA.
11 19. If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project, and from undertaking acts in 12

13 furtherance thereof, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at

14 law in that the Project area and surrounding areas would be irrevocably altered and significant adverse

15 impacts on the environment would occur. Petitioners and the general public have also been harmed by

16 Respondents' failure to provide an environmental document that accurately and fully informs

17 interested persons of the Project's impacts.
18 20. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public
19 interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the general public, citizens of Fontana, Jurupa 20

21 Valley, San Bernardino County and the State of California, and will therefore be entitled to attorneys'

22 fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5.

23 21. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21168.5 and Code

24 of Civil Procedure § 1085 or 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a project be sët

25 aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either
26 where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner required by law or where its determination or
27

28 decision is not supported by substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their

6

P

2 discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to the law, and their decision is not
supported by substantial evidence.

IV.
4 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22. The proposed Project consists of the development and operation of the seven warehouse

6 buildings, totaling more than 3.4 million square feet, on 212.1 adjusted gross acres in the City of

7 Fontana.

8 23. The Project site is located within the southeastern portion of the City of Fontana, in the

10 southwest "Valley Region" of San Bernardino County. The site is bounded on the north by a Southern

11 California Edison (SCE) utility corridor, on the west by the Jurupa Hills, on the south by a residential

12 neighborhood in the City of Jurupa Valley, and on the east by the community of Bloomington in San

13 Bernardino County. The Jurupa Hills, a major landform in southern Fontana, are the natural backdrop

14 to the Specific Plan site and surrounding neighborhoods.

15

16 24. According to the Revised West Valley Specific Plan, the West Valley Logistics Center

17 consists of 291.31 acres, of which 212.11 acres is planned for warehouse/distribution logistics uses,

18 16.47 acres of which are within existing detention basins, approximately 55.23 acres of natural hillside

19. will be preserved in open space, and 7.5 acres will consist of roadways.

20 25. Because the Project site was originally designated for residential use, the City's approval of

21 the Project required wholesale revisions of the City's General Plan and West Valley Specific Plan.

22 Accordingly, Project approvals included Specific Plan Amendment No. 11-003, General Plan

23

24 Amendment No. 11-026, Zone Change No. 11-016, Development Agreement No.11-002, and

25 Tentative Parcel Map No. 19156 (TPM No 13-005) to change the General Plan land use designation

26 from Residential Planned Community (R-PC), Medium Density Residential (R-M), Multi-Family

27 Residential (R-MF), Recreational Facilities (P-R) to Light Industrial (I-L) and Open Space (OS) and a

28 Zone Change to change the Zoning District Map from Valley Trails Specific Plan to West Valley

7

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Logistics Specific Plan.

2 PROJECT SETTING and PROJECT IMPACTS
3 Air Quality
4

5 26. The Project is located in an area that is violation of the Clean Air Act's National Ambient

6 Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS"). The South Coast Air Basin is designated as an extreme

7 nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone standard, a moderate nonattainment area for the 2012

8 PM 2.5 (microparticulate) standard, a serious nonattainment area for the 2006 PM 2.5 standard, and a

9 moderate nonattainment area for the 1997 PM 2.5 standard'. According to state and local air agencies,
10 achieving attainment will require massive emissions reductions from all pollution sources, even in the
11 absence of any growth in emissions associated with new projects.
12

13 27. According to the EIR, the Project will introduce up 2,432 daily truck trips, of which the

14 EIR claims 60.3% will be 4+ axle trucks, 17.7% will be three-axle trucks, and 22% will be two-axle

15 trucks. According to CARB's public comments, the 2,432 figure is likely underestimated. Larger

16 trucks will generate significantly larger amounts of emissions of diesel particulate matter, or DPM,

17 greenhouse gasses (GHGs), and other pollutants compared to other vehicles. The EIR does not include
18 any adequate explanation of where these percentages were obtained. Owing to this failure, the EIR's
19 project description is inadequate and flawed because it is impossible to determine the diesel truck 20

21 emissions generated by this Project without accurate description of the number of each type of truck

22 that will be making deliveries to and from the Project.

23 28. The EIR admits the Project will exceed South Coast Air Quality Management District's

24 (SCAQMD) thresholds of significance for nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds
25 (VOCs), and will therefore cause a significant impact on air quality, but does not identify and analyze
26 a reasonable range of potentially feasible mitigation measures to reduce this impact to a less than
27

28 1 U.S. EPA, Nonattainment Areas for Criteria Pollutants (Green Book), available at https://www.epa.gov/green-book 8

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

significant level. Despite the inadequate analysis of mitigation measures, the City and the Final EIR

2 conclude that the significant impacts on air quality and climate change are "unavoidable."
3 29. Petitioners and other commentators and agencies identified a number of potentially feasible
4
mitigation measures to address the significant air quality and climate change impacts. The Final EIR

6 and the City rejected these proposed mitigation measures without any adequate analysis or discussion.

7 Suggested mitigation measures included mitigation measures previously suggested by the SCAQMD

8 for similar projects, those discussed by the EIR for the Kimball Business Park Project and climate

9 change mitigation measures suggested by CAPCOA's Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
10 Measures. See Response to Comments, Final EIR at 2-13. The Final EIR rejected these potentially
11 feasible mitigation measures without any adequate discussion or analysis.
12

13 30. As required by CEQA and recently confirmed by the California Supreme Court in Sierra

14 Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 402, the EIR was required to include a discussion of the

15 Project's health impact on the local residents. To this end, the City prepared a Health Risk Assessment

16 (HRA), which is discussed in the EIR. As set forth in public comments, the EIR's discussion of the
17 Project's public health impacts, and the HRA on which it is based, are-seriously flawed and do not
18 pass legal muster. The HRA fails, for example, to incorporate age-specific inhalation rates or to
19

20 analyze the differential impact of diesel emissions on infants and children.

21 31. The City concluded that the "minor increases in regional air pollution from project-

22 generated ROG [reactive organic gasses that can create ozone] and NOx, and CO would have nominal

23 or negligible impacts on human health." It is inconceivable that the addition of more than 2,400 daily

24 heavy-duty truck trips in the immediate vicinity of residential neighborhoods would result in only
25 "nominal or negligible" impacts on human health.
26 Climate Change
27

28 32. The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 mandates that greenhouse gas

9

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 emissions be reduced to 1990 levels by 2020. Despite the California legislature's unequivoca] mandate

2 that local planning decision-makers must specifically consider and address their planning decisions'
3 impacts on global climate change, the City failed to adequately analyze and mitigate this Project's
4

5 impacts on global warming.

6 33. The City concluded that owing to the Project's expected overall emission of 60,000 metric

7 tons of CO2 equivalents (MTCO2e) per year, which exceed the SCAQMD's recommended 3,000

8 MTCO2e threshold by a factor 20, the Project's impact on climate change would be significant.

9 34. The City concluded that the Project would result in a significant impact on climate change
10 also because the Project will conflict with applicable regulatory plans, policies, and regulations
11 intended to reduce GHG emissions. In particular, the City concluded the Project conflicts with the
12

13 ARB 2017 Scoping Plan Update, a which sets a 2030 target of 40% reductions below 1990 levels,

14 consistent with Executive Order B-3014 and SB 32. The EIR contends the Project will comply with

15 every component of the 2017 Scoping Plan Update, but concludes, however, that the Project would

16 a result in a significant impact on account of conflicts with the 2017 Scoping Plan Update's target

17 because the Project exceeds the numerical threshold and would result in a cumulatively significant
18 impact. The EIR fails as an informational document because its analysis of the Project's consistency
19
with the 2030 40% reduction target is wholly inadequate.
20

21 35. The EIR fails to consider, let alone establish Project consistency with other significant state

22 GHG policies and plans. For instance, without any adequate explanation the GHG emissions analysis

23 fails to establish consistency with Executive Order S-3-05, which requires a reduction in GHG

24 emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
25 36. The EIR and the City conclude that "no feasible mitigation measures exist that would
26 reduce project-related emissions to levels that are less-than-significant." (Recirculated Draft EIR
27

28 [RDEIR] at 4.2.7-42.) This contention is based on a misstatement of the applicable CEQA standard,

10

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

pursuant to which, where the lead agency concludes an impact is be significant effect, it must adopt all

2 feasible mitigation measures to reduce that effect, even if the effect would remain significant. The
3 City's conclusion that it could not adopt mitigation measures to reduce GHG emissions from mobile
sources is not supported by substantial evidence. Petitioners supplied the City with several examples

6 of such mitigation measures that could effectively reduce the Project's GHG emissions.

7 Biological Resources

37. As set forth above, the Project site abuts a large, relatively intact open space area. The EIR

0 claims that there are "no existing habitat features that occur between Rattlesnake Mountain and the
10 Jurupa Hills that would be expected to support a wildlife movement corridor." (RDEIR at 4.2.3-16.)
11 However, a local expert explained the City's position incorrectly assumes this area lacks the necessary 12

13 features to serve as a wildlife a movement corridor for avian species, when, in fact, wildlife corridors

14 are often forced corridors resulting from human land development. (RDEIR, Appx. B3 at PDF 16.)

15 Similarly, the RDEIR incorrectly claims that the Project area "does not represent an opportunity for

16 avian movement between undeveloped areas in the Jurupa Hills and Rattlesnake Mountain, and the
17 project site in its current condition does not provide an east-west movement corridor for avian
18 species." (RDEIR at 4.2.3-28.) These claims are not supported by any evidence, and were refuted by
19
the expert opinions of Dr. Smallwood and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW"). 20

21 (See CDFW Letter at RDEIR, Appx. B3 at 79-83.) This statement is even at odds with an carlier

22 version of the RDEIR, which stated "The project site is currently the only open space connecting the

23 native Riversidean Sage Scrub (RSS) habitats in the Jurupa Hills and Rattlesnake Mountain.

24 38. The EIR's conclusion regarding the absence of the federally-listed California coastal

25 gnatcatcher is not supported by substantial evidence because the City never bothered to undertake a
26 protocol level survey for this species. The EIR, moreover, misleadingly claims that undisturbed
27

28 gnatcatcher habitat "that meets the Critical Habitat definition occurs exclusively within the proposed

11

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 conservation area," when in fact most of the Project site is designated gnatcatcher critical habitat. The

2 EIR fails to address the Project's impacts to gnatcatcher critical habitat and to gnatcatcher recovery.
3 As a result of these deficiencies, the EIR's conclusion that the impact on the gnatcatcher would be less
4

5 than significant is not supported by substantial evidence.

O N 39. The EIR's analysis of the Project impacts on the burrowing owl (a California species of

special concern) is inadequate. The burrowing owl survey was not conducted during the breeding

8 season and was otherwise not based on the established protocol. Despite the fact that one owl was

9 detected and the EIR admits the site contains suitable owl habitat, the EIR improperly deferred
10 protocol surveys until after Project approval.
11 40. Likewise, the EIR's analysis of the Project impacts on the federally-listed Delhi Sands
12

13 flower-loving fly is inadequate. Adequate surveys for this species were never conducted.

14 41. The EIR does not include any adequate mitigation measures to address potential impacts

15 on special status plants. The EIR improperly defers the formulation of such mitigation measures until

16 after Project approval, albeit without identifying any performance criteria or analysis of whether

17 mitigation would be feasible, as required by CEQA.
18 Environmental Justice
19
42. Environmental justice is the fair treatment of people of all races, cultures, and incomes 20

21 with respect to the development, adoption, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws,

22 regulations, and policies. Senate Bill ("SB") 115; Cal. Gov. Code § 65040.12(e). The Project has an

23 environmental justice impact because it would disproportionately affect a minority population or a

24 low-income population.

25 43. The California Department of Justice, through the Office of the Attorney General, released
26 a report in 2012 entitled "Environmental Justice at the Local and Regional Level-Legal Background"
27

28 ("report") which interprets existing CEQA law as imposing several environmental justice obligations

12

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 on local governments. According to the report, while CEQA does not use the term "environmental

3 justice", it centers on "whether or not a proposed project may have a "significant effect on the

4 environment.3 Pub. Res. Code. § 21000(b). A "project may have a 'significant effect on the

5 environment if, among other things, "[t]he environmental effects of a project will cause substantial

6 adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly." Pub. Res Code. § 21083(b)(3). An EIR

7

8 shall identify and focus on the significant environmental effects of a proposed projèct. 14 Cal. Code

9 Regs., (hereinafter cited as "CEQA Guidelines") § 15126.2(a). The discussion should include

10 "population concentration, the human use of the land..., health and safety problems" and "[t]he EIR

11 shall also analyze any significant environmental effects the project might cause by bringing

12 development and people into the area affected." Id.

13 44. The EIR does not include any analysis of the Project's environmental justice impacts or

14 disparate impacts on a community disproportionately comprised of people of color.

15 PROCEDURAL HISTORY

16

17 45. A Draft EIR for the West Valley Logistics Center Specific Plan (WVLCSP") was made

18 available for public comment beginning on April 22, 2014 and ending on June 5, 2014. After

19 receiving extensive public comments, the City decided to recirculate the entire Draft EIR pursuant to

20 the provisions of CEQA Guidelines § 5088.5 (a). A Recirculated Draft EIR was made available for

21 public comment beginning on December 18, 2014, and ending on February 2, 2015.

22

23 46. The City received extensive comments from the agencies and the public. Based on these

24 comments, the applicant revised the proposed project by altering the routing of trucks between the

25 project site and area freeways. Largely as a result of these revisions, the EIR's analysis of the Project's

26 traffic impact analysis, air quality, greenhouse gas, and noise were revised and the EIR was

27 recirculated for a second time. a

28 47. The Second Recirculated Draft EIR was circulated for 45 days, from February 5, 2018 to

13

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 March 23, 2018. In October 2018, the City released a Final EIR, consisting of the comments and

3 responses to comments on the Draft EIR, First Recirculated Draft EIR, and Second Recirculated Draft

4 EIR; revisions to the Second Recirculated Draft EIR; and an erratum making minor, non-substantive

5 changes to the Final EIR.

6 48. The Planning Commission held public hearings on December 18, 2018 and January 15,

7

8 2019, and recommended that the City Council approve the Project, subject to all conditions of

approval adopted and mandated by the City Council, with a further recommendation that the City

10 Council not approve the Project until street improvements consistent with mitigation measures TRA-

11 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, and 1E have been approved and agreed to by the various jurisdictions.

12 49. On March 12, 2019, the City Council held a public hearing and approved the Project,

13 certified the Final EIR, and adopted findings in support of the Project approval.

14 CEQA MANDATES

15

16 50. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document and

17 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made. Pub. Res.

18 Code § 21000, and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding

19 criterion in public decisions." Pub. Res. Code § 21001(d) "CEQA was intended to be interpreted in

20 such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

Pub. Res. C § 21000.

2 51. The lead agency must identify all potentially significant impacts of the project, and must
therefore consider all the evidence in the administrative record, not just its initial study. Pub. Res.
Code § 21080 (c), (d), § 21082.2. The CEQA Guidelines direct lead agencies to conduct an Initial 5

6 Study to "determine if the project may have a significant on the environment." § 15063(a). "All phases

7 of the project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in the Initial Study".

8 CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a)(1). Besides the direct impacts, the lead agency must also consider

9 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes in the environment in the area in which significant
10 effects would occur, directly or indirectly. See CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d) & § 15360; see also
11 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn, supra, 47 Cal. Ed at 392.
12

13 52. An a indirect impact is a physical change in the environment, not immediately related to the

14 project in time or distance, but caused indirectly by the project and reasonably foreseeable. CEQA

15 Guidelines § 15064(d)(2) & § 15358(a)(2). Indirect impacts to the environment caused by a project's

16 economic or social effects must be analyzed if they are "indirectly caused by the project, are
17 reasonably foreseeable, and are potentially significant." CEQA Guidelines § 15064(d)-(e). A lead
18 agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the development or other activity that will
19
ultimately result from an initial approval. City of Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 CA3d 1325 20

21 (emphasis added). The guidelines specifically require that an Initial Study must consider "all phases of

22 project planning, implementation, and operation." CEQA Guidelines § 15063(a)(1).

23 53. The EIR must contain a sufficient degree of analysis to provide the decision-makers with

24 enough information to make an intelligent decision. CEQA Guidelines § 15151. The analysis in the §
25 EIR must be sufficient to connect the dots between facts and conclusion; it may not include the
26 agency's bare conclusions or opinions. Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52
27

28 Cal.3d 553, 568. "The grounds upon which an administrative agency has acted must be 'clearly

3 disclosed and adequately sustained." San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society, Inc. v. County of San

Bernardino (1984) 55 Cal.App.3d 738, 752.

A
Un 54. CEQA requires that agencies "mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment

7 of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so." Pub. Res. Code §

8 21002.1(b); Napa Citizens for Honest Gov't v. Napa County Bd. Of Supervisors ("Napa") (2001) 91

9 Cal.App.4th 342, 360 ("the EIR must propose and describe mitigation measures that will minimize the

10 significant environmental effects that the EIR has identified.)" "CEQA does not authorize an agency

11 to proceed with a project that will have significant, unmitigated effects on the environment, based

12

13 simply on a weighing of those effects against the project's benefits, unless the measures necessary to

14 mitigate those effects are truly infeasible." City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of the California State

15 University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368-369. Because the EIR admits the Project's cumulative impact

16 on climate change and air quality will be significant, the EIR was required to consider and impose all

17 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce this impact to the extent feasible.
55. Where the CEQA environmental process

18 was procedurally or substantively defective,

19

20 reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates

21 may not have resulted in a different outcome. Pub. Res. Code § 21005(a). For example, the Court in

22 Citizens to Preserve Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421, 428 held that the

23 certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental impacts of the project

24 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with the mandates of CEQA

25 would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund y. LAFCO (1987) 191

26 Cal.App.3d 886, 897-8, went so far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA procedural

27 requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford

28 (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692 explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if "the failure to

include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation,

16

thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process." Id., at 712.

2 56. CEQA's environmental review process is intended to provide the public with assurances

that "the agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions."
4
Laurel Heights Improvement Ass. v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3rd 376,

6 392. The function of the environmental review, then, is not merely to result in informed decision
making on the part of the agencies, it is also to inform the public so they can respond to an action with

8 which they disagree. Id.

11 57. Petitioners refer to and incorporate herein by this reference paragraphs 1-56, inclusive, of 12

13 this Petition as though fully set forth herein.

14 58. The Final EIR fails to adequately describe the Project setting and to establish the

15 environmental baseline. The EIR fails, for example, to adequately describe the suitability of the

16 habitat for harboring special status species such as the gnatcatcher, or to serve as a critical wildlife

17 movement corridor. The EIR's analysis of the environmental baseline does not include reliable
18 protocol level surveys for special-status species.
19

20 59. The EIR fails to adequately analyze Project's environmental impacts, including but not

21 limited to impacts on air quality and related public health impacts, biological resources, climate

22 change, energy use, traffic and noise. The Final EIR, moreover, fails to adequately analyze the

23 Project's cumulative or potential growth-inducing impacts.

24 60. The EIR fails to adequately analyze, discuss and propose potentially feasible mitigation
25 measures to address the Project's potentially significant impacts, including mitigation measures to
26 address the Project's impacts on air quality, biological impacts, climate change, traffic and noise. In
27

28 some cases, formulation of mitigation measures are improperly deferred without any discussion of the

17

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- feasibility of mitigation or identifying performance criteria.

2

3 61. The EIR fails to include an adequate analysis of the Projects' environmental justice

4 implications or the Project's potential to impact communities comprised primarily of people of color

5 or socio-economically disadvantaged communities.

6 62. The EIR fails to adequately and in good faith respond to public and agency comments.

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment against the City, as set forth herein below.:

10 (1) That the Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate commanding

11 Respondent the City of Fontana and Fontana City Council to set aside, invalidate and

12 void all approvals in connection with the West Valley Logistics Project;

13 (2) The City set aside its certification of the EIR for the West Valley Logistics Project;

14 (3) For declaratory judgment, stating that the actions of Respondents in approving West

15 Valley Logistics Project and certifying the EIR were in violation of CEQA;

16

17 (4) For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction

18 prohibiting any actions by Respondents and/or Real Parties in Interest pursuant to the

19 approval of West Valley Project until Respondents have fully complied with the

20 California Environmental Quality Act, all other applicable state, local laws and

21 requirements

22 (5) For an award of costs and attorney's fee, and

23

24 (6) For an award of such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

RE: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation against the City of Fontana to set aside the City's approval of the West Valley Logistics Project and the certification of the Final
Recirculated EIR therefor.

This letter serves as CENTER FOR COMMUNITY ACTION AND'ENVIRONMENTAL 1540 Marsh Street JUSTICE, SIERRA CLUB and CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY'S (Petitioners) Sue110 notice of intent to commence litigation against the City of Fontana and Fontana City Council
San Luis Obispo ("City") for violating the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code
California 93401 §21000 et seq., in connection with the City's approval of the West Valley Logistics (the
ph: 805-593-0926 "Project"). Project approvals included Specific Plan Amendment No. 11-003, General Plan Amendment No. 11-026, Zone Change No. 11-016, Development Agreement No.11-002, and fax: 805-593-0946 Tentative Parcel Map No. 19156 (TPM.No 13-005) to change the General Plan land use designation from Residential Planned Community (R-PC), Medium Density Residential (R-M),
babaknaficy@sbcglobal.net Multi-Family Residential (R-MF), Recreational Facilities (P-R) to Light Industrial (I-L) and Open Space (OS) and a Zone Change to change the Zoning District Map from Valley Trails Specific Plan to West Valley Logistics Specific Plan.
Petitioners contend the City violated CEQA in large part because the Final Environmental
Impact Report does not adequate analyze the Project setting and impacts, and does not include an adequate discussion of mitigation measures,
