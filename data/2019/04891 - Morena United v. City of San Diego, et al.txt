Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of San Diego ("City" or
3  "Respondent") of the Morena Corridor Specific Plan ("Plan" or "Project"), and the related failure to

4 comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code ยง 21000, et seq.

5 2. Among other things, the City failed to consider the environmental impacts associated with

6 the Plan, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider and

7 adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation.

8 3. Additionally, the City failed to comply with its own General Plan, Climate Action Plan,

9 Clairemont Mesa Community Plan, and Linda Vista Community Plan.

10 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals

11 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

12 PARTIES

13 5. Petitioner Morena United is an unincorporated association of residents, business owners,

14 and property owners within the City of San Diego who live in or do business in and around the Plan

15 area, and who seek to protect health and safety, preserve aesthetic qualities, preserve the unique

16 character of the City of San Diego, protect pedestrian safety, ensure reasonable traffic and circulation,
17 protect public views and spaces, and otherwise protect the community and environment. Petitioner

18 believes that reasonable growth may be accomplished in the City of San Diego while preserving the

19 quality of life of the area affected by the Plan. Petitioner and its members have been and will be injured as

20 a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, rely on, enjoy and benefit from the
21 resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the aesthetic,

22 recreational, economic, environmental, and health and safety interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's

23 members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be

24 adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress

25 Petitioner's and Petitioner's members' injuries.

26 6. Respondent City of San Diego is a political subdivision of the State of California and a body

27 corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of

28 the State of California.

Morena United v. City of San Diego Page 2

1 7. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

2 Does through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioners will amend

3 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

4 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

5 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

6 8. The Plan states: "The Specific Plan area is approximately 280 acres along Morena

7 Boulevard and West Morena Boulevard between Clairemont Drive and Friars Road To the west, the

8 Specific Plan area is bounded by the railroad right-of-way and Interstate 5 (I-5). To the north and east,

9 the Specific Plan area is shaped by the sloping topography and cohesive single-family residential
10 neighborhoods in Clairemont Mesa; the University of San Diego (USD); and multifamily and student

11 housing in Linda Vista. To the south is the San Diego River and Interstate 8 (I-8), which separate the

12 Specific Plan area from Old Town San Diego and Mission Valley."

13 9. The City has represented that the intent of the Plan is to transform the Plan area into a

14 pedestrian-oriented village with various land uses, including commercial and residential uses, linked
15 together by pedestrian and bicycling facilities. The Plan provides separate policies and development

16 regulations beyond those included the Clairemont Mesa Community Plan and Linda Vista Community

17 Plan. The City has also represented that the Plan was intended to further and implement the goals and

18 policies of the City's General Plan, Clairemont Mesa Community Plan, and Linda Vista Community

19 Plan, and, among other things, provides specific criteria for the development of mixed-use "villages"

20 within the Plan area. In addition, the City has represented that the Plan seeks to implement the goals

21 and strategies of the City's Climate Action Plan, including among other things increasing housing near
22 transportation facilities and improving access and facilities for transit.

23 10. In July 2017, a draft of the Plan was made available for public review. Subsequent drafts of

24 the Plan were made available in August 2018 and January 2019.

25 11. The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") was published for public comment on or

26 about August 1, 2018. Comments submitted on the DEIR, including from Petitioner's members,

27 noted, among other things, concerns about the Plan's impacts on transportation and circulation,

28 parking, water supply, visual effects, community character, historical and tribal cultural resources,

Morena United v. City of San Diego Page 3
Writ Petition

1 noise, air quality, energy, public services and utilities, cumulative impacts, greenhouse gas emissions,

2 and parks and recreation facilities. Comments also noted concerns about impacts to land use, water

3 quality, building heights, and economic impacts related to the loss of jobs and commercial spaces. In

4 addition, comments noted concerns about additional strains on already underperforming roadways, and

5 concerns about public health and safety, including among other things, the Plan's impacts to fire

6 hazards and inadequate analysis of evacuation planning. Comments also noted inconsistencies with

7 the Clairemont Mesa Community Plan, the Linda Vista Community Plan, and the Climate Action

8 Plan; as well as a lack of adequate analysis of impacts to transportation and circulation, inadequate

9 analysis of various Plan elements related to mobility, inadequate provisions for affordable housing,

10 concerns about the City's failure to comply with CEQA's procedural requirements, and the need to

11 recirculate the DEIR. Moreover, San Diego Association of Governments recommended additional

12 policies and steps to address issues related to mobility, transportation, and parking.

13 12. The Final EIR ("FEIR") was published on or about February 1, 2019, and another draft of

14 the Plan and an errata to the FEIR were made available for public review in July 2019.

15 13. Numerous comments, including from Petitioner, were received regarding the Plan and

16 raised additional concerns about the FEIR. Comments noted, among other things, the Plan's violations

17 of the General Plan and community plans, the Plan's impacts to air quality, energy, noise, historical

18 and tribal cultural resources, greenhouse gas emissions, paleontological resources, parks and recreation

19 facilities, water quality, visual effects and neighborhood character, transportation and mobility, fire

20 hazards, public health and safety, public facilities, water supply, and the Plan's cumulative impacts. In

21 addition, comments noted the Plan's failure to ensure adequate affordable and inclusionary housing.

22 14. Comments also noted the EIR's failure to adopt feasible mitigation measures, failure to

23 address and/or analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, and failure to address foreseeable impacts.

24 15. Comments also noted that the Plan was inconsistent with the City's adopted Climate Action

25 Plan and with its adopted Recreation Element and Strategic Framework Element of the General Plan.

26 16. Comments also noted the FEIR's failure to address comments.

27 17. Comments also noted the Plan's inconsistencies with the Climate Action Plan.

28

Writ Petition

18. On February 21, 2019, the Planning Commission met to consider the Plan and the EIR.
2 Testimony was received regarding numerous concerns. Comments, including from Petitioner's

3 members, noted concerns about, among other things, impacts to land use, visual effect and

4 neighborhood character, growth inducement, parking, and traffic. Comments also noted concerns

5 about inadequate public facilities and infrastructure related to, among other things, storms drains and

6 water quality. In addition, comments noted concerns about inadequate provisions for affordable

7 housing, and about new height regulations inconsistent with the Linda Vista Community Plan area.

8 Despite these concerns and the many that had been previously raised, the Planning Commission voted

9 to recommend to the City Council certification of the EIR and approval of the Plan.

10 19. The City's Planning Department Staff Report to the City Council dated July 18, 2019

11 ("Staff Report"), stated that the Clairemont Mesa Community Planning Group voted: "to recommend

12 approval of the draft Morena Corridor Specific Plan with the following conditions: Implementation of

13 the Low-Density Alternative" The Clairemont Mesa Community Planning Group's recommendation

14 also included conditions addressing concerns about preservation of existing height limits, infrastructure
15 improvements, and transportation, circulation, and mobility impacts. The Staff Report also explained

16 that the Linda Vista Planning Group voted to recommend: "City Council either (1) postpone adoption

17 of the Specific Plan until the Council has provided by ordinance for significantly greater inclusionary

18 housing requirement in San Diego than current law requires, or (2) the Morena Corridor Specific Plan

19 be amended to require for all projects in the Plan Area a significantly greater inclusionary housing

20 requirement than current law requires."

21 20. On August 1, 2019, the City Council met to consider the Plan and EIR. Testimony,
22 including from Petitioner's members, was received regarding numerous concerns. Comments noted,

23 among other things, concerns about inadequate affordable housing in the Plan, impacts to air quality,

24 transportation and mobility, land use, and parking. Comments also noted the EIR's failure to mitigate

25 significant impacts and failure to adopt a feasible range of alternatives. City Councilmember Jennifer

26 Campbell, whose district covers the entire Plan area, noted concerns about the Plan's impacts to

27 housing supply, community character, and inadequate consideration of public participation. Despite

28 these concerns, the City Council voted to approve the Plan and certify the EIR.
