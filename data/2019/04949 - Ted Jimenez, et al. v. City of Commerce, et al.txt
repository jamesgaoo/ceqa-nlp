VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

1.
2 This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the City of Commerce's ("Respondent" or "City") July 3,
2019 action (and all subsequent actions) approving the Citadel Outlets Expansion and 10-Acre
3 Development Project (*Project"), and certification of the Project' of an Environmental Impact Report
4 (State Clearinghouse No. 2018121041), finding that the Project may result in potentially significant
5 impacts under certain thresholds, but that any such impacts will be mitigated.
6 2. In approving the Project, Respondent violated the California Environmental Quality Act,

7 Cal. Pub Res. Code § 21000 et seq; State Planning and Zoning Law, Cal. Government Code § 65000 et

8 seq; and the City of Commerce General Plan.

9 THE PROJECT

10 3. The Project is located in the City of Commerce at or near the site of the Citadel Outlets

11 shopping complex, and generally runs along Telegraph Road, between Hoefner Avenue on the west and
Washington Boulevard on the east. ("Project Site") The Project Site consists of three distinct areas
12 referred to as Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3, defined as follows:
13 a. Area 1 includes the existing Citadel Outlets shopping center complex. The Assessor's
14 Parcel Numbers that are applicable to 1 Area 1 include 6336-019-030, 6336-019-031,
15 6336-019-033, 6336-019-034, 6336-024-017, and 6336-024-018.

16 b. Area 2 consists of approximately 26 acres and is located east of the existing Citadel

17 shopping complex and continuing easterly for an approximate distance of 2,100 feet.

18 Gaspar Avenue is the demarcation between Area 1 and Area 2. The Assessor's Parcel

19 Numbers that are applicable to Area 2 include 6336-018-920, 6336-018-805, and 6336-
017-908.
20
C. Area 3 consists of approximately 10 acres of land located on the northwest corner of
21 Washington Boulevard and Telegraph Road. Washington Boulevard extends along the
22 east side of Area 3, while Telegraph Road extends along the south side. The Assessor's
23 Parcel Number that is applicable 3 to Area 3 is 6336-010-908.

24 d. The industrial uses located along the west side of Tubeway Avenue and the Commerce

25 Casino and Hotel are not part of the Project, and, as a result, are located outside of the

26 Project Site.

27 4. The Project would enable the development of 1,007,202 square feet of new development

28 and establish new regulations for future development within the Project Site.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

PARTIES

5.
2 Petitioner Ted Jimenez is an individual who lives, works and recreates in the area in and
around the Project Site and would be affected by the traffic, noise and other significant environmental
3 effects of the Project.
4 6. Petitioner SOUTHWEST REGIONAL COUNCIL OF CARPENTERS ("Petitioner") is
5 a labor union representing 50,000 union carpenters in six states, including in southern California, and
6 has a strong interest in well ordered land use planning and addressing the environmental impacts of
7 development projects, such as the Project. Southwest Regional Council of Carpenters submitted

8 comments on the Project that addressed the inadequacies of Respondent's environmental review and

9 violation of zoning and land use requirements.

10 7. Defendant and Respondent City of Commerce (*Respondent" or "City") is a city located

11 in Los Angeles County, California. The City is responsible for all project approvals and prepared and

12 certified the Intial Study and Environmental Impact Report for the Project. The City is the Lead
Agency within the meaning of Public Resources Code, section 21067.
13 8. Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
14 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using
15 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities

16 when ascertained.

17 9. Real Party in Interest Citadel Holdings Group, LLC ("Real Party") is a Delaware limited

18 liability company listed on the Notice of Determination as the Project applicant and Real Party in

19 Interest. On information and belief, and on this basis, Petitioners allege Citadel Holdings Group, LLC

20 applied for and received the approvals from Respondent for the Project.
10. Real Party in Interest Was-Tel Commerce, LLC ("Real Party") is listed on the Notice of
21 Determination as the Project applicant and Real Party in Interest. On information and belief, and on this
22 basis, Petitioners allege Was-Tel Commerce, LLC applied for and received the approvals from
23 Respondent for the Project.

24 11. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

25 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using

26 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities

27 when ascertained.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
28 12. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") sections 1085 and 1094.5 and

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

California Public Resources Code ("PRC") sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has

2 jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondent's decisions to (a) certify the Initial
Study, (b) adopt an Environmental Impact Report, and (c) purportedly approve the Project.
13. This court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Government Code §§ 54960,
4 54960.1, and 54960.2.
5 14. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project Site lies entirely within the County of
6 Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause
7 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (Cal. Code of Civil Procedure

8 ("CCP") § 393; Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.)

9 15. Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to CCP §§ 394 (actions against a city, county

10 or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since Respondent is a city in the County of Los Angeles.
16.
11 This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondent's decision to issue a Notice
of Determination in accordance with PRC § 21167 (a).
12 17. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to Respondents
13 in compliance with PRC § 21167.5, a true and correct copy of and are including which the notice and
14 proof of service as are attached hereto as Exhibit A.
15 18. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of its election to prepare the record of
16 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with PRC § 21167.6 or other

17 applicable laws, a true and correct copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

18 19. Petitioner has concurrently filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC §

19 21167.4, a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
20. Petitioner has concurrently filed and served notice of this lawsuit to the California
20 Attorney General in compliance with PRC § 21167.7 and CCP § 388, a true § § and correct copy of which
21 notice is attached hereto as Exhibit D.
22 21. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has
23 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC § 21177. Petitioner and/or
24 other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in

25 writing during the Respondent's decision-making process.

26 22. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

27 Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this

28 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and
those of its supporting members.

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 23. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

2 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside the certification of

3 the Project and the supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies,
Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner and its
4 members.

5 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK
6 California Environmental Quality Act

7 24. The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. Pub. Res. Code, §§ 21000, et seq

8 ("CEQA") requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant environmental

9 impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

10 25. CEQA requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed

11 actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). The EIR is the very
heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost
12 principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the
13 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."
14 a (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
15 26. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and
16 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code of Regs., §

17 15002, subd. (a)(1).)! "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

18 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only

19 the environment but also informed self-government.™* (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors
(1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
20 purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have
21 reached ecological points of no return."(Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001)
22 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.)
23 27. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

24 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.

25 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.)

26 The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of

27 a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly

28
14 CCR 15000 et seq. are referred to herein as the "CEQA Guidelines"
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 reduced." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002 (a)(2).)
28.
2 To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered

3 structure. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002 (k); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of
Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 - 86.) First, if a project falls into an exempt category,
4 or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect on the
5 environment, no further agency evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if there is a possibility the project
6 will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial study.

7 (Id.; CEQA Guidelines, § 15063 (a).) If the study indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the

8 project may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a negative declaration.

9 (Id., CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063 (b)(2), 15070.) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on

10 the environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)

11 Environmental Impact Reports & The Substantial Evidence Standard
29. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
12 proposed actions in an EIR (except in certain limited circumstances). (See, e.g., PRC § 21100.)
13 30. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th
14 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be
15 read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the
16 statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98,

17 109.)

18 31. A lead agency may not approve a project if that project will have a significant effect on

19 the environment unless it has first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate or substantially

20 lessen all significant impacts of the project. (PRC § 21002.1(a), (b).)
32. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead
21 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
22 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC $21002.1(c).)
23 33. If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve
24 the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the

25 environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are

26 "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (PRC § 21081; CEQA Guidelines § 15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).)

27 34. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the reviewing

28 court is not to 'uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project proponent in support
of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.""*

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 (Berkeley Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v.

2 Regents of University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12.) Drawing this line and determining

3 whether the EIR complies with CEQA's information disclosure requirements presents a question of law
subject to independent review by the courts. (Sierra Club v. Cnty. of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal. 5th 502, 515;
4 Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. V. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102, 131.)
5 35. When challenging an agency's certification of an EIR under CEQA, abuse of discretion

6 is established if the agency: (1) has not a proceeded in a manner required by law, or, (2) if the
7 determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21168.5.)

8 Substantial evidence is defined as "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this

9 information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions

10 might also be reached." (CEQA Guidelines so 15384(a).) Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable

11 assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinion supported by facts; however, it does not include
argument, speculation, or unsubstantiated opinion or narrative. (PRC §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c).)
12 Environmental Impact Report Recirculation Standard
13
36.
14 Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification is addressed in CEQA § 21092.1, and

15 CEQA Guidelines §15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an environmental impact

16 report after notice has been given pursuant to Section 21092 ... but prior to certification, the public

17 agency shall give notice again pursuant to Section 21092, and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104

18 and 21153 before certifying the environmental impact report." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21092.1.)
37. "Significant new information" includes:
19

20 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from

21 a new mitigation' measure proposed to be implemented.
(2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result...
22 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different from
23 others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant environmental
24 impacts of the project.
25 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory

26 in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

27 (CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n (1989) 214

28 Cal.App.3d 1043.)

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 38. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. V. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112

2 ("Laurel Heights IP'), the Supreme Court explained that Section 21092 favors EIR recirculation
prior to certification. The Court stated:
3 Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment. (See State Bar
4 Rep., supra, at p. 28.) Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR
5 commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically inadequate or
6 conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect meaningless triggers recirculation

7 under section 21092.1. (See, Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 214

8 Cal.App.3d 1043.

9 (Laurel Heights 11, 6 Cal.4th at 1130 (emph. added).)

10 Final Approval and Notice of Determination

39.
11 Approval of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the agency

12 to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out."(CEQA Guidelines §
15226(a).
13 40. A Notice of Decision is only valid if the agency (1) approves the project in a manner
14 that "commits to a definite course of action" and (2) the agency is "legally bound to take that course of
15 action." (Cty. of Amador v. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) ("County

16 of Amador"), citing CEQA Guidelines § 15352(a) (approval of a project means "the decision by a

17 public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to

18 be carried out").)
41.
19 A "notice of [decision] cannot be filed until after the project is approved." (76 Cal. App.

20 4th at 963). Project approval while a project is still subject negotiation and change is invalid. (See id. at
965.)
21 General Plan Consistency
22 42. Each California city and county must adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan
23 governing development. (Napa Citizens for Honest Gov. V. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91
24 Cal.App.4th 342, 352, citing Gov. Code §§ 65030, 65300.) The general plan sits at the top of the land

25 use planning hierarchy (see DeVita V. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773), and serves as a

26 "constitution" or "charter" for all future development. (Lesher Communications, Inc. V. City of Walnut

27 Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.)
43.
28 General plan consistency is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws;
it is the principle which infused the concept of planned growth with the force of law." (See Debottari v.

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Norco City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.)
44.
2 State law mandates two levels of consistency. First, a general plan must be internally or

3 "horizontally" consistent: its elements must "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and
compatible statement of policies for the adopting agency." (See Gov. Code § 65300.5; Sierra Club v.
4 Bd. of Supervisors (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 698, 704.) A general plan amendment thus may not be
5 internally inconsistent, nor may it cause the general plan as a whole to become internally inconsistent.
6 (See DeVita, 9 Cal.4th at 796 fn. 12.)

7 45. Second, state law requires "vertical" consistency, meaning that zoning ordinances and

8 other land use decisions also must be consistent with the general plan. (See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2)

9 [land uses authorized by zoning ordinance must be "compatible with the objectives, policies, general

10 land uses, and programs specified in the [general] plan."]; see also Neighborhood Action Group v.

11 County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184.) A zoning ordinance that conflicts with the
general plan or impedes achievement of its policies is invalid and cannot be given effect. (See Lesher,
12 52 Cal.3d at 544.)
13 46. State law requires that all subordinate land use decisions, including conditional use
14 permits, be consistent with the general plan. (See Gov. Code § 65860(a)(2); Neighborhood Action
15 Group, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184.)

16 47. A project cannot be found consistent with a general plan if it conflicts with a general

17 plan policy that is "fundamental, mandatory, and clear," regardless of whether it is consistent with other

18 general plan policies. (See Endangered Habitats League v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th

19 777, 782-83; Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County V. Bd. of Supervisors (1998) 62

20 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1341-42 ("FUTURE").) Moreover, even in the absence of such a direct conflict, an
ordinance or development project may not be approved if it interferes with or frustrates the general
21 plan's policies and objectives. (See Napa Citizens, 91 Cal.App.4th at 378-79; see also Lesher, 52
22 Cal.3d at 544 (zoning ordinance restricting development conflicted with growth-oriented policies of
23 general plan).)
24 Zoning Amendment

25 48. Zoning ordinances are required to be consistent with the general plan of the county or

26 city. (Gov't Code § 65860.)

27 49. A zoning ordinance may be changed or amended by adopting an amending ordinance.

28 There are two basic types of amendments: (1) a "rezoning," which reclassifies the zoning (changes the
zoning district) applicable to a specific property; and (2) "text amendments," which change the

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 permitted uses or regulations of the use and development on property within particular zoning districts.

2 A rezoning usually involves change in the zoning map, without any change in the text of the
ordinance, whereas a text amendment does not change the map. (See Neighbors in Support of
3 Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997, 1006.)
4 50. Before amending the zoning ordinance, an analysis must be performed under CEQA
5 regarding possible environmental impacts. A zoning enactment is a "project under CEQA" that is either
6 exempt or requires preparation of a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or an
7 environmental impact report. (Gov. Code § 65854.)

8 51. As police power measures, zoning regulations must bear a substantial relation to the a
public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. (Nectow v City of Cambridge (1928) 277 US 183, 187,

10 48 S Ct 447.) California courts have confirmed that zoning ordinances, like other land use regulations,

11 must be reasonably related to the public welfare. (See Associated Home Builders, Inc. v City of
Livermore (1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 601; Arcadia Dev. Co. v City of Morgan Hill (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 12 1526, 1538; City of Del Mar v City of San Diego (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 401, 409; Arnel Dev. Co. V
13 City of Costa Mesa (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 330, 336.)
14 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

15 52. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
16 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

17 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

18 public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

19 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Parties in
Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal 20 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondent from undertaking any portion of the Project until they
21 have fully complied with these legal requirements.
22 53. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
23 section 1021.5 when it prevails in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of
24 these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

25 STATEMENT OF FACTS

26 54. On or about Octboer 22, 2018Respondent published an Initial Study for the Project

27 determining that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment warranting the

28 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), and circulated the findings of the Initial Study
for public review and comment.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 55. On or about October 22, 2018, Respondent released a Notice of Preparation of

2 Environmental Impact Report ("NOP") for the Project.
56. On or about February 19, 2019, the City published a document purporting to be the 3 Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Project. Although Appendices A to D were
4 referenced in the intial DEIR circulated on February 19, 2019, no appendices were published on the
5 City's website on that date.

6 57. Also on or about February 19, 2019, the City relayed in its Notice of Completion that the
7 Project's Draft EIR was available for public review and comment.

8 58. While the State Clearinghouse records state that the document was available for public

9 review by February 19, 2019 with the comment period ending on April 4, 2019, the DEIR itself stated

10 that the document would be circulated for a public review period beginning February 7, 2019 and

11 ending March 22, 2019.
59. Prior to March 22, 2019, the City received numerous letters raising significant concerns 12 that the purported Draft EIR was incomplete and contained numerous errors, inaccuracies, and
13 inconsistencies, including, but not limited to:
14 a. The Table of Contents did not contain a reference to the Air Quality section,
15 a although it is a section in the document;

16 b. The Table of Contents did not list any appendices, although Appendices A to D

17 were referenced in the document;

18 c. Appendix D, a geotechnical study provided by GPI Geotechnology, was missing

19 from the DEIR and was not provided on the City's website;
d. Appendices A to C were not initially available on the City's website; 20
e. The Transportation Impact Study was marked "DRAFT";
21 f. Appendix E of the Transportation Impact Study stated that information was "to
22 be provided," indicating that the section was not complete;
23 g. Appendix A was variously and inconsistently labelled Air Quality Worksheets,
24 Traffic Counts, and as containing the Notice of Preparation, Initial Study, and
25 Comment letters on the Notice of Preparation;

26 h. Appendix B was variously and inconsistently labelled as the Air Quality Study

27 and Noise Worksheets;.

review date provided by the State Clearinghouse.
60.
2 Links to the February 19, 2019 DEIR, Appendices A to C; the Transportation Impact
Study; the Transporation Impact Study Appendices; and the Notice of Preparation and Initial Study
3 were published on the City's website on or about March 7, 2019. Appendix D was not uploaded to the
4 City's website.
5 61. On or about March 27, 2019 the City's withdrew the initial February 19, 2019 DEIR.
6 62. On or about March 27, 2019 the City re-circulated the DEIR for public comment until

7 May 10, 2019. The cover page for this document dates the document as "March 15, 2019," but the

8 document was not released to the public at that time.

9 63. After release of the revised DEIR on March 27, 2019, the City received nineteen

10 comment letters, including letters from eight government agencies, one tribal government, and

11 numerous private entities and organizations, including Petitioner.
64. On or about June 20, 2019, Respondent released a Final Environmental Impact Report
12 ("FEIR") for the Project. Additions and modifications to the FEIR include, but are not limited to, the
13 following:
14 a. New three-phase construction plan with specific target dates;
15 b. Thirteen new proposed mitigation measures with respect to Air Quality impacts,
16 as suggested by SCAQMD, with no indication whether they would actually be

17 incorporated into the project (pp.17-18, 92-96);

18 C. Six new proposed mitigation measures suggested in public comments with

19 respect to greenhouse gas emissions, with no indication whether they would

20 actually be incorporated into the project (pp.19, 111-112);
d. New analysis showing unmitigated estimated daily construction emissions (pp.
21 90-91);
22 e. New noise measurements and results (pp.151-152);
23 f. Correction that Zone Changes will be required as part of the project's
24 implementation, rather than proposed; and

25 g. Specific details regarding the distance of residential homes to the project site.

26 65. The FEIR concluded the significant and unavoidable impacts would occur in the

27 following areas:

a.
28 Construction Air Quality Impacts;
b. Operation Air Quality Impacts;
-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 C. Greenhouse Gas Impacts;

A 68. On July 3, 2019, the City Council held its first reading of the following uncodified

5 ordinances for the Project:

a.

6 Uncodified Ordinance for Development Agreement No. 18-032 and Zone

7 b. Change to rezone a portion of Area 1 from M-2 Zone to the C-2 Zone;

00 Uncodified Ordinance for Development Agreement No. 18-033 and Zone

9 C. Change to rezone Area 3 from the C-2 Zone to the C-2/PF/M-2 Zone; and

10 d. Master Sign Plan for Area 1, Area 2, and Area 3.

11 At the July 3, 2019 reading, before completion of the second reading on July 16,

12 2019, and before final approval, the City Council certified the Final EIR and

13 adopted the Statement of Overriding Considerations, CEQA Findings, and
associated Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") and a

14 69. Notice of Determination was posted for the Project.

15 On July 16, 2019, Respondent approved the Project and adopted and waived the second

16 reading of the Uncodified Ordinance Approving the Development Agreements with Real Parties

17 Citadel Holdings Group, LLC and Wash-Tel Commerce, LLC.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 70. (Violations of CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)

herein.
20 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

71.
21

22 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental impact report,
initial study or mitigated negative declaration that complies with the requirements of the statute. The

23 lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the project and associated

24 environmental documentation. An environmental impact report, initial study or mitigated negative

25 declaration must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental analysis such

26 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the
proposed project.

27 72.

28 Respondent violated CEQA by adopting an environmental impact report that fails to
adequately analyze and mitigate for the Project's environmental impacts, including but not limited to:

a. Failing to adequately describe the project;
-14-

P approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's certification of the mitigated

2 negative declaration and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
3 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings)
4 74. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
5 forth herein.

6 75. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported
7 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide

8 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

9 76. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law

10 as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the

11 following:

a. The determinations that the Project's environmental impacts would be less than 12 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the
13 Project's significant effects on the environment to less than significant levels.
14 b. The determination that the following significant impacts, identified in the FEIR,
15 cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance:
16 i. Construction Air Quality Impacts;

17 ii. Operation Air Quality Impacts;
iii. 18 Greenhouse Gas Impacts;
iv. Traffic Impacts; 19
V. Cumulative Air Quality Impacts; 20 vi. Cumulative Greenhouse Gas Impacts.
21 C. The determination that the economic, legal, social, technological, and other
22 benefits of the project outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects.
23 d. Any implied or explicit determination that an amendment of the Zoning Code
24 would have no significant environmental impact.

25 77. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

26 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

27 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's adoption of the FEIR and

28 purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

-16-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

(Violations of CEQA; Failure to Recirculate EIR) -
78. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set 2
forth herein.
3 79. CEQA requires recirculation of an environmental impact report whenever substantial
4 revisions have been made to the Draft EIR

5 80. The Final EIR for the Project was released included significant revisions to the Project's
6 I construction plan, nineteen new proposed mitigation measures, and significant new analysis, including

7 all new noise and greenhouse gas emissions analyses and analysis of a new project alternative.

8 81. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

9 failing to proceed in a manner required by law as required by CEQA and approving the Project in

10 reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' adoption of the environmental impact report, related

11 environmental findings and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
12 (Violations of CEQA; Invalid Notice of Decision)
13 82. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
14 forth herein.

15 83. A Notice of Decision is only valid if the agency (1) approves the project in a manner
16 a that "commits to a definite course of action" and (2) the agency is "legally bound to take that course of

17 action." (Cty, of Amador v. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) ("County

18 of Amador"), citing CEQA Guidelines § 15352(a) (approval of a project means "the decision by a

19 public agency which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to
be carried out").)
20 84. A "notice of [decision] cannot be filed until after the project is approved." (76 Cal. App.
21 4th at 963). Project approval while a project is still subject negotiation and change is invalid. (See id. at
22 965.)
23 85. Respondent violated CEQA by releasing its Notice of Decsion on July 3, 2019, before
24 completion of the second reading on July 16, 2019 and before final approval. Since the City had not

25 completed the second reading of the Project's proposed land use ordinance or approved the

26 development agreements for this Project, the City had not "committed to a definite course of action"

27 and was not "legally bound to take that course of action." (County of Amador, supra, 76 Cal. App.4th
at 965.) 28

-17-

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA; Failure to Provide Documents)
86. A lead agency that is preparing an environmental impact report must provide public 3 notice of that fact within a reasonable period of time prior to certification of the environmental impact
4 report. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092(a).)
5 87. The notice must specify the period during which comments will be received on the draft
6 environmental impact report and must include the date, time, and place of any public meetings or
7 hearings on the proposed project, a brief description of the proposed project and its location, the

8 significant effects on the environment, if any, anticipated as a result of the project, the address where

9 copies of the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration, and all documents referenced in

10 the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration, are available for review, and a description

11 of how the draft environmental impact report or negative declaration can be provided in an electronic
format. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092(b)(1).)
12 88. The City failed to provide copies of all documents referenced in the draft environmental
13 impact report or "the address where copies of the draft environmental impact report ... and all
14 documents referenced in the draft environmental impact report ... are available for review" as required
15 by CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092(b)(1).)

16 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Gov. Code $ 65000 § et seq. Violations of the City's General Plan By Petitioner Against All

18 Respondents and All Real Parties)
89.
19 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
herein.
20 90. As required by State Planning and Zoning Law, the City has a General Plan that governs
21 land use planning throughout the City.
22 91. The Project fails to comply with the objectives and mandates set forth in the City's
23 General Plan as the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan's zoning for the Project Site as well as
24 the framework, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, climate objectives, conservation, housing, noise,

25 open space, service systems / public recreation, safety, traffic, circulation, mobility elements,

26 greenhouse gas emissions; community development, and other objectives of the General Plan.
