1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner Preserve Calavera ("Petitioner" or "Preserve Calavera") files

3 this Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to require the City of Oceanside ("City") to

4 rescind and set aside certain land use approvals and entitlements that the City made and
granted to Real Party in violation of the City's statutory duties under CEQA to provide

6 full information to the public about the environmental damage Real Party's Project

7 would do, to not approve environmentally damaging projects without adopting all

8 feasible mitigation for such harm, and in derogation of its statutory duty to properly

q enforce its General Plan.

10 2. Specifically, Petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandate ordering a the City to set

11 aside its November 6, 2019 approvals of the North River Farms Planned Development

12 Project ("North River Farms" or "Project") until the City has fully complied with the

13 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code sections

14 21000, et seq., regarding its mandatory duty under CEQA to develop and publish fully

15 adequate environmental impact report ("EIR") on the Project, and its mandatory duty

16 under Public Resources Code sections 21002 and 21080 to refrain from approving

17 projects that may significantly harm the environment unless the City has required and
adopted all feasible measures to mitigate that harm.
18 3. The North River Farms Project will cause significant harm to the 19 environment in building approximately 585 dwelling units on 176.7 acres of land
20 located in the South Morro Hills community, including loss of significant and state
21 recognized farmland. This harm will be caused through increased emissions of air
22 pollutants, resulting in increased ambient ozone concentrations and hindering the San
23 Diego Air Basin from attaining the state and federal ambient air quality standards, of
24 which it is currently in violation. The Project will result in the emissions of millions of
25 metric tons of climate-changing greenhouse gases over its life and thereby accelerating
26 the harm to California's and the world's environment that is already occurring from
27 climate change, without adequate mitigation. The Project also deviates from applicable
28

F regional and City land use plans, and is not in compliance with two new elements of the

2 General Plan (Economic Development and Energy and Sustainability) adopted in May

3 2019. Morcover, the Project increases the public risk from wildfires and other

4 emergencies by creating traffic failures that will cause slower response times and by

5 exacerbating problems of emergency evacuation on roads with insufficient capacity and

6 with traffic in failure conditions. The Project fails to include adequate mitigation for

7 these impacts.

8 4. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by participating in the

9 environmental review and administrative approval proceedings as to this Project, having

10 submitted comment letters on the EIR and appeared by letter and in person at public

11 hearings held by the City on the Project.
PARTIES 12
5. 13 Petitioner Preserve Calavera is a grass-roots organization of north San

14 Diego County residents, including City of Oceanside residents, who use, recreate in, and

15 enjoy the natural lands in the area. Preserve Calavera was founded in 2001 with a focus

16 on the Calavera open space in northeastern Carlsbad, but has expanded its focus to

17 include all of the natural lands in the coastal northern San Diego County, including those
in the City of Oceanside. Preserve Calavera focuses on preservation and protection of 18 natural lands, including lands comprising watersheds, and of the wildlife movement
19 corridors that connect natural lands and their wildlife throughout coastal north San Diego 20 County. It has members throughout Oceanside, Carlsbad and Vista, many of whom use,
21 recreate in, and enjoy the natural lands in the City of Oceanside.
22 6. Respondent City of Oceanside is a municipal corporation and has a five-
23 member elected City Council that serves as the legislative body of the corporation. The
24 a City became a charter city in 2010. It encompasses 42 square miles and has a diverse
25 population of over 175,000 residents. The City is a public agency under Section 21063
26 of the Public Resources Code. It is authorized and required by law to hold public
27 hearings, to determine adequacy of and certify environmental documents prepared
28

pursuant to CEQA, and to take other actions in connection with the approval of projects

2 within its jurisdiction.
7. Real Party in Interest NRF Project Owner, LLC. ("Real Party" or

4 "applicant") is listed on City's Notice of Determination as the Project applicant. NRF
Project Owner, LLC filed as a Foreign Entity in the State of California on Tuesday,

6 January 13, 2015, is approximately four years old, according to public records filed with
California Secretary of State, and is listed by the California Secretary of State as "active."
It is the proponent of the North River Farms Planned Development Project.

9 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under Code of Civil

11 Procedure sections 1085 and 194.5, et seq., and under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the

12 Public Resources Code.

13 9. Venue lies in this County because the actions complained of herein were

14 committed in San Diego County, and because the City of Oceanside is located in San

15 Diego County.

16 BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
10.
17 The City of Oceanside, a city of over 175,000 people, located in northern

18 San Diego County adjacent to Camp Pendleton, encompasses both urbanized areas and
areas devoted to agriculture and the active production of food. It contains 3.5 miles of
19 beach, rolling hills devoted to agriculture, and local businesses. The City is now in the
20 process of amending its General Plan, which has been in place for many years.
21 11. The City has approved a residential project to be built by Real Party within
22 the South Morro Hills agriculturally zoned area. The Project site has historically been
23 used for agriculture, and currently contains active farms. The southern edge of the
24 Project site abuts the San Luis Rey River, and has been designated as within the 100-year
25 floodplain of the San Luis Rey River on Federal Emergency Management Agency
26 (FEMA)'s Flood Insurance Rate Maps. It is bordered on the north and east by
27 agricultural land, scattered residences, and a golf course. On the west is residential-
28

-

2 zoned land with scattered residences. The main roadway access is by North River Road,

3 a two-lane roadway that provides access to the Project site and the South Morro Hills

area.

4 12.

5 The Project Site was previously designated Agriculture, with a Scenic Park

6 Overlay on portions of it, in the Oceanside General Plan and designated on the zoning

7 map. The applicant sought and received a General Plan Amendment (GPA) to

8 redesignate the Site for agriculture, low and medium density residential, open space, and

9 commercial uses. The previous Agriculture zoning designation allows properties to be

10 subdivided into lots of, at minimum, 2.5 acres, with one single-family residence per
parcel allowed lot. The maximum number of dwelling units that could be built on the

11 project site was 71. At the applicant's request, the City Council redesignated the Site to

12 Agriculture (A), Open Space (OS), single-family residential (SFD-R), medium density

13 residential A (MDA-R), medium density residential B (MDB-R), and special commercial

14 (SC). The redesignated Site would allow density ranges between 3.6 and 15 dwelling
units
15 per acre. The Project proposes to build 585 dwelling units, nearly all single-family

16 dwellings, as well as various commercial and open space (i.e., small farm, community

17 gardens, parks) uses. However, a public comment on the draft EIR calculated that the

18 newly-approved designation would allow over 1,000 dwelling units to be built if the

19 maximum density were sought in future for each parcel. The General Plan Amendment

20 also reclassified North River Road from a four-lane arterial to the lower classification of

a
21 four-lane secondary collector street (it is now only two lanes). North River Road

22 bisects the Site, and forms the main access into and out of the Project. All other internal

23 Site streets would be private.
13.
24 The Project would build 585 dwelling units, with up to 30,000 square feet

25 of commercial space, 31.6 acres allotted for agriculture/community gardens/landscaping,
and 16 acres for

26 open space uses such as parks and trails. (City's CEQA Findings, p. 3.)
Real Party characterizes the Project as promoting "agritourism" and emphasizing a
27 connection with local agriculture. The Project would have four different planning areas,
28

T each with different densities, with one area forming the "Village Core," where

2 commercial uses will be placed. The Project is designed predominantly to comprise
3 single-family houses. No housing that is truly affordable to low- or very low-income

4 persons or families is included in the Project. The "Village Core" section of the Project

5 proposes to include various commercial uses, including a hotel and craft and retail

6 spaces; however, such uses are not fixed, but will depend on future market conditions.

7 Approximately 31.6 acres of the Project would be reserved for what Real Party

8 designates as agricultural uses, including small farming, community gardens, and edible

9 landscape plantings. New water and sewerage pipes would be installed.

10 14. The Project would be built in four phases, with each phase requiring a

11 discretionary review by the City for consistency with the General Plan and the

12 Development Plan. There are certain benchmarks that must be met before construction

13 may proceed. After the tenth occupied residence, the temporary fire station is to be put in

14 place. After the ninety-ninth residence, the developer must purchase the land for

15 expansion of the College Avenue bridge, or according to the City, construction must stop.
15. At its February 27, 2017, the City's Planning Commission voted 16 unanimously to recommend that the City Council deny North River Farms' application, 17 citing concerns as to the Project's compliance with screening criteria and with the City's 18 agricultural and land use policies. (Planning Commission January 28, 2019, Staff Report,
19 p. 2.) At its January 28, 2019 meeting, the City's Planning Commission recommended to
20 the City Council that it disapprove a revised version of the Project. The Planning
21 Commission cited concerns, inter alia, that the Project was inconsistent with General
22 Plan policies; would promote sprawl; was not needed to satisfy projected housing
23 demand in the City; would convert a significant portion of existing state-designated
24 prime and significant farmland to nonagricultural uses; had the potential to precipitate
25 conversion of other existing agricultural lands to residential use; was premature in that it
26 might prejudice or adversely affect land use plans being contemplated for the South
27 Morro Hills area; would have adverse effects on traffic and congestion; would have
28

F

2 negative impacts on the City's Agritourism Strategic Plan; and would have significant
environmental impacts.

3 16.

4 On November 6, 2019, the City Council approved the Project on a 3-2 vote.

5 On November 7, 2019, the City filed its Notice of Determination for the Project. The
instant litigation was timely filed.

6 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

7 17.

8 The City has approved Real Party's Project without full and adequate
compliance with CEQA, in that the EIR certified by the City fails to fully inform the

9 decision makers and the public as to the full adverse environmental effects that the

10 Project would cause, and in that the mitigation proposed by the EIR and adopted by the

11 City is not shown to constitute all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the

12 environmental harm the Project will do. Specific environmental effects are discussed

13 below.

14 18. The City of Oceanside lies within the San Diego Air Basin, which is

15 already suffering from serious air pollution. The San Diego Air Basin does not meet

16 either the federal 8-hour ambient air quality standard for ozone or the California 8-hour

17 standard for ozone (FEIR, p. 4.3-4), nor does it meet the California standard for either

18 coarse particulate matter (usually referred to as PM10) or fine particulate matter (usually

19 referred to as PM2.5). (Ibid.) The American Lung Association's State of the Air report

20 for 2018 shows that the San Diego-Carlsbad urban area is the sixth-worst such area for

21 ozone pollution in the United States. (State of the Air, p. 20, FEIR, Appdx TO, p. 84.)

22 The health effects of exposure to ozone can include worsened asthma, increased hospital

23 visits for respiratory distress, worsened COPD, decreased lung damage, increased risk of

24 heart attack in people with cardiovascular disease, and low birth weight and decreased

25 lung function in newborns (State of the Air, p. 36-38, FEIR, Appdx. TO, pp. 100-102),

26 and a long-term decrease in lung function among children (FEIR, Appdx. TO, p. 48).

27 The Project would add new air pollutant emissions to this existing heavily polluted air
basin.

28

1 19. The EIR relies upon the Project's consistency with the San Diego Air
2 Pollution Control Agency's (APCD) Regional Air Quality Strategy (RAQS) to show that

3 the Project is not inconsistent with an applicable air quality plan and that it will not

4 contribute to violations of applicable air quality standards. Mere consistency with the

5 RAQS does not show that the Project will not contribute to violations of applicable

6 federal and state air quality standards. In fact, the Project will contribute to such

7 violations by adding to existing airborne concentrations of pollutants that already violate

8 these applicable standards.

9 20. In response to the crisis of global warming, the State of California has

10 adopted challenging goals for reducing emissions of climate-forcing greenhouse gases

11 (GHGs). AB 32 requires a reduction of GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and SB

12 32 requires a reduction to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. (Health & Safety Code §§

13 38500 et seq. and 38566, respectively.) The City evaluates the significance of individual

14 projects' GHG emissions through the use of an efficiency metric applied to projects that
would emit over 900 metric tons of GHGs
15 per year. This efficiency metric determines

16 the amount of GHG emissions, per Oceanside resident, that could occur without

17 conflicting with the GHG reductions mandated by state law. (FEIR, p. 4.8-30-31.)

18 Applying this metric to the Project, the Final EIR determines that the Project will cause
GHG emissions in excess of the allowable amount, and will therefore have a significant 19 adverse effect on climate change, absent mitigation. (FEIR, p. 4.8-34.)
20 21. The mitigation measures proposed in the EIR and adopted by the City
21 involve the purchase by Real Party of offsite carbon offsets (i.e., reductions in GHG
22 emissions at locations other than North River Farms) to mitigate the emission of GHGs
23 from Project construction and operation. The City-adopted mitigation measures allow for
24 GHG offsets to be purchased by the developer from businesses known as carbon
25 registries that specialize in locating, registering, and selling such offsets. Such offsets are
26 assumed by the EIR and the City to be real, verifiable, enforceable, permanent, and
27 additional (not required by any other law, regulation, or GHG reduction requirement) if
28

F they are registered with a "reputable" carbon registry, including any registry used by the

2 California Air Resources Board to identify potential offsets for use in the state Cap-and-

3 Trade program for GHG emissions reductions. (FEIR, p. 4.8-43.) No additional proof

4 that the purchased offsets are actually real, verifiable, enforceable, permanent, and
additional is required, other than their listing by such a registry. The offsets must be

6 sought first locally, but if not locally available, they may be purchased according to a

7 geographic priority list. The offsets are required to be bought in San Diego County first,
but if not available in San Diego County, offsets within California may be bought, if not ,

9 available within State, then offsets within the U.S. may be bought, and finally, if not

10 available in the U.S., offsets may be obtained anywhere in the world. (FEIR, p. 4.8-43-

11 47.) The Supplemental EIR for the Climate Action Plan adopted by San Diego County

12 stated that virtually no GHG offsets are now available in San Diego County. (County

13 CAP FEIR, p. 8-53.) Petitioner is informed and believes that this remains the case today.
22. A virtually identical mitigation scheme, relying on GHG offsets purchased 14

15 from carbon registries and ultimately purchasable anywhere on the planet, was ruled to
violate CEQA by the San Diego Superior Court, Judge Timothy Taylor presiding, in 16

17 Golden Door Properties LLC v. County of San Diego Case number 37-2018-00013324-
CU-TT-CTL. Judge Taylor's ruling, issued on December 24, 2018, concluded that the
18 County of San Diego violated CEQA by allowing the purchase of out-of-County GHG
19 offsets without legally sufficient analysis and by delegating the decision about the
20 geographic location of offsets to the Planning Director without sufficient guidance.
21 Furthermore, the out-of-County offset scheme violates CEQA because it fails to provide
22 enforceable, verifiable, and additional mitigation to mitigation that would not have
23 occurred without the program. This ruling is currently on appeal. While a trial court
24 ruling is not binding on any other trial court, its reasoning may be persuasive. Petitioner
25 brought this ruling to the attention of the City, to no avail.
26 23. The mitigation measures proposed in the EIR and adopted by the City do
27 not adequately mitigate the climate-forcing impacts of the Project, in that such measures
28

1 are not fully enforceable, and do not demonstrate that any carbon offsets so obtained are

2 permanent, effective, verifiable, and additional to any other applicable GHG-reduction

3 requirement. (CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(c)(3).) In addition, rather than

4 performing the monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the mitigation measures it

5 has adopted for reduction of GHG emissions itself, the City has improperly delegated to

6 private entities, namely the carbon offset registries from which the City will allow the

7 Project to purchase offsets, the full determination of whether such offsets are enforceable,

8 permanent, effective, verifiable, and additional to any other applicable GHG-reduction

9 | requirement. No City review of this determination is provided for.

10 24. The EIR calculates the Project's GHG emissions using presumed Project

11 life of only 30 years. When the Project reaches that age, no GHG emissions from the

12 residential and commercial uses in the Project are presumed to exist, none is reported in

13 the EIR, and none is the subject of mitigation. Data in the record show that over two

14 million houses in California are over 30 years old and still in use, and the EIR does not

15 state that houses in the Project will fail to exist or to emit GHGs after 30 years. The EIR

16 fails to calculate or even estimate the GHG emissions that the Project will cause after its

17 thirtieth year of operation, and has failed either to adopt all feasible mitigation for such

18 emissions or to make an enforceable commitment, accompanied by specific performance
standards, to identify and adopt such mitigation at a later time. (CEQA Guidelines, §
19 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
20 25. The Project would significantly reduce state designated prime and
21 significant farmland. The Project proposes to convert about 177 acres of agricultural
22 land, including lands the EIR and the State recognize are significant agricultural lands, to
23 urban uses, placing commercial uses and residential development in an area designated
24 and historically used for growing crops, livestock grazing, and animal husbandry. Such
25 conversion of state designated prime and significant farmland violates City of Oceanside
26 General Plan policies, the State of California policies (e.g., Govt. Code § 51220(a);
27 Public Res. Code § 10201), Oceanside's General Plan, Oceanside's Zoning Ordinance,
28

and is an impact that is essentially irreversible. While the EIR states that about 68 acres

2 of land within the Project will be used for "agricultural" purposes, these uses include

3 community gardens and landscaping. Petitioner believes that such uses cannot replace

4 the current use of the land for farming of crops. The EIR identifies loss of agricultural
lands as a significant impact of the Project.

6 26. As mitigation for these impacts, the City required the purchase by the

7 Project of permanent agricultural easements on existing agricultural land, such easements

8 to be purchased from any City of Oceanside agricultural land mitigation bank, or if no

9 such bank exists, from the San Diego County Purchase of Agricultural Conservation

10 Easement (PACE) program, on an acre-for-acre basis. No City mitigation land bank yet

11 exists, so all easement purchases would be made from the County PACE program, at

12 currently unknown locations.

13 27. The City Council immediately directed staff to develop a moratorium on

14 development in South Morro Hills. This undercuts the City Council's decision to

15 develop this land.
28.
16 Public comments on the EIR expressed concern that the conversion of the

17 North River Farms land to residential development could induce other farmland owners

18 in the South Morro Hills area to sell their farmland for such residential development.

19 This conversion resulted in the determination that the Project was growth-inducing and

20 the City included a statement of overriding considerations for this impact. No mitigation
was proposed or adopted for such impacts. The testimony at a public hearing by a
21 developer who purchased an adjacent parcel substantiates Petitioner's claim that
22 conversion of land to residential development is not just a possibility; rather, developers
23 are already taking action.
24 29. The Project purports to fill future housing needs in Oceanside, but the
25 Planning Commission staff stated that there were already areas designated in Oceanside's
26 General Plan that could provide locations for sufficient housing to satisfy the City's
27 Regional Housing Need Assessment (RHNA), an assessment of future housing needs
28

F required to be made under state planning laws. (See, e.g., Govt. Code 65884), and the

2 North River Farms housing is not needed to fulfilled housing needs identified in the

3 RHNA or.the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) regional plan. The

4 Project is not in a smart growth corridor and no homes in the Project are designated as

5 affordable.

6 30. Agritourism has been identified as a key way to preserve local agriculture.

7 This Project compromises the ability to preserve local agriculture, as identified by a

8 technical expert on the issue and others.

9 31. Northern San Diego County, including Oceanside, is subject to significant
risk of wildfires, four significant-sized fires having burned in the last five years within 10

11 five miles of the Project Site. The EIR states that the River Fire burned within the San

12 Luis Rey Riverbed adjacent to the southwest corner of the project site in 2014,

13 consuming 168 acres. The 2017 Lilac Fire, which burned approximately 5 miles to the

14 northeast of the Project Site, was the most recent, and second largest wildfire in the

15 vicinity of the Project, with a total burned area of approximately 4,100 acres. (EIR,

16 Appendix J1.) Many members of the public commented that they, as well as the
community of South Morro Hills, were subject to mandatory evacuations multiple times 17 in the last decade, including during one or both of the River or Lilac fires. 18 32. The City's standard for its emergency response is to respond to 19 emergencies within five minutes. The City Council's CEQA Findings for the Project 20 acknowledges, "The proposed project does not strictly comply with the City's 5-minute
21 response goal." (CEQA Findings, p. 47.) The City Council found this to be a significant
22 impact of the Project, but could be mitigated.
23 33. The mitigation adopted for this impact is the construction by Real Party, on
24 land provided by Real Party in the Village Core area, of a local fire station with capacity
25 to house two fire personnel, together with storage space, a such as a covered parking area,
26 for an appropriate fire response vehicle, and up to $350,000 to purchase such a vehicle.
27 (CEQA Findings, pp. 47-48.) In response to a public comment, the EIR characterized the
28

F fire personnel that would staff this station as paramedics. Construction of this fire station

2 is not required until prior to the last certificate of occupancy; presumably this will occur

3 at the end of the five-year build-out of the Project. No mitigation other than Project use

4 of building materials and design features intended to inhibit fires, appears required until

5 full build-out; the EIR and the City have already found that such measures do not prevent

6 delayed response to fires and wildfire from being a significant impact. The EIR does not

7 state or show that there will not be temporary impacts of the Project on response times to

8 fires at any time during the five-year build-out period. Therefore, any temporary impacts

9 of the Project on response time to fires have not been shown not to occur, and appear to

10 be unmitigated.
34. 11 The Project's evacuation plan is inadequate to protect public safety. In

12 addition to the inadequate emergency response times, the roads lack adequate carrying

13 capacity to accommodate residents who are evacuating. The EIR failed to adequately

14 address the impact that increased traffic from the Project will have on further reducing
times and creating traffic backups for those fleeing wildfires. The 15 emergency response

16 City's analysis is inadequate. The Fire Chief acknowledged that in the event of an
emergency, there will still be residents trapped in their cars. The Fire Chief also 17 mentioned an updated evacuation plan, yet this was not released to the public. 18 35. The City and the EIR improperly rely upon future actions by the as-yet- 19 nonexistent homeowners' association for the completed Project to maintain fire-
20 inhibiting Project design features and agricultural activities that the EIR relies on to
21 mitigate impacts of reduced fire response time, and loss of agricultural lands, and to
22 develop plans and protocols for evacuation of residents in case of wildfires. Such actions
23 are not shown to be enforceable, and therefore may not be relied upon to mitigate these
24 impacts. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(2).)

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATION OF CEQA, PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTIONS 21002 &
3 21081, CEQA GUIDELINES 15126.4)
4 36. Petitioner hereby realleges all allegations in the previous paragraphs, as
5 though set forth here in full.
6 37. CEQA, at Public Resources Code section 21002, provides that "public
7 agencies should not approve projects as proposed if there are feasible alternatives or
8 feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
9 environmental effects of such projects. In addition, Public Resources Code section
10 21081 provides that "no public agency shall approve or carry out a project for which an
11 environmental impact report has been certified which identifies one or more significant
12 effects on the environment that would occur if the project is approved or carried out
13 unless" either the public agency makes findings that changes or alterations to the project
14 have been made that would mitigate or avoid such significant effects, or the public
15 agency adopts a Statement of Overriding Consideration that such significant effects are
16 outweighed by specified economic, social, or other benefits of the project. (Pub. Res.
17 Code section 21081, subds. (a), (b).) Such findings must be supported by substantial
18 evidence. (Pub. Res. Code section 21081.5.)

19 38. The City's certification of the North River Farms Project EIR and the
20 City's approval of the North River Farm Project violate Public Resources Code sections

21 21002 and 21081, in that the Project will contribute to existing violations of applicable
22 federal and state air quality standards, in that GHG emissions from the Project will have
23 significant cumulative impacts on the environment by contributing to climate change in

24 California, in that Project emissions of GHGs have been grossly understated by

25 artificially defining the Project's lifespan as only 30 years, in that the Project is

26 inconsistent with the City's General Plan, in that the Project adversely impacts the City's

27 ability promptly to respond to fires and improperly relies on a future homeowners'

28

association to develop fire evacuation plans and protocols, and in that these and other

2 significant effects have not been adequately mitigated.

3 39. The state policy in the Housing Crisis Act of 2019 applies to this Project.

4 Senate Bill 330 recognizes that premature and unnecessary development of agricultural

5 lands for urban uses continues to have adverse effects on the availability of those lands

6 for food and fiber production and on the economy of the state. Therefore, it is the policy

7 of the state that development should be guided away from prime agricultural lands. In

8 implementing this section, local jurisdictions should encourage, to the maximum extent

9 practicable, infilling of existing urban areas. The legislative intent of Senate Bill 300 is

10 clear, and the Project's EIR failed to adequately address this impact.

11 40. CEQA is a statute intended to "protect[] informed self-government"

12 (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47

13 Cal.3d 376, 392) and "to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in

14 fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (No Oil, Inc. v.

15 City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 86.) The EIR for the Project does not

16 adequately inform the City decision makers or the public as to the full adverse

17 environmental effects that the Project can be expected to have as to air quality, global

18 climate change, and wildfires, in violation of CEQA's purposes of full environmental

19 disclosure and public accountability.

20 41. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent City of Oceanside

21 has violated its duties under the law, abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the

22 manner required by law, and decided the matters complained of without the support of

23 substantial evidence, all in violation of CEQA.

24 42. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources section 21167.7 by serving
25 a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General. A copy of this letter is
26 attached as Exhibit A.

2 Petitioner has complied with Public Resources section 21167.5 by sending

4 filing. A copy of this letter is attached as Exhibit B.

44. Petitioner has elected to prepare the administrative record in this case.

6 Petitioner's Notice of Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached as

7 Exhibit C.

o PRAYER

11 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

1.
12 For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate commanding

13 Respondent City to immediately vacate and set aside its certification of the

14 Environmental Impact Report for the North River Farms Development Project and to

15 vacate and set aside the approvals of each Project until and unless the City fully

16 complies with all requirements of CEQA;
2.
17 For costs of this suit;

3.
18 For reasonable attorneys' fees; and

4.
19 For such other relief as this Court deems just and proper.
