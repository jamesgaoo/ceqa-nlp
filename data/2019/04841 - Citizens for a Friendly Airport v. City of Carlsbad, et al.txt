16 Defendants and Respondents; )ENVIRONMENTALQUALITY ACT AND OTHER LAWS

18 Defendants and Real Parties in
Interest.

21

22 Plaintiff and Petitioner CITIZENS FOR A FRIENDLY AIRPORT ("Petitioner") alleges as
follows:

23

24 Parties

1.

25 Petitioner is a non-profit organization formed and operating under the laws of the State
of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in or near the County of San Diego,
26 California, and has an interest in protecting the region's air quality, minimizing and ameliorating traffic,
27

28 ensuring informed and responsible growth, and promoting other environment-related quality-of-life

issues.

2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF CARLSBAD ("CITY") is a "public agency" under

2 Public Resources Code Section 21063. Defendant and Respondent COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO
3 ("COUNTY") is also a "public agency" under Section 21063.

4 3. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents identified as DOES 1
through 100 and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 1,000 are

6 unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to allege
the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Each of the fictitiously named
8 Respondents 1 through 100 has jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the action that is being
challenged in this lawsuit and each of the fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest 101 through 1,000
10 either is a party to the challenged action or has some other cognizable interest in the action.
11 Background Information

12 4. The government action that is the subject of this lawsuit is that certain Mutual
13 Cooperation and Settlement Agreement between CITY and COUNTY dated March 28, 2019,
14| concerning McClellan-Palomar Airport Master Plan Update ("Project").

15 5. Petitioner opposes the Project on the grounds that Defendants/Respondents violated
16 CEQA and other laws.

17 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations

18 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges:

19 A. A Notice of Determination for the Project was filed in the Office of the County

20 Clerk for the County of San Diego within the last 35 days.
21 B. Alternatively, no Notice of Determination for the Project has been filed.
22 7. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on
23 Defendants/Respondents, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. The Notice of
24 Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A.

25 8. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General

26 not more than 10 days after the commencement of this lawsuit, as required by Public Resources Code
27 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 2

2 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

9.

3 Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code

4 Section 21168 or 21168.5, as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526a, 1060 et seq., and
1084 et seq., among other provisions of law.

5 10.

6 Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that neither Public

7 Resources Code Section 21177(a)-(b) nor any other exhaustion-of-remedies requirement under may
be applied to Petitioner.

8 11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since its
9 members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as a result of
10 Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws. Defendants/Respondents' approval of
11

12 the Project also rests on the failure to satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with
those laws. Even when Respondents are permitted or required by law to exercise their discretion in
13 approving projects under those laws, a they remain under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise
14 their discretion within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws.
15 Defendants/Respondents have had and continue to have the capacity and ability to approve the Project
16 within the limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but Defendants/Respondents have failed
17 and refuse to do SO and have exercised their discretion beyond the limits of and in a manner that is not
18 consistent with those laws.

19 12.

20 Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Defendants/Respondents' fulfillment of
all their legal duties, as alleged in this pleading.
21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

22 Illegal Approval of Project

23 (Against All Defendants/Respondents and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest)

13.

24 14. Paragraphs through 16 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.
The Project does not comply with all applicable laws. By way of example and not
25 limitation (including alternative theories of liability):

26 A.

27 The Project violates CEQA. In particular:
1. CEQA requires every "discretionary project" to be subjected to
28 environmental review before it may be approved by the public agency.

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 3

1 2. The Project is a "discretionary project" under CEQA.

2 3. The Project is not exempt from environmental review under CEQA.

3 B. The Project violates public policy. In particular:

4 1. The Project involves an agreement that COUNTY is immune from

5 CITY's building and zoning ordinances and requirements pursuant to Government Code Section 53090

6 et seq. However, the COUNTY's immunity is narrower than the agreement indicates. For example,
7 COUNTY is required to obtain CITY's approval of any expansion or enlargement plan for the
8 McClellan-Palomar Airport under Public Utilities Code Section 21661.6 and to satisfy other
requirements thereunder.

10 2. The Project involves an agreement that mischaracterizes COUNTY's

11 obligations under that certain conditional use permit no. CUP-172 as voluntary. COUNTY's

12 obligations under CUP-172 are mandatory and legally enforceable.

13 3. The Project involves an agreement that CITY will not adopt the zoning-
14 ordinance amendment that it published for public review on or about January 18, 2019, or any similar
15 ordinance that purports to create an airport boundary line or restrict the acquisition of interests in
16 property for airspace protection or Airport safety zones. Such agreement constitutes an illegal
17| contracting-away of CITY's right to exercise its police powers.

18 4. The Project involves an agreement that CITY attorneys, officers, agents,

19 employees, and contractors will not assist, aid, or encourage any litigation related to COUNTY's

20 approval of the McClellan-Palomar Airport Master Plan Update or its corresponding environmental
21 impact report ("EIR"). However, this agreement prohibits CITY representatives from interacting with
22 Petitioner's members and other members of the public concerning Petitioner's separate lawsuit over

23 the Master Plan Update and EIR, despite their constitutional rights to interact with public officials.
24 C. The Project violates the Carlsbad Municipal Code ("CMC"). In particular:

25 1. Atall relevant times, CMC Section 21.53.015(a) has provided as follows:
26 "The city council shall not approve any zone change, general plan amendment or any other legislative
27 enactment necessary to authorize expansion of any airport in the city nor shall the city commence any

28 action or spend any funds preparatory to or in anticipation of such approvals without having been first

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 4

1 authorized to do so by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the city voting at an election for such
2| purposes."

3 2. The Project's approval by CITY constitutes a "legislative enactment"

4 under CMC 21.53.015.

5 3. The Project involves the taking of action preparatory to or in anticipation

6 of an approval to authorize expansion of McClellan-Palomar Airport, which is located in the City of

7 Carlsbad.

8 4. The Project's approval by CITY has not been subjected to a vote of

9 CITY's qualified electors.

10 15. As a result of Defendants/Respondents' violations of CEQA and other laws, Petitioner
11 has been harmed in that Petitioner, the public, and the decision-makers who approved the Project were
12 not fully informed about the impacts of, mitigation measures for, and alternatives to the Project prior
13 to its approval and because the Project is illegal in other respects.

14 * Prayer

15 *FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against
16 | Defendants/Respondents and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest (and any and all other parties who may
17 oppose Petitioner in this lawsuit):

18 A. On All Causes of Action:
19 1. A judgment determining or declaring that Defendants/Respondents failed to
20 comply fully with CEQA and/or other laws as it relates to the Project and that its approval (including
21 all associated entitlements) was illegal in at least some respect, rendering the approval null and void;
22 2. A judgment determining or declaring that Defendants/Respondents must subject

23 the Project to environmental review under CEQA before final approval of the Project may be granted;
24 3. Injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants/Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

25 (and any and all persons acting at the request of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of
26 them) from taking any action on any aspect of, in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project
27 unless and until Defendants/Respondents comply with all applicable provisions of law, as determined
28 by the Court;

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ETC. Page 5

4.

2 Any and all other relief that may be authorized by law but is not explicitly or
specifically requested elsewhere in this Prayer;

3 5. All legal fees and other expenses

4 incurred in connection with this lawsuit

5 including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil Procedure and
the Government Code; and

6 6. Any

7 Date: June 4, 2019. and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.
Respectfully submitted,

Re: Notice of Commencement of Action

Dear Board Clerk and City Clerk:
I represent Citizens for a Friendly Airport and am sending this Notice of Commencement
of Action on my client's behalf.
Please be advised that an action is to be commenced by my client in San Diego County Superior Court against your agencies. The action will challenge your agencies' approval of that certain Mutual Cooperation and Settlement Agreement dated March 28, 2019, on the grounds that the approval violated the California Environmental Quality Act (PUB. RES. CODE § 21000 et seq.). The action may also challenge your agencies' approval of the project based on one or more violations of other laws.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely,
BRIGGS LAW CORPORATION AZ
