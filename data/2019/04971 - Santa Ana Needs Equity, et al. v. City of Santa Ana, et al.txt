FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Something is rotten in the City of Santa Ana. The stench is from the actions of
3 Respondents City of Santa Ana (the "City"), the City Council of the City of Santa Ana (the "City
4 Council"), and the Planning Commission of the City of Santa Ana (the "Planning Commission")

5 to assist Real Parties in Interest by approving a giant car wash project that is detrimental to the

6 community, and to do so without conducting the environmental review, and adopting necessary
7 mitigation measures, as required by CEQA.

8 2. In this action, Petitioners challenge multiple approvals issued and actions taken by
9 the City, the City Council, and the Planning Commission (along with Does 1 through 20,
10 collectively referred to as, "Respondents" or the "City"), concerning a project proposed by the
11 Real Parties in Interest to demolish existing uses and to develop two abutting properties located at
12 301 N. Tustin Avenue and 325 N. Tustin Avenue, Santa Ana, California, located in the County of
13 Orange (collectively, the "Properties").

14 3. In 2018, after more than two years of effort by the Real Parties in Interest, Richard
15 Finkel, Bundy-Finkel Architects, Chase Russell, and Russell Fischer LP (collectively, the "Real
16 Parties" or "Applicants"), the City of Santa Ana approved the project sought by the Real Parties.
17 The Real Parties are effectively a car wash collective - Richard Finkel is a car wash consultant on
18 the board of the Irvine Advisory Group a committee of professionals with ties to the Car Wash
19 & Service Station Industry, Richard Finkel's architectural firm, Bundy-Finkel Architects, Chase
20 Russell has been in the car wash business for 30 years and owns Russell Fischer LP, the company
21 that owns and operates six car washes in Orange County (collectively, the "Real Parties").

22 4. In 2016, the car wash collective of Real Parties represented to Respondents that they
23 sought to develop a project that would demolish an existing small gas station, convenience store,
24 and a small car wash on 325 North Tustin Avenue, and a restaurant on 301 North Tustin Avenue,
25 and then build a larger gas station and a larger a convenience store on 325 North Tustin Avenue,
26 and a retail center (not a car wash) on 301 North Tustin Avenue. Both properties were zoned
27 Professional, not commercial, and 301 N. Tustin Avenue was designated Professional
28 Administrative Office ("PAO") under the City's General Plan. As part of the proposed project,

2
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

, Real Parties applied to the City to rezone both properties from Professional to General
2 Commercial (C2), and to amend the General Plan land use designation for 301 N. Tustin Avenue
3 from PAO to General Commercial. Rezoning 301 N. Tustin Avenue to C2 was not necessary to
4 develop the retail center, but it was required to develop the massive car wash on that property - a
5 project "revision," which, as detailed below, was not disclosed until almost three years after the
6 project was first proposed, and several months after the Original Project with the retail center and
7 restaurant component was fully entitled.

8 5. The City conducted an initial study of the potential environmental impacts of the
9 Original Project, as required by CEQA. Based on the initial study, the City determined that the
10 Original Project would have significant environmental effects without the implementation of
11 mitigation measures. With appropriate mitigation measures, however, the City determined that
12 these environmental impacts would be less than significant. Accordingly, the City adopted a
13 Mitigated Negative Declaration, Environmental Review No. 2016-156 (the "MND") and
14 Mitigation Reporting and Monitoring Plan (the "MMRP").
15 6. Having adopted the MND and MMRP to comply with CEQA, the City granted Real
16 |Parties' requests for several other project approvals, all of which were conditioned on and subject
17 to the MND and MMRP, including:

18 a, Zone Amendment rezoning 301 and 325 N. Tustin Avenue from P to General

19 Commercial (G2);

20 b. Amending the General Plan land use designation for 301 N. Tustin Avenue from
21 PAO to General Commercial;

22 C. Granting a variance to reduce setback requirements on 325 N. Tustin Avenue; and
23 d. Granting conditional use permit for operation of a drive through on 301 N. Tustin
24 Avenue.

25 Both the CUP and variance are further conditioned on and subject to the effectiveness of
26 the above referenced zoning amendments and the General Plan amendment.
27 ///
28 ///

3
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 7. Throughout the entire process, and even after full project approval, the City

2 maintained a dedicated webpage to the project and led the public, including the neighbors, to
3 believe that what was being built on 301 North Tustin was a retail center.

4 8. There was no public opposition to the original project as proposed.

5 9. Shortly after obtaining all of the required approvals for the project, the Real Parties

6 the car wash business, car wash owner, and car wash consultant-applied in secret to the City to

7 revise the fully approved project to get rid of the retail center on 301 North Tustin and instead put

8 in a giant car wash complete with a 4,354 square foot car wash tunnel, 20 vacuum bays, two pay
9 Ipoints, and 189 feet of stacking. The City hid the revisions to the project from the public for more
10 than five months, until 10 days before the September 9, 2019 Planning Commission meeting,
11 when the City served notice of the hearing on a paltry few properties around the proposed project
12 via mail.

13 10. Various members of the public were opposed to the revisions to the project-the
14 massive car wash replacing the retail center and restaurant-including the Petitioners. Over their
15 objections and opposition, the Planning Commission approved the revision to the project-to
16 substitute a giant car wash for the retail center.

17 11. In order to fast track the car wash approvals, the City actually abandoned the MND
18 and MMRP it had adopted, which CEQA required because the project would have significant
19 effects on the environmental. Instead, Respondents found that the revised project was
20 categorically exempt from CEQA review and filed a Notice of Exemption.

21 12. The categorical exemption was not available for the revised project for a number of
22 reasons, including: (1) CEQA does not permit piecemeal environmental review or project
23 approval; (2) CEQA does not permit a government agency to abandon mitigation measures
24 already determined necessary for a project; (3) the City failed to conduct any subsequent
25 environmental review to address the additional environmental impacts of the massive automated
26| car wash-which were obviously not considered in Respondents evaluation of retail center's
27 environmental impacts-as required by CEQA; (4) the project does not qualify for the categorical
28 exemption approved by Respondents, for a number of reasons, including that (a) the project was

4
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1  not consistent with General Plan and zoning designations because two key components of this
2  project are the General Plan amendment and zone changes required to build the car wash, (b) the
3  project was not consistent with the General Plan Land Use Policies and Goals, and (c)
4 Respondents already found that this project, at minimum, would have significant impacts on
5 cultural resources, hazards, and tribal and cultural resources, and thus unusual circumstances exist

6 including that the City previously determined there would be significant environmental impacts
7 from the same aspects of the project that remained in the revised project.
13. The Planning Commission also improperly granted a conditional use permit for
9 operation of a car wash on 301 N. Tustin Avenue and variance amendment required for the car
10 wash. The Planning Commission failed to satisfy the five criteria set forth in SAMC Section 41-
11  638 required to grant the conditional use permit to operate the car wash because, among other
12 things, the proposed use is not consistent with the General Plan and both the General Plan
13 amendment and the zoning amendment pertaining to the Properties were automatically deemed
14 null and void when Respondents abandoned the MND and MMRP previously adopted for the
15 project, and thus the proposed use is inconsistent with the City's General Plan and Zoning
16 Ordinance. In addition, the Amendment to Variance No. 2018-10 (the "Variance Amendment")
17 was improperly approved because it does not address "special circumstances" that deprive the
18 subject property of privileges enjoyed by similar properties as required by the Municipal Code and
19 State law, but instead constitutes a blatant, impermissible grant of special privileges to allow the
20 Applicants to maximize their profits. (See SAMC, § 41-638(a)(2); Gov't Code, § 65906.)
21 14. Petitioners appealed all of the actions by the Planning Commission to the City
22 Council. The City failed to include in the public notice that Petitioners appealed the categorical
23 exemption determination under CEQA or otherwise indicate that the City Council would be
24 deciding whether the project approvals violated CEQA. The City also refused to withdraw the
25 Notice of Exemption in light of the Petitioners' appeal. Accordingly, to preserve the timeliness of
26 their CEQA claim, Petitioners filed their initial petition in this action on October 15, 2019 for
27 violation of CEQA.
28 ///

5
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 15. At the City Council hearing on the appeal, numerous additional members of the
2 community joined Petitioners in opposing the revised project and in support of the appeal.
3 Despite this opposition, and while acknowledging Petitioners' "compelling arguments" as well as
4 the "vulnerabilities" in the approvals, the City Council denied the appeal and affirmed all of the

5 approvals and determinations of the Planning Commission. Not only did the City Council approve

6 the Planning Commission's finding that the project was categorically exempt as an infill
7 development-but without notice to anyonethe City Council purportedly adopted an additional
8 categorical exemption for the project, which was never before mentioned. In addition, the City

9 Council approved a CUP and variance amendment that were not permitted by law, based on
10 findings not supported by substantial evidence and without bridging the analytical gap between the
11 evidence and the findings.

12 16. Plaintiffs and Petitioners, Santa Ana Needs Equity, William Conklin, Karina Rangel
13 Conklin and Yoon Hee Choe (collectively, "Petitioners"), now file this First Amended and
14 Supplemental Petition and Complaint to overturn the City's approval of the revised project and the
15 categorical exemption determination that it adopted to avoid CEQA review, and abandonment of
16 the MND and MMRP it previously adopted for the project.

17 17. Petitioners hereby petition this Court for a writ of administrative mandamus under
18 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, directed to Respondents, requiring them to set aside their
19 approval of the Conditional Use Permit and Variance Amendment. Petitioners also seek a writ of
20 Imandate pursuant to CEQA to set aside the City's categorical exemption determinations, to
21 require the City to reinstate the MND and MMRP, and to conduct subsequent environmental
22 review required by CEQA evaluating the additional impacts of the revision to the project-adding

23 a massive car wash in the place of a retail center- and prepare a subsequent EIR or MND.
24 18. More specifically, Petitioners seek a writ of mandate from this Court to set aside the
25 | Notices of Exemption, Environmental Review No. 2019-69 (the "NOE") filed by Respondents, to
26 set aside Respondents' determination that the Project, including the Revised Project at 301 N.

27 Tustin Avenue, is categorically exempt from CEQA environmental review as an in-fill
28 development project pursuant to 14 Cal. Code Regs. Sec. 15332, and/or as a new construction or

6
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 conversion of small structures pursuant to 14 Cal. Code Regs. Sec. 15303(c), and to order

2 Respondents to conduct environmental review of the Revised Project, including the preparation of
3 an EIR, Subsequent EIR, MND, or Subsequent MND, as required by CEQA.

4 19. This Petition also seeks to set aside all other approvals Respondents have granted
5 for the Revised Project, including Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-30, Amendment to Variance
6 No, 2018-10, and Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-31, both for failing to comply with CEQA and

7 because those approvals were granted in violation of the law and without substantial evidence to
8 support the required findings.

9 20. In addition, this Petition requests that the Court compel Respondents to provide
10 public notice of all CEQA determinations, all public hearings or meetings discussing a CEQA
11 determination, and all public hearings considering discretionary approvals, with adequate time for
12 the public to meaningfully participate, and further to provide notice to businesses and residents
13 within a sufficient radius of the Revised Project so that interested parties may meaningfully
14 Iprepare and appear to protect their interests, and Respondents may receive important input from
15 the public, including those affected by the Revised Project.
16 21. Petitioners further seek an immediate stay of all actions under the conditional use
17 permit, variance amendment, and all other City approvals regarding the proposed project of Real
18 Parties Richard Keith Finkel, Bundy-Finkel Architects, Russell Fischer, LP, and Chase Russel,

19 and Roes 1 through 20, pending final resolution of this action.

20 22. Petitioners seek relief for the City's failure to produce documents requested related
21 to, among other things, the properties, the Real Parties, the original project, and the revised project
22 in violation of the California Public Records Act.

23

24 II. PARTIES JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 23. Petitioner, Santa Ana Needs Equity ("SANE"), is an unincorporated association
26 made up of residents, business owners, and businesses in the City of Santa Ana with a geographic
27 nexus to the proposed Revised Project. SANE is comprised of individual members, including the
28 lindividual petitioners who reside, own property, or work in the vicinity of the Revised Project and

7
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 are affected by the Project's environmental impacts as well as other impacts. SANE is organized

2 to seek fairness and comprehensive economic and environmental equity in Santa Ana's urban
3 planning, including protecting the interest of the residents, businesses and property owners from
4 the environmental impacts of the Revised Project and the failure to assess and mitigate
5 environmental impacts.

6 24. Petitioners William Conklin and Karina Rangel Conklin are concerned citizens who
7 together own commercial property in Santa Ana, located at 2035 N. Tustin Avenue. Petitioners
8 are also co-owners of a business at that property, called Speedie Clean Express Car Wash
9 |("Speedie Wash"). Speedie Wash is located only 1.1 miles from the proposed Project on the same
10 side of the same street. The Conklins and their business will be adversely affected by the Revised
11 Project, including its environmental impacts. Petitioners' interests are unique and will be directly
12 impacted by the Project. The Petitioners as well as the general public will suffer direct harm if
13 Respondents are permitted to approve the Project without first conducting environmental review
14 in violation of CEQA.

15 25. Petitioner Yoon Hee Choe, DDS, is a concerned citizen who owns the property
16 located at 171 N. Tustin Avenue, which is immediately adjacent to the proposed Revised Project.
17 Petitioner Choe is a licensed dentist and operates a dental and medical practice in the office
18 building on her property. Petitioner Choe has one tenant who operates a massage business.
19 Petitioner Choe's interests are unique because of the extremely close proximity of the car wash

20 tunnel to her building, where she operates sensitive use, which cannot tolerate vibrations or
21 noise, and thus will be directly and severely impacted by the environmental impacts of the
22 Revised Project. According to the plans for the Revised Project, the 4,354-square foot car wash
23 tunnel that is part of the Revised Project will run the entire length of the property boundary shared
24 with Petitioner Choe, and the distance between the exterior wall of the car wash tunnel on 301 N.
25 Tustin Avenue, and the exterior wall of Petitioner Choe's dental office building on 171 N. Tustin

4 City documents in connection with the Project.

5 32. Petitioners are ignorant of the true names and capacities of the real parties in interest

9 Chase Russell, and ROES 1 through 20 are collectively referred to herein as "Real Parties."

10 33. Venue is proper in this Court as this lawsuit arises out of findings that the Project
11 was exempt from environmental review under CEQA, that decision occurred within the County of
12 Orange, by Respondents City of Santa Ana, and the Project at issue is located at 325 & 301 N.
13 Tustin Avenue, in the City of Santa Ana, County of Orange.
14 34. Respondents' actions and failures to act, which gave rise to this Petition, occurred in
15 Orange County, California. The Project is located within Orange County, California. The
16 environmental effects resulting from the Project will impact businesses and residents of the City of
17 Santa Ana, located in the County of Orange.

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 STANDING

2 37. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they
3 are beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

4 Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing
5 upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the
6 Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the
7 natural environment and the quality of life in the surrounding community and economic viability
8 of surrounding businesses. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the

9 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondents' failure to perform any
10 environmental review of the Project under CEQA, and by approving the Project.
11 38. Petitioners actively participated in the City's administrative approval process in an
12 attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws prior to the
13 close of the September 9, 2019 public hearing on the Project, and before issuance of the NOE, and
14 thus fully exhausted administrative remedies. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)
15 39. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all
16 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
17 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioners and other interested individuals and businesses made oral and
18 written comments that were submitted to the City before and at the September 9, 2019 Planning
19 Commission hearing at which Respondents approved the Project.

20 40. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
21 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate. In the absence of such remedies,
22 Respondents determinations and approval of the Revised Project will form the basis for a decision
23 made in violation of law.

24 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 41. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies available to them.
26 Petitioners submitted written and oral opposition to the Planning Commission and appealed the
27 Planning Commission's decisions to the City Council. No further administrative actions are
28 available to Petitioner to challenge the Respondents' approval of the Revised Project.

11
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 V. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

2 42. A challenge to a determination that a project is exempt must be filed within 35 days
3 after a notice of exemption is filed. (Pub. Res. Code § 21167(d); 14 Cal Code Regs §

4 15112(c)(5).)

5 43. Petitioners filed an appeal of Respondents NOE and Project approvals on September
6 19, 2019, which was heard by the City Council on October 15, 2019.

7 44. Although Petitioners' Appeal was still pending, Respondents filed a NOE

8 |concerning the Project on September 10, 2019, and thus triggered the 35-day statute of limitations
9 Ito challenge a determination that the Project is exempt. (Pub. Res. Code § 21167(d).). The City
10 refused to withdraw the NOE despite the appeal and Petitioners' request. Accordingly, Petitioners
11 filed the original Petition in this matter to preserve their rights to challenge the NOE and related
12 determinations under CEQA.

13 45. Following the City Council's hearing on October 15, 2019, the City filed a second
14 NOE on October 16, 2019. Petitioners now challenge the second NOE and related determination
15 under CEQA pursuant to this Amended and Supplemental Petition which was filed within 35 days
16 of the NOE.

17 46. Thus, Petitioners filed the original Petition and this Amended and Supplement
18 Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.
19 VI. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

20 47. Petitioners bring this action as private attorney generals pursuant to Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
22 affecting the public interest.

23 48. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
24 the general public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other
25 applicable laws before approving the Project.

26 49. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
27 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondent to engage in a legally
28 adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to

12 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.
award of attorneys' fees 2 50. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an
3 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Parties will proceed with

4 development of a Project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might
5 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review, and the

6 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.
51. In addition, without this Petition, Respondents and Real Parties will proceed with
8 development of a Project that detrimental to the public interests and which does not meet the
9 requirements for the issuance of the discretionary approvals.
10 VII. STATEMENT OF FACTS

11 A. Uses of 301 And 325 N. Tustin Avenue Before the Proposed Project
12 52. In or about 2015, Real Parties Chase Russell and Russell Fischer LP purchased the
13 Properties at 301 and 325 N. Tustin Avenue. These properties are located in between the
14 intersection of N. Tustin Avenue and Fourth Street, and the 55 Freeway offramp into Santa Ana.
15 53. Currently, a gas station with small, attached automated car wash and a
16 convenience store is located on 325 N. Tustin Avenue, as shown below.

55. At the time Real Parties, Chase Russell and Russell Fischer LP, purchased the
16 Properties, both Properties were zoned Professional, and 301 N. Tustin Avenue was designated
17 Professional & Administrative Office ("PAO") in the City's General Plan, while 325 N. Tustin

19 18 Avenue was and still is designated General Commercial under the General Plan.
56. Per the Land Use Element of the City's General Plan, the PAO designation applies
20 to areas where professional and/or administrative offices are predominant or where such
21 I| development is being encouraged, and land included in this designation is found primarily near the
22 Civic Center, and along the First Street and Tustin Avenue Corridors in close proximity to
23 freeways. "The purpose for maintaining and supporting these areas exclusively for office and
24 office-related uses is to encourage major employment centers at locations which significantly
25 lessen the impact to the City's local street system. The First Street/Tustin Avenue office corridor
26 between the Santa Ana (I-5) and Costa Mesa (SR-55) Freeways serves this purpose." (Land Use
27 Element at p. A-20.) The types of uses typically located in the PAO district include professional
28 and administrative offices/office parts, service activities such as copy centers, courier services,

14
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 travel agencies, and restaurants when such uses are an integral component of a planned office
2 development, and professional uses such as accountants, attorneys, doctors, engineers, and
3  insurance brokers.

4 57. Consistent with the original land use designation, since 1965, the property located at
5 301 N. Tustin Avenue had been developed with a restaurant that served the surrounding business

6 and professional community, such as the dental office on the adjacent property, the law offices,
7 insurance and real estate brokerages, and chiropractor office directly across the street, among

8 lothers.

9 58. Both Properties were zoned Professional, which per section 41-313 of the SAMC,
10 professional, business and administrative offices, banks, mortgage and finance companies, travel
11 agencies, medical and dental offices, art galleries and studios, science centers, print and copy
12 services, pharmacies, child care facilities, and commercial and service uses integrated into
13 profession/business uses, and freestanding restaurants, cafes, and eating establishments, in
14  addition to other uses that are permitted as of right.

15 59. The property at 325 N. Tustin Avenue was designated as General Commercial under
16 the General Plan, and thus correlates to the following zoning districts: Professional, Community
17 Commercial (C1), General Commercial (C2), Planning Shopping Center (C4), Arterial
18 Commercial (C5), Special Plan, and Overlay Zone, among others.

19 60. The boundary of the Metro East Mixed Use Overlay Zone (hereinafter, "MEMU
20 Zone") is directly across from the project on the other side of N. Tustin Avenue. The MEMU
21 Zone is intended to, among other things, create a mixed-use urban village where it is possible to
22 live, work, shop and play all within a short walk of each other, a highly-integrated pedestrian
23 system that provides for connectivity between the nearby residential areas and public recreation
24 amenities, parking solutions that discourage vehicle trips, increase pedestrian activity, and enhance
25 high-quality building and site design, and project designs that encourage retail or commercial
26 space to service residents and/or employees within the MEMU Zone. Respondents found that,
27 given that the project location is adjacent to the MEMU Zone, the Original Project proposed with
28 retail center and restaurant supported and complemented the Goals and Policies of the General

15
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Plan as well as the MEMU Zone.

2 B. The Real Parties Propose the Original Project

3 61. In 2016, Real Party, Richard Finkel, representing Real Parties and Project
4 |Applicant, Chase Russell and Russell Fischer LP - a car wash owner and developer that has "been

5 in the car wash industry for 30 years and operates six locations in Orange County" - originally

6 submitted applications to the City to do the following:

7 a. change the zoning designation of both Properties from Professional to General

8 Commercial (C2);
9 b. amend the General Plan to change the land use designation for 301 N. Tustin

10 Avenue from Professional & Administrative Office ("PAO") to General

11 Commercial ("GC").

12 C. demolishing all existing uses on both Properties - the gas station and small,

13 connected car wash, and small convenience store on 325 N. Tustin Avenue, and the
14 restaurant building on 301 N. Tustin Avenue, and to close the driveway along

15 Fourth Street;

16 d construct a new gas station convenience store and gas canopy on 325 N. Tustin

17 Avenue; and

18 e. construct a new single-story multi-tenant retail building with drive-through lane on

19 301 N. Tustin Avenue.

20 (Staff Report to Planning Commission, Sept. 24, 2018, at pp. 1-8.)

21 62. The Real Parties purportedly requested the zone changes and the General Plan
22 amendment "in order to facilitate construction of a new multi-tenant commercial building with
23 ancillary drive-through service at 301 N. Tustin Avenue and a service station at 325 N. Tustin

24 Avenue." (Resolution No. 2018-082, T A.) Without the zone changes and the General Plan
25 amendment, the Real Parties could not ultimately develop the properties with the car wash use on
26 301 N. Tustin Avenue, because an open-air car wash is only permitted under the SAMC in a C2
27 zone with a conditional use permit. However, the Real Parties could have developed a retail
28  center and restaurant without a drive-through component under the existing Professional zoning.

16 C. The City Conducts CEQA Environmental Review for the Original Project

17 66. In a letter to Respondents dated June 12, 2018, Mr. Andrew Salas, Chairman of the
18 Gabrieleño Band of Mission Indians - Kizh Nation (the "Mission Indians Letter"), requested a
19 consultation regarding the Original Project pursuant to Senate Bill 18 (SB 18), Government Code
20 Section 65352.3. The Mission Indians Letter states in pertinent part, that the Original Project "lies
21 within our ancestral tribal territory, meaning descending from, a higher degree of kinship than
22 traditional or cultural affiliation. Your project is located within a sensitive area and may cause a
23 substantial adverse change in the significance of our tribal cultural resources . . to avoid adverse
24 effects to our triable cultural resources, we would like to consult with you and your staff to
25 provide you with a more complete understanding of the prehistoric use(s) of the project area and
26 the potential risks for causing a substantial adverse change to the significance of our triable

27 cultural resources." (Mission Indians Letter, June 12, 2018.)

28 ///

18
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

67. Respondents requested proposals from numerous environmental consultants for the
2 preparation of CEQA documentation for the project Real Parties proposed at 301 & 325 North
3 Tustin Avenue. Each of these proposals received described the project to include the demolition
4 of all existing uses on both Properties, the construction and development of the proposed uses on
5 both Properties, the zoning amendment and the General Plan amendment: "The project would
6 require a General Plan amendment to change the land use designation at 325 N. Tustin Avenue

7 from PA to GC, a zone change from (P) to Commercial General (C2). . ." (See ex, Circlepoint
8 Proposal to City, March 27. 2018, at p. 1; see also LSA Proposal to City for Environmental
9 Consulting Services, Feb. 20, 2018, at p. 1.)

10 68. Respondents prepared an Initial Environmental Study in connection with the
11 Original Project as required by 'EQA. The Initial Study found "at least one impact that is either
12 'Potentially Significant Impact' or 'Less Than Significant with Mitigation Incorporated"
13 including Cultural Resources, Hazards and Hazardous Materials, Tribal Cultural Resources and
14 Mandatory Findings of Significance.

15 69. Respondents found that there were a number of items that would result in a
16 significant impact on the environment, and the project impacts would only be less than significant
17 with mitigation measures that would be imposed as part of the MND and implemented through the
18 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP"). Respondents found that absent the
19 mitigation measures the project would "cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of
20 an archeological resource," "directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site
21 or unique geological feature," and "disturb any human remains including those interred outside of
22 formal cemeteries." Respondents also found that absent required mitigation measures, the project
23 would "create a significant hazard to the public or the environment through the routine transport,
24 use, or disposal of hazardous materials," "create a significant hazard to the public or the
25 environment through reasonably foreseeable upset and accident conditions involving the release of
26 | hazardous materials into the environment" and "emit hazardous emissions or handle hazardous or
27 acutely hazardous materials, substances, or waste within on-quarter mile of an existing proposed
28 school."

19
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

70. In August 2018, Respondents made a determination based on the Initial Study that
2 "the proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment, there will not be a

3 significant effect in this case because the mitigation measures described on an attached sheet have
4 been added to the project. A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared."

5 (italics added.)

6 71. Finding the project could have a significant environmental impact on tribal cultural
7 resources, hazards such as lead paint and asbestos, and cultural resources at both 325 and 301 N.
8 Tustin Avenue, Respondents thereafter prepared and adopted the MND1 and MMRP pursuant to
9 CEQA. The mitigation measures were to be implemented during all phases of the project,
10 including demolition and construction.

11 72. Petitioners are informed and believe that these mitigation measures are critical to the
12 Mission Indians, who explained during their consultation with Respondents, that 301 & 325 N.
13 Tustin Avenue is a sensitive location in light of their oral and written history, which they shared at
14 length during that consultation, along with highly sensitive supporting documentation, which the
15 tribe only shares with the government during consultation in effort to keep Tribal Cultural
16 Resources protected and preserved. Petitioners are informed and believe that the documentation
17 shared with Respondents included: Historical Map 1938 (CONFIDENTIAL), 2018 Kizh Tribal
18 Map indicating villages overlapping the project area (CONFIDENTIAL), Literature resources
19 describing the village areas within the project area (CONFIDENTIAL); and 1921 Strandt map of
20 Orange County Ancient Indian Camp Sites (CONFIDENTIAL). Petitioners are also informed
21 and believe that during the consultation, the tribe provided Respondents input on the critical
22 mitigation measures for all phases of development of this project, including demolition and
23 construction, and language to include in the mitigation measures.

24 73. Before this consultation occurred, however, Respondents informed the Real Parties
25 that they would include boilerplate-type mitigation language in the environmental review

26

27 Although the City purported to adopt an MND, Petitioners have not been able to locate the MND purported adopted. Petitioners have not been able to obtain a copy of the MND from the City (and other sources) despite making various 28 requests including pursuant to the California Public Records Act.

4 American Monitor to conduct a Native American Indian Sensitivity Training for construction personnel prior to commencement of any excavation activities. The
5 training session shall include a handout and focus on how to identify Native American resources encountered during earthmoving activities and the procedures
6 followed if resources are discovered, the duties of the Native American Monitor and the general steps the Monitor would follow in conducting a salvage investigation. The project developer a shall retain a Native American Monitor to be

8 on-site during all project- related, ground-disturbing construction activities (e.g., pavement removal, auguring, boring, grading, excavation, potholing, trenching,
9 and grubbing) of previously undisturbed native soils."*

11 74. As part of the Original Project (and as part of the Revised Project), 325 and 301
12 North Tustin were to be graded and the MND and MMRP required Real Parties to hire an expert
a 13 to perform a CEQA analysis for any archaeological, paleontological or geologic discoveries and to
14 excavate them appropriately. Similarly, Real Parties were required to allow an archaeologist to
15 evaluate and perform any required analysis of any discovered burial sites or sacred lands. In
16 |addition, prior to commencing construction, Real Parties were required to "retain a Native
17 American Monitor to conduct a Native American Indian Sensitivity Training for construction
18 personnel" and "retain a Native American Monitor to be on-site during all project related, ground
19 disturbing construction activities (e.g. pavement removal, auguring, boring, grading, excavation,
20 potholing, trenching, and grubbing)."

21 75. Prior to demolition, Real Parties were required to conduct an asbestos survey, to
22 remove all asbestos as required and prepare an abatement report. Real Parties were also required
23  to remove all lead-based paint as specified.

24 76. Further, Respondents were required to evaluate whether the project would result in
25  exposure of persons to or generation of excessive groundborne vibrations or noise levels, if the
26 project would expose people or generate noise levels in excess of standards established in the local
27 General Plan or noise ordinance, or applicable standards of other agencies, and whether the project
28 would create a substantial temporary or periodic increase in ambient noise levels in the project

2 part of the Initial Study for the retail building only.

3 D. Respondents Approve the Original Project Along with a Mitigated Negative

4 Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program

5 77. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that a Mitigated Negative Declaration,
6 | Environmental Review No. 2016-156 was completed for the Original Project (the "MND"), as
7 well as a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (the "MMRP"). Plaintiffs are informed
8 and believe that the MND concluded that the Original Project would have a less than significant
9 environmental impact with implementation of mitigation measures to address tribal and cultural
10 resources, and hazards, including asbestos and lead-based paint:

11 a. "The [Original ] Project site will be graded prior to construction, and if

12 during grading, it is revealed that previously unidentified archaeological, paleontological
13 or geologic deposits exist, an expert appropriate to the nature of the find must be afforded

14 the opportunity to evaluate any additional finds and to complete an analysis in accordance

15 with CEQA guidelines, as amended."

16 b. "If future activities in project site adversely impact previously unidentified
17 cultural resources, including burial sites or sacred lands, an archaeologist will be afforded
18 the opportunity to evaluate any additional finds and to complete an analysis in accordance

19 with CEQA guidelines, as amended."

20 C. "Due to the age of the existing building, there is a potential that asbestos
21 containing materials (ACM) and, perhaps, lead-based paint (LBP) may be present.

22 Exposure to either ACM or LBP may expose construction workers and people in the

23 vicinity of the project site to potential health risks."

24 78. On October 8, 2018, the Planning Commission approved two entitlements necessary
25 for the Real Parties to develop the Original Project: a variance for 325 N. Tustin Avenue to reduce
26 setback requirements, and a conditional use permit for 301 N. Tustin Avenue to operate the drive-
27 through portion of the proposed restaurant. (Resolution Nos. 2018-35 and 2018-28, respectively.)
28 Both of these approvals were expressly conditioned on the MND and MMRP (Mitigated Negative

22
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Declaration, Environmental Review No. 2016-156, SCH No. 2018081033) being in effect, as well
2 as the both the General Plan amendment and the zoning amendment being in effect. (See

3 Resolution No. 2018-35, Sec. 3; and Resolution No. 2018-28, Sec. 3.)

4 79. On November 20, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2018-081,
5 adopting the MND and MMRP for the Project. Resolution No. 2018-081 states that the MND

6 |" reflects the City's independent judgment and analysis as lead agency for the project. The [MND]

7 concluded that the project would have a less that significant environmental impact with
8 implementation of mitigation measures. Mitigation measures are included to address cultural

9 resources, hazards, and tribal and cultural resources." The City Council found that "the MND
10 adequately addresses the expected environmental impacts of this project," and because of the
11 adopted mitigation measures the project would not "have a significant adverse effect on the
12 environment.3

13 80. Also on November 20, 2018, the City adopted Resolution No. 2018-082, approving
14 the General Plan Amendment sought by the Real Parties, which changed the land use designation

15 in the General Plan for 301 N. Tustin Avenue from Professional & Administrative Office to
16 General Commercial "to facilitate construction of a new multi-tenant commercial building with
17 ancillary drive-through service at 301 N. Tustin Avenue and a service station at 325 N. Tustin
18 Avenue." Respondents noted that these Properties provide neighborhood facilities and services to
19 the nearby Metro East Mixed-Use Overlay zone (the "MEMU Zone") and professional offices.
20 |(Staff Report to City Council, Nov. 20, 2018, p. 5.)

21 81. On December 4, 2018, the City Council adopted Ordinance No. NS-2960 approving
22 the Real Parties Amendment Application No. 2018-08 amending the zoning designation of the
23 Properties located at 301 N. Tustin Avenue and 325 N. Tustin Avenue from the Professional to the
24 General Commercial (C2) zoning district "in order to facilitate construction of a new multi-tenant
25 commercial building with ancillary drive-through service at 301 North Tustin Avenue and a
26 service station at 325 North Tustin Avenue." The Ordinance further states that "General Plan
27 Amendment No. 2018-05 was filed concurrently with the Amendment Application for consistency
28 with the General Plan." The staff recommended approval of the zoning amendment because it

23
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 "will allow for commercial development that supports the nearby office environment by providing
2 places to visit, shop and dine. In addition, the General Commercial zone permits professional,
3 administrative and business offices should the property owners elect to have office uses in the
future. The proposed drive-through requires discretionary approval of a CUP and the service

6 station yards require a variance. In order to approve a CUP or variance, the General Plan Land
Use designation and the zoning designation must be consistent." (Planning Commission Staff
7 Report, September 24, 2018, p. 5.).

8 82. The City Council's approvals of both the General Plan amendment for 301 N.
9 Tustin Avenue, and the zoning amendment pertaining to both Properties are expressly conditioned
10 the effectiveness of the other, as well as the effectiveness of Resolution No. 2018-081 adopting the
11 MND and MMRP. Failure of any one of those three approvals for any reasons automatically
12 invalidates the other two. Section 6 of the Ordinance expressly states: "This ordinance shall not
13 be effective unless and until Resolution No. 2018-081 (Environmental Review No. 2016-156 and
14 General Plan Amendment No. 2018-05) is adopted and becomes effective. If either resolution
15 and/or ordinance are for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any
16 court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise does not go into effect for any reason, then this
17 ordinance shall be null and void and have no further force and effect." (Ordinance No. NS-2960,
18 Sec. 6.) Resolution 2018-082 is similarly conditioned: "This Resolution shall not be effective

19 unless and until Ordinance No. NS -2960 (AA No. 2018- 08) becomes effective. If said ordinance
20 is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the decision of any court of competent
21 jurisdiction, or otherwise does not go into effect for any reason, then this resolution shall be null
22 and void and have no further force and effect." (Resolution 2018-082, Sec. 5.)

23 83. The Original Project was thus fully entitled as of December 4, 2018, and
24 Respondents led the public to believe that the Real Parties were proceeding with development of
25 that Original Project as approved.

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

E. The Applicants Demolished the Restaurant on 301 N. Tustin Avenue which

2 Disrupts Petitioner's Dental Business

3 84. On or about May 20, 2019-prior to disclosing to the public Real Parties' revision

4 to the project-Respondents issued a demolition permit to the Real Parties to demolish the

5 restaurant building on 301 N. Tustin. The restaurant building was located roughly in the middle of

6 the site. Demolition of that restaurant occurred over several weeks sometime thereafter, but
7 without any prior notice to neighboring properties such as Petitioner Choe, who operates her

8 dental practice on the southern adjacent property.
9 85. The disturbance from the Real Parties' demolition on 301 N. Tustin Avenue was so
10 severe that it caused severe, jarring vibrations inside Petitioner Choe's building, and such loud
11 noise inside her building, that patients were scared and decided not to continue their treatment,
12 Petitioner Choe could not perform the exams or use sensitive, delicate dental treatments because
13 of the jarring vibrations, and because it prevented Petitioner Choe from being able to focus on the
14 precise medical tasks she was performing. During demolition, Petitioner Choe was forced to close
15 her dental practice early, start late, or was unable to take any patients at all because the severe
16 vibrations and noise made it impossible to do so.

17 86. Petitioner Choe's tenants, who operate a massage business in Petitioner Choe's
18 building on 171 N. Tustin Avenue, were also prevented from operating their business on several
19 occasions during the restaurant demolition on 301 N. Tustin Avenue, due to the extreme noise and
20 vibrations heard and felt from inside the building. After one day of demolition, Petitioner Choe
21 found a vertical crack in an interior wall in an exam room that spans from the ceiling to the floor.
22 This crack was not there prior to the demolition of the restaurant building.

23 87. Petitioners are informed and believe that the demolition was done without

24 compliance with the mitigation measures imposed pursuant to the MND and MMRP. Further,
25 neither the City nor Real Parties have provided any evidence of such compliance.

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

F. With Only 10 Days-Notice to a Handful of Properties, the City Proposes to
Approve the Developer's Revised Project with a Massive Car Wash Instead
of a Retail Building and Find the Revised Project Categorically Exempt

4 from CEQA

5 88. Nine months after the Original Project was fully approved, Respondents posted and

6 mailed to only a handful of properties a "Notice of Public Hearing before the Santa Ana Planning
7 Commission," dated August 30, 2019 (the "August 30th Notice"). Respondents' August 30th

8 Notice was the very first time Respondents informed the public that the project referred to by
0 Respondents as the "Russell Fischer Commercial Center" and approved for 325 and 301 N. Tustin
10 Avenue the year prior, no longer included the Retail/Restaurant development on 301 N. Tustin
11 Avenue, but instead, "[s]ince the zone change, the property owner has revised the project" to
12 "substitute" a massive, automated carwash on 301 North Tustin, including a 4,354 square foot car
13 wash tunnel and 20 vacuum bays, for the approved retail building. The service station and
14 convenience store plans for 325 N. Tustin Avenue were unchanged.

15 89. The August 30th Notice stated that the Planning Commission would hold a Public
16 Hearing on September 9, 2019, and take action on three items for the "revised" project, which was
17 described as follows: "The applicant proposes to demolish the existing service station, car wash,
18  and convenience store to construct a new service station with 3,040-square foot convenience store

19 and new automated car wash. The project includes a request for (1) Conditional Use Permit No.
20 2019-30 to allow a car wash, (2) amendment to Variance No. 2018-10 to allow a reduction in the
21 City's yard standards, and (3) Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-31 to allow a convenience store to
22 operate 24 hours a day." a

23 90. The August 30th Notice also stated that the Revised Project was categorically
24 exempt from CEQA environmental review as an in-fill development project:

25 "[T]he project is categorically exempt from further environmental review pursuant

26 to CEQA Guidelines Section 15332, Class 32, In-fill Development Projects. This exemption applies to in-fill development provided it is consistent with the General
27 Plan and zoning designation. The combined development site is 1.46 acres and surrounded by urban uses. The site was previously developed with commercial uses
28 and has no habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. The project will not

26
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

result in any significant impacts related to traffic, noise, air quality or water quality

2 according to the traffic impact analysis and with implementation of water quality
requirements."

3 91. Thus, even though Respondents determined in late 2018 that the Original Project for
301 N. Tustin Avenue required environmental CEQA review and adopted the MND and MMRP,

5 in part because 301 N. Tustin Avenue was found to be located "within a sensitive area and may
cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of [the Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians

7 Kizh Nation's] tribal cultural resources," Respondents determined that the Revised project-by
8 substituting : massive car wash in the place of the retail building on 301 N. Tustin Avenue
would have no significant effect on the environment and did not need to comply with the
10  previously adopted MND and MMRP or conduct environmental review for this major revision
11 under CEQA. Accordingly, Respondents both posted and filed the Notice of Exemption for the
12 Revised Project on September 10, 2019.
13 G. The City Concealed the Revised Project from Petitioners and the Publie
14 92. It has recently become apparent, that failure to give notice of the restaurant
15 demolition on 301 N. Tustin Avenue was neither the first, nor the last time both Respondents and
16 the Real Parties failed to provide adequate notice to the public regarding actions taken, and
17 developments and changes to the project. In fact, the record will show that providing no or
18 inadequate notice, withholding information, and allowing the Real Parties to proceed above the
19 law is not the exception but the rule, and so much so, that it is Respondents' clear pattern and
20 |practice with respect to this project.
21 93. Petitioners are informed and believe that the project's evolution from its inception in
22 2016, to the City Council's final approvals on October 15, 2019, reveal that the Real Parties never
23 intended to develop the retail center and drive-through restaurant components of the Original
24 Project on 301 N. Tustin Avenue, and only proposed that version to avoid opposition from the
25 community while obtaining the major entitlements needed to develop the Properties.
26 94. As pictured above, Respondents expressly inquired whether the C2 zone change
requesting for 301 N. Tustin Avenue would "allow for a carwash use, either as an 27 they were
28 allowed or conditioned use?" as early as April 19, 2017, and listed a car wash in project

27
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Submittal Affidavit dated November 18, 2016. Then, almost immediately upon the Original
2 Project with retail center being fully approved, the Real Parties submitted plans to "revise" the

3 project by replacing the retail center and restaurant on 301 N. Tustin Avenue with the Real
4 Parties' "bread and butter" - a massive, noisy, unappealing, and offensive express car wash
5 complete with a 4,354-square foot car wash tunnel to be located only inches from Dr. Choe's

6 |building, twenty vacuum bays, two automated pay stations, and 189 feet of stacking for cars to
7 queue. (Staff Report to Planning Commission, Sept. 9, 2019, at p. 2.) After all, the Applicant,
8 Mr. Chase Russel and Russell Fischer LP, are exclusively car wash owners/developers, as pointed
9 out in the staff report to the Planning Commission: "The property owner has revised the project to
10 include a car wash component instead of retail development. The current property owner has
11 been in the car wash industry for over 30 years and operates six locations in Orange County." (Id.
12 at p. 4.)

13 95. Unbeknownst to the public, and most egregiously, unbeknownst to the immediately
14 surrounding community, Respondents and the Real Parties acted in cahoots and in secret to
15 circumvent the law sO they could fast-track the major, unappealing, and detrimental car wash
16 revisions to the Project without opposition from impacted members of the community. The very
17 first time the public was notified of the major project revisions, was the public notice for the
18 September 9, 2019 Planning Commission hearing mentioned above. That notice revealed that the
19 Real Parties had submitted a "revised plan" for the project, which proposed to "replace" the retail
20 building and restaurant approved as part of the Original Project for 301 N. Tustin with a massive
21 automated car wash (the "Revised Project"). Worse yet, Respondents now asserted that the
22 Revised Project was categorically exempt from all environmental review under CEQA as an in-fill
23 development project under Section 15332 of the California Code of Regulations ("CCR").

24 96. Prior to Respondents publishing and distributing the September 9, 2019 Notice,
25 certain Petitioners inquired about the project development at 301 N. Tustin Avenue because it was
26 Iwell known that the property owner and project Applicant, Real Parties Russell Fischer, LP and
27 Chase Russell, owned six (6) car washes in Orange County, and Real Party Richard Finkel of
28 Bundy-Finkel Associates, is a car wash developer that sits on the board of the Irvine Advisory

28 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Group - Carwash Consultants • "a consultancy headed by Paul Dadgar that has specialized in all

2 facets of the carwash industry for over 25 years." Accordingly, astute residents and business
3 owners like Petitioners found it curious that a car wash owner and a car wash developer would tear

4 down the existing car wash on 325 N. Tustin Avenue, and develop on 301 N. Tustin Avenue a
5 multi-tenant commercial retail center with restaurant.

6 97. Petitioner, Karina Conklin, visited the City Planning Department in person in early
7 July 2019, and specifically inquired as to whether the development at 301 N. Tustin Avenue had

8 changed from the Original Project approved by Respondents to a project involving a car wash.

9 Respondents informed Ms. Conklin that only the 2018 Original Project was before the City, and
10 referred her to the information page for the "Russell Fischer Commercial Center" on the City's
11 website. (See https://www.santa-ana.org/pb/planning-division/major-planning-projects-and-
12 documents/russell-fischer-commercial-center). Petitioner Conklin, as a concerned Santa Ana
13 [business owner, requested Respondents to inform her if the project changed. Despite Petitioner
14 Conklin's request, Respondents did not include her in the notification list for the August 30th
15  Notice, which was distributed only to those within 500 feet of the Revised Project.

16 98. Contrary to the City's representation to Petitioner Conklin, Respondents received
17 Inew development plans replacing the retail center and restaurant portion of the project on 301 N.
18 Tustin Avenue with the massive car wash on April 26, 2019. In fact, Petitioners are informed and

19 believe that Respondents learned of Real Parties intent to revise the project to include a car wash

1 99. Respondents also received payment from Real Parties for review of the Revised
2 Project on April 26, 2019. Moreover, Respondents' Planning Department submitted a
3  Discretionary Action New Submittal" memo to various City departments on May 1, 2019
4 regarding the newly proposed Revised Project for 301 N. Tustin Avenue. Respondents also
5 received a "Revised Focused Traffic Impact Analysis Report" from Real Parties in Interest for the
6 Revised Project on or about May 17, 2019. Respondents' project page for the "Russell Fischer
7 Commercial Center" on the City's website reflected the Original Project until August 29, 2019,
8 when the Revised Project was finally displayed - four months after Respondents received
9 development plans and payment for the Revised Project.

10 100. Respondents took active measures to conceal the evolution of the project at 301 N.
11 Tustin Avenue from the Original Project that, for over three (3) years, had been explained to the
12 public, discussed at numerous City meetings and hearings, shown to the public with site plans and
13  project mock ups, and displayed on the project page on the city's website as the Russell Fischer

14 Commercial Center up until ten (10) days before the September 9th hearing, as a service station,
15 convenience store, and retail center with drive-through restaurant. Moreover, Respondents
16 should have informed Petitioners that the project at 301 N. Tustin Avenue did in fact include a car
17 wash when Petitioner expressly inquired in early July. These factors evidence that the ten-day
18 notice distributed only to those within 500 feet of the Revised Project was not intended to inform
19 the public, but rather to conceal the drastic change in the project for 301 N. Tustin Avenue. If
20 Petitioners were provided adequate notice, they could have obtained experts, had necessary studies
21 conducted regarding the Revised Project, submitted Public Records Act requests for project
22 documents and materials, and had time to review and analyze the documents and plans for the
23 newly proposed Revised Project, before the September 9th hearing. Respondents denied

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioners of this opportunity and the result was prejudicial to them.

2 H. Petitioners Submit Written Oppositions and Speak at the Hearing in

3 Opposition
101. Prior to the September 9, 2019 hearing on the Revised Project before Respondent's

5 Planning Commission, Petitioner Choe submitted written comments opposing the Revised Project
6 stating her concerns over the impact of noise and vibrations on her dental practice because of the

7 sensitive nature of her work and her medical equipment, as well as her tenant's massage business.

8 102. Petitioners William Conklin and Karina Conklin also timely submitted written

9 comments in opposition prior to the hearing addressing, among other things, Respondents'
10 violation of CEQA. Petitioners also objected that the August 30th Notice was insufficient to afford
11 interested persons like themselves an adequate opportunity to prepare and protect their interests.
12 Petitioners requested that the hearing being continued so that interested parties may have sufficient
13 time to obtain and review the project materials for the newly Revised Project, but Respondents'
14 Planning Commission denied that request.

15 103. Petitioner Choe appeared in person at the September 9, 2019 Planning Commission
16 hearing and voiced her concerns to the Board of Commissioners over the significant
17 environmental impacts the Revised Project will have on her property and business as an

18 immediately adjacent, and uniquely sensitive use.

19 104. Petitioners William and Karina Conklin spoke in opposition to the Revised Project
20 at the September 9th hearing through their representative.

21 I. Respondents' Planning Commission Approves the Revised Project and
22 Finds it Exempt From CEQA

23 105. At the September 9, 2019 hearing, the Planning Commission approved the Revised
24 Project by granting two conditional use permits, amending a variance issued for the Original
25 Project, and adopting Notice of Exemption, Environmental Review No. 2019-69, finding the
26 Revised Project categorically exempt from CEQA environmental review pursuant to Section
27 15332 for certain infill developments. In issuing these approvals, the Planning Commission chose
28 to ignore the portions of the project that had already been implemented-including the General

31
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Plan amendment and zoning changes-determined that the Revised Project was categorially
2 exempt from CEQA (which was not available because of, among other things, the General Plan
3 | and zoning changes), and abandoned the MND and MMRP adopted to implement the mitigation
4 measures previously determined by the City Council as necessary for the project to avoid
5 significant environmental impacts on, inter alia, cultural resources, hazards, and tribal and cultural

6 resources. (See Resolution No. 2018-081.)

7 J. The City Posts and Files a Notice of Exemption for the Revised Project

8 106. On September 10, 2019, Respondents both filed and posted the NOE for the

9 Revised Project, which stated the Project was categorically exempt from CEQA review pursuant
10 to Section 15332. The NOE states the following under "Reason(s) Why Project Is Exempt From
11 CEQA:" "The project is consistent with the General Plan and zoning designation. The site is 1.46
12 acres and surrounded by urban uses. The site was previously developed and has no habitat for
13 endangered, rare or threatened species. The project will not result in any significant impacts
14 related to traffic, noise, air quality or or [sic] water quality."

15 107. Respondents did not make single reference to the potential for cultural resources
16  or tribal cultural resources on 325 and 301 N. Tustin Avenue, after August 30, 2019, when the
17 project proposed with the car wash publicly became the Revised Project. Respondents also did
18 not mention the hazardous substances that could be released into the air from demolition,
19 Jincluding asbestos and lead-paint.

20 K. Petitioners File an Appeal to the City Council but the City Refuses to

21 Withdraw the September 10th NOE Pending the Hearing
22 108. On September 19, 2019, Petitioners filed an appeal of the City's Planning
23 Commission's approvals of the Revised Project, including the categorical exemption
24 determination to the City Council.

25 109. California Public Resource Code section 21151 requires the City to provide an
26 appeal of the Planning Commission's categorical exemption determination to the City Council.
27 The City's CEQA guidelines provide for such an appeal as well.

28 110. Petitioner requested that the City withdraw the NOE in light of the appeal to the

32
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 City Council, but the City refused.
111. The City's refusal to withdraw the NOE pending the hearing on the appeal
3 necessitated Petitioners filing of the original writ petition in this case when they did in light of the
4 35-day statute of limitation to challenge an NOE pursuant to Section 21167(d) of the Public
5 Resources Code.

6 L. Respondents Issue the Public Notice for the Appeal Hearing before the City

7 Council

8 112. On or about October 4, 2019, Respondents issued a public notice stating the
9 Petitioners' appeal of the Revised Project would be heard by the City Council at the October 15,
10 2019 meeting (the "Appeal Notice"). Petitioners immediately challenged this notice as defective
11 because it did not include the Petitioners' CEQA challenge, including its challenge of the NOE, in
12 the description of the appeal to be heard and considered by the City Council. In fact, the Appeal
13 Notice actually reasserted that the Revised Project was categorically exempt from CEQA review
14 pursuant to the NOE the Petitioners challenged in their appeal. The relevant section of the notices
15 is shown below.

16 NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN - The City Council of the City of Santa Ana will hold a public hearing

17 of Appeal Application No. 2019-03. The appellant is appealing the decision of the Planning Commission approving Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-30 to allow a car wash at 301 North Tustin Avenue, and amendment to Variance No. 2018-10 to allow a reduced front yard at 301 North Tustin Avenue and
18 Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-31 to allow after-hours operations for the convenience store at 325 North Tustin Avenue. On September 9, 2019, the Planning Commission voted 4:0 with one absence to
19 approve the project.

20 Environmental Impact - In accordance with the California Quality Environmental Act (CEQA), Environmental Review No. 2019-69 the project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15332,
21 Class 32, In-fill Development Projects.

22

23 113. In addition, nothing in the notice indicated that the City Council would consider
24 adopting additional categorical exemptions for the revised Project.

25 114. In response to Petitioners objection to the deficient notice and request to properly
26 re-notice the hearing, Respondents asserted that the notice was proper and refused to correct the

27 I notice.

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 M. The City Council Denies Petitioners' Appeal of the Planning Commission's
Revised Project Approvals

3 115. On October 15, 2019, Petitioners' appeal was heard by the City Council at the
4 regular meeting. Dozens of individuals from the community appeared at the appeal hearing and
5 several spoke in opposition to the newly proposed Car Wash, include approximately thirty
6 representatives of Petitioner Santa Ana Needs Equity (SANE).

7 116. At that hearing, the City Council expressly acknowledged the sloppy work by
8 Planning Department staff with respect to the Revised Project, and the City's exposure to liability
9 as a result thereof. Nonetheless, the City Attorney and Director of Planning advised that the City
10 adopt a new Notice of Exemption for the Revised Project, even though the fact that the City was
11 considering a new categorical exemption finding was not identified in the Appeal Notice, in the
12 Agenda for the Appeal Hearing, or anywhere prior to the Planning Director's presentation to the
13 City Council on the Appeal.

14 117. Pursuant to the Applicants express agreement to fully indemnify Respondents for
15 |liability in connection with approving the Revised Project, the City Council voted and denied the
16 Petitioners' appeal on October 15, 2019, thus approving the Planning Commission's multiple
17 project approvals from September 9, 2019.

18 118. In addition, the City Council purportedly approved a new finding that the Revised
19 Project is categorially exempt from environmental review under CEQA pursuant to Section
20 15303(c) for new construction or conversion of small structures.3

21 119. On October 16, 2019, Respondents filed and posted a new Notice of Exemption,
22 Environmental Review No. 2019-069, reflecting the City Council's determination that the Revised
23 Project is exempt from CEQA review pursuant to two categorical exemptions: the in-fill
24 development exemption per the September 10, 2019 NOE, and the new construction exemption
25 under Section 15303(c) of the Guidelines, per the October 16, 2019 NOE.

26

27 This additional finding was not actually part of the motion made, seconded and approved by the City Council at the hearing. Rather, it was stated by the City Attorney at the hearing and then apparently added to the documents after the 28 fact.

34
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

2 previously adopted for the Original Project, which are of equal concern for the Revised Project. In

3 addition to the Respondents approvals and findings that the Revised Project is categorically
4 exemption under CEQA, this abandonment of the MND and all mitigation measures set forth in

FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
[Against All Respondents for a Writ of Mandate to Set Aside All Approvals for the Revised
Project, including the Categorical Exemption and Notices of Exemption for Violation of
CEQA Against All Respondents]

5 122. Petitioners reallege and incorporate each of the prior allegations as set forth in full.

6 123. A court shall issue a writ of mandate ordering a public agency to perform a
7 mandatory duty under CEQA if the court finds the agency committed a prejudicial abuse of
8 discretion. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5; Code Civ. Proc. § 1085(a).) In the context of CEQA, an
9 abuse of discretion "means the agency failed to proceed as required by law or there was no
10 substantial evidence to support its decision." (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.)

11 124. Respondents and the Real Parties have attempted to evade environmental review
12 under CEQA by analyzing and approving the Revised Project in piecemeal fashion. CEQA
13 requires the City to conduct subsequent environmental review following the MND based on the
14 substantial changes to the project by the addition of the car wash. CEQA does not authorize the
15 City to abandon the MND and MMRP previously adopted. Moreover, even if CEQA allowed the
16 City to evaluate the Revised Project anew, the City is required to include the entire project in the
17 review, including the portions already completed such as the General Plan and zoning
18 amendments. When the entire project is included, Respondents are precluded from invoking

19 either of the categorical exemptions selected. Further, the addition of the car wash would have
20 substantial impacts on the environment requiring the preparation of an Environmental Impact
21 Report ("EIR"), subsequent EIR, MND or subsequent MND. But even without the impacts from
22 the car wash, the substantial environmental impacts identified as part of the original MND still
23 apply to the Revised Project, which precludes the City from utilizing a categorical exemption for
24 the Revised Project regardless of how it is analyzed.

25 A. The City Engaged in Prohibited Piecemealing and Failed to Conduct

26 Subsequent Environmental Review

27 125. "The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act 'to be
28 interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within

36 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 the reasonable scope of the statutory language.'" (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of
2 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390 [citing Friends of Mammoth v. Board of

3 Supervisors (1975) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259].)

4 126. To that end *"CEQA forbids 'piecemeal' review of the significant environmental
5 impacts of a project." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. V. Board of Port Comrs. (2001) 91
6 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.) "This standard is consistent with the principle that 'environmental
7 considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones-each

8 a with a minimal potential impact on the environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous
9 consequences." (Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 396.)

10 127. Respondents engaged in unlawful piecemealing of the Project in blatant violation of
11 CEQA by omitting portions of the project for which an MND and MMRP were previously
12 ladopted, approving modifications to the Original Project without further environmental review,
13 and then carving out handpicked portions from the Revised Project. Respondents then defined
14 those handpicked selections as the "project" in order to avoid necessary further environmental
15 |review, as well as compliance with the mitigation measures Respondents required for the Original
16 Project via the MND and MMRP. The Petitioners as well as the general public will suffer grave
17 | harm if Respondents are permitted to continue morphing the Project, via piecemeal modifications,
18 and ultimately permit development of that Project without necessary mitigation measures, as they
19 have currently attempted and actually begun to do.

20 128. For purposes of CEQA coverage, a "project" is defined as comprising "the whole of
21 an action" that has the potential to result in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical
22 change to the environment. (14 Cal Code Regs §15378(a).) Thus, the term "project" refers to the
23 activity for which approval is sought, not to each separate governmental approval that may be
24 required for the activity to occur. (14 Cal Code Regs §15378(c).) Accordingly, the lead agency
25 must describe the project to encompass the entirety of the activity that is proposed for approval to
26 ensure that all potential impacts of the proposed project will be examined before it is approved.
27 (14 Cal Code Regs §15378(a), (d).) An initial study that fails to describe the entire project is
28 fatally deficient: "[A] correct determination of the nature and scope of the project is a critical step

37
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (in complying with the mandates of CEQA." (Nelson v County of Kern (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th
2 252, 267 [county violated CEQA by not including new surface mining as part of project when

3 county was required to approve mining in addition to reclamation plan].)

4 129. In the August 9, 2018 Initial Study completed for the for the Project, Respondents
5 defined the originally proposed project, which was the evaluated for environmental impacts, to
6 include five (5) actions: (1) Development Project Approval for 325 N. Tustin Avenue and 301 N.
7 Tustin Avenue; (2) Conditional Use Permit for drive through services on 301 N. Tustin Avenue;
8 (3) Variance application for reduced landscape setback at 325 N. Tustin Avenue; (4) General Plan
Amendment to revise land use designations of two parcels from Professional Administration
10 Office to General Commercial; and (5) Amendment Application to change the zoning of four
11 parcels from Professional to General Commercial (C2). (Initial Study, p. 10.) Respondents
12 described the Original Project as follows:

13 "The proposed project will facilitate the redevelopment of a site with a 2,778-square
14 foot gas station convenience store, a 2,117-square foot gas pump canopy, and a
15 7,417-square foot multi-tenant retail building on two parcels totaling 1.46 acres in
16 the City of Santa Ana. The project also includes a General Plan Amendment to the

17 Land Use Plan Map, an Amendment Application (zone change) to the Zoning Map
18 on two properties of the Tustin Avenue Retail Development Project site (1.46 acres)
19 and three adjacent properties (2.78 acres), which together will be known as the Tustin

20 Avenue Retail Project site and total approximately 4.24 acres." (Initial Study, p. 4.)
21 130. Respondents expressly describe the Original Project to include "the demolition of
and carwash at 325 N. Tustin Avenue and demolition of the 22 the existing gas station, gas canopy,
23| existing restaurant building at 301 N. Tustin Avenue." (Initial Study, p. 10.)
24 131. Respondents September 24, 2018 staff report to the Planning Commission
25 concerning the Original Project recommended approval of the General Plan Amendment sought by
26 Real Parties in Interest because it would "create an approximately 4-acre General Commercial
27 area at the northeast and southeast corners of Tustin Avenue and Fourth Street," and the zone
28 change because it would "create a continuous block of commercial uses that will stimulate the

38 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 economy in the area." (Staff Report, September 24, 2018.)

2 132. The "Determination" reported by Respondents in the Initial Study was that the
3 Original Project would have a less than significant effect on the following environmental areas
4 with mitigation measures incorporated: cultural resources, hazards and hazardous materials, and
5 tribal cultural resources. It follows then that without these mitigation measures, the Original

6 Project will have a significant effect on these environmental areas. The specific mitigation
7 measures adopted for the Original Project are discussed supra in this Petition.

8 133. Thereafter, Respondents prepared the MND for the Original Project,4 as well as the

9 MMRP (SCH # 2018081033). Respondents (City Council) adopted Resolution No. 2018-081
10 adopting the MND and MMRP on November 20, 2018. The Resolution states that the MND

11 "concluded that the [Original] [P]roject would have a less than significant environmental impact
12 with implementation of mitigation measures. Mitigation measures are included to address cultural
13 resources, hazards, and tribal and cultural resources." The Resolution further states that the "City
14 Council has, as a result of its consideration and the evidence presented at the hearings on this
15 matter, determined that, as required pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
16 and the State CEQA Guidelines, the MND adequately addresses the expected environmental
17 impacts of this [Original] [P]roject."

18 134. On or about May 20, 2019, Real Parties in Interest applied for, and Respondents
19 issued, a demolition permit for the demolition of the restaurant building on 301 N. Tustin Avenue.
20 The demolition occurred in approximately June 2019 and has since been completed.
21 135. On September 10, 2019, Respondents filed and posted the NOE (Notice of
22 Exemption, Environmental Review No. 2019-69), which states the "project" is categorially
23 exempt from CEQA review pursuant to Section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines, as in-fill
24 development project. In the NOE, Respondents now define the "proposed project" as:
25

26

27 4 To date, Petitioner have been unable to review the MND because Respondents have failed to produce the MND in response to a Public Records Act Request submitted by Petitioners on September 12, 2019, as well as several other
28 informal requests. The MND is not available on the City's website, nor is it available on the is State Clearinghouse website.

39
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

l"Demolition of the existing service station, car wash and convenience store to construct a new
2 service station with 3,040-square foot convenience store and new automated car wash."

3 136. The "project" as defined in the NOE deviates significantly from the Original
4 Project, for which the Initial Study, MND and MMRP were adopted. The revised "project" adds
5 the following: (1) Application for Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-30 to allow a car wash on 301

6 N. Tustin Avenue; (2) Application for Amendment to Variance No. 2018-10 to allow a reduction

7 in the City's yard standards for 301 N. Tustin Avenue because Variance No. 2018-10 only applied

8 to 325 N. Tustin Avenue - the retail/restaurant development on 301 N. Tustin Avenue did not
9 require a variance; and (3) Application for Conditional Use Permit No. 2019-31 to allow a
10 convenience store to operate 24 hours a day. The project location is identified in the NOE as 301
11 N. Tustin Avenue and 325 N. Tustin Avenue, which are now referenced as within "the General
12 Commercial (C2) zone."

13 137. Respondents improperly omit the following major components of the Original
14 Project from the revised project description: (1) General plan amendment No. 2018-05 to change
15 the designation of the 301 N. Tustin Avenue, 431 N. Tustin Avenue, and 2321 East Fourth Street
16 to General Commercial; (2) Zoning Amendment Application No. 2018-08 to change the zoning of
17 the properties at 301 N. Tustin Avenue, 325 N. Tustin Avenue, 401 N. Tustin Avenue, and 2320
18 East Fourth Street to C2; (3) Variance No. 2018-10 to allow a reduction in the City's yard
19 standards; and (4) demolition of the buildings on 301 and 325 N. Tustin Avenue.
20 138. Respondents' revised project definition set forth in the NOE is a blatant attempt to
21 circumvent CEQA by piecemealing the project, and by avoiding subsequent environmental review
22 required by CEQA when a project undergoes significant modifications after initial MND approval.
23 These unlawful and prejudicial efforts are evident from the record. For instance, Respondents
24 erroneously assume that the project is located on properties zoned C2, and with a General Plan
25 designation of General Commercial, when these applications and approvals were major
26 components of the Original Project. In fact, development of the proposed car wash on 301 N.
27 Tustin Avenue could not occur without those approvals.
28 ///

40
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 139. Per the original NOE and the second NOE, Respondents improperly abandoned the
2 MND and the MMRP adopted for the Original Project only months before, and claim as of
3 September 10, 2019 (Planning Commission) and October 15, 2019 (City Council), that the revised

4 project is categorially exempt from CEQA review as an in-fill development project. Accordingly,
5 Respondents are permitting Real Parties to proceed with development of the revised project

6 without complying with any of the mitigation measures identified in the MND and MMRP for
7 cultural and tribal and cultural resources, as well as hazards.

8 140. Because the Revised Project for purposes of CEQA must include all of the
9 component parts, including the General Plan amendment and zone change already completed, the
10 Revised Project cannot qualify for the infill categorical exemption. As discussed above, the in-fill
11 development exemption is subject to five limitations including that the project must be consistent
12 with the applicable General Plan designation and all applicable General Plan policies, as well as
13 with any applicable zoning designation and regulation (14 Cal Code Regs §15332(a)). The CEQA
14 exemption set forth in Section 15303(c) similarly requires the project be consistent with the
15 zoning. Thus, as a matter of law, a project that includes a General Plan amendment or a zone
16 change-as was the case here- -is not eligible for either exemption.
17 141. Respondents actions constitute piecemeal project approval prohibited under CEQA,
18 and negate Respondents' determination that the project is categorically exempt as an in-fill
19 development project because Respondents cannot carve out the General Plan Amendment and
20 Zoning Amendment from the project in order to rely on the result of those approvals to satisfy the
21 requirements for the in-fill exemption. The General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment are
22 a significant part of the Revised Project, which includes the proposed modifications to develop a
23 car wash on 301 N. Tustin Avenue instead of the retail center, because the car wash could not have
24 been developed on the property without those changes. Commercial development of those
25 properties is the exact reason Real Parties applied for the General Plan Amendment and the
26 Zoning Amendment because the Revised Project could not be developed without those initial
27 approvals.

28 142. The Revised Project is also inconsistent with the City's General Plan Goals and

41 FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 / Policies because the car wash development will not promote economic growth, sales tax revenue,
2 or jobs, and it is aesthetically unappealing at an identified gateway to the City. In addition, per the

3 Resolutions and Ordinance Respondents adopted and the City Council approved on October 15,

4 2019, the General Plan Amendment and Zoning Amendment pertaining to the Properties is
5 automatically "null and void" because Respondents abandoned the MND and MMRP.

6 143. Moreover, Respondents were required to determine whether subsequent
7 environmental review of the Original Project was required in light of the modifications Real
8 Parties requested in 2019 as part of the Revised Project-i.e. the substitution of the car wash for
9 the retail building. If Respondents determined that no subsequent environmental review was
10 mandated by the modifications, then the MND and MMRP remained in effect and compliance

11 with the mitigation measures set forth therein was required. If Respondents determined that
12 further environmental review was necessary in light of the Modifications, then CEQA required
13 Respondents to adopt a subsequent environmental review document.

14 144. Further environmental review was required here because the addition of a massive,
15 automated car wash in the Revised Project creates environmental concerns that are distinct from
16 those associated with a retail building and were not considered in Respondents' Initial Study in
17 connection with the Original Project, or the MND. For example, the retail building in the Original
18 Project would produce no significant impacts on noise, vibration or traffic. In contrast, the
19 laddition of the car wash development on 301 N. Tustin Avenue constitutes a substantial change in
20 light of, among other things, the vibrations, noise and traffic impacts the car wash will generate,
21 and that the car wash tunnel will be constructed merely inches from highly sensitive use as a

22 dental office on 171 N. Tustin Avenue.

23 145. Subsequent environmental review was necessary to analyze whether the Revised
24 Project will have a significant impact on vibrations. Vibration is sound radiated through the
25 ground. Groundborne noise is rumbling sound caused by the vibration of room surfaces.
26 According to the EPA's technical guideline on vibrations, the dental office constitutes a "critical
27 area" that requires lower vibration levels to be acceptable. The preferred values for Petitioner
28 |Choe's office are: 0.0050 (z-axis), 0.0036 (x- and y-axes), with maximum values of 0.010 (z-axis),

42
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 0.0072 (x- and y-axes). Petitioner Choe stated in her written comments opposing the Car Wash
2 Project, that her medical/dental machinery and equipment and highly sensitive hand pieces such as

3 the drill for nerve treatment, will cease to function even at very low vibration levels.
146. The vibrations generated by the car wash are "serious environmental impacts" that
5 Respondents should have evaluated in a subsequent environmental review document when they

6 revised the Original Project to include a car wash. This is particularly true because of the unique
7 location of the 4,354 square-foot car wash tunnel on 301 N. Tustin Avenue, only inches from the
8 dental office building on 171 N. Tustin Avenue, and the opening of the tunnel towards the

9 sidewalk and professional business uses across the street. (See supra, site plan image.) A
10 vibration impact assessment needed to be performed and considered before the Revised Project
11 was approved. Similarly, the extremely close proximity of the car wash tunnel to the Petitioner
12 Choe's building is unusual and thus mandates further assessment and evaluation so that mitigation
13 measures may be incorporated into the project, including for construction, if possible, and as
14  conditions to any project approvals. The vibration and noise disturbance Petitioner Choe suffered
15 during the restaurant demolition at 301 N. Tustin Avenue, which was significantly further away
16 from her building than the mere inches to the tunnel of the new car wash, evidences the unusual
17 circumstances of the Revised Project and need for these evaluations prior to any approvals for the
18 Project.

19 147. The Revised Project will have a significant impact on noise by the addition of a
20 massive, automated car wash. According to the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), Noise
21 levels are generally considered low when they are below 45 dBA, moderate in the 45 to 60 dBA
22 range, and high above 60 dBA. The car wash will operate from 7:00 am to 7:00 or 8:00 pm, seven
23 days per week, and will service up to 30,000 cars per month. Prior to its demolition in 2019, 301
24 N. Tustin Avenue was developed with a restaurant located in the center of the property and had
25 been used as such since 1965. The generation of noise from the industrial equipment used within
26 the car wash tunnel, the twenty (20) vacuum bays, the extremely close proximity of the tunnel to a
27 highly sensitive use, and the location of the car wash primarily surrounded by office/professional
28 uses, is unique. The car wash will have a significant effect on the surrounding environment

43
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 especially, Petitioner Choe's property and medical and dental practice, as well as her tenant's
2 massage business, pedestrian traffic directly in front of the tunnel, and professional/business office
3 directly across the street.
148. Immediately prior to filing of the initial Petition, Petitioners became informed and

5 on that basis believe that Respondents disclosed for the first time that a noise study had been

6 performed for the car wash portion of the Revised Project. The LSA Noise Impact Analysis dated
7 July 2019 (the "LSA Noise Study") cites two (2) of Respondents' conditions of approval for the
8 Revised Project:

9 Conditions of Approval

10 The City requires that the following conditions of approval be met:

11 21. Submit a technical noise study prepared by a firm specializing in noise studies to the City for review by the Planning Division, Police Department, and Code Enforcement Division that
12 demonstrates that the existing exterior noise levels and that the proposed design and equipment of the car wash will conform to City noise ordinances, and the General Plan, and 13 will minimize noise impacts on adjacent properties.

14 22. A condition of approval for the project will include a requirement for a noise study based on updated field measurements within the applicant to submit
one month of commencement
15 of operations (issuance of a certificate of occupancy), and again on the one-year anniversary of the commencement of operations, to ensure compliance with the City's noise ordinances. 16

17 I(LSA Noise Study, p. 8.)

18 149. The LSA Noise Study goes on to state: "This analysis has been prepared to satisfy

19 Condition of Approval 21." (LSA Noise Study, p. 10.) The LSA Noise Study determines that

20 there are no surrounding sensitive uses because they are all commercial and office uses. (Id. at p.
21 11.) The City's General Plan noise element provides that the desirable maximum noise level for

22 commercial land use is 65 decibels and the maximum acceptable noise level is 70 decibels. "The
23 City of Santa Ana does not currently have specific requirements for commercial and medical

24 office uses within its Municipal Code." (LSA Noise Study, p. 19.)

25 150. The LSA Noise Study found that the "noise levels measured at the end of the car

26 wash tunnel" alone would be 81.9 dBA 13 feet away in the direction of the businesses across the
27 street and 73.7 dBA 20 feet from the end of the tunnel "90 degrees off-center"-i.e. on the other
28 side of Petitioner Choe's dental office. No noise analysis was performed from the interior of

44
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner Choe's building, or to assess the noise impact on the interior of her building from noise
2 emanating through the wall of the tunnel, which is only inches away. The LSA Noise Study also
3 failed to consider the vibrations that would be generated, and how they would be felt inside her
4 building.

5 151. Petitioners are informed and believe that Respondents have never before cited to or

6 disclosed the LSA Noise Study because since its creation in July 2019, Respondents removed
7 Condition 21 to the CUP approval. The Condition of Approval for the car wash as set forth in the

8 attachments to the staff report for the September 9, 2019 Planning Commission hearing on the

9 Revised Project only require compliance with "City noise ordinance standards," and no longer
10 with the General Plan (the Noise Element) as it did when LSA prepared the Noise Study in July
11 2019:

12 "Prior to Building & Safety Division plan check submittal, the Applicant shall
13 submit a technical noise study prepared by a professional firm specializing in preparation of noise studies to the City for review by the Planning Division, Police
14 Department, and Code Enforcement Division that demonstrates that the proposed design and equipment of the car wash will conform to City noise ordinances and
15 will minimize noise impacts on adjacent properties. The Applicant shall, to the best

16 of his or her abilities and at his or her sole cost, utilize the same noise specialists employed at the Applicant's other location(s) to prepare the noise readings and
17 studies. Prior to issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy, the Applicant shall hold a "soft opening" to test all noise-generating equipment onsite and make
18 adjustments as necessary to bring the equipment into compliance with City noise ordinance standards, to the satisfaction of the Planning and Building Agency and 19 Police Department. The Applicant shall submit an updated and revised noise study based on updated field measurements within one (1) month of commencement of 20 operations, and again on the one-year anniversary of the commencement of
21 operations, to ensure compliance with the City's noise ordinances."

22 (CUP 2019-30, Condition to Approval, No. 11)

23 152. Accordingly, with respect to noise, Respondents' have conditioned approval of the
24 CUP for the car wash on compliance with nothing because, as LSA pointed out, the Noise
25 Ordinance does not have "specific requirements for commercial and medical office uses." (LSA
26 Noise Study, p. 19.)

27 "I
28 mr

45
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

153. There will be a significant impact on noise for the surrounding environment,
2 including but not limited to, business uses and pedestrian traffic, as there is no specific
3 requirement that noise remain below any certain level or comply with any specific standard.

4 154. Petitioners' expert conducted a peer review of Real Parties' traffic analysis and
5 found it deficient in that it used outdated and incomplete data that, when corrected, would show

6 the Revised Project will have a significant impact on traffic, including increasing the collision rate
7 at the intersection of N. Tustin Avenue and Fourth Street beyond what it currently is, which is
8 significantly higher than would be expected for this type of intersection. Specifically, "[t]he ten

9 year average collision rate at this intersection is 0.37 collisions per million entering vehicles . ..
10 [and] the most recent collision rate during the past three years (2016-2018) the collision rate has
11 increased to 0.43 collisions per million entering vehicles." (Id.) Significantly, RKE found that

12 "any increase in traffic generated by the proposed [Car Wash] [P]roject could potentially increase
13 the collision rate at this intersection." (RK Engineering, Peer Review of the Revised Project
14 revised Traffic Study, dated May 17, 2019, prepared by Linscott, Law & Greenspan, Appendix B,
15 SWITRS data for Intersection of N. Tustin Ave. and 4th Street.)

16 B. The Revised Project Does Not Qualify for the Infill Exemption
17 155. Respondents violated CEQA by erroneously finding the Revised Project
18 categorically exempt as an in-fill development project pursuant to Section 15332 of the CEQA
19 Guidelines.

20 156. CEQA section 15332 specifies the five requirements for a project to qualify for the
21 in-fill development exemption, which are:

22 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable General Plan designation

23 and all applicable General Plan policies as well as with applicable zoning
24 designation and regulations;

25 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of
26 no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses;
27 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or

28 threatened species;

46
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects
2 relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality; and

3 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public
services. (State CEQA Guidelines Section 15332.)"

5 157. The Revised Project does not qualify for the in-fill categorical exemption because

6 the project, within the meaning of CEQA, includes the General Plan amendment and zone change,
7 which were part of the Original Project and are necessary for the development of the Revised
8 Project. In addition, the General Plan amendment and zone change became void when the City

9 abandoned the MND and MMRP.

10 158. The Revised Project also does not qualify for a categorical exemption because
11 Respondents have already determined that the Original Project--including the portions that
12 remain in the Revised Projectrequire an MND and mitigation measures to avoid significant
13 impacts on the environment. In addition, CEQA does not permit a project to be modified
14 following the adoption of an MND and then for a categorical exemption to be approved so that the
15 MND can be disregarded.

16 159. The Revised Project also does not qualify for the categorical exemption because the
17 Revised Project would result in significant effects relating to traffic, noise, vibrations, and air
18 quality.

19 160. In addition, the Revised Project cannot be approved as categorically exempt because
20  it falls into three exceptions.

21 161. CEQA section 15300.2 contains a list of exceptions to the exemptions. Relevant
22 here:

23 a. "all exemptions... are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive
24 projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant." (subd. (a).)
25 b. "a categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a

26 reasonable possibility that the activity will a have a significant effect on the
27 environment due to unusual circumstances." (subd. (b).)

28 C. "a categorical exemption shall not be a used for a project which may cause a

47
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource."

2 162. A categorical exemption is also not available because there are unusual
3 circumstances that will have a significant effect on the environment in connection with the

4 Revised Project, including but not limited to (a) the proximity of the car wash component of the
5 |Revised Project to the building on the adjoining property and the noise and vibrations that will

6 impact the sensitive uses on that property, (b) that Respondents previously adopted an MND and
7 MMRP requiring mitigation measures to address significant environmental impacts for the project
8 and have abandoned the MND and MMRP as part of the approval of the Revised Project, (c) the
9 existence of cultural resources and tribal cultural resources on the property, and (d) the additional
10 traffic generated by the Revised Project which will increase the collision rate at the intersection of

11 4th Street and N. Tustin Avenue, which is already significantly exceeds the expected rate for this
12 type of intersection.

13 163. In the alternative, a categorical exemption is also not available because of the
14 cumulative impacts of the implemented portions of the Original Project, including the amendment
15 of the General Plan, and zone change and demolition of the restaurant building coupled with the
16 additional elements of the Revised Project will have a significant impact on the environment as
17 evidenced by the previously adopted MND and MMRP.

18 164. Respondents were required to, and failed to, evaluate the environmental impacts of
19 the unmodified portions of the Original Project, as well as the environmental impacts of the work
20 already completed such as the demolition of the restaurant at 301 North Tustin Avenue, along with
21 the environmental impacts of the changes made in the Revised Project. The existence of the MND
22 and MMRP, which required mitigation measures for demolition and during construction of the
23 entire original project, including the parts that have not been changed in the Revised Project,
24 demonstrates that Respondents failed to consider and properly address these cumulative impacts in
25 approving the Revised Project as categorically exempt.

26 C. The Revised Project Does Not Qualify for the New Construction or
27 Conversion of Small Structures Exemption

28 165. Preliminarily, it was a violation of Petitioners' and the public's right to due process

48
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 under the Constitution of the United States and the State of California as well as a violation of
2 CEQA for the City Council to adopt an additional categorical exemption for the revised project

3 when the City failed to provide notice that the City Council was contemplating taking such an

4 action and the notice provided for the hearing did not even indicate that the categorical exemption
5 finding by the Planning Commission would be reviewed by the City Council at all. "[T]he
6 required notice must be adequate in light of the purpose to be served." (Drum v. Fresno County
7 Dept. of Public Works (1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 777, 782-783.) The "notice must, at a minimum, be
8 reasonably calculated to afford affected persons the realistic opportunity to protect their interests."
9 (Id.) Further, "[w]holly inaccurate notice is no notice at all." (Id.)

10 166. In addition, the revised project does not qualify for the exemption provided by
11 ||CEQA Guidelines section 15303 because the revised project does not consist of only the
12 "construction and location of new, small facilities or structures" nor does it consist of "the
13 conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications
14 are made in the exterior of the structure." For the first group, this exemption only applies where
15 the project does not include demolition of existing structures and only includes construction of
16 new structures on vacant land. Where there are existing structures on the land, this exemption
17 only applies "where only minor modifications are made in the exterior of the structure."
18 Demolishing all existing structures is obviously not a minor modification. Interpreting
19 construction of new structures to include demolition would not be consistent with the statutory
20 language or logic. Such an interpretation would permit complete demolition and construction of a
21 new structure, or a minor modification of the exterior of an existing structure. But it would not
22 permit a project where there were even minor modifications to the interior of the structure or
23 major modifications to the exterior of the existing structure. There is no rational basis to believe
24 this was the intent of the exemption.

25 167. The exemption also does not apply because, as explained above, the project for
26 purposes of CEQA includes the requested zone change and General Plan amendment, and
27 accordingly, the Properties are not "sites zoned for such use" as required by subsection (c). In
28 addition, by abandoning the MND and MMRP, the zone change and General Plan amendment

49
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 became void.

2 168. In addition, as explained above, in light of the professional office zoning
3 surrounding the Properties, including the dentist's office immediately adjacent to the southern

4 edge of 301 North Tustin, the surrounding area is environmentally sensitive.

5 169. Finally, as explained above, this categorical exemption is not applicable because of
6  unusual circumstances and cumulative impacts.

7 D. Respondents Have Violated Applicable Law and Abused Their Discretion

8 170. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in a manner required by
9 CEQA because they:

10 a. Failed to adequately address, analyze, or otherwise consider the adverse
11 environmental impacts, necessary or foreseeable mitigation measures, or a
12 reasonable range of alternatives to the Revised Project, in an environmental
13 document as required by CEOA.

14 b. Failed to provide adequate notice to Petitioners and the public to allow them to

15 meaningfully prepare and participate in the hearing on the Revised Project as

16 required by the right to due process under the US Constitution, the California
17 Constitution and CEQA before both the Planning Commission and the City
18 Council;

19 C. Failed to provide adequate notice to Petitioners and the public to allow them to
20 meaningfully prepare and participate in the hearing on the Revised Project as
21 required by the right to due process under the US Constitution, the California

22 Constitution and CEQA for the City Council meeting that the Planning
23 Commission's categorical exemption determination was at issue and that the City
24 Council may adopt additional categorical exemptions, including pursuant to section
25 15303, which had never been previously mentioned.
26 d. Engaged in prohibited piecemeal environmental review by ignoring the Original
27 Project, carving out approval of the General Plan amendment and zoning
28 amendment from the project and then asserting the revised project is categorically

50
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

exempt in reliance thereon, and ultimately abandoning the MND and MMRP
approved for the project and upon which other necessary project approvals depend;

e. Failed to conduct subsequent environmental review after substantial changes were
made to the Original Project;

f. Found the Revised Project categorically exempt as an in-fill development without
meeting the statutory requirements, including consistency with the General Plan
and zoning, and no significant impacts relating to traffic, noise, air quality and
water quality;

9 g. Found the Revised Project categorically exempt as new construction or conversion
10 of small structures pursuant to section 15303(c) of the Guidelines without meeting
11 the statutory requirements, including consistency with the General Plan;

12 h. Found the Revised Project categorically exempt even though (a) the Revised
13 Project will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
14 circumstances, (b) the cumulative impact of successive projects over time is
15 significant, and (c) the Revised Project will cause a substantial adverse change in

16 the significance of historical resources, so that the exception provided by Guideline
17 section 15300.2 applied to the Revised Project;

18 i. Failed to provide an appeal to the City Council of the Planning Commission's

19 determination on the Revised Project as required by CEQA and the City of Santa
20 Ana's local CEQA guidelines. In addition, Respondents determinations in
21 approving the Revise Project and the categorical exemption were not supported by
22 substantial evidence.

23 j. Failed to provide fair hearing as Petitioners are informed and believe that at least
24 the majority of the Planning Commissioners and City Council members had
25 prejudged the issues before the respective hearings and that a one or more had

26 conflicts of interest that were not disclosed as well as other contacts and

27 relationships with the Applicant that were not disclosed which, at a minimum, gave
28 rise the appearance of conflict of interest.

51
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

171. Further, the lack of sufficient notice to Petitioners and the public deprived

2 Petitioners and the public of the ability to meaningfully prepare for and participate in the public
3 hearing regarding the Revised Project. Petitioners were denied sufficient time to hire experts,
4 conduct necessary tests and studies related to the Revised Project, including a traffic study, noise
5 study and vibration study, and to prepare and submit the public comments and materials submitted

6 for both the Planning Commission's hearing on September 9, 2019 and the City Council meeting

7 on October 15, 2019.

8 172. Accordingly, the Court should determine the Revised Project is not categorically

9 exempt from CEQA as an infill development project or as new construction or conversion of small
10 structures, and in turn require Respondents to reinstate the MND and MMRP, and to conduct the
11 necessary subsequent environmental review for the revisions to the project, including adopting
12 either a subsequent EIR or subsequent MND.

13

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

15 [Against All Respondents for a Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

16 Section 1094.5 To Vacate Approval of Conditional Use Permit for the Revised Project]

17 173. Petitioners reallege and incorporate each of the prior allegations as set forth in full.

18 174. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the subject matter of this amended Petition.

19 175. Respondents proceeded without and in excess of their lawful jurisdiction, failed to
20 provide fair hearings, and prejudicially abused their discretion by, among other things:

21 a. granting the CUP for the Revised Project without the requisite evidentiary support
22 and legal findings mandated by the City's Municipal Code and the law. The car

23 wash: (i) would not provide a service or facility that would contribute to the general
24 wellbeing of the neighborhood or the community, (ii) would be detrimental to the

25 health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the vicinity, (iii)
26 would adversely affect the present economic stability or future economic

27 development of property in the surrounding area; (iv) would not comply with the

28 regulations and conditions specified in the Municipal Code; and (v) would

52
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

adversely affect the City's General Plan.
b. granting of the CUP is not supported by the findings made by the City, and the City
failed to bridge the analytical gap between the raw evidence and the granting of the

CUP.

C. the City failed to evaluate the CUP application under the proper standard and acted
under the mistaken belief that, among other things, the effect of the proposed car
wash on other businesses and the oversaturation of car washes was not relevant to

the CUP determination,

16o 10 d. granting a CUP to operate a car wash on 301 N. Tustin Avenue when it is zoned

11 Professional and not General Commercial because Ordinance No. NS-2960

12 rezoning both Properties to C2 automatically was made null and void when

13 Respondents voluntarily abandoned the MND and MMRP adopted for the project,
and thus Resolution No. 2018-081;

14 e

15 granting a CUP when doing so was dependent on zoning and General Plan

16 consistency, and no such consistency exists because the General Plan amendment

17 and zone change automatically were made null and void when Respondents

18 f. intentionally abandoned the MND and MMRP approved for the project;

19 granting a CUP when it is dependent on consistency with the General Plan Goals

20 and Policies, which the car wash does not promote and actually undermines,
including but not limited to, the MEMU Zone;

21

22 g. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the Revised

23 Project on the surrounding uses, specifically the effect of vibrations and noise on

24 Petitioner Choe's property and her dental practice when the wall of the car wash

25 tunnel will be located only inches from the wall of her building;

26 h. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the Revised

27 Project on noise when the conditions to project approval do absolutely nothing to

28 mitigate noise impacts on the community and pedestrians since the City's Noise
Ordinance has absolutely no requirement with respect to noise limits on

53
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

commercial properties, which is of particular concern here since pedestrian traffic
in this MEMU adjacent location is important;
i. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the Revised
Project on traffic at this arterial location and at the particular intersection of N.
Tustin Avenue and Fourth Street, where the collision rate is significantly higher
and the traffic study for the project did not consider collision data for this
intersection or include weekend peek trip counts in its analysis;

8 j. failing to provide notice of public hearings sufficient to afford interested parties a
realistic opportunity to protect their interests when, among other things, the appeal
10 of the Planning Commission's CEQA determinations was not included in the notice

11 for the October 15, 2019 City Council hearing on the appeal, the City Council's

12 consideration of : new categorical exemption under CEQA was not identified in

13 the notice for the hearing or the agenda, and the notice for the September 9, 2019

14 Planning Commission hearing on the Revised Project only to the surrounding 500

15 feet and only 10 days prior to the hearing was inadequate time to review the

16 significant project revisions, consult experts on the impact of those revisions on the

17 environment, obtain documents from the city to understand and evaluate the

18 Revised Project, especially when the project had been pending since 2016 and fully

19 approved since late 2018.

20 k. failed to provide fair hearing as Petitioners are informed and believe that at least

21 the majority of the Planning Commissioners and City Council members had

22 prejudged the issues before the respective hearings, and that a one or more had

23 conflicts of interest that were not disclosed as well as other contacts and

24 relationships with the Applicant that were not disclosed which, at a minimum, gave

25 rise to the appearance of a conflict of interest.

26 176. Petitioners have exhausted all required remedies.

27 177. Petitioners have no administrative remedy, and have no plain, speedy or adequate
28 remedy in the ordinary course of law. The only remedy provided by law for Petitioners to obtain

54
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

relief is the Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section
2 1094.5.

3 178. Petitioners will suffer irreparable injury and damages if the decision of
4 Respondents' approval of the CUP is allowed to stand.

5 179. Because of the wrongful acts of Respondents, Petitioners have incurred and will
6 }continue to incur substantial attorney's fees and costs in bringing this action as private attorneys
7 general pursuant to CCP 1021.5 to vindicate their interests and those of the taxpayers and citizens
8 of the City of Santa Ana in the proper enforcement and implementation of the zoning, land use,

9 and environmental laws.

10

11 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
12 [Against all Respondents for a Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section

13 1094.5 To Vacate Approval of the Variance Amendment]

14 180. Petitioners reallege and incorporate each of the prior allegations as set forth in full.
15 181. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in the subject matter of this amended Petition.

16 182. Respondents proceeded without and in excess of their lawful jurisdiction, failed to
17 provide fair hearings, and prejudicially abused their discretion by, among other things:

18 a. granting the Variance Amendment for the Revised Project without the requisite

19 evidentiary support and legal findings mandated by the City's Municipal Code and
20 the law. Among other things, there were no special circumstances applicable to 301
21 North Tustin whereby the strict application of the zoning ordinance would deprive
22 the subject property of privileges enjoyed by similar or neighboring properties; the
23 granting of variance was not necessary for the preservation or enjoyment of any
24 substantial property rights, as there is no property right to develop a car wash,
25 much less in a way to maximize profit; the granting of the Variance was materially
26 detrimental to the public welfare and injurious to surrounding property, including
27 the adjacent dental office, and granting the variance to develop the proposed car
28 wash will adversely affect the General Plan;

55
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

b. granting of the Variance Amendment is not supported by the findings made by the
City, and the City failed to bridge the analytical gap between the raw evidence and
the granting of the CUP;

C. granting the Variance Amendment when it is dependent on consistency with the
General Plan Goals and Policies, which the car wash does not promote and actually

6 undermines especially in light of the project location at a gateway to the City,
including but not limited to, the MEMU Zone, the Economic Development
Element, Land Use Element, and Urban Design Element;

4 d. granting the Variance Amendment when it constitutes an unlawful special privilege
10 to enable the Applicant to develop the car wash in a manner that is designed to
11 operate at the "highest efficiency," and with the "highest possible return on the
12 [Applicant's] considerable investment," when the Applicant could have developed
13 the fully approved Original Project with retail center and restaurant without any
14 variance for 301 N. Tustin Avenue;

15 1. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the

16 Revised Project on the surrounding uses, specifically the effect of vibrations and
17 noise on Petitioner Choe's property and her dental practice when the wall of the car

18 wash tunnel will be located only inches from the wall of her building;

19 m. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the Revised

20 Project on noise when the conditions to project approval do absolutely nothing to
21 mitigate noise impacts on the community and pedestrians since the City's Noise
22 Ordinance has absolutely no requirement with respect to noise limits on

23 commercial properties, which is of particular concern here since pedestrian traffic
24 in this MEMU adjacent location is important;

25 n. failing to adequately consider the impact of the car wash component of the Revised

26 Project on traffic at this arterial location and at the particular intersection of N.

O. intersection or include weekend peek trip counts in its analysis;
failing to provide notice of public hearings sufficient to afford interested parties a
realistic opportunity to protect their interests when, among other things, the appeal
of the Planning Commission's CEQA determinations was not included in the notice
for the October 15, 2019 City Council hearing on the appeal, the City Council's
consideration of a new categorical exemption under CEQA was not identified in
the notice for the hearing or the agenda, and the notice for the September 9, 2019

7o Planning Commission hearing on the Revised Project only to the surrounding 500
feet and only 10 days prior to the hearing was inadequate time to review the
significant project revisions, consult experts on the impact of those revisions on the

12 environment, obtain documents from the city to understand and evaluate the

13 Revised Project, especially when the project had been pending since 2016 and fully

19 relationships with the Applicant that were not disclosed which, at a minimum, gave

20 rise the appearance of a conflict of interest.

21 183. Petitioners have exhausted all required remedies.

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 [Against all Respondents for Violation of the California Public Records Actl

7 187. Petitioners reallege and incorporate each of the prior allegations as set forth in full.

8 188. On or about September 11, 2019, Petitioner Conklins' attorney made a request on
9 their behalf to the City of Santa Ana pursuant to the California Public Records Act for various
10 documents, including but not limited to the following:

11 a "AIl DOCUMENTS related to the PROPERTIES, including but not limited to

12 application(s) for entitlements for any project to be developed on one or both

13 PROPERTIES, from January 1, 2015 to the present."
14 b. "AIl DOCUMENTS related to application(s) for entitlements for the Russell
15 Fischer Commercial Center as submitted in or about 2016."

16 C "A11 DOCUMENTS related to application(s) for entitlements for the Russell
17 Fischer Commercial Center as submitted in or about 2018 and/or as revised in or

18 about 2019."

19 d. "All communications, correspondence, and emails sent to RUSSELL FISCHER by
20 the CITY."

21 e All communications, correspondence, and emails sent to RUSSELL FISCHER by
22 the CITY."

23 f. "AII DOCUMENTS submitted to the CITY by RUSSELL FISCHER."

24 g. "AIl DOCUMENTS sent from the CITY to RUSSELL FISCHER."

25 h. "AIl DOCUMENTS that evidence or relate to any meetings, whether in person or

26 by telephone, between the CITY and RUSSELL FISCHER."

27 A true and correct copy of the Request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

28 189. The California Constitution, Art. I, § 3(b)(1), declares that "[t]he people have the

58
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 right of 1 access to information concerning the conduct of the people's business, and, therefore,
2 the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to
3 public scrutiny."

4 190. The CPRA, declares that "access to information concerning the conduct of the
5 a |people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state." (Cal. Gov't

6 Code, § 6250.)

7 191. The CPRA provides, in relevant part, that "[p]ublic records are open to inspection at

8 all times during the office hours of the state or local agency and every person has a right to inspect
9 any public record, except as hereafter provided." (Cal. Gov't Code, § 6253(a).)

10 192. The CPRA further provides that each agency must respond "within 10 days." (Id. §
11 6253(c).) The CPRA further requires that public entities may take extensions "in unusual
12 circumstances," but only by written notice to the person making the request, "setting forth the
13 reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched."
14 (Id.) The CPRA also limits extensions: "[n]o notice shall specify a date that would result in an
15 extension for more than 14 days." (Id.)

16 193. The City of Santa Ana failed to produce all of the responsive public records within
17 the time required by the PRA. Preliminarily, the City purported to grant itself multiple extensions
18 in excess of the 14 days permitted by the CPRA.

19 194. In addition, despite granting itself these extensions, and despite not claiming any
20 exemptions for any of the requested records, the City failed to produce various records requested
21 including but not limited to the following:

22 a. The project application submitted in 2016 for development of 301 and 325 N.

23 Tustin Avenue as then proposed;

24 b. The project application for the revised project with the car wash, submitted by the
25 applicant in or around April 2019;

26 C. Amendment Application No. 2018-08 (rezoning);
27 d. Zoning Amendment No. 2018-08;

28 e. Application for General Plan Amendment No. 2018-05;

59
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

f. General Plan Amendment No. 2018-05;

2 g. Application for Variance for 325 N. Tustin Avenue;
h. Application for CUP for Drive-Through Restaurant on 301 N. Tustin Avenue;
i. Application for Amendment to Variance 2018-10 (the complete application so all
spaces on the form are included);
j. Application for CUP 2019-030 (the complete application so all spaces on the form
are included);
k. Application for CUP 2019-31 (the complete application so all spaces on the form

9 are included);
10 1. Notice of Intent to adopt the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration,
11 Environmental Review No. 2016-156, dated August 13, 2018,
12 m. The "Preliminary Exemption Assessment" (Form "A") completed for the project;
13 n. Comments received by the City re Mitigated Negative Declaration, Environmental
14 Review No. 2016-156, and the "Response to Comments" document prepared by Or
15 on behalf of the City in response to the comments the City received.
16 0. The documents related to the MND that were made available for a 30-day public
17 review and comment period, and on the project page on the City's website (these
18 documents were removed from the project page and cannot otherwise be obtained);
19 p. Mitigated Negative Declaration, Environmental Review No. 2016-156;
20 q. Demolition Permit No. 101100163 and related documents;

21 r. Property line survey, boundary surveys and related documents for the Properties;
22 s. The documents containing "economic information for the proposed use," including
23 "expected employment and sales/tax revenue from the gas station and car wash"

24 that the City required the Real Parties to provide for the project;
25 t. The operations and management plan required by the City from Real Parties;
26 u. Documents containing information regarding other car wash facilities owned or
27 operated by the owner (Applicant), as required by the City;
28 ///

60
FIRST AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PETITION AND COMPLAINT

V. Emails and other communications between Real Parties (and people acting on their
behalf) and Respondents, including but not limited to Planning Commission
members and City Council members, related to the Properties or any aspect of the
project or Revised Project.
5 195. Petitioner Conklins are informed and believe that there are additional responsive
6 documents that they have not yet identified that are in the City's possession and have not been
7 produced.

8 196. Pursuant to Government Code section 6258, Petitioners seek a judicial declaration
9 that Respondents have violated the CPRA and are required to produce the requested records
10 forthwith. Plaintiffs also seek a judicial declaration that Respondents violation of the CPRA were
11 intended to and did frustrated Petitioners efforts to challenge Respondents approvals and
12 determinations in connection with the revised project. In addition, Petitioners seek a writ of
13 mandate and injunctive relief requiring Respondents to produce the requested records forthwith.
14 Petitioners have no adequate legal remedies to secure Respondents compliance with their
15 obligations under the CPRA.

16 197. Pursuant to Government Code section 6259(d), Petitioners Conklins are entitled to
