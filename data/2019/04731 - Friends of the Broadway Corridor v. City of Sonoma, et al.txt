Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 Introduction

3
1.
4 Friends of the Broadway Corridor, an unincorporated association, brings

5 this mandamus action in the public interest to enforce the California Environmental

6 Quality Act (CEQA). Friends challenge Sonoma's failure to prepare an environmental
impact report (EIR) for the mixed-use Sonoma Gateway project. The project proposes

9 oversized luxury townhouses and grossly-undersized affordable units and is

10 inconsistent with the Historic Overlay Zone of the city's Broadway Historic District.

23 The project site lies in Sonoma's Broadway Corridor Planning Area just south of

24 the Plaza a National Historic Landmark. Members of Friends are not only not against a

25 housing project at the Broadway site but actively support high-density housing,

26 including more-affordable units at greater density than proposed.
27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 CEQA's mandates include conducting an EIR process when fact-based opinions

2 of citizens or experts present a 'fair argument' that a proposed discretionary project

3 may have a significant environmental impact, regardless of contrary evidence. That
4

5 process informs the public as well as the land use discretion of elected decisionmakers.

6 Here, because there is credible evidence -including expert opinions of appointed and

7 elected city officials - that the Gateway project may have significant impacts and may

8 be inconsistent with Sonoma's adopted plans and policies, Friends seek an EIR to
9

10 analyze environmental impacts and identify feasible mitigations and alternatives.

11 Among other substantial evidence, local architects Bill Willers and Victor

12 Conforti provided expert opinion that the Gateway project is inconsistent with the

13 city's adopted plans and policies, concluding in relevant part that
14

15 [t]he Sonoma Gateway project design is an automobile-centric, standard- commodity housing project. Its scale and development pattern are out of
16 character with the Historic District with which it is required to be compatible.

17 Changing the building style and adding porches here and there do not overcome|
the overall incompatibility of mass and scale of this project.
18

19 The California Supreme Court recently confirmed CEQA's low-threshold 'fair

20 argument' standard that triggers preparation of an EIR for projects that may have
21 significant impacts. As to aesthetics, lay opinion referencing the environmental setting

22 suffices. (Friends of the San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College District
23

24 (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 957, 959 (Gardens I); Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San

25 Mateo County Community College District (2017) 11 Cal.App. 5th 596, 609 (Gardens II).)

26 Addressing a housing project comparable to the Sonoma Gateway project, Protect

27 Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1129 (Niles) recently affirmed that an EIR
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 process was required before city could consider approval of a mixed-use/ housing

2 project. The Niles opinion relied in significant part on fact-based opinions of residents
3

4 as to aesthetic and traffic impacts in an historic overlay district. Consistently,

5 Georgetown Preservation Society v. County of El Dorado (2018) __Cal.App._ confirmed the

6 requirement of an EIR for a design-review process in light of a fair argument of

7 significant aesthetic impacts and inconsistency with adopted city plans and policies.

8 So it is here. Friends respectfully ask for this Court's peremptory writ to order
9

10 the city to conduct an EIR process to inform its review of the Gateway project.

11 Jurisdiction

12 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and
13

14 CCP section 1094.5. The parties and site are in the County of Sonoma.

15 Parties

16 3. Petitioner Friends of the Broadway Corridor is an unincorporated
17

18 l association formed in the public interest in December 2018 after approval of the

19 Gateway project. Friends' purpose is to protect the historic nature and character of

20 Sonoma's Broadway Corridor as the gateway to the city, and to ensure that new
21 development is compliant with the city's code requirements drafted specifically to
22 protect the Broadway Corridor. Members of Friends include community residents and
23

24 concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the environmental and historical

25 resources in Sonoma. Friends brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly

26 situated that are too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as

16 Il proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

17 General Allegations

18 8.
19 The Sonoma Gateway project is proposed at 870 Broadway on the

20 northeast corner of Broadway and East MacArthur Street in Sonoma. The project seeks

21 a use permit, tentative map, and related approvals to redevelop a 2-acre site with 3,500

22 square-feet of commercial space and 33 residences, including 8 moderate-income rental
23 units, for a total of approximately 57,000 square feet of new development.
24

25 9. A 30-foot tall mixed-use building is proposed at the southwest corner of

26 the site, aligned with Broadway. Commercial space is proposed on the lower floor,

27 with four two-bedroom residences to be located on the second floor. Eight one-

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 bedroom unit apartments of 486 square feet are proposed for the north side of the

2 mixed-use building, fronting Broadway, while three detached residential units are

3 proposed along West MacArthur Street. Eighteen luxury townhouses are proposed at
4

5 three stories with two-car garages and 10 additional covered spaces.

6 10. The project lies within the city's Broadway Corridor Planning Area and

7 Historic Overlay Zone. The Broadway Historic District from the Plaza to MacArthur

8 Street at the project site is one of few remaining intact grand boulevards, with many

10 contributing historic buildings. It provides a grand entrance to the Plaza Historic

11 District that has the rare honor of listing as a National Historic Landmark on the
12 National Register of Historic Places. The designation sets a high standard for new

13 developments, including use of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for siting,
14

15 massing, scale, height, and building details to ensure compatibility with the district.

16 11. The Sonoma Municipal Code describes the Broadway corridor:

17 Connecting the southern gateway to the downtown, the Broadway

18 corridor possesses considerable historic, visual, and functional
significance. Historically, Broadway completes the Camino Real or "Royal
19 Road" of Spanish/Mexican mission settlements. Visually, Broadway

20 provides a grand entrance to downtown Sonoma with its axial view of the

21 Plaza, City Hall, and the northern hills, its 110- foot right-of-way, and its procession of street trees.. North of MacArthur Street, Broadway
22 possesses a clear visual organization defined by historic structures with

23 landscaped front yards and generally regular setbacks, street trees, and a
consistent street width.
24

25 12. A 2002 Historic Resources Evaluation Report prepared for a street lighting

26 project along Broadway confirmed the Sonoma Plaza's rich historic significance:

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

N The [street lighting]l project is located in a richly historic area of Sonoma,

C near the town Plaza. There are numerous historically significant resources
directly within or adjacent to the project's APE [Area of Potential Effects]. There are fifteen properties located within the APE, including one

5 potentially eligible historic district, a portion of a National Historic

6 Landmark District & National Register Historic District (co-terminous),

7 and thirteen individual properties. The Broadway Street Historic District appears eligible for the National Register of Historic Places at the local

8 level of significance under Criteria A and C, for its association with the

9 development of the town during its tourism and post gold-rush period and for its design and concentration of architectural styles. The

10 concentration of buildings and period of significance date between 1880

11 and 1930. The potentially eligible Broadway Street Historic District

12 includes a total of forty-one buildings with twenty-eight contributing
buildings, five historically compatible noncontributing buildings, and

13 seven non-contributing buildings. A portion of the Sonoma Plaza National

14 Historic Landmark District (NHL) and National Register Historic District is located within the northern segment of the APE. Although the NHL is

15 very large and includes the Plaza and numerous buildings outside the

16 APE, there are thirteen buildings of this listed property inside the APE,

17 which include six contributing buildings and seven non-contributing.

13.

18 In February 2018, the city issued an Initial Study / Mitigated Negative

19

20 Declaration (MND) for the proposed Sonoma Gateway project, and updated it the next

21 month. The MND listed potentially significant project impacts relative to biology,

22 transportation and traffic, cultural and tribal resources, air quality, hydrology and

23 water quality, noise, land use, and utilities and service systems, but concluded that all

24 impacts would be mitigated to insignificance.

25 14.

26 The Sonoma Planning Commission considered the MND and required

27 project approvals at public hearings on March 29 and May 10, 2018. Public speakers

28 expressed concerns regarding the project's inconsistencies with area plans and related
impacts to aesthetics, historic resources, and parking.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 15. Voting against the project, Planning Commissioner James Bohar stated that

2 the project did not meet the definition of a mixed-use project because the designation

3 was not intended to be applied to two- and three-bedroom townhouse projects like this
4

5 one, and so the project should not have qualified for a height extension. Commissioner

6 Bohar also stated that the project was proposed in the wrong location and was not the

7 type of project that should be approved as the 'gateway' to Sonoma.

8 16. Also voting against the project, Planning Commission Chair Bob Felder
9

10 concurred with an objection expressed at the May public hearing by architect and

11 former Planning Commissioner Bill Willers that the Commission failed to consider the

12 adequacy of the MND separately from the adoption of the project. Chair Felder

13 concurred with Willers that the project's impacts were not sufficiently analyzed,
14

15 especially as to aesthetics.

16 17. The Commission adopted the MND and approved the Gateway project on

17 May 10 a on a split 5-2 vote.

18 18. Bill Willers and another local architect, Victor Conforti, appealed the
19 approvals to the City Council. With a combined experience of over 75 years as
20

21 practicing architects, their backgrounds include serving on planning task force

22 committees, the Sonoma Citizens Advisory Commission, and the Sonoma Planning

23 Commission. They participated in community discussions related to the planning of
24

25 the Sonoma community for over 30 years. Their appeal letter stated in relevant part:

26 We were participants in the formation of the City of Sonoma's General Plan, members of the task force that ultimately formed the City of
27 Sonoma's current Development Code and have participated in every

28 update of the housing element.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

We have also always advocated for higher densities as a solution to our housing needs. We worked to include the, then, new zoning designation of "Mixed Use" in our Development Code, argued for increasing the density in this zoning designation so as to provide affordable forms of housing and have supported many higher density, and affordable housing projects

5 that met the goals and aspirations of our community as expressed in the
General Plan and Development Code.

6
19. Willers and Conforti offered expert opinions that the Sonoma Gateway

8 project's scale, massing, and development pattern would be inconsistent with the
9 General Plan, the Development Code that includes the Broadway Corridor Planning

10 Area and the Historic Overlay Zone, and the Broadway Street Historic District, and
11 that the project would have significant impacts to aesthetics and cultural resources.
12

13 20. Regarding lack of conformity with the Broadway Corridor Planning Area,

14 Willers and Conforti stated that the three proposed buildings would be clearly visible

15 along Broadway and MacArthur and would be out of scale with the historic buildings
16 in the Planning Area and the Broadway Street Historic District. As to the Historic
17

18 Overlay Zone, they provided expert opinion that the project "bulk and height may

19 have a negative impact on the adjoining small-scale structures," disallowed by the

20 Code, and had inadequate proposed setbacks. They emphasized the significance of the

21 I project site at Broadway and MacArthur:
22

23 This is such an important gateway site at the entrance to this 110-foot wide historic tree-lined avenue leading directly to the Historic Plaza.
24 This project does not fit into the fabric or context of this critically

25 important site at the entrance to our historic town.

26 21. Willers' and Conforti's attorney, Kristina D. Lawson, confirmed that the
27 city's designation of the Broadway Corridor as historically significant meant that the
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 MND should have analyzed the project's impacts on the Corridor's historic status.

2 Even though its existing structures are not historically significant, the site's location in
3 the Broadway Corridor area, a historical resource for purposes of CEQA, requires
4

5 analysis of potentially significant impacts on the Broadway Corridor.

6 22. The Willers and Conforti appeal also contended, inter alia, that the

7 project's inclusion of detached single-family housing types and larger luxury

8 townhouses is incompatible with the mixed-use zoning district that encourages higher
9

10 density housing types such as apartments and condominiums.

11 23. Regarding aesthetic impacts, attorney. Lawson stated:

12 The IS/ MND appears to rely on the fact that the General Plan anticipates high density mixed-use development on the site to conclude that the
13 Project will not substantially degrade the existing visual character or
14 quality of the site and its surroundings. Contrary to this bare conclusion,

15 the Project's proposed construction of eleven buildings, its removal of 36 trees, including five oak trees of significant stature, will potentially impact
16 scenic vistas, scenic resources, the visual character and quality of the site

17 and its surroundings, and create new sources of substantial light. These
potentially significant impacts must be further analyzed in an EIR. The
18 Municipal Code describes the Broadway Corridor as possessing
19 "considerable historic, visual, and functional significance." (SMC

20 19.32.010.) Impacts to scenic resources and the Project's consistency with the General Plan policies and Code provisions aimed to preserve them
21 would be potentially significant and must be further analyzed in an EIR.

22 The proposed development would alter the visual character of the Broadway Corridor and its surroundings. While an analysis of aesthetic
23 impacts is somewhat subjective, the City is not excused from evaluating

24 potential impacts altogether.

25 24. The appeal by Willers and Conforti also addressed project impacts to land
26

27 use, parking, traffic, and cumulatively significant impacts. The Traffic Impact Study

28 prepared for the project by W-Trans did not consider an adequate number of study

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 intersections as it only studied the Broadway and MacArthur intersection and not those

2 at Second Street East and MacArthur and First Street West and MacArthur.

3 25. In August 2018, the City Council held a public hearing to consider the
4

5 appeal. Community members, including Friends' member Lou Braun, objected to the

6 project approval and agreed, inter alia, with the appeal's criticisms of inconsistencies
with the General Plan and the Historic Overlay Zone. Following testimony, the City

8 Council asked staff for additional information, including the installation of story poles

10 on the site, and continued the hearing to September 17 and then to October 1, 2018.

11 26. The real party /developer made minor revisions to the project in
12 September 2018, increasing building setbacks by 3-5 feet; setting the buildings' heights

13 at 30 feet or less; designating floor area ratio at 70.4% and site coverage at 56.7%;
14

15 adding three parking spaces for a total of 79 spaces; adding some trees; and increasing

16 common space to about 12,000 square feet.

17 27. On October 1, 2018, the Council considered approvals of the MND and the

18 project. Councilmember Rachel Hundley, a municipal law attorney, noted the unstable
19 project description and that a fair argument of significant environmental effects had
20

21 been raised as to aesthetics and historic resources, triggering the requirement to

22 prepare an EIR. Vice-Mayor Amy Harrington concurred, explaining that when there

23 are differing expert opinions as to significant environmental impacts, a city must

24 prepare an EIR. She explained that an EIR for the Gateway project should also review
25

26 impacts to land use/planning and traffic. Other Sonoma residents reiterated their

27 previously-expressed concerns, including that the project revisions did not cure defects.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

1 28. The City Council took a straw vote to deny the appeal and to approve the
2 MND, use permit, and tentative map, and to continue the meeting. Following a
3

4 subsequent public hearing on December 3, the Council adopted findings, denied the

5 appeal, adopted the MND, and approved the use permit, tentative map, and related

6 entitlements on a 3-1-1 vote. In voting no on the project, Councilmember Hundley

7 confirmed that the project was not CEQA compliant and that approved mitigations did
8 not reduce the project's impacts to a level of insignificance.
9
29.
10 Lou Braun testified at the December public hearing in opposition to

11 approval of the project without an EIR. He also objected to the city's characterization of

12 the City of Sonoma as an urban area, because CEQA's definition requires populations
13 of over 100,000 people.
14
30.
15 a The city filed a Notice of Determination on December 4, 2018. This action is

16 timely filed within 30 days.

17 31. Friends have served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General.
18 32. Friends have no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief prayed for in
19

20 this petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and irreversible

21 environmental impacts to the Sonoma environment and residents. The city has the

22 ability to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

23

24

26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

2 33. Friends incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

3 34. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by
4

5 law in approving the Sonoma Gateway Project based on a mitigated negative

6 declaration. According to proof following certification of the record of proceedings:

7 a. The city unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant

8 environmental impacts without preparing an EIR to inform its discretion.
9

10 The record contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of

11 potentially significant environmental impacts, including, site-specific and

12 cumulative impacts relating to traffic, parking, aesthetics, cultural and

13 historic resources, and inconsistencies with the city's adopted land use
14

15 plans and policies, among other impacts supported by evidence in the

16 administrative record.

17 b. The mitigated negative declaration is not based on a finite, stable project

18 description.
19
C. The city failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence.
20

21 WHEREFORE, Friends pray:

22 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the city to set

23 aside and void all approvals relating to the Sonoma Gateway project and to refrain

24 from further consideration of the project until it fully complies with CEQA by
25

26 preparing an adequate EIR and adopting feasible alternatives and mitigation measures;

27 2. That the Court enjoin the city and real parties in interest and their

28 employees and agents from all construction and pre-construction activities, such as

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 13

1 grading and tree removal, in furtherance of the Sonoma Gateway project while this

2 petition is pending;

3 3. For Friends' costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

5 section 1021.5; and

6 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
