Plaintiff Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods alleges:

2 On or about May 16, 2019, Respondent Regents of the University of California approved the Upper
3 Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020
4 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) (Project) and certified a Final Supplemental Environmental
5 Impact Report (FSEIR) for the Project.

6 2. This action challenges Respondents' approval of the Project on grounds the approval violates the

7 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
3.
8 Education Code section 67504 provides that "The Legislature further finds and declares that the

9 expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment.

10 Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of

11 the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant off-campus impacts related
to campus growth and development."
12 4. Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (b) requires that "Environmental effects
13 relating to changes in enrollment levels shall be considered for each campus or medical center of public
14 higher education in the environmental impact report prepared for the long range development plan for the
15 campus or medical center." Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (d) requires that
16 Respondents and the University of California, Berkeley "consider the environmental impact of academic
17 and enrollment plans" pursuant to CEQA and "that any such plans shall become effective for a campus
18 only after the environmental effects of those plans have been analyzed" as required by CEQA.

19 Parties

20 5. Plaintiff SAVE BERKELEY'S NEIGHBORHOODS (Plaintiff) is a California nonprofit public

21 benefit corporation formed to provide education and advocacy to improve quality of life, protect the

22 environment and implement best planning practices. Plaintiff's founders, members, and directors live in

23 the area affected by the Project's environmental effects, and will suffer injury from adverse environmental

24 impacts caused by this Project if the legal violations alleged herein are not remedied. Plaintiff was formed

25 and brings this action to represent and advocate the beneficial interests of its founders, members, and
directors in obtaining relief from these legal violations and to improve quality of life, protect the 26 environment and implement best planning practices in connection with UC Berkeley's increases in student 27 enrollment and expansion of infrastructure.

4 disclosing, and mitigating the environmental impacts of the 2020 LRDP and the excess increase in student

5 enrollment.

6 7. Respondent JANET NAPOLITANO is the President of the University of California and is named

7 herein solely in this capacity. Regents' Policy 8103 delegates to the President of the University the Regents'

8 authority for budget or design for capital projects consistent with approved Long Range Development Plans

14 DOES through 20, inclusive. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that such fictitiously
15 named Respondents are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissions complained of or pending
16 herein. Plaintiff will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Respondents' true names and
17 capacities when ascertained.

18 Statute of Limitations

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

Jurisdiction and Venue
2 14. Plaintiff brings this action in mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5,
3 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5; and as a complaint for declaratory
4 relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060. The Court has jurisdiction over these claims.

5 15. Venue is proper in Alameda County under Code of Civil Procedure section 394, subdivision (a),

6 because UC and Respondents are situated therein.

7 Standing

8 16. Plaintiff and, to the extent applicable, its members are beneficially interested in Respondents' full

9 compliance with CEQA. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA with respect to the

10 2020 LRDP and the excess increase in student enrollment. Plaintiff has the right to enforce the mandatory
duties that CEQA imposes on Respondents.
11 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
12 17. Respondents' approval of the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal
13 procedures.
14 18. In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Plaintiff objected to
15 Respondents' approval of the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to the
16 close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of any Project related Notice of Determination.
17 19. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (a), all alleged grounds for
18 non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to Respondents during the public
19 comment period for, or prior to the close of the public hearing on, the Project.

20 20. In the alternative, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (e), there was no

21 opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition prior

22 to Respondents' approval of the Project.

23 Private Attorney General Doctrine
21.
24 Plaintiff brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

25 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.
22.
26 Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons by
ensuring that Respondents complete adequate environmental review of the Project's environmental effects.
27 23. Issuance of the relief requested herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the
28 public interest. By compelling Respondents to complete adequate environmental review of the Project's

1 environmental effects, Plaintiff will vindicate the public's important CEQA rights to public disclosure
2 regarding and public participation in government decisions that affect the environment.
3 24. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's fees
4 appropriate in this proceeding because the transgressor is the agency whose duty it is to enforce the laws at

5 issue in this proceeding.

6 First Cause of Action
(Violation of CEQA: Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
7 25. Plaintiff hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs this First Amended Petition and
8 Complaint as though set forth herein in full.
9 26. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents relating to this action, all of
10 which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of proceedings and which are incorporated by
11 reference.
12 27. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources

13 Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

14 28. Respondents violated CEQA because, without limitation, Respondents:

15 a. Certified a FSEIR that,

16 (1) Fails to present stable, accurate, and certain project description;

17 (2) Fails to accurately and sufficiently describe the affected environmental setting of the

18 project;

19 (3) Fails to include information necessary for informed decision making and informed

20 public participation, including information necessary to reach informed conclusions
regarding the significance of the Project's environmental impacts, the effectiveness of 21 mitigation measures to avoid the Project's significant environmental impacts, or the
22 feasibility of mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant environmental impacts;
23 (4) Fails to analyze a range of reasonable alternatives;
24 (5) Fails to lawfully assess the Project's cumulative effects;
25 (6) Fails to present the best available information;
26 (7) Fails to provide good faith responses to comments on the DSEIR;
27 b. Failed and refused to recirculate a revised draft supplemental EIR including said necessary
28 information;

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

C. Failed and refused to prepare, circulate for public comment, and certify a subsequent, rather
2 than supplemental EIR;

3 d. With respect to the findings required by CEQA at Public Resource Code section 21081,
4 Respondents failed to make required findings, failed to make required findings in accordance with law,

5 failed to support the findings made with substantial evidence, and failed to disclose the analytic route

6 showing how the evidence supports said findings.

7 29. These violations of CEQA include, without limitation, the legal errors described in comment letters

8 submitted during the administrative process which are incorporated herein by reference, including, without

9 limitation, the following:

a.
10 March 7, 2019, comment letter on the DSEIR from the City of Berkeley Landmarks
Preservation Commission (Steve Finacom) to Respondents;
11 b. March 11, 2019, comment letter on the DSEIR from the Berkeley Architectural Heritage
12 Association to Respondents;
13 C. April 12, 2019, comment letter on the DSEIR from the Southside Neighborhood Consortium
14 to Respondents;
15 d. April 11, 2019, comment letter on the DSEIR from Daniella Thompson;
16 e. April 12, 2019, comment letter on the DSEIR from the City of Berkeley (Timothy Burroughs)
17 to Respondents;

18 f. May 13,2019, comment letter on the FSEIR from the City of Berkeley (Timothy Burroughs)
19 to Respondents.

20 30. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's environmental effects caused by increases in student

21 enrollment at the UC Berkeley campus since 2005.

22 a. As explained in the Southside Neighborhood Consortium's April 12, 2019, comment letter,

23 1:

24 "The Project description is uncertain because while the NOP [Notice of Preparation] directly asserts the increase in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected in 2005 is part
25 of the "project, the Draft SEIR equivocates on this commitment. Instead, the Draft SEIR has

26 artfully included the increase in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected in 2005 in the "baseline" or "environmental setting" rather than in the "project description.' As
27 a result, the reader is left guessing as to whether the Draft SEIR actually evaluates the
28 environmental impacts of increases in student enrollment above the 1,650 increase projected
in 2005."

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

1 b. As explained in the City of Berkeley's May 13, 2019, comment letter, p. 1:
2 "one of the 'thematic responses' provided in the FSEIR asserts that the document's analysis
3 of increased enrollment is not part of the *project' being analyzed, but rather just an 'updated baseline.' As discussed below, this discussion is not responsive to the concerns raised in the
4 City's comments on the draft SEIR, as it fails to point to any specific instance in which the
5 SEIR uses this 'updated baseline' in analyzing the impacts of the GSPP Project, and it
continues to refer to the SEIR's analysis of impacts caused by this increased enrollment. 6 Under CEQA, a lead agency only analyzes project impacts. A baseline by definition has no

7 impacts."

8 C. The SEIR fails to acknowledge that the Project would substantially increase the local

9 population and exacerbate inadequate housing conditions for university students and for City of Berkeley

10 residents or to lawfully assess the environmental effects of these changes. (See e.g., April 12, 2019,

11 Southside Neighborhood Consortium comment letter pp. 9-10; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment
letter, p. 9; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 6-10.) 12 d. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the effects of Project's increases in student enrollment on
13 community aesthetics, including increases in street trash and littering. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, Southside
14 Neighborhood Consortium comment letter, pp. 7-8; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p. 9;
15 May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 6-10.)
16 e. The SEIR fails to acknowledge that the Project's increased enrollment will result in a
17 substantial increase in service population that will significantly impact public services and infrastructure or
18 to lawfully assess the environmental effects of these changes. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley
19 comment letter, p. 11; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 10-15.)
20 31. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on historic and cultural resources. The SEIR
21 fails to adequately describe existing conditions at the project site, including the historically significant

22 character of the area surrounding the Project site; the SEIR provides an incomplete analysis of impacts to

23 identified historic resources; the SEIR defers mitigation of significant impacts to identified historicl

24 resources; the SEIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate impacts relating to archaeological resources; and

25 the SEIR fails to analyze alternative building designs that avoid significant impacts on historic and cultural

26 resources. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter pp. 30-34; May 13, 2019, comment

27 letter from the City of Berkeley, pp. 21-25; March 7, 2019, City of Berkeley Landmarks Preservation
Commission (Steve Finacom) comment letter; March 11, 2019, Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association 28 comment letter; April 11. 2019 Daniella Thompson comment letter.)

5 34. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on traffic and transportation. (See e.g., April

9 of Berkeley comment letter, p. 19-23; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 18-19.)
36.
10 The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions and

11 climate change. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 23-26; May 13, 2019, City
of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 18-19.)
12 37. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on noise pollution. (See e.g., April
13 12, 2019, Southside Neighborhood Consortium comment letter, pp. 8-9; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley
14 comment letter, p. 26; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 19-20.)
15 38. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's land use effects and inconsistencies with
16 the City's General Plan and zoning laws. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 27-
17 29; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 26-27).
18 39. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on water quality and hydrology.
19 (See e.g., April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p. 34.)

20 40. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's growth inducing effects. (See e.g., April

21 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 37-38; May 13, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, p.

22 27.)

23 41. The SEIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's cumulative effects. (See e.g., April 12,

24 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 38-39.)
42.
25 The SEIR's analysis of Project alternatives omits essential information, including an analysis of a

26 range of reasonable alternatives. (See e.g., April 12, 2019, Southside Neighborhood Consortium commentl

27 letter, pp. 10-11; April 12, 2019, City of Berkeley comment letter, pp. 30-34, 39-41; May 13, 2019, City of

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Upper Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020
Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report.
Dear Chancellor Christ and Regents of the University of California:

This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that on or
before June 13, 2019, Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods (Petitioner) intends to file a lawsuit challenging the University's adoption of the Upper Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) (Project) and certification of a Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (FSEIR) for the Project. The action will challenge The Regents' approval of the Project on grounds the approval violates the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
Petitioner is interested in discussing settlement of this dispute without the need for litigation. Toward that end, Petitioner proposes that the University meet with Petitioner as soon as possible to discuss their concerns regarding the Upper Hearst project and to explore possible resolutions that might obviate the need for Petitioner to proceed with filing the above-described action. Petitioner also proposes that the University agree to toll CEQA's limitations period to provide an opportunity for pre-litigation settlement discussions.
I have calendared June 17, 2019, as the last day to file the action consistent with CEQA's

Chancellor Carol T. Christ, University of California, Berkeley
Regents of the University of California
Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Upper Hearst Development Plan for Goldman School of Public Policy (GSPP) and Minor Amendment to the 2020 Long Range Development Plan (2020 LRDP) and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report. June 10, 2019

statute of limitations. However, I will be unavailable June 14 through 18. Therefore, unless the
Regents agree to toll the limitations period to discuss settlement, Petitioner intends to file the
action on June 13, 2019.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours,
