RELIEF

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs, AJK FARMS, LLC, DALHAR FARMS, LLC, and

3 LANCE JEFFREY STANLEY and SARAH HILEA STANLEY, individually and as trustees of

4 the Stanley Revocable Living Trust (collectively "Petitioners"), petition this Court for a Writ of
Mandate, under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5 and Public Resources

6 Code sections 21167, 21168, and 21168.5, directed to Respondent and Defendant,
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("Respondent"). Petitioners request to set aside

8 Respondent's: (1) certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")/Environmental

9 Impact Statement ("EIS") ("Final EIR/EIS") for the Yolo Bypass Salmonid Habitat Restoration

10 and Fish Passage Project ("Project"); and, (2) approval of the Project.

11 2. Respondent, acting as the lead State of California public agency, was required to

12 prepare an EIR which evaluated potential impacts on the physical environment associated with

13 the proposed Project. However, Respondent's certification of the Final EIR/EIS violated the

14 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.,

15 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, Division 6, Chapter 3 section 15000 et seq.

16 3. The proposed Project purports to enhance flood plain habitat for fish while

17 protecting current agricultural and flood management uses of the Yolo Bypass and lower

18 Sacramento River Basin. The overarching goal of the Project is to construct facilities to improve

19 fish passage and increase floodplain fisheries rearing habitat in the Yolo Bypass and Sacramento

20 River basin. The proposed Project is intended to fulfill Respondent's legal obligations regarding

21 fish passage and habitat restoration pursuant to the Reasonable and Prudent Alternative ("RPA")

22 action I.6.1 and, in part, I.7 of the 2009 Biological and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term

23 Operations of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project on the long-term operations of

24 the State Water Project and the federally managed Central Valley Project. Respondent is

25 responsible for operating and maintaining the State Water Project while Real Party In Interest,

26 United State Bureau of Reclamation ("USBR"), is the federal agency responsible for managing

27 the Central Valley Project.

28 1//

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 4. By certifying the Final EIR/EIS and approving the proposed Project, Respondent

2 failed to comply with CEQA in that it failed to identify, evaluate, and mitigate for all potential

3 environmental impacts related to the Project including, but not limited to, the impacts to

4 groundwater and seepage and impacts to agricultural resources on real property next to the

5 proposed Project, including property immediately adjacent to the Tule Canal.

O 5. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

7 required by law by certifying a Final EIR/EIS which did not provide adequate identification,

8 analysis, or mitigation measures for individual impacts, including but not limited to impacts on

9 groundwater and water seepage and impacts to agricultural resources as a result of increased

10 inundation in the Tule Canal.

11 6. Respondent failed to provide an adequate response to comments related to these

12 issues during the Draft EIR/EIS phase, in violation of CEQA. Respondent also failed to assess

13 the cumulative impact of other planned projects related to the proposed Project in violation of

14 CEQA. Because the Final EIR/EIS violates several of CEQA's requirements, the approvals

15 reliant upon it must also be overturned.

16 7. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary

17 law unless this Court grants the requested Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") to require

18 Respondent to set aside its certification of the Final EIR/EIS and approval of the Project. In the

19 absence of such remedies, Respondent's certification and approval will remain, in effect, a

20 violation of state law.

21 PARTIES

22 8. Petitioner and Plaintiff, AJK FARMS, LLC ("AJK Farms") is a California limited

23 liability company. AJK Farms owns the agricultural real property located at 16878 County Road
24 117, West Sacramento, California consisting of a 104-acre pistachio orchard. A portion of AJK

25 Farms' real property parcel is within the proposed Project area of the Tule Canal and the

26 remainder of AJK Farms' property is immediately adjacent to the proposed Project area of the

27 Tule Canal.

12 proposed Project area of the Tule Canal and the remainder of the Stanley Trust's property is
immediately adjacent to the proposed Project area of the Tule Canal.

13 11.

14 Respondent and Defendant, DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES, is a

15 California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with the management of the

16 State Water Project ("SWP") and other management tasks. Respondent is the State of California

17 CEQA "lead agency" on the proposed Project, its impacts, and, if necessary, mitigation measures

18 and alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. Respondent certified

19 the deficient Final EIR/EIS and filed a Notice of Determination on July 19, 2019. Additionally,

20 Respondent adopted the findings and Statement of Overriding Consideration and approved the
proposed Project on July 19, 2019.

21 12.

22 The true names and capacities of Respondents and Defendants, DOES 1-20,

23 inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue such respondents/defendants by

24 fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 474. Petitioners are informed and

25 believe, and based on such information and belief allege, the fictitiously named Respondents and

26 Defendants are also directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition.

27 When the true identities and capacities of these respondents/defendants have been determined,

28 Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and

1 13. Real Party In Interest, the UNITED STATE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION is a

2 federal agency, which operates the Central Valley Project ("CVP") and is the designated lead

3 federal agency related to the proposed Project. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that

4 basis allege, USBR is signatory to the federal component to the Project, the EIS. As of the date

5 of the filing of this Petition, USBR has not provided its Record of Decision related to the EIS.

6 14. The true names and capacities of Real Parties In Interest, ROES 1-20, inclusive,

7 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names

8 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 474. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based

13 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT AND NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

14 15. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

15 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

16 16. On August 13, 2019, Petitioners served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit

17 on Respondent, in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. Proof of Service of

18 this notification, with the notification, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A.

19 17. Petitioners have also named USBR as a Real Party In Interest and are timely

20 serving this Petition/Complaint on USBR.

21 18. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code

22 section 21167.7, Petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a copy of this a

I 20. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

2 Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section

3 21000 et seq., including Public Resources Code sections 21168, and 21168.5.

4 21. This Court has the authority to issue a Writ of Mandate directing Respondents to

5 vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and certification of the EIR for the Project under

6 the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

7 22. Venue is proper in Yolo County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil

8 Procedure sections 392 and 393(b), because the primary location of both the Project and the

9 majority of associated impacts is the County of Yolo.

10 STANDING

11 23. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

12 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

13 24. Respondents have mandatory duty to comply with CEQA prior to certification

14 and approval of the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000-21098, 21155-21156, 21158-

15 21666, 21167.1-21189.3.)

16 25. Petitioners are beneficially interested in ensuring the proposed Project is
17 evaluated and mitigated prior to Respondent's approval and certification. (Code Civ. Proc., §

18 1086.) A beneficial interest can be established when a petitioner/plaintiff has some private or

19 particular interest to be subserved or some right to be preserved or protected, independent of that

20 which he holds with the public at large. (Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area
21 V. County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 158 [citing Kappadahl v. Alcan Pacific Co. (1963)

22 222 Cal.App.2d 626, 643].) In a Writ of Mandate based on alleged violations of CEQA, a

23 property owner, taxpayer, or elector who establishes a geographical nexus with the site of the

24 challenged project has standing. (Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area, supra,

25 172 Cal.App.3d at 158-159 [citing Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d

26 263, 272].)

27 26. Respondent's approval of the proposed Project and certification of the EIR will

28 result in irreparable harm to Petitioners because the Project will cause adverse environmental

RELIEF

1 impacts that are not mitigated. Specifically, Petitioners' land and agricultural operations will be

2 directly affected by the proposed Project. Petitioners' real property is directly adjacent to, and at

3 points overlaps with, the Tule Canal. The Tule Canal is part of the proposed Project area. The

4 proposed Project may adversely impact the seepage of water and thereby the amount of

5 groundwater in and around the Project area, including the Tule Canal. Petitioners have a direct

6 and beneficial interest in Respondent's compliance with laws bearing upon the approval of the

7 Project as their real property will be affected by the environmental impacts including seepage

8 and groundwater levels as a result of the Project. Moreover, this increased inundation of the Tule

9 Canal impacts agricultural practices adjacent to the proposed Project area. These interests will be

10 directly and adversely affected by the proposed Project. Stated differently, Petitioners have a

11 direct and beneficial interest in Respondent's compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the

12 Project as their real property will be affected by the environmental impacts including water

13 seepage and groundwater levels and impacts to agricultural practices as a result of the Project. a

14 27. By certifying the Final EIR/EIS, which was not supported by substantial

15 evidence, and by approving the Project even thought it was not adequately analyzed under

16 CEQA, Respondent has placed the environment on Petitioners real property at significant risk.

17 These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the proposed Project. In addition,

18 unless the relief requested herein is granted, the environment will be adversely affected and

19 injured by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA when certifying the Final EIR/EIS and

20 approving of the Project.

21 28. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

22 course of law, and Petitioners will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief

23 requested in this Petition.

24 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

25 29. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

26 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

27 30. In compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167, the alleged grounds for

28 noncompliance were provided to Respondent, orally or in writing, during the public comment

RELIEF

1 period and prior to the close of the public hearing on the project before the issuance of the notice

2 of determination. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

3 31. All issues raised in this Petition were presented during the comment phase of the
4 Draft EIR/EIS prior to the certification of the Final EIR/EIS and approval of the Project, thereby
5 complying with the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement pursuant to Public

6 Resources Code section 21177.

7 32. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies.

8 33. Prior to the close of the comment period on the Final EIR/EIS and prior to the

9 issuance of the Notice of Determination and approval of the project by Respondent, Petitioners

10 submitted written comments during the Final EIR/EIS stage of the Project, including written

11 comments objecting to the approval and certification of the Final EIR/EIS of the Project because

12 it failed to identify, analyze, and mitigate for the environmental impact of seepage and increased

13 groundwater levels and impact to agricultural practices pursuant to the requirements of CEQA.

14 34. Respondent has taken final agency actions certifying the Final EIR/EIS and

15 approving the Project and has filed the Notice of Determination. Respondent has a mandatory

16 duty to comply with all applicable state and federal laws including, but not limited to CEQA,

17 prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this suit. Petitioners possess no

18 effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in the action other than by means of this

19 Petition.

20 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

21 35. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

22 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.
23 36. On July 19, 2019, or soon thereafter, Respondent posted a Notice of
24 Determination Certifying the Final EIR/EIS for the Project with the State of California, Office of
25 Planning and Research. At this same time Respondent also adopted findings and a Statement of

26 Overriding Consideration approving the Project.

27 37. The statute of limitations provides an action or proceeding alleging an act or

28 omission of a public agency does not comply with the requirements of CEQA must be

2 Resources Code, § 21167; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15094, subd. (g), 15112 subd. (c)(1).)

3 38. This Petition was timely filled in accordance with Public Resources Code section

4 21167 and Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, sections 15094 and 15112. Thus,

5 Petitioners filed their Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.

6 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

7 39. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

8 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

9 40. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2),

10 Petitioners elect to prepare the administrative record in this action.

11 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

12 41. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

13 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

14 42. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

16 affecting the public interest.

17 43. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

18 the general public by requiring Respondent to carry out its duties under CEQA and other

19 applicable laws before approving the Project.

20 44. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys'
21 fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondent and USBR will proceed with a

22 plan and development which will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts which

23 might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review

24 and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

1 Project Background

2 The Project Area

3 46. The Project area includes the lower Sacramento River Basin, including the Yolo
4 Bypass, in Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, and Yolo Counties. Major water bodies and infrastructure

5 located within the Project area include the Sacramento River, Fremont Weir, Sacramento Weir,

6 Lisbon Weir, Knights Landing Ridge Cut, Tule Pond, Tule Canal, and Toe Drain. Project actions

7 are primarily located along the Fremont Weir and within the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area south

8 to Agricultural Road Crossing 1.

9 The Yolo Bypass

10 47. The Yolo Bypass is part of the Sacramento River Flood Control Project (SRFCP),

11 and includes levees, weirs, and bypass facilities that help manage the historic flooding in the
12 Sacramento Valley. The Yolo Bypass is approximately 59,000 acres, which can convey a design

13 flow of approximately 343,000 cubic feet of water per second. Flows enter the Yolo Bypass
14 through the Freemont Weir, which is on the Sacramento River.

15 The Freemont Wier

16 48. The Fremont Weir is an ungated, fixed-crest, concrete weir measuring 1.8 miles

17 long, 6 feet high, and 35 feet wide, located on the downstream right bank of the Sacramento

18 River. The Freemont Weir is a State a Plan of Flood Control facility. The Fremont Weir was

19 designed to allow flow into the Yolo Bypass during high-flow events when the Sacramento River

20 is higher than the Fremont Weir with a 32-foot weir crest elevation.

21 The Sacramento Weir

22 49. The Sacramento Weir is a State Plan of Flood Control facility located along the

23 right bank of the Sacramento River approximately two miles upstream from the mouth of the
24 American River. The Sacramento Weir limits flood stages (water surface elevations) in the

25 Sacramento River to Project design levels through the Sacramento/West Sacramento area. It

26 diverts Sacramento and American Rivers' floodwaters to the west down the mile-long

27 Sacramento Bypass to the Yolo Bypass.

- The Tule Pond

2 50.

3 Tule Pond is an approximately 20-acre perennial pond in the Yolo Bypass located

4 approximately 13 miles north of Interstate (I) 80. The Final EIR/EIS states it is likely the pond is

5 sustained by multiple sources, including impounded floodwater, leakage from an agricultural

6 canal at its southern end, and groundwater, however, the Final EIR/EIS does not provide any
scientific studies to support the sources the Pond is sustained from.

7 Agricultural Road Crossing 1

8 51.

9 Agricultural Road Crossing 1, which is the northernmost agricultural road

10 crossing in Tule Canal at the southeastern corner of the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area, serves as a

11 vehicular crossing and a water delivery feature. The crossing consists of two earthen berms, with

12 the southern used as the road crossing. The cross-canal berms are flow barriers in Tule Canal.

13 The top of the berm has an elevation of approximately 21 feet, which backs up water originating

14 from the Knights Landing Ridge Cut for conveyance east into the northern Elkhorn Basin. This

15 cross-canal berm leaks in some years, which provides water inflow to the upstream wooded area

16 and Tule Pond. Additionally, when overtopping of Fremont Weir ends and flows recede, the

17 cross-canal berm continues to impound water to the north. The cross-canal berms and road

18 crossing create a migratory barrier for adult salmonids and sturgeon under low flows, which
results in fish stranding.

19 Tule Canal

20 52.

21 The Tule Canal is a channel along the east side of the Yolo Bypass, which begins

22 south of Agricultural Road Crossing 1. The Tule Canal receives water from westside tributaries

23 including Knights Landing Ridge Cut and Cache Creek, groundwater contributions, and

24 agricultural diversions. The Tule Canal also drains the initial flows from the Sacramento River

when the river rises above the crest of Fremont Weir.

- 53. There are four earthen agricultural road crossings/impoundments in Tule Canal

2 that control water and provide access for vehicles and farming equipment from the Yolo Bypass

3 east levee road to the agricultural fields. The crossings are commonly referred to as Agricultural

4 Road Crossings 1, 2, 3, and 4 (from north to south). These structures control water during the

5 agricultural season but sometimes wash out during overtopping events.

6 54. As stated in the Final EIR/EIS, Agricultural Road Crossings 2, 3, and 4, are being
N removed or replaced to provide fish passage by separate projects.
8 Toe Drain

9 55. The Tule Canal becomes the Toe Drain south of the I-80 Yolo Causeway. The

10 Toe Drain receives water from the Tule Canal, westside tributaries, groundwater contributions,

11 and agricultural diversions. During non-flooded periods, sturgeon and migrating adult salmonids

12 are contained in the Toe Drain from where they enter at the south end of the Yolo Bypass.
13 Lisbon Weir

14 56. Lisbon Weir is the southernmost water-control structure that crosses the Toe

15 Drain. Lisbon Weir provides higher and more stable water levels to water users north of the weir.

16 Lisbon Weir blocks the channel and limits the range of tidal fluctuation upstream of the weir.

17 The weir operates passively by impounding upstream inflows and tidal water at a minimum

18 elevation that is equal to the weir crest elevation. Lisbon Weir is being modified to improve fish
19 passage as part of a separate project.

20 Project Purpose

21 57. The proposed Project is a joint effort undertaken by Respondent and USBR. The

22 Project proposes to modify infrastructure to increase the number of juvenile salmonids that have

23 access to the floodplain habitat in the Yolo Bypass through the Freemont Weir. Respondent is

24 responsible for operating and maintain the SWP while USBR is responsible for managing the is

25 CVP.

26 58. The SWP and CVP are operated in a coordinated manner to deliver water to

27 agricultural, municipal, and industrial contractors throughout California. The National Marine
28 Fisheries Service issued the Biological and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 the Central Valley Project and State Water Project ("NMFS BO") on June 4, 2009. The NMFS

2 BO conclude that, if left unchanged, the CVP and SWP operations were likely to jeopardize the

3 continued existence of four anadromous fish species listed under the Federal Endangered Species
4 Act. The NMFS BO sets for RPAs that would allow the CVP and the SWP operations to remain
n in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The NMFS BO identified activities in RPA
0 A actions 1.6.1 and I.7 to improve fish passage and habitat restoration actions in the lower

Sacramento River basin, including the Yolo Bypass.
cg Project Infrastructure

9 59. The proposed Project would primarily consist of an intake channel, headwork

10 structure, transport channel, and downstream channel improvements. Under different

11 alternatives, each of these facilities may be constructed in a different location as part of one of

12 three different channel alignments (east, center, and west) in the Yolo Bypass. Each alignment

13 would terminate downstream into the existing Tule Pond.

14 60. The Final EIR/EIS for the Project analyzed six alternatives and a No Project

15 Alternative. Alternative 1 was identified as the Preferred Alternative for CEQA purposes during

16 the Draft EIR/EIS process. Each of the alternatives included variations in the maximum flow and

17 location of structures and modifications to existing infrastructure, however, components common

18 to all of the proposed alternatives include removing the cross-canal berms and road crossing

19 which comprise Agricultural Road Crossing 1. Agricultural Road Crossing 1 presently creates :

20 physical barrier between the Tule Canal and Tule Pond limiting water flow into the Tule Canal.

21 These proposed Project would remove the berms and regrade to connect the proposed upstream

22 channel improvements to the Tule Canal. Additionally, under Alternatives through 4 and 6,

23 improvements would be made to the existing channel that extends from the Tule Pond outlet to

24 the beginning of the Tule Canal at Agricultural Road Crossing 1 in an attempt to facilitate

25 upstream adult fish passage between the existing Tule Canal and Tule Pond.

26 Environmental Review

27 61. On March 4, 2013, Respondent filed a Notice of Preparation with the State

28 Clearing House to prepare a joint EIR/EIS with USBR for the Project.
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 62. On the same date, on March 4, 2013, USBR published a Notice of Intent and

2 Scoping for the Project in the Federal Register Vol. 78, No. 42, 14117-14119.

3 63. Respondent and USBR accepted scoping comments through the public scoping

4 period of March 4 through May 6, 2013. Two scoping meetings were held on March 14, 2013 in

5 West Sacramento, CA and Woodland, CA.

6 64. On December 22, 2017, Respondent filed the Draft EIR/EIS with the State

7 Clearinghouse. The Draft EIR/EIS was circulated for public and agency comment from

8 December 22, 2107 through February 15, 2018.

9 65. USBR also published a Notice of Availability for the Draft EIR/EIS in the Federal

10 Register Vol. 82, No. 248, 61584-61585 on December 28, 2017.

11 66. During the Draft EIR/EIS comment period, Respondent held public meetings in

12 Woodland, CA on January 17, 2018 and West Sacramento on January 18, 2018.

13 67. During the Draft EIR/EIS comment period, Respondent received written

14 comments from four federal agencies, five state agencies, 12 local agencies, and local elected

15 officials, four non-governmental organizations, and numerous members of the public.

16 Additionally, oral comments were provided to Respondent on the Draft EIR/EIS the public

17 meetings. Comments received during this time included comment letters from Yolo County,

18 Reclamation District 1600, North Delta Water Agency, and members of the public.

19 68. On June 7, 2019, Respondent and USBR released the Final EIR/EIS. At this time,

20 USBR published a Notice of Availability of the Final EIR/EIS in the Federal Register Vol. 84,

21 No. 110, 26675. The comment period for this Final EIR/EIS draft period concluded on July 8,

22 2019.

23 69. During this Final EIR/EIS comment period, both USBR and Respondent received
24 comment letters, including a comment letter from Petitioners dated July 8, 2019 reiterating the

25 lack of proper environmental analysis related to the Project including the failure to identify,

26 analyze, and mitigate for seepage and groundwater level increase and impacts to agricultural

27 resources as a result of the increased inundation of the Tule Canal.

8 MANDATORY REQUIREMENT OF CEQA

9 73. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

10 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

11 74. CEQA applies to discretionary projects, which are undertaken, funded, or

12

13 approved by public agencies. Prior to project approval, CEQA requires the lead public agency
identify all potentially significant environmental impacts of a proposed project, adequately

14

15 disclose those impacts to the public, and implement all feasible alternatives or mitigation
measures necessary to avoid or substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§

16 21002, 2100; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15126.6, 15370.)

17 75. Each public agency must mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the

18 environment of projects that it carries out or approves whenever it is feasible to do so. (Pub.

19 Resources Code, § 21002.1, subd. (b).)

20 76. A lead agency is responsible for considering the effects, both individual and

21 collective, of all activities involved in project. (Pub. Resources Code, §21002.1 subd. (d).)

22 77. Public Resources Code section 21100 subdivision (b)(2)(A) requires an EIR

23 include a detailed statement setting forth "any significant effect on the environment that cannot

24 be avoided if the project is implemented."

25 78. The EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the project which may be

26 "cumulatively considerable" and address the project's incremental effects when combined with

27

28 the effects of past, current, and probable future projects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§15064, subd.
(h)(1), 15130, subd. (a), 15355.)
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

- 79.

2 A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project without significant

3 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. The lead agency's

4 findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources
Code § 21081; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15091-15093.)

5 80.

6 Failure to include essential information in the EIR results in a failure to proceed in

7 the manner required by law. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2
Cal.5th 918.)

8 81. CEQA requires agencies to consider a "reasonable range of alternatives that will

9

10 foster informed decision making and public participation." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §15126.6,

11 subd. (a).) The "discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or its location

12 which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project,

13 even if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives

14 or would be more costly." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, 15126.6, subd. (b).) It is imperative that

15 each alternative allow meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed
project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.6, subd. (d).)

16 82.

17 A project cannot be approved if its significant impacts can be feasibly reduced to

18 insignificance through project alternatives or mitigation measures. (Pub. Resources Code, §

19 21002, 21021.) Agencies can eliminate alternatives from detailed consideration in an EIR if they

20 are infeasible, fail to meet "most" of the basic project objectives or do not avoid significant

21 environmental impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8 14, § 15126.6, subd. (c).) An agency's rejection of

22 an alternative as "infeasible" or otherwise "unworthy of more in-depth consideration" must be

23 supported by "substantial evidence." (Center for Biological Diversity v. County of San
Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 885.)

24 STANDARD OF REVIEW

25 83. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

26 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

27 84.

28 Failure to comply with the CEQA requirements constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, regardless of
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1

2 whether a different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those
requirements in the first place. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.)

3 85.

4 Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner

5 required by law or, if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by substantial
evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

6 86. Under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.6 and Code of Civil

7

8 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, the Court reviews the legal effects of any of Respondent's
findings a on a de novo basis, with no deference to Respondent's decision.

9 87. Under Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil

10

11 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, the Court reviews the administrative record to determine

12 whether any of Respondent's findings on CEQA issues are supported by substantial evidence in
light of the whole record.

13 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

14 88.

15 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all
previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

16 89.

17 In its comment letter to Respondent and USBR, Petitioners requested certification

18 of the Final EIR/EIS and approval of the Project be deferred until the informational deficiencies

19 of the environmental document were addressed and resolved, and until adequate monitoring and

20 mitigation plan is developed and implemented. Respondent failed to take such actions, and
instead certified the Final EIR/EIS and approved the Project.

21 90.

22 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5 subdivision (g), the

23 Court may stay or enjoin the operation of any administrative decision or order involved in this

proceeding.

- 91.

2 A stay or injunction of Respondent's actions and Real Parties' in interest actions

3 related to the Project would not be against the public interest because Respondent is required by

4 CEQA to conduct an adequate environmental review of the Project before taking any actions to

5 approve it, because construction of the Project could have significant environmental impacts, and

6 because neither Respondent or USBR will be harmed by the Court's issuance of a stay or an
injunction.

7 92.

8 Because Respondent has approved the Project, a there is a real, concrete threat

9 Respondent will proceed with such construction despite the inadequate environmental review of

10 the Project's impacts that Respondent has conducted under CEQA. As Respondent violated

11 CEQA in certifying the Final EIR/EIS and approving the Project, any action regarding the

12 construction or operation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and pose a

13 significant threat to the real property and groundwater levels in and around the Tule Canal.

14 Petitioners have no plan, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for this irreparable harm. Therefore,

15 a stay or preliminary and permanent injunction should be issued in this case restraining

16 Respondent and USBR from obtaining permits and undertaking any Project construction
activities until Respondent has complied with CEQA.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Failure to Evaluate Project Impacts

19

20 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.)
93.

21 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all
previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

22 94.

23 The EIR is an informational document which must disclose any potentially

24 significant environmental impacts of the project and inform decision-makers and the general

25 public of mitigation measures and alternatives to the project which would avoid or substantially

26 lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.1) An EIR must provide an analytically

27 complete and coherent explanation of its conclusions and contain "a sufficient degree of analysis

28 to provide decision makers with information which enables them to make a decision which
intelligently take account of environmental consequences." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15151.)
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 95. An EIR must identify the significant environmental impacts of a proposed project.

2 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.) Significant

3 impacts are defined as a "substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the
4 environment." (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21068, 21060.5. See also Pub. Resources Code, §
5 21100, subd. (d).)

6 96. In order to determine whether there are potentially adverse changes in the
7 environment, the EIR must examine the changes to the existing environment and evaluate the

8 changes that would occur if the proposed Project were implemented. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §

9 15126.2; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr. v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.4th 645.)

10 97. In addition to direct impacts of the proposed Project, the EIR is required to

11 identify and describe significant indirect environmental impacts that will result from, the Project.

12 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) An indirect environmental impact is a change in
13 the physical environmental that is not immediately related to the Project but caused indirectly by

14 the Project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15064, subd. (d)(2).) Indirect impacts include secondary
15 effects. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, 15358.) If a direct Project impact will cause another change

16 in the environment, the secondary effect is an indirect impact of the Project. (Cal. Code Regs.,

17 tit. 14, § 15064.) The EIR is required to evaluate these indirect impacts as part of its

18 environmental analysis. (El Dorado Union High Sch. Distr. V. City of Placerville (1983) 144
19 Cal.3d 123; City of Hayward v. Board of Trustees of Cal. State Univ. (2015) 242 Cal.4th 833,

20 859.)

21 98. The EIR failed to adequately identify and evaluate the Project's significant
22 environmental impacts. Specifically, the EIR fails to identify and evaluate the impacts of

23 removing Agricultural Road Crossing and increasing the inundation flow quantity and duration

24 of flooding the Tule Canal.

25 99. The EIR failed to evaluate whether the increased inundation would result in a

26 higher water table and seepage on properties directly adjacent to the Tule Canal. Moreover, the

27 EIR failed to evaluate how the increased seepage would impact surrounding land use and
28 agricultural practices.
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

100. The failure of the EIR to identify and evaluate the high water table and seepage

2 impacts of the proposed Project result in the EIR being deficient and a violation of the CEQA

3 requirements. The purpose of the proposed Project is to facilitate increased floodplain

4 inundation, including the removal of existing structures to facilitate increased water flow and
5 inundation. The potential for seepage impacts, damage to existing land use and surrounding
6 agricultural operations are clearly potentially adverse changes in the environment that the EIR is

7 required to identify and evaluate. The failure to do so results in a violation of CEQA

8 requirements.

9 101. Respondent abused its discretion when it failed to proceed in a manner required

10 by law. Moreover, Respondent's decision to approve the Project is an abuse of discretion

11 because Respondent's findings are not supported by evidence, its decisions are not supported by

12 the findings, and it has not proceeded in the manner required by law under CEQA.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Failure to Evaluate Cumulative Impacts

15 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000; 21083; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15130)

16 102. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

17 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

18 103. CEQA requires an EIR to consider the impacts of a proposed project along with

19 the other projects, to ensure a complete picture of environmental change is portrayed. An EIR is

20 required to disclose the cumulative impacts of the proposed Project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §
21 15355.) Specifically, an EIR must discuss the cumulative impacts of a project when the project's

22 incremental effects are "cumulatively considerable." (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000, 21083,

23 subd. (b)(2); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15130, subd. (a).) "Cumulatively considerable" means

24 that "the incremental effects of an individual project are significant when viewed in connection
25 with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable

26 future projects." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083, subd. (b)(2); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15065,

27 subd. (a)(3).)

28 /1/
20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 104. A lead agency may find that the proposed project is not cumulatively

2 considerable. However, it must do so only after it has properly identified the past, present, and

3 probably future projects producing related impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15130.)

4 105. The EIR failed to adequately identify all potentially cumulative projects. For

5 example, the EIR evaluated several significant potential projects that could, along with the

6 proposed Project, have a cumulative impact to agriculture in the Project area. The California

7 WaterFix project was identified, but its impacts were only evaluated in conjunction with the no-

8 project alternative. (See Section 1.8 of the Final Environmental Impact
9 Statement/Environmental Impact Report of the Yolo Bypass Salmonid Habitat Restoration &

10 Fish Passage Project.) The EIR failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of the preferred

11 alternative with the California WaterFix project. This failure requires the lead agency to either

12 adopt the no-project alternative or perform a proper cumulative analysis considering the

13 proposed Project in conjunction with other water-related programs such as California WaterFix.

14 106. The EIR also fails to evaluate the cumulative impacts of several other local

15 infrastructure programs, including the Lower Elkhorn Basin Levee Setback Project and the

16 Lower Yolo Ranch Restoration Project. Without the evaluation of the impacts of the Proposed

17 Project in conjunction with these and other local programs, the EIR does not include a valid

18 cumulative impacts analysis. For these reasons, the EIR is deficient and violates the CEQA

19 requirements with regard to cumulative analysis.

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Failure to Evaluate and Adopt Mitigation

22 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15002; 15021.)

23 107. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in all

24 previous paragraphs of this Petition, as if fully set forth herein.

25 108. Identification and discussion of proposed mitigation measures are core

26 requirements of CEQA. A basic purpose of CEQA is to "[p]revent significant, unavoidable

27 damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or

28 mitigation measures." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15021 subd. (a)(1).) This
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 is accomplished by identifying ways in which a proposed Project's impacts can be mitigated or

2 avoided. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21061.) An EIR is required to describe feasible

3 mitigation measures that can minimize the significant environmental impacts of the proposed
4 Project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15121.)

5 109. CEQA imposes upon Respondent a clear, present, and mandatory duty to analyze

6 and adopt all feasible mitigation measures as well as consider a reasonable range of alternative to

7 adopt any reasonable alternative, which would substantially lessen the significant environmental

8 effects of the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002.)

9 110. The EIR fails to provide a reasonable analysis of mitigation measures to avoid,

10 minimize, or mitigate the Project's significant environmental impacts related to the

11 environmental impacts of increased water table, seepage, and other impacts related to increased

12 frequency and duration of flooding. The EIR fails to describe and evaluate reasonable

13 mitigation measures and alternative that could eliminate or substantially lessen significant

14 environmental impacts of the proposed Project. Specifically, the EIR fails to evaluate the use of

15 tile drains, controlled subsurface drainage mechanisms, or other drainage plans to address the

16 impact of seepage and increased inundation.

17 111. As a result of the forgoing defects, Respondent failed to adopt legally adequate

18 mitigation for the Project and approved the Project with unmitigated impacts. Respondent

19 prejudicially abused its discretion by certifying and approving an EIR, which does not comply
20 with the requirements of CEQA.

21 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Inadequate Response to Comments

113. An EIR must evaluate comments on environmental issues and include a written

2 response to such comments. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088, subd. (a).) A lead agency must

3 respond to comments raising significant environmental issues received during the noticed
4 comment period. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088, subd. (a).)

5 114. The written response must describe the disposition of significant environmental

6 issues raised (e.g., revisions to the proposed project to mitigate anticipated impacts or

7 objections). (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088, subd. (c).) When major environmental issues

8 raised when the lead agency's position is at variance with recommendations and objections

9 raised in the comments must be addressed in detail giving reasons why specific comments and

10 suggestions were not accepted. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088, subd. (c).) There must be a

11 good faith, reasoned analysis in response. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088, subd. (c).)

12 Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.

13 14, § 15088, subd. (c).)

14 115. The EIR does not satisfy the requirements for responding to comments on the
15 EIR. The EIR does not include good faith, reasoned analysis in its response to the comments;

16 instead, the response to comments in the Final EIR/EIS merely regurgitate the incomplete

17 information provided in the Draft EIR/EIS. The response to comments is conclusory, evasive,

18 confusing, or otherwise non-responsive contrary to the requirements of CEQA.

19 116. For example, the Final EIR/EIS did not provide adequate explanations regarding
20 the lacking analysis of Project impacts to seepage, groundwater, and the hydrologic condition as

21 a result of the increased inundation of the Tule Canal. Instead, the EIR included responses to

22 comments that contained conclusory statements and were unsupported by substantial evidence in

23 the administrative record.

24 117. For these reasons, the EIR violates CEQA and Respondent abused its discretion

25 by certifying the Final EIR/EIS and approving the Project.

Re: Notice of Intent to file a petition pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21000 challenging the certification of the Final EIR/EIS and approval of Yolo Bypass Salmonid Habitat Restoration and Fish Passage Project
Dear Director Nemeth:

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC") § 21167.5, Petitioners AJK Farms, LLC, Dalhar Farms, LLC, and Lance Stanley, as an individual and on behalf of the Stanley Revocable Living Trust, ("Petitioners") intend to file a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Resources Code § 21000
et seq., against Respondent the Department of Water Resources (*Respondent"), challenging Respondent's
July 19, 2019 certification of the Final EIR for the Yolo Bypass Salmonid Habitat Restoration and Fish
Passage Project ("Project"), and adoption of findings, statement of overriding considerations, mitigation,
monitoring, and reporting plan, approval of the project and execution of the notice of determination.
Among other issues, Petitioners will allege Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and without substantial evidence by certifying an EIR that fails to properly disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's potential significant individual and cumulative impacts and inadequate response to comments. The petition being filed will seek the following relief:

1. 2. For a stay pending trial of Respondent's decisions approving the Project.
For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering: a. Respondent to vacate and set aside it's certification of the EIR for the Project, adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations, and decisions approving the Project; b. Respondent and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity under the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project that could result in any change or alternation to the physical environment until Respondent has taken all actions necessary to bring the certification and Project approvals into compliance with CEQA; and
C. Respondent to prepare, circulate, and consider an EIR in compliance with CEQA prior to any subsequent action to approve the Project.
3. 4. For the costs of suit.
For an award of attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable provisions of law or equity.
5. For any other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper.

Karla Nemeth
August 13, 2019 Re: Notice of Intent to Sue

Petitioners request the Respondent rescind the Notice of Determination and the approval for the Project, to conduct the appropriate environmental review, and revise the EIR as required by law. In this vein, our clients are willing to forego filing the Petition if Respondent enters into an agreement to toll the statute of limitations with regard to filing a petition in this matter and mitigate for Project impacts to Petitioners.

Very Truly Yours,
Whupisd Valerie C. Kincaid
