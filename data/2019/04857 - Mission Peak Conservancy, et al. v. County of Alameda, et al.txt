THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1

Petitioners and Plaintiffs Mission Peak Conservancy and Kelly Abreau (*Petitioners")
2 allege through this Verified Third Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
3 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") as follows:

4 I. INTRODUCTION

5 Respondent and Real Parties in Interest Violations of the

6 California Environmental Quality Act
7 1. This action challenges the legality of Respondent County of Alameda, by and
8 through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning
[ Department, Public Works Agency, Fire Department, and Board of Supervisors ("the County"),
10 and Real Parties in Interest Christopher and Teresa George ("RPI"), to proceed with the
11 transformation of agricultural land into a resort like event and recreation center without any
12 environmental review in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act under California
13 Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., and title 14 of California Code of Regulations §§ 15000
14 et seq. ("CEQA"), on properties commonly known as 3505 and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road,
15 located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont, California, in an area not
16 visible to the public ("the Properties"), including, but not limited to, the following:
17 The construction of a 12,000 square foot event center, also known as the
18 "agricultural barn", "barn", or "mini-Versailles";
19 The creation of six million gallon lake stocked with unknown species of fish;
20 The creation of a dam and the alteration of a watercourse to create the lake;
21 The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;
22 The construction of a 6800 square foot "workshop";
23 The construction of a 2000 square foot greenhouse;
The construetion-of a large gazebo;
25 The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
26 The excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars;
27 The installation of a winery or brewery;
28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2

1 The construction of a courtyard connected to the 12,000 square foot "barn"
2 containing a gas fire pit for entertainment, cooking area kitchen, lighting, seating
3 and retaining walls ("the courtyard");
4 The construction of a waterfall or watercourse feature;
5 The installation of a 500 feet gas line into the courtyard kitchen;
6 The installation of a 2400 feet water line from a well to the "barn" storage tank;
The construction and grading of an elevated and landscaped road thousands of
8 feet long with an impermeable surface and an approximate 10%-20% grade; and
The construction of an "inground spa".
10 The amendment to Title 17 of the General Ordinance Code of Alameda County
1.1 No. 17.06.030(E) related to microbreweries in Zone A Districts which allows
12 agri-tourism and the commercial production of beer without a use or variance
13 permit and specifically drafted by RPI, promoted by RPI, and adopted with RPI's
14 interests in mind on or about April 9, 2019.
15 (collectively, defined as "the Project" or "the Project as a whole".) a
16 2. The Properties on which the Project is located is in an agricultural and riparian
17 area. The Project is very large in scope, and whether as a whole, or by its individual
18 components, it will have a significant effect on the environment, yet the County failed to conduct
19 any environmental review of the Project as a whole, including, but not limited to, a preliminary
20 review of the Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project as a whole a
21 qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project as a whole
22 § (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an environmental impact report or a negative
23 declaration of the Project as a whole. The County has not issued any approvals, permits, or made
2.4  any-findings-with-respect to the -Project as a whole.

25 3. Instead, the County RPI are improperly piecemealing or segmenting the Project
26 into many sub-projects, and have obtained County approvals (building permits) for the 12,000
27 square foot event center, the large courtyard, the installation of a 500 foot gas line, and the
28 installation of a 2400 foot water line. RPI, on or about November 15, 2018, applied for County

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

1 "corrective" building permits to legalize the gazebo, the new road, the greenhouse, and the 6800
2 square foot "workshop, all of which have already been constructed, or are under construction,
3 and are known to Respondent. On or about 2019, RPI applied for another building permit for the
"inground spa". Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the foregoing are
5 currently awaiting County approval and/or denials as of the date of the filing of this Third
6 Amended Petition and demonstrate illegal piecemealing of the Project.
7 4. Piecemealing applies to project when a future action: "(1) is a reasonably a
8 foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be
9 significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its
10 environmental effects." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of University of
11 California (1987) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.) Related activities constitute a single project where "the
12 second activity is a reasonably foresecable consequence of the first activity; the second activity is
13 future expansion of the first activity; or both activities are integral parts of the same project."
14 (Sierra Club v West Side Irrigation Dist. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 690, 698 (citations omitted).)
15 5. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI
16 will continue to engage in further piecemealing, as RPI are currently seeking, or will seek in the
17 imminent future, separate approvals (building permits) for the remaining sub-projects already
18 built without any permits, including, but not limited to, the six million gallon lake, dam and
19 watercourse alteration, the white sand beach alongside the lake, the mobile/manufactured home,
20 the excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars, the graded road,
21 and the installation of a winery or brewery. The County, pursuant to conditions described on
22 permit BLD2017-02969, dated November 21, 2017 for the courtyard, explicitly required RPI to
23 "submit permits for all structures on site that were built without permits", "prior to permit final".
24. A-true and correct copy of this permit is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is hercby
25 incorporated by reference.

26 6. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI
27 have, and currently are, improperly piecemealing the Project, and have obtained, and/or are
28 seeking, separate County approvals for each separate sub-project or component of the Project in

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4

1 an effort to avoid CEQA review. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the

2 County mischaracterized each of the separate building permit approvals as ministerial in order to

3 exempt them from CEQA review. The County should have analyzed the Project as a whole, not

4 separately, which analysis would have required discretionary approvals and CEQA review.

5 7. The County already knew, as early as July 14, 2014, when RPI first sought

6 County approval for the 12,000 square foot event center or "barn", that the "barn" was a

7 component of a much bigger project which required CEQA review, but CEQA review did not

8 happen. A true and correct copy of the County email correspondence providing this information

9 and dated July 14, 2014, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B, and is hereby incorporated by
10 reference.

11 The Evolution of the Project Definition and Its Effect on the

1.2 CEQA Statute of Limitations Based on the "Commencement of the Project"

13 8. Petitioners, however, did not have actual or constructive notice the "barn" was a

14 part of a much larger project like the County did in 2014 and 2015. When Petitioners first

15 complained to the County in 2016, they complained only of the "barn". At that time Petitioners

16 believed the "barn" alone was the "project". Petitioners had actual and constructive notice only
17 of the barn in the summer of 2016.

18 9. The reasons for this are as follows: First, RPI did not apply for or receive any
19 other County approvals or permits for any other component of the Project except for the "barn"
20 until the summer or fall of 2017 when they sought permits for the construction of the large
21 courtyard attached to the "barn". Until that time, for more than two years, there were no other
22 public disclosures by either RPI or the County whatsoever regarding any component of the
23 Project except for the "barn", nor for the Project as a whole.

25 Petitioners learned much later in 2018 that the courtyard construction may have begun earlier
26 as a part of the "barn" before the permits for the courtyard were issued on or about November

27 21, 2017, since both structures appear to be connected to each other. But as of the summer of 2016, Petitioners did not have actual or constructive notice of the courtyard and did not complain
28 to the County about the same, and any such reference to complaints made about it at that time (in 2016) were attorney error. The "courtyard", as Petitioners refer to it in this Petition, did not exist at that time.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5

10. Second, the County never held any public hearings or posted any public notices
2 about the Project as a whole or any a component thereof at any time, including for the "barn" or
3 the courtyard.

4 11. Third, the remote and hidden nature of the Properties worked to effectively hide
5 the components of the Project and the Project a as a whole from public view, especially since the
public park adjacent to the Properties, where one can distantly view some portions the Properties,

7 was closed and was not accessible to the public until early summer of 2017.

8 12. The result of these combined factors is that the definition of the Project, as
9 described in paragraph 1, evolved over time based on Petitioners' notice of the components that
10 make up and changed the definition of the Project as a whole, and based on the fact that some of
11 the components simply did not exist when the "barn" construction began in 2015 or when the
12 permit issued that same year. The scope and definition of the Project expanded over time to

13 include more and more of the components described above in paragraph 1, some of them as
14 recent as this year, as more fully described below.

15 13. The County has not issued any formal approvals for the Project (as a whole),
16 therefore, the appropriate statute of limitations to apply is the 180-day statute of limitations

17 under California Public Resources Code §21167(d) and 14 California Code of Regulations
18 15112(c)(5)(B) that runs from the "commencement of the project". (See, December 13, 2018
19 Order on Demurrer to First Amended Petition filed in this action; and June 21, 2019 Tentative
20 Order on Demurrer and Motion to Strike Second Amended Petition.)
21 14. The "commencement of the project" is when (1) a public agency or private entity
22 has disclosed that it has committed itself (commencement) to an action that is stable, finite and
23 capable of being defined with accuracy (project), (2) the action may cause either a direct physical
change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

25 environment (project subject to CEQA) and (3) the petitioner or the public is on constructive
26 notice of both the proposed action and its possible effect on the environment." (Id.) (See also,
27 Communities for a Better Environment v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2016) 1
28 Cal.App.5th 715, 726, "we acknowledge that if there were any situation in which it would be

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

1 warranted to delay the triggering of a limitations period in the manner CBE urges, it would be

2 one in which no public notice of the project was given and the project's commencement was not

3 readily apparent to the public.)

4 15. Part one of the above definition necessarily requires the action, in this case, the
5 a Project (as a whole), is stable, finite and capable of being defined with accuracy. When the

6 definition of the Project as a whole continues to a change as new components are added as alleged
7 herein and described more fully below, the "action" is not stable, finite or capable of being

8 defined with accuracy because it continually evolves. Said another way, a project is only stable,

9 finite and being capable of being defined with accuracy until the next significant change comes
10 along.

11 16. Part two of the definition requires that the "action" - the Project as a whole - is a
12 subject to CEQA, which is alleged in this Petition at 11 1-7; 90-102.
13 17. Part three of the definition - constructive notice - is defined by California Civil
14 Code § 19 as "Every person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent

15 person upon inquiry as to a particular fact has constructive notice of the fact itself in all cases in
16 which, by prosecuting such inquiry, he or she might have learned that fact."

17 18. "Constructive notice of the proposed action" necessarily requires that Petitioners
18 have constructive notice of the contents of the "proposed action", or "project", i.e. the
19 components of the Project. Thus, when significant components of the Project as a whole
20 continue to change and grow, the time when Petitioners acquired constructive notice of the

21 Project as a whole also change.

22 19. The a Project as a whole commences when it is constructively known to Petitioners,

23 and when it keeps changing, so does the "commencement of the project" keep changing. As of
24  the date of this filing, the *commencement of the Project", as defined herein, began no earlier
25 than November 21, 2017, and possibly as late as November 15, 2018 or even this year, as
26 described below.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7

1 2015 to the Summer of 2017

2 20. From 2015 until the summer of 2017, the definition of the Project for purposes of
3 this CEQA action included only the construction of the 12,000 square foot "barn" or "mini-

4 Versailles", allegedly being built to replace an old barn RPI had torn down. Petitioners did not

5 have any constructive or actual knowledge of any other portion of the Project as defined herein,

6 many components of which did not even exist at that time, as described more fully, below, and
other components of which were undisclosed because RPI had violated the law and built
unpermitted structures. None of the other components of the Project other than the "barn" were
disclosed to the public by the County or RPI via permits or applications for the same during this
10 time frame, and as stated herein, the Properties are hidden from public view in a remote location.
11 Petitioners had no notice, actual or constructive, or reason to suspect, know or believe during this
12 time frame that the Project consisted of more than just the "barn," in part because RPI had
13 violated the law and built unpermitted structures.

14 21. At that time, the Project as a whole had not commenced. The only part of the
15 Project that had "commenced" between 2015 and the summer of 2017 was the "barn", since

16 because (1) he County and RPI had only "disclosed that it has committed itself" to the it

17 construction of the "barn". not the Project as a whole as defined herein, and (2) Petitioners did
18 not have constructive notice of the Project as a whole at that time, only the barn. There were no
19 approvals or disclosures by the County or RPI that it was committing themselves to the Project
20 as a whole. In fact, many portions of the Project as a whole physically did not exist during this
21 time frame, such as the large courtyard, the waterfall/watercourse, the new graveled road, the gas
22 line, the water line, and the inground spa. Furthermore, it took the County five months or more

23 to approve the "barn" permit. The County initially refused to the grant the agricultural
24- exemption for the "barn"-because it was two stories (the County only allow one story), and the
25 "barn" contained mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components. Following a flurry of
26 County activity regarding the "barn", including "all hands" on deck type meetings, per Planning
27 Director Albert Lopez, the County also recognized "[w]e seem to be into the first part of a "plan
28 of larger development", as we say in the C3 world." (referring to the "barn" as a commercial a

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 "C3" type development.) The County, however, ultimately approved the "barn" permit despite
2 its CEQA concerns, and told RPI that it will assist RPI in "getting the building permit to
3 complete this portion of the project". This is just more evidence that the County was not only
4 | piecemealing intentionally, but that it had committed itself only to the "barn" portion of the
5 project, not the Project as a whole, even though they recognized it was a "portion of the project"
6 as a whole, since they were approving or "committing" to just the "barn" portion.
7 22. During this time frame, Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege
8 that RPI did not disclose any of the other individual components of the Project that existed at that
9 time to the County or the public at large, including the lake, the dam, the beach, the gazebo, the
10 workshop, the parking lot and the greenhouse. Petitioners did not have actual or constructive
11 notice of these undisclosed individual components of the Project during this time frame (2015 to
12 summer of 2017). The only "proposed action" Petitioners had constructive notice of was the
13 construction of the "barn".

14 The Summer and Early Fall of 2017
15 23. In or around the summer of 2017, the definition of the Project changed and grew
16 to include the lake, the dam, the beach, the gazebo, the workshop, the greenhouse and the paved
17 road. Petitioners obtained actual notice of these components of the Project, but it still did have
18 constructive notice of the Project as whole as it is defined herein because (1) the Project as a
19 whole was still not stable, finite and capable of being defined with accuracy during this time
20 because it grew again to include significant changes (2) neither the County nor RPI "disclosed"
21 they had "committed" themselves to the Project as a whole, as a and (3) Petitioners did not have
22 constructive notice of the Project as a whole a at that time because it grew again to include
23 significant changes.

24 24.After not receiving any information or feedback from the County for more than a
25 year, and after the Vargas Plateau Regional Park re-opened after a series of lawsuits filed a by RPI
26 (see 11 112-117), Petitioners began to perform their own research and inquiry about the
27 Properties, and complained to the County about what they believed they found in or around the
28 summer of 2017.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

25. During late spring and/or early summer 2017, Petitioners took to Google Earth as

2 well as Vargas Plateau Regional Park to attempt to learn more about the "barn". Google Earth
and aerial historical images of the Properties revealed not only the "barn" and some of its

4 characteristics, but the existence of the lake, the dam, the white sand beach, the parking lot, the
5 gazebo, the greenhouse, the manufactured home, and the workshop, all of which Petitioners

6 believed were constructed without permits and thus formally undisclosed to the County.
7 26. This was the first expansion of the project definition, where it changed from

8 including only the barn, to include the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot, the greenhouse,
9 the workshop, the gazebo and the manufactured home.

10 27. Soon thereafter, Petitioners complained to and notified the County of these

11 components of the Project they had observed (in the summer of 2017), and notified the County

12 that Petitioners believed CEQA applied to the Project as it was defined at this time, and that the

13 County was failing in its duty to conduct CEQA review of the Project as it was defined at that it
14 time. Petitioners complaints to the County were related to those components of the Project of
15 which Petitioners had knowledge and that existed at the time, and did not include complaints of
16 the Project as a whole as it is defined in this Petition and of which they did not have constructive
17 knowledge.

18 28. The Project a as a whole still did not "commence", for statute of limitations

19 purposes, in the summer of 2017, because the definition of the Project as a whole grew and

20 changed again in or around November 21, 2017, and throughout 2018 into 2019, as did

21 Petitioners' constructive notice of the new definition and components of the Project. (the

22 "proposed action".) The Project a as a whole - the "action" was not stable, finite, or capable of

23 being described with accuracy at that time because the components of the Project as a whole
continued to change, and because many of its components did not exist at that time.

25 29. The County or RPI also did not "disclose" it "committed" themselves the Project

26 as a whole at that time, or to any other component of the Project. Petitioners complained, but
27 during the summer and fall of 2017, neither the County nor RPI had "disclosed" it "committed"
28 itself to any of the previously undisclosed components of the Project, or to the Project as a whole

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10

1 (as it was defined then). To the contrary, Petitioners were the ones who "disclosed" the various

2 components of the Project to the County in an effort to get the County to do its job and conduct

3 CEQA review of the Project as it was then. Petitioners had no idea at that time whether the

4 County was "committed" to allowing RPI to continue to move forward on the whole, part, or

5 none of the Project as it was defined at that time. Equally importantly, Petitioners had no actual
6 or constructive knowledge whether the County had committed itself to a particular course of

7 action and, in fact, as discussed below, in paragraphs 30 - 32, the County had not committed

8 itself to a particular course of action and as late as October and November, 2017, was still

9 considering which course of action it would commit itself to approving the Project (as it was
10 then known to exist) without further review or accepting Petitioners' concerns and requiring
11 CEQA review.

12 30. Petitioners were not aware at the time that the County had visited the Properties in
13 response to their complaints in the summer of 2017 regarding the components of the Project that
14 they knew of and existed at the time, nor were they aware of the wrangling that went on during
15 this time frame between the County and RPI regarding the issuance of the building permit for the
16 courtyard and the overall use of the "barn". The County had most definitely not committed itself
17 to the courtyard component of the Project at this time, or the Project as a whole, despite a RPI's
18 intense efforts, including pulling some political strings.

19 31. For about a month or more during October and November 2017, RPI were
20| hounding the County to give them their building permit for the courtyard. In fall 2017, the

21 County visited the Properties and came away with the conclusion that: "We are trying to decidel
22 how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not designed to be used as a barn:

23 radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and construction, adjacent deck,
24 admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See attached pictures taken this past Friday.) This begs
25 the question, if used currently as an accessory entertainment building for the existing house, then
26 the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum floor area for the residential buildings and residential accessory
27 buildings applies. understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be at 12,000 sq. ft. floor

28 area (both floors combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor area, the property

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

1 would likely be over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for residential and

2 residential accessory buildings, per ECA. We are trying to get the other County departments
3 and with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to see about the adjacent property, at

4 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned by

5 Christopher George, to see about the beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after

6 months being told that it would soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of

7 the pond (I can't tell its size)." (Ex. E.; emphasis added). Petitioners were not aware of these

8 activities and this email until in or about March or April, 2018. Equally if not more importantly,
9 though, these activities clearly established that the County had not yet committed itself to a
10 particular course of action, approving the Project (as it was then known to exist) without further
11 review or accepting Petitioners' concerns and requiring CEQA review. As the County's email
12 above states, as of this date, the County was still "trying to decide" what to do, was still "trying
13 to get" input from other County departments and the state Department of Fish and Wildlife" and

14 still needed "to see about" the other unpermitted structures.

15 32. An hour and a half a later on the same day, Planning Director for the County Albert
16 Lopez wrote to Mr. Wilson: "We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the
17 various activities on the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some
18 kind of assembly use, event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily
19 have to look at everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play
20 out through our normal process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to

21 learn more about his plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local
22 ordinances." (Ex. E; emphasis added). This email also conclusively establishes as of that date,
23 the County still had not yet committed itself to a particular course of action. As of this point in

24- time, the County stitl "[did]n't know"-RPI's final plans or RPI's activities; the County still
25 "[had] to look at" the information Petitioners had brought to the County's attention; the County
26 still had "to learn more about" RPI's plans; the County still had to "discuss how those plans align
27 with our various ordinances." Because the County was still in the process of deciding which
28 course of action it would pursue, it had not yet committed itself to a particular course of action.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

1 33. Petitioners also did not have constructive notice of, nor were they aware during
•2 this time, that the "barn" was being built for assembly use as the Court stated in its Tentative
3 Order dated June 21, 2019. ("An email dated 10/23/17 indicates that a member of the public was
aware that the barn on the George's property was being built for assembly use." Tentative Order
5 dated June 21, 2019, at 8:26-9:3.) Rather, it is the County that admits in their correspondence
6 described herein and attached as Exhibit E that the "barn" is clearly being built for assembly use,
7 not Petitioners or another member of the public. (See, Ex. E.)
8 34. Petitioners may have had their suspicions of the future use of the "barn" for
9 assembly use, but they did not have constructive notice that it was intended for the same at that
10 time, especially when the County insists to Petitioners that the use of the barn and the Properties
11 is agricultural and "legal land use wise". (See 135.) Petitioners did not have knowledge of the
1.2 contents of these internal County emails until many months later in 2018 following a California
13 Public Records Act request.

14 35. In an email to Petitioner MPC on November 14, 2017, Planning Director Lopez
15 communicated to Petitioners that the County still has not "committed itself" to the Project as it
16 was defined at that time, or any (unpermitted) component of it, writing that the County is looking 17 into the "the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of
18 the property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner".
19 "[B]ased on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being
20 looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to 21 discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an
22 ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting
23 all the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.". "[NJo discretionary permits
24 have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if-through the code enforcement
25 process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded
26 the concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting 27 their response." (Ex. C.) This email provided actual notice to Petitioners that, consistent with
28 the prior activities and emails of which Petitioners were not aware until in or about March or

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 13

1 April, 2018, the County still had not committed itself to a course of action. Indeed, this email

2 holds out the proposition that in fact the County may very well conclude that CEQA review

3 would be ordered.

4 36. Nothing in the above-described correspondence gives any indication that the

5 County has effectively signed on or committed itself to RPI's Project as it was defined at that
6 time. To the contrary, it demonstrates the County was engaged in an "ongoing" action that was
7 "working toward resolution", not a "commitment" yet and in fact, refers to the possibility that as
8 a result of this on-going process, the County still may very well commit itself to CEQA review.

9 37. RPI were irate by November 2017, irked that the County had not provided its
10 approval for the building permit for the courtyard, and let the County know it. If the County had
11 committed itself to a course of action by this point in time, RPI would not have been irate. The

12 County, however, concerned at that time that the "barn" and the entertainment courtyard
13 connected to the "barn". were clearly not intended for agricultural use and occupancy, advised

14 RPI that in order to receive County approval for the courtyard, RPI would first have to bring
15 every existing structure that had built illegally into compliance.

16 38. This did not go over well with RPI, so the County offered another alternative, a
17 Deed Use Restriction restricting use to agricultural use. Mr. George initially agreed to the deed
18 restriction, but then changed his mind and backtracked. So, no such deed restriction was signed
19 or recorded.

20 November 21, 2017 to the Present

21 39. Only a week later, however, on November 21, 2017, the County appeared to
22 mysteriously cave to RPIs demands, and issued the building permit for the courtyard attached to
23 the "barn". The definition of the Project again changes at this time to now include the significant
24 1 and new courtyard component that is attached to the "barn"*. ----.-

25 40. The issuance of this building permit on November 21, 2017 represented the
26 "tipping point," representing the earliest possible point in time at which Petitioners could be said
27 to have had either actual or constructive knowledge that the County would not require CEQA
28 review for the Project (as it was then known to exist). Only one week earlier, the County had

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14

1 held out the possibility to Petitioners that as a result of the on-going code enforcement process,

2 CEQA might in fact be ordered. The issuance of the November 21, 2017 building permit

3 indicated that the County would not require CEQA review or else it likely would not have issued

4 the building permit. Thus, even if Petitioners could be said that the Project (as it was then known

5 to exist) was stable and finite at some prior point in time (and Petitioners contend it was it not

6 stable and finite as of November 21, 2017), November 21, 2017 was the earliest point in time
7 that Petitioners could be said to have had constructive knowledge that the County had committed
8 itself to a particular course of action. That course of action was not to require CEQA review and

9 only as of November 21, 2017 was this necessary element of committing to a particular course of
10 conduct met.

11 41. Even as to the "stable and finite" element, the Project was still not stable and
12 finite. Taking the in the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that the County had
13 actual notice of the Project and its components as it was defined at that time from their site

14 inspection of the Properties, including the "barn", the lake, the dam, the parking lot, the sand
15 beach, the gazebo, the workshop, the greenhouse and the manufactured home, by issuing the
16 courtyard permits, instead of rejecting them, the County has engaged in piecemealing, and has
17 disclosed it committed itself to RPI's development of the whole Project without CEQA review of

18 the whole Project.

19 42. The County, by issuing the courtyard permits on November 21, 2017, the second
20 set of building permits for separate components of the Project (the "barn" and the attached
21 courtyard), has also disclosed that it is committing itself to the piecemealing of the Project, and
22 has acquiesced to RPI's development of the Project without CEQA review of the whole Project,
23 committing itself to the same. Petitioners have constructive notice of this new definition of the
24- Project as a whole by virtue of the public disclosure of the courtyard permits.
25 43. Had the County not approved the courtyard permits, throwing up the guardrails at
26 that point with the knowledge it had regarding the Project as a whole and what it contains, and it
27 instead conducted CEQA review of the Project as a whole, then Petitioners would not have had

28 to file this lawsuit.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 15

1 44. But until that point, Petitioners did not have either constructive notice of the

2 Project as a whole (since the definition substantially changed when the massive courtyard in all

3 its splendor was just added), nor did the County or RPI "disclose" its intention to "commit" to

4 the illegal piecemealing and development of the Project as a whole until it issued the courtyard

5 permits. By issuing those permits, the County disclosed and provided constructive notice to

6 Petitioners that it was committed to the illegal piecemealing of the Project, and the illegal

7 development of the whole of the Project without CEQA review, thus commencing the Project as

8 it was defined at that time.

9 45. However, throughout 2018 and 2019, the definition of the Project still changed,

10 and arguably, delayed the commencement of the Project and thus the limitations period even

11 longer.

12 The Changes to the Project Definition in 2018 Regarding Use and

13 Petitioner's Knowledge of the Same

14 46. In the summer and early fall of 2018, Petitioners had actual notice that the use of

15 the "barn" was not going to be for a traditional barn type uses, but for assembly use, contrary to

16 the assertions the County and RPI repeated ad nauseum throughout 2017 and into 2018. Around

17 this time, the County disclosed it had committed itself to the use of the barn as assembly use.

18 Previously, Petitioners had their suspicions, but the County and RPI insisted they were wrong

19 over and over. County documents obtained by Petitioners in March or April 2018 pursuant to a

20 California Public Records Act request belied the County and RPI's claim the use was

21 agricultural, but still the County and RPI maintained this front to Petitioners, until about the

22 summer of 2018.

23 47. RPI admitted that the "occupancy limit" for the "barn" was 400 persons in the

24 courtroom in the summer of 2018, and that they had obtained or will obtain an occupancy permit

25 indicating the same. RPI also admitted during this time frame that wedding parties were held at

26 the "barn".

27 48. Petitioners then obtained a letter in or about September 2018 from the County

28 after months of diligently seeking records from the Fire Department about the "barn". This letter

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

1 was dated August 17, 2017 from RPI to the Fire Department in which RPI unequivocally states

2 they will not use the "barn" as a barn. It will not store agricultural equipment, or animals, but it

3 will be used as listed on the plans, which indicate an event center. A true and correct copy of the

4 August 17, 2017 letter to the Fire Department from RPI is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit

5 D and incorporated by reference. This letter was not a part of the records Petitioners received in

6 the spring of 2018 pursuant to the Public Records Act request.

7 49. The building plans RPI submitted to the County for the "barn" and the courtyard

8 classify the actual use will be for an event center and/or banquet hall, a mixed Occupancy of "A-

9 2" assembly, and "U" utility. Petitioners learned this information as a result of and after a

10 obtaining the "barn is not a barn letter" described in paragraph 42, which referenced the use of

11 the "barn" as those consistent with those described in the plans.

12 50. Although Petitioners had their suspicions in the summer and fall of 2017 that the

13 "barn" and the Project as defined at that time were not built or used for agricultural purposes,

14 they did not have constructive notice of the intended - use - facts that would lead them to know or

15 learn that the use was for assembly - in part because the County and RPI actively concealed

16 these facts from Petitioners until 2018, and denied them repeatedly. (See, Ex. C.. County email
17 correspondence dated July 11, 2017 and November 14, 2017 claiming the "barn" is "legal land

18 use wise".)

19 51. When Petitioners tried to learn of the facts supporting the same on or about

20 November 5, 2017 by attempting to capture drone footage of the structures, their attempts were

21 literally shot down by RPI.

22 52. The County admitted on at least two occasions that if the use of the "barn"

23 changes (to a non-agricultural use), then CEQA would be needed to obtain the required
conditional use permits. (See, Ex. C and Ex. F, transcript of August 16, 2018 hearing.)

25 53. The use of barn changed as of 2018, the County and RPI did not disclose to the

26 public or Petitioners that they committed themselves to assembly use of the "barn" until 2018,

27 and Petitioners did not have constructive knowledge until 2018 (and within 180 days of the filing

28 of the original Petition on May 18, 2018) of the changed use of the "barn" to assembly use, not

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17

agricultural. On or about April 9, 2019, the County adopted an amendment to Title 17 of the

2 Alameda County Municipal Ordinance Code that allows agri-tourism and the production of beer
in Zone A district properties like RPI's. While facially this amendment appears to have been

4 approved for the overall benefit of the general population of Alameda County, in truth, this

5 amendment was not only promoted by RPI, the amendment was drafted in part by RPI, for the

6 benefit of RPI, and is an integral part of the Project, and Petitioners learned of this the night

7 before the filing of this Petition. From inception in 2013, RPI have been more than just

8 instrumental in pushing for the amendment. RPI's lawyers drafted portions of the amendment,

9 which portions, per the County, were approved by the County. In fact, RPI requested a final
10 draft of the amendment so he could have his lawyers have one more crack at it just to make sure
11 it was "safe". County counsel allegedly advised against providing RPI and his lawyers with the
12 final draft. Meanwhile, RPI have publicly declared in the various meetings and in emails to the

13 County that he has absolutely no interest in the brewery ordinance (that he helped draft) and will

14 never open a brewery on the Properties, all the while communicating with the County about the

15 status of the amendment, the contents of the amendment, and the opponents to the amendment up
16 to and including 2018 and 2019. This is further evidence that the Project was still not stable and

17 finite, as another major component has been added, and that Petitioners did not have constructive

18 notice that the amendment was part of the Project until July 18, 2019, when it discovered RPI's

19 deep involvement in the amendment process (contrary to his public statements) in order to allow

20 RPI to again attempt to side track the CEQA process and have their brewery as a matter of right

21 without having to go through the CEQA process, making it an instrumental component of the

22 Project as a whole. A brewery under this amendment does not require the owner to obtain a

23 conditional use permit, a variance or other permit to open and develop a commercial brewery.
This Ordinance was heavily sponsored, promoted, and even written by RPI, with RPI only in
25 mind, and the County knew it. Petitioners, however, did not have constructive notice that it was

26 a part of the Project until July 18, 2019.

27

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18

The Commencement of the "Permitted Project" and the Discretionary Permit Approvals

2 as the Basis for the 180 day Limitations Periods

3 54. As of November 21, 2017, the County had Permitted and approved two separate
4 components of the Project, the "barn" and the "courtyard", and was setting itself up for more.

5 55. The courtyard permit requires that RPI must bring every other structure built

6 illegally into compliance. (Ex. A.) According to this permit, RPI will have to submit permit
7 applications for every structure built without permits (which is all but the "barn") in order to

8 bring them into compliance, amounting to even more potential for piecemealing and avoidance

9 of CEQA review of the whole Project.

10 56. This sequence of continuing piecemealing, in fact, has already begun. On or

11 about November 15, 2018, RPI submitted "corrective" permits for some of the undisclosed

12 structures they built, including the 6000 square foot workshop, the greenhouse, and the gazebo.
13 Also submitted in 2018 or 2019 were the applications for permits for the new driveway, the 2400
14 feet long water line, the 500 foot gas line, and the "inground spa".

15 57. None of these recent permit applications have been approved or denied by the

16 County as of the date of the filing of this Petition.

17 58. The following is a list of the permits the County issued (without any CEQA
18 review) between 2014 and the present, representing the portions of the Project that have been

19 "piecemealed" to date:

20 a. BLD2014-02024 of August 29, 2014 -- construction of eight feet high retaining
21 walls and site drainage system "per approved plans" for the 12,000 square foot event
22 center or "ag barn";

23 b. BLD2014-02739 of February 6, 2015 - foundation permit for the 12,000 square

24 foot event center or "barn";

25 C. BLD2014-01654 of November 5, 2015 - construction of the 12,000 square foot
26 event center or "barn" (renewed by BLD2017-03666 on November 8, 2017)

27 d. BLD2017-02969 of November 21, 2017 - construction for the courtyard

28 connected to the event center (renewed on January 4, 2019)

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19

1 e. BLD2018-01508 of May 8, 2018 - gas line installation to the courtyard

2 f. BLD2018-01949 of June 15, 2018 - waterline installation from well to "barn"

3 storage tank

4 g. BLD2018-03182 of September 27, 2018 - supplemental permit to BLD2018-

5 01949 for additional 2,400 feet of waterline from well to "barn" storage tank.

6 59. On or about November 15, 2018, the County and RPI applied for and/or opened
7 the following new permits for the Properties:

8 h. BLD2018-03850 - legalize pre-fab 6,000 square foot metal shop building, and

9 323 square foot gazebo;
10 i. BLD2018-03851 agricultural exemption for the 2,880 square foot greenhouse,
1.1 which has been "routed for departmental approvals";
12 j. SAM2014-00001 extension of private driveway to future on-site building
13 (access road or driveway); and
14 k. BLD2019-01748 - a "new in ground spa". (d through k, collectively defined as,
15 "the Permitted Project", being all permits issucd by the County after November 21,
16 2017, and thus not including any of the "undisclosed" or unpermitted work either.)

17 60. The County has not, however, issued any approvals, permits, or made any
18 findings with respect to the Permitted Project as a whole, but such approval, permit, or findings

19 would be a discretionary decision.

20 61. The definition of the Permitted Project has changed over time with each new

21 application submitted by RPI and/or issued by the County related to the development of the
22 Properties by RPI, and may continue to change each time RPI applies for or the County issues a
23 new permit for a new and significant component of the Permitted Project. The definition of the
-24-1 Permitted Project will likely grow to include the sub-projects for which RPI must obtain the

25 "corrective permits", but for which RPI have not yet applied, such as the lake, dam, watercourse

26 alteration, beach, graveled road, manufactured home, and parking lot.

27 62. Although the County has mischaracterized the building permits issued for the

28 Permitted Project as ministerial, the level of discretion actually exercised and authorized by the

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 20

1 County in determining the approvals and any conditions attached thereto meet the definition of
2 discretionary approvals under CEQA.

3 63. The statute of limitations applicable to the Permitted Project as a whole is 180

4 days after commencement of the Permitted Project as a whole, under Title 14 of the California

5 Code of Regulations section 15112(c)(5)(B) and California Public Resources Code § 21167(d),

6 where the County has not made any formal approval of the Permitted Project as a whole.

7 64. The "commencement of the project" is when (1) a public agency or private entity

8 has disclosed that it has committed itself (commencement) to an action that is stable, finite and

9 capable of being defined with accuracy (project), (2) the action may cause either a direct physical
10 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

11 environment (project subject to CEQA) and (3) the petitioner or the public is on constructive

12 notice of both the proposed action and its possible effect on the environment." (Id.)

13 65. The commencement of the Permitted Project as a whole began, at the earliest, on

14 or about November 21, 2017, and within 180 days before the filing of the original Petition on

15 May 18, 2018.

16 66. In the alternative, the statute of limitations for the various sub-parts of the

17 Permitted Project is 180 days from the approval of each sub-project, all of which have occurred

18 within 180 days of the filing of the original Petition.

19 The County's Abuse of Discretion regarding

20 CEQA and the Project and/or the Permitted Project

21 67. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a
22 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion

23 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,

24 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair. Failure to exercise

25 discretion is itself an abuse of discretion. (June 21, 2019 Tentative Order, citing Ashburn v. AIG

26 Financial Advisors, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 79, 97.)

27

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 21

68. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the

2 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals

3 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful.
69. The County also abused its discretion when it failed to exercise its discretion and

5 conduct any review or reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with

6 respect to the Project as a whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early
as July 2014 that CEQA was required, and that discretionary approvals were going to be

8 required.

9 70. The County did not hold any public hearings, or post any public notices,

10 regarding CEQA and the Project, CEQA and the Permitted Project, or any component of the
11 Project or the Permitted Project, including but not limited to, notice(s) of exemption(s) from

12 CEQA.

13 71. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any

14 actions, uses, or permits for the Properties described herein without complying with CEQA,

15 including compliance with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent

16 to only approve actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a

17 whole, or, in the alternative, mandating Respondent only approve further actions or permits on

18 the Properties that consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to
19 comply with CEQA, including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project

20 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project

21 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061),

22 an initial study of the Project and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the a

23 preparation of either an environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project

24 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole.

25 72. Petitioners also a seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,

26 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made
27 by the County regarding the any part of the Project, and/or the Permitted Project, including the

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

1 rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any decisions regarding

2 exemption from CEQA.

3 II. PARTIES

4 73. Petitioner MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY is a neighborhood political

5 advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of the environment, protection and

6 enhancement of park access, and the construction of a network of bicycle and pedestrian trails in

7 southern Alameda County near Fremont, California, including the area in which the Project and

8 the Permitted Project are located in Vargas Plateau.

9 74. Petitioner KELLY ABREAU is an individual and is now, and at all times

10 mentioned in this Petition was a resident of Fremont in Alameda County.

11 75. Respondent County of Alameda is a government entity located in the State of

12 California.

13 76. Petitioners are persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts,

14 decisions, and omissions of Respondent as alleged in this Petition. Petitioners have fundamental

15 vested rights and interests which are adversely effected by the acts, decisions, and omissions of

16 Respondent. Unmitigated, significant and damaging environmental effects associated with the

17 Project and/or the Permitted Project, and the effects will adversely impact the Petitioners as well

18 as the public generally.

19 77. Respondent is charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law

20 including CEQA, and their own local ordinances and codes including those that regulate zoning.

21 The Board of Supervisors is the duly constituted legislative body, and highest administrative

22 body in the County. The Board is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things, that all

23 applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and implemented. The
24 Respondent, through the Board of Supervisors, Community Development Agency, Planning

25 Department, Building Inspection Department, Fire Department, Department of Environmental

26 Health, and Public Works Agency, has failed to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project
27 and/or the Permitted Project. The Respondent has also failed to comply with its own regulations

28 and duties with respect to zoning.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23

1 78. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and

2 the owners of the Properties, and are the proponents of the Project and/or the Permitted Project,

3 and any and all portions thereof.

79. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein

5 as 1 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 20 through

6 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues these Respondents and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious

7 names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend the Petition, if necessary, to allege the true names

8 and capacities when ascertained.

9 80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material

10 hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the

11 other Respondent herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and

12 scope of the agencies and the employment and with the permission and consent of Respondent.

13 III. JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION

14 OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15 81. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1085 of the California

16 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.

17 82. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and 305 of the California Code

18 of Civil Procedure as the county in which the real properties in dispute are located and as a

19 county in which Respondent and RPI reside.

20 83. Petitioners haves complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

21 Code section 21167.5 by sending a Notice of Commencement ("Notice") of this action to

22 Respondent prior to filing the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018. A

23 true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein by

24 this reference.

25 84. Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA as described herein constitute

26 prejudicial abuses of discretion. As alleged in this Petition, Respondent failed to proceed in the

27 manner required by law, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported

28 by substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24

1 with members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondent's violations of

2 CEQA.

3 85. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

4 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

5 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018 to the State Attorney

6 General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the original Petition for Writ of Mandate and

7 Notice of Commencement of Action on the Attorney General, and a true and correct copy of the

8 Service of this Petition, is attached hereto as Exhibit G, respectively, and incorporated herein by

9 this reference.

10 86. California Public Resources Code § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies

11 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain a CEQA action does not apply to

12 Petitioners in accordance with subsection (e), which states, "This section does not apply to any

13 alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or

14 other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to

15 the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

16 (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued

17 any public notice regarding CEQA review of the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or any

18 portion thereof.

19 IV. STANDING

20 87. Petitioners have standing as parties beneficially interested in the issuance of the

21 requested writ of mandate because the Project and/or the Permitted Project, as alleged more
22 specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the individuals

23 named herein as well as the general public.

24 88. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all their legat

25 duties as alleged in this Petition. Further, issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will

26 confer significant benefits on the general public by requiring Respondent to carry out their duties

27 under CEQA. Issuance of the relief requested will also result in the enforcement of important

28 rights affecting the public interest by compelling the County to engage in a fair, a objective, and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25

1 legally adequate analysis of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, and ensure that the public

2 has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the impacts of the same.

89. The significant adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to,

4 increased traffic and safety issues, habitat and waterway destruction, agricultural land

5 destruction, increased sewage and refuse, and the exploitation of, and harm to, groundwater

6 resources.

V. CEOA REQUIREMENTS

8 90. Respondent is subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project
that may have a significant effect on the environment. The Project and the Permitted Project are

10 a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that they are "an activity which may cause

11 either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

12 change in the environment". and which is "[a]n activity that involves the issuance to a person of

13 a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies."

14 (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)

15 91. CEQA requires Respondent to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of

16 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that

17 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

18 significant adverse environmental impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen

19 such impacts.

20 92. CEQA also requires Respondent to evaluate the environmental impacts of "the

21 whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondent

22 must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the Project

23 and/or the Permitted Project, and cannot separate Project or the Permitted Project into its

24 separate and smaller components such that each individual component has a lesser environmentall

25 impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of these projects as a whole.

26 93. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent, knew as

27 early as July 2014 that the "barn" was one part of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, yet

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 26

1 Respondent impermissibly issued separate discretionary approvals for individual components of

2 the Project and/or the Permitted Project without any CEQA review of these a whole.

3 94. Had Respondent performed an initial CEQA review of the whole of the Project

4 and/or the Permitted Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion

5 that replacing a barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard,

6 expanding a cattle pond into a lake stocked with unknown species of fish, with an artificial

7 white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse to create the lake, grading the

8 former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and erecting a barn with a

9 brewery or a workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would
10 create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more than sufficient to

11 trigger CEQA compliance and a report on the same.

12 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent has

13 determined that exemptions apply individually to each and/or some of the components of the

14 Project and/or the Permitted Project, or that the approvals were all ministerial approvals, versus
15| determining whether any cxemption applies to the Project or the Permitted Project as a whole.

16 Exemptions to CEQA, however, do not apply to the Project or to the Permitted Project.

17 96. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County

18 determined the individual components, or some of them, that make up the Project are exempt

1.9 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:

20 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of

21 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

22 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose

23 and capacity as the structure replaced."
California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor public or private

25 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve

26 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural

27 purposes."

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 27

California Code of Regulations § 15303 - Class 3 "construction and location of
limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new
equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small
structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in

5 the exterior of the structure."

6 97. The "barn" and the courtyard, although placed on the same space where the old

7 barn was located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure

8 replaced." (California Code of Regulations § 15302.) §

9 98. The lake, the dam, the parking lot, the driveway or access road which extends
10 thousands of feet southeast, a more than one-half mile long water line, and the beach are not

11 "minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do

12 not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes."

13 (California Code of Regulations § 15304.)

14 99. The gazebo, the manufactured home, and the 6800 square foot barn are not

15 "limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations §

16 15303.)

17 100. Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.

18 California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:

19 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the

20 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is

21 significant.

22 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where

23 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

24 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §

25 15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

26 101. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

27 apply to the Project, or the Permitted Project, or to any components thereof, these exceptions to

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 28

1 the exemptions preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review

2 and reporting.

3 102. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under

4 CEQA apply to the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or to any components thereof, and

5 challenge any and all of Respondent's findings to the contrary.

6 VI. THE ALTERATIONS MADE TO THE PROPERTIES

7 103. The Properties sit upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the hills of

8 Sunol east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay Regional

9 Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and seasonal

10 cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small residential

11 home. The road leading up to the Properties, Morrison Canyon Road, is a narrow and hazardous

12 road. Petitioners have complained to the city and the park district about the dangerous condition

13 of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from The Properties.

14 104. When RPI began to transform the Properties into the resort-like recreation center,

15 they kept it secret from the County. RPI did not seek or obtain any County approvals or permits

16 at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot, the

17 brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo, the manufactured home, or the other 6,800 square foot

18 workshop. The only approvals RPI sought from the County before the filing of the original

19 Petition, were related to the "barn" and the courtyard.

20 105. Building plans for the "barn" describe a 12,000 square foot multi-story event

21 center with a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and

22 cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic system, restrooms with disability access, an

23 elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable for large gatherings of people, a fire sprinkler

24 system, a groundwater treatment system for the production of beer and wine, two walk-in

25 refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels of wine, class IV heavy-frame timber

26 suitable for an entertainment facility that can accommodate large groups of people.

27 106. The "ag barn", however, houses no animals, no farm equipment, and is not being

28 used a barn per RPI. (See, Ex. D.) The 3,000 sq ft barn that the RPI demolished, and replaced

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 29

1 with a much larger structure, was more than a half-century old. The old barn had a traditional

2 appearance and typical size.

3 107. The cattle stock pond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

4 the white sand beach and a large gazebo with a masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading

5 to the stock pond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam.

6 108. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn," the lake and the main gate of
the Properties was graded and excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars,

8 and displaced approximately 1,200 cubic yards of earth. Petitioners are informed and believe
and thereon allege, that just recently, in the summer of 2018, RPI began construction of a new

10 road. Petitioners do not know at this time to where the road is going, or why it is being built, but

11 it is thousands of feet long, graveled, raised, landscaped, and allows for water run-off to lead to

12 the watercourse that dumps into the lake.

13 109. The 6,800 square foot workshop is not a barn in structure or use, and Petitioners

14 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,|

15 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George

16 announced and advertised that beer labeled "Sunol Ridge" had been produced at Properties as of

17 2013-2015.

18 110. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the courtyard with its

19 fireplace, outdoor kitchen, and 13-foot high retaining walls is connected to the "barn", and was

20 built at or around the same time construction began on the "barn", although Petitioners were not
21 aware of that at the time. The lakefront waterfall feature is also listed on the November 21, 2017

22 permit. In 2019, RPI submitted an application for an "inground spa".

23 111. All in all, RPI are transforming the formerly traditional ranch and farm property
24._ into a large resort-style entertainment .and event facility, all done without any CEQA review.-.-

25 112. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and

26 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016
27 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 30

1 park located next to (west of) the Properties and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas

2 Rd.

3 113. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,

4 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what

5 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in

6 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which

7 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and

8 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from

o I approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp

10 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for

11 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these

12 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,

13 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George V.

14 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

15 114. The George Petition alleged in part:

16 *4. In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

17 (A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along

18 Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and

19 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of

20 the Park to the public in summer 2008.

21 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse

22 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison

23 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,

24 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.

25 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger

26 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the

27 Park to the public in summer 2008.

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 31

1 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon

2 Road and instead relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to

3 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use

4 Plan.

5 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified

6 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County

7 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.

8 (F) Failing to adopt monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation

9 measures.

10 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning
11 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to

12 accommodate additional traffic."

13 115. The George Petition also complained that EBRPD had intended to construct a

14 parking lot at the Regional Park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.

15 116. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached

16 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon
17 Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit a

18 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of
19 Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

20 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called

21 for more road improvements.

22 117. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to

23 Morrison Canyon Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted
to $300,000-$400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road

25 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

26 118. RPI also have constructed a parking lot on the Properties which may

27 accommodate up to 100 cars, and this is four times the limit on the number of spaces that Mr.

28 George insisted on for the EBRPD lot.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 32

1 119. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege RPI have hosted events at

2 the Properties with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

3 120. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain

4 substandard, as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the

5 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the Project and/or the Permitted

6 Project is not required when The Properties are essentially a park, resort, event facility, brewery

7 and/or winery that is comparable in area and has as many peak hourly visitors, if not more, than

8 the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for the very same concerns alleged in this

9 Petition. (The Properties have 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately
10 1200 acres.) In other words, the Regional Park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr.

11 George's own "park" is not.

12 VII. THE COUNTY'S DISCRETIONARY APPROVALS

1.3 AND THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION

14 121. Although the County has not issued any approvals, discretionary or otherwise,
15 with respect to the Project as a whole or the Permitted Project as a whole, the County did issue
16 discretionary approvals with respect to certain individual components of the same, including but

17 not limited to the "barn" and the courtyard. The County issued permit number BLD2014-02739

18 for the foundation of the 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-l

19 01654 for the construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued

20 permit number BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls. No other

21 applications for permits (other than renewals for these permits) were submitted or other permits

22 issued until November 21, 2017 for the courtyard.

23 122. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic

24 investigation arising out of the 2014 -2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the

25 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles", or "barn", were fast-tracked and avoided CEQA

26 a review in a highly irregular manner. Prior to their issuance, the County Planning Department

27 wrote the following assessment in an email communication dated July 14, 2014: "Please do not

28 issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does require CEQA and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 33

1 rezoning." (Ex. B.) Regardless of this directive, Respondent issued the permits for the "barn"

2 just a few months later, without any CEQA review.

3 123. In or around 2016, Petitioners began complaining to the County about the "barn"
4 only. Not the Project as a whole, or any other component of the Project, not the Permitted

5 Project or any component of the Permitted Project, just the "barn". At that time, the "barn" was
the "project", and the only component of what eventually evolves into the Project as a whole

7 defined herein.

8 124. For about a year, Petitioners do not hear a word from the County regarding their
complaints about the "barn". Finally, in or around summer or fall of 2017, after Petitioners

10 complained to the County about the barn and other components of the Project that they had

11 learned of that summer, the County engaged in a code and enforcement action that reinforced, or

12 should have reinforced, what it had known as of 2014that the "barn" is no barn, but an event

13 center that is "part of a much larger project that does require CEQA and rezoning."

14 125. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,

15 2017 internal email, "it a came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of

16 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else a than a barn, SO we sent a letter

17 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It

18 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself

19 was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back and

20 forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an

21 existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."

22 126. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County's decision

23 to exempt the "barn" from CEQA, its zoning approval for the building permit for the "barn", and

24 the approval of the building permit itself, were discretionary actions that required the exercise of

25 personal judgment and deliberation. The discretionary actions would have had the ability to

26 mitigate environmental damage, in that the County admitted it knew the "barn" "was clearly

27 being planned to be something other than a barn" (personal judgment), admitted it "went back

28 and forth on CEQA" (deliberation) and "ultimately determined", (personal judgment and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 34

deliberation), that the "barn" was exempt from CEQA. During the latter half of 2018, for at least
five months, the County was deeply involved in deliberations regarding the "barn" and whether
3 to approve it, contrary to statements the County has made under penalty of perjury in this case.
4 The County did much more than just check the boxes on the building permit application. They
5 even accepted, after much deliberation, a CEQA "report" on the "barn" allegedly prepared by
6 RPI's own private environmental consultant, when they knew it was a part of much larger
7 project. In fact, the agricultural exemption was denied at first.
8 127. The County did not simply determine whether zoning allowed the "barn" to be

9 built in the requested location, it also exercised personal judgment and deliberation in
10 determining whether or not the "barn" was in fact a barn, if it was going to be actually used as a
11 barn, what conditions, if any, should be attached to the County's approval of it, and finally,
12 whether or not it should be approved. The County used its personal judgment as to the wisdom
13 and/or manner of carrying out this subsidiary "barn" project, and County emails from this time
14 frame offer abundant evidence of the same.

15 128. Just because the County did not make any effort to mitigate the potential
16 environmental damage, does not imply or demonstrate that they did not have the authority or
17 discretion to do so. If the County had made the correct determination that the "barn" is not a
18 barn and was not going to be used as a barn, the approvals as they are would not have issued.
19 RPI would have had to obtain conditional use permit prior to construction, a zoning variance
20 and/or adjustment, each of which would require CEQA review and discretionary approvals as
21 Respondent has admitted.

22 129. Approximately three years after the first permit was issued for the "barn," RPI
23 sought County approval to construct the entertainment courtyard, literally attached to the event
24 center. At the same time, however, on or about August-17, 2017, RPI-wrote-a letter-to the-
25 County in which they admitted that the "barn is not to be used as a traditional barn" "no animals
26 nor equipment nor stables [sic] housed in this barn", but RPI intend to use the "barn" "as
27 indicated on the plans submitted to you and the county." (Ex. D.) The plans submitted to the
28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 35

1 County indicate that the actual intended use for the 12,000 square foot structure is for a banquet

2 hall with assembly occupancy.

3 130. During this time frame, while RPI were actively seeking County approval for the

4 building permit for the entertainment courtyard, the County had also opened a code enforcement

5 investigation, likely because of Petitioners complaints. RPI regularly relied on Shawn Wilson,

6 Chief of Staff to County Supervisor Bob Haggerty, as their point man in communications with

*7 the County.

8 131. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Mr. Wilson exercised
undue political influence to demand the staff of the County issue the required building permits.
10 Mr. Wilson sent dozens if not hundreds of emails to the County on behalf of RPI as a part of the

1.1. endeavor to exert influence, and it ultimately worked. The County approved the courtyard, but
12 not before exercising its discretion over the course of several months in determining whether or

13 not to provide it, and under what conditions.

14 132. Mr. Lopez, on July 11, 2017, wrote to Rodrigo Orduna in the Planning

15 Department: "Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show a

16 mini beach has been created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not

17 clear which structures are legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and

18 others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous

19 stock pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we

20 never authorized that work, and CEQA probably wasn't done. So would start by digging out the

21 old file, see what was approved and what was already existing, and then compare that with what

22 is built today. Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting complaints, try and get

23 access to the site, which is remote." (Ex. C.)

24 133. Four months later, after the site visit to the Properties, Mr. Orduna wrote: "We

25 are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not designed to

26 be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and

27 construction, adjacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See attached pictures taken

28 this past Friday.) This begs the question, if used currently as an accessory entertainment building

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 36

for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum floor area for the residential buildings
and residential accessory buildings applies. I understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be

3 at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor
area, the property would likely be over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for

5 residential and residential accessory buildings, per ECA. We are trying to get the other County

6 departments and with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to see about the adjacent

7 property, at 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned|

8 by Christopher George, to see about the beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after

9 months being told that it would soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of
10 the pond (I can't tell its size)." (Ex. E.)

11 134. a An hour and a half later on the same day, Planning Director Lopez wrote to Mr.
12 Wilson, indicating the County knew the "barn" was being built for assembly and not agricultural

13 purposes: "We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the various activities on

14 the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some kind of assembly use,
15 event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily have to look at everything
16 given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our normal
17 process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to learn more about his

18 plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local ordinances." (Ex. E.)

19 135. In an email to Petitioner MPC on November 14, 2017, Planning Director Lopez
20 writes: "the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the
21 property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner"..

22 "[B]ased on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being

23 looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to
-*** -2-4 discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an

25 ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all

26 the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.". .. "[NJo discretionary permits
27 have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement
28 process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 37

1 concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their

2 response." (Ex. C.) The use, however, has changed - from agriculture to event center • and

3 CEQA is required.

4 136. RPI were irate by November 2017, irked that the County had not provided its

5 approval for the building permit for the courtyard, and let the County know it. The County,

6 however, was concerned that the "barn" and the entertainment courtyard connected to the "barn".

7 were clearly not intended for agricultural use and occupancy. The County advised RPI that in:

8 order to receive County approval for the courtyard, RPI would have to bring every existing

9 structure that had built illegally into compliance.

10 137. This did not go over well with RPI, so the County offered another alternative, a

11 Deed Use Restriction restricting use to agricultural use. Mr. George initially agreed to the deed

12 restriction, but then changed his mind and backtracked. So, no such deed restriction was signed

13 or recorded.

14 138. The County, however, once again made the wrong determination that the "barn"

15 is really going to be used as a barn, and concluded the courtyard attached thereto is really going

16 to be used for agriculture, once again avoiding CEQA review of anything.

17 VIII. CAUSES OF ACTION

18 First Cause of Action

19 Writ of Mandate - CEQA Violations

20 (Against Respondent)

21 139. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

22 paragraphs 1 through 138 as though fully stated herein.

23 140. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental analysis at
tany time of the Project as a whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as

25 early as July 2014 that the "barn" was a part of a much larger project that required CEQA,

26 rezoning and discretionary approvals.

27 141. Respondent also violated CEQA by piecemealing the Project and/or the Permitted

28 Project into separate sub-projects and approving each sub-project individually in order to avoid

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 38

1 complying with CEQA, and by exempting the "barn" and/or any other structure from CEQA

2 review, when it knew as early as July 2014 that the "barn" was a part of a much larger project

3 that required CEQA, rezoning, and discretionary approvals.

4 142. Respondent also violated CEQA by approving the discretionary permits for
5 I construction of the "barn" and the courtyard, and approving them as to zoning, based on false

6 claims of agricultural use, and contrary to all the evidence. Respondent has admitted that if the

7 uses changes from agriculture, then CEQA will be required. The use has changed, the County

8 knows it, and CEQA is required.

9 143. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a

10 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion
11 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,
12 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

13 144. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the

14 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals

15 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful.

16 145. The County abused its discretion when it failed to conduct any review or

17 reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with respect to the Project as

18 whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early as July 2014 that CEQA

19 was required, and that discretionary approvals were required.

20 146. The County abused its discretion when it determined that exemptions apply
21 individually to a portion of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, or that the approvals were all

22 ministerial approvals, versus determining whether any exemption applies to the Project or the

23 Permitted Project as a whole.

2 147. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any
25 actions, uses, or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance
26 with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve

27 actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, or, in the

28 alternative, mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 39

1 consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA,
2 including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted
3 a Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted

4 Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the

5 Project and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an

6 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

7 a as a whole.

8 148. Petitioners also seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,

9 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made
1.0 by the County regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project,
11 including the rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any approvals
12 regarding exemption from CEQA.

13 149. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil

14 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
15 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
16 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.
17 Second Cause of Action

18 Public Nuisance

19 (Against Respondent and RPI)

20 150. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

21 paragraphs 1 through 149 as though fully stated herein.

22 151. Respondent, by abusing its discretionary authorities as described herein, has

23 created dangerous conditions on the Properties and to the surrounding area, including, but not

-24 limited to, Morrison Canyon Road, that are probable and immiment. RPI, as the proponent of

25 the Project and/or the Permitted Project, has also created the dangerous conditions on the

26 Properties and the surrounding area, and has admitted the existence of such dangerous conditions
27 by virtue of his own lawsuit against the East Bay Regional Parks District regarding Vargas

28 Plateau Regional Park adjacent to the Properties.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 40

1 152. These dangerous conditions, include, but are not limited to, dangerous traffic and

2 road safety conditions, harm to underground aquifers and streams near the Properties through

3 excess sewage and waste, harm to the riparian habitat and wildlife at or near the Properties,

4 including the next door East Bay Regional Park, and potential fire hazards in a high risk fire

5 zone.

6 153. These dangerous conditions affect the public at large, especially considering the

*7 Vargas Plateau East Bay Regional Park is located right next to the Properties, and those who use

8 the park, access it via Morrison Canyon Road.

9 154. These dangerous conditions create an imminent and probable danger such that
10 RPI have hosted and will continue to host large events with hundreds of people and vehicles
11 using Morrison Canyon Road despite the fact RPI do not have the requisite permits to host such

12 events. While such permits are required by the County to host such events, RPI have flagrantly
13 disobeyed this requirement as alleged herein, and Petitioners are informed and believe and

14 thereon allege that RPI will continue to host large events and continue to build unabated at the

15 Properties regardless of whether they have the proper permits.

16 155. These dangerous conditions are those by which an ordinary person would be

17 reasonably annoyed or disturbed, not only because of the danger itself, but because the illegal

18 construction on the Properties has created the dangerous conditions, as well as the corrupt

19 manner in which they were allowed to be constructed.

20 156. The extent of the construction and the seriousness of the dangers, as described in
21 this Petition, outweighs the social utility of Respondent and RPI's illegal conduct and

22 construction, of which social utility there is none.

23 157. Petitioners have not consented to the Respondent's or RPI's conduct.

-2-4 158. Petitioners have suffered harm that was different from the type of harm suffered

25 by the general public. Petitioner's suffered special injury as a result of respondent's public

26 nuisance in that at a public meeting on a May 1, 2019 a female agent, representative and/or

27 employee of RPI Christopher George destroyed personal property consisting of posters prepared

28 by and paid for by petitioner MPC and physically assaulted MPC member Laurence Edelson, for

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 41

which assault a police report was made, and a second male agent, representative and/or employee

2 of respondent Christopher George destroyed additional personal property consisting of additional

3 posters prepared by and paid for by petitioner MPC. The public meeting was to address the

4 closure of a portion of Morrison Canyon Road for public safety and environmental reasons and

5 the posters depicted a photograph of the "Versailles Barn, the letter signed by respondent George

6 to the effect that the alleged "barn" would not be used to store agricultural equipment, house
7 animals or contain stables, the LLC registration by respondent George related to beer and a

8 a brewery, comments from a Fremont City Council meeting and/or public officials regarding the
narrow and dangerous condition of Morrison Canyon Road and a newspaper article regarding the

10 above-described issues.

11 159. But for MPC's core mission and direct involvement in the issues that are the

12 subject of the public nuisance, petitioner MPC would not have suffered the aforementioned

13 destruction of personal property and physical assault on one if its members.

14 160. Respondent's a and RPI's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Petitioners

15 harm, such that the County and RPI, through their actions and inaction as described herein,

16 created the dangerous conditions on the Properties.

17 Third Cause of Action

18 Declaratory Relief

19 (Against Respondent)

20 161. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

21 paragraphs 1 through 160 as though fully stated herein.

22 162. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondent

23 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondent denies, the

-24 following:

25 a. That the Project as a whole and/or the Permitted Project as a whole require CEQA
26 review;

27 b. That the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or portions thereof are not exempt

28 from CEQA;

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 42

1 C. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.

• 2 163. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
3 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the Project and/or the
4 Permitted Project.

5 164. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that
6 Petitioners and Respondent may ascertain Respondent's obligations under CEQA with respect to
7 the Project and/or the Permitted Project and Petitioners' rights.

8 Fourth Cause of Action

9 Injunctive Relief

10 (Against Respondent)

11 165. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
12 1 paragraphs 1 through 150 as though fully stated herein.

13 166. Respondent has unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the Permitted

14 Project and portions of the Project in violation of CEQA, and have failed to conduct CEQA
15 review of the Project or the Permitted Project as a whole, when the County knows it is required.
16 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined that
17 portions of the Project or the Permitted Project are exempt from CEQA.
18 167. Unauthorized construction and use is ongoing at the Properties. Petitioners are
19 informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large events
20 continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.
21 168. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as
22 weddings, have been and continue to be held at the Properties even though RPI do not have the
23 proper permits.

2.4- 169.--Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the
25 environment already and in the future as a result of the Project and/or the Permitted Project
26 and/or portions thereof, as well as the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless
27 the County and RPI are ordered to halt construction and all approvals pending a judgment by this
28 Court that CEQA review and reporting is required for the entire Project and/or Permitted Project.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 43

1 170. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondent and RPI refrain from the
2 conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondent failed and refused the
3 requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue construction, and continue

4 to authorize construction and impermissible uses of the Properties.

5 171. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain

6 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration

7 and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of

8 Morrison Canyon Road. It will be impossible for Petitioners to obtain adequate relief by way of

9 money damages, and therefore, is without an adequate remedy at law.
10 172. Petitioners seek temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and
11 preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining RPI and Respondent, their agents, employees,
12 officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, order or

13 delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction or
14 development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring any large
15 gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the "agricultural barn" or
16 on other portions of the Properties, or taking any other action to implement in any way the
17 Properties and any portion thereof pending judgment of this Court and/or compliance with
18 CEQA.

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request judgment against Respondent as follows:
20 1. For a writ of mandate (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any actions, uses,
21 or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance with CEQA's
22 prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve actions, use, or
23 permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, or, in the alternative,

24 mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that consider the
25 Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA, including,
26 but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted Project as
27 a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted Project as a

28 whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project

1 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an

2 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

3 as a whole.

4 2. For a writ of mandate ordering the County to vacate, set aside, rescind, and void

5 all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made by the County

6 regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project, including the
7 rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any approvals regarding

8 exemption from CEQA.

9 3. A judgment declaring that a fundamental vested right of the Petitioners is
10 adversely affected.

11 4. For a temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
12 permanent injunctions restraining RPI and Respondent, their agents, employees, officers, and
13 representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, order or delivery of
14 construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction, development or use
15 approvals or permits, allowing or sponsoring any large gatherings or assemblies whether for
16 public use or private enjoyment in the "agricultural barn" or on other portions of the Properties,
17 or taking any other action to implement in any way the Project and/or the Permitted Project, or
18 any portion thereof, pending judgment by this Court and/or compliance with CEQA;

(gacal
I'lI be in Oakland for a good chunk of the day, so I'll give you quick summary here. Jana worked on this as one of her last big projects, Chris George was the applicant - it came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so We sent a letter saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send

code enforcement. It was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself was permitted by BID and we signed off on it. We went back and forth on the CHQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA. There was some talk of a possible brewery which is probably why D1 has been pushing for the ordinance to allow it. As of now, I have not heard of any reason to believe there is a brewery going on out there, but maybe there is. The interference of D1 was the subject of a grand jury report from 2015 I believe, so you can go back and read that if you want to.

Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show a mini beach has been created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not clear which structures are legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with

CEQA probably wasn't done, the disruption of a previous stock pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we never authorized that work, and

So I would start by digging out the old file, soe what was approved and what was already existing, and then compare that with what is built today. Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting complaints, try and get aocess to the site, which is remote. Access from Morrison Canyon is shared by EBRPD/Vargas Plateau which is it one of the reasons Kelly has it out for Mr. George. George sued EBRPD due a to a substandard roadway which closed access to the park

-. (http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/15/neighbors-force-just-opened-fremont-park-to-close/)for some time. I think Kelly actually lives in Fremont and uses the park, so he's now looking into Mr. George's business. I don't know the degree to which D1 would get involved now in a code enforcement

.- action, but I'm assuming they would get minimally involved, and I'm pretty sure the property is actually in D2 which doesn't have the same history/ties with the owner.

Sent: Tuesday, November 14, 2017 1:59:27 PM Subject: Re: More Background - Historical images of the Vargas Plateau development
Thanks Chris for including us on this email string, I can hopefully provide some more background information about what is and what is not happening at the site. From its inception, the project has been proposed to be a non-commercial venue, it is being proposed for personal use and storage and the building permit that was obtained reflects this use. Based on recent complaints we have visited the site 2 times of the last month or so to look at the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss the overall use of the property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner.
The use of the main barn, as mentioned above, is not being proposed for anything other than storage and personal use, there is no proposal to open a brewery, winery or any other commercial activity at the site. Although the construction is of a quality not usually associated with a barn, this is a matter of personal taste and that is not something we regulate.
For various reasons we are also concerned about the use of the property going forward, especially given the condition of the road and other possible limitations of the site . To that end, the property owner has received a draft document that would limit the use of his property and has in concept agreed to language that could ultimately result in a recorded deed restriction.
Further based on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being looked at as woll, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.
There is also some questions regarding the Williamson Act and whether or not the owner can have other uses on his property that are not related to agriculture. The uniform rules adopted by the county- do allow other uses that are compatible with Agriculture and given the large size of the paroel it's likely that the property owner will be okay in terms of what the Williamson Act requires. We are further looking into this issue and will have more information later.
-Lhope this is. helpful to-dispel some-of the rumors about -the potential-use of the-barn being constructed. This is an ongoing code enforcement case which will take some time to resolve fully, but I just wanted you to know that we are actively pursuing each and every complaint that we have received, and are communicating with the property owner on an almost daily basis.
Also, there is nothing ocourring on the property that I believe conflicts with the East County arca plan; r'eferences to some of the policies in that plan I don't think are relevant to this discussion. It could be -

that additional information comes forward that could change that conclusion but at this time I'm fairly confident in this determination.
Lastly, no discretionary permits have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response.
I'd be happy to discuss some of this over the phone if needed, I'll be out of the office after today until next week, which as you know is a short week, so please let me know if you like to speak before then,
Thank you

It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself was permitted by BID and we signed off on it. We went back and forth on the CBQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA. There was some talk of a possible brewery which is probably why D1 has been pushing for the ordinance to allow it. As of now, I haye not heard of any reason to believe there is a brewery going on out there, but maybe there is. The interference of D1 was the subject of a grand jury report from 2015 I believe, so you can go back and read that if you want to.
Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that.seem to.show.a mini.beach-has-been--_- created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not clear which structures are legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and others probably new for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous stook pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we never authorized that work, and CBQA probably wasn't done,

It was my understanding based on the meeting that Chris George will be removing the tent.
What I do not understand and perhaps you can help me with this one, but it was not clear what It the County Planning department was investigating and why,
Or, does this Investigation stem from the comments made under public comment at the EBZA a few months back or was there something formal sent to Planning,
Thanks

Greetings, Shawn.

We are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not
designed to be used as barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom
design and constructlon, adJacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See
attached pictures taken this past Friday.) This begs the questlon, if used currently as an

:

accessory entertainment bullding for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maxlmum
floor area for the residential buildings and residentlal accessory bulldings applies. l
understand that the "barn" by Itself, may already be at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors
combined) or close to It. If we are to add the house floor area, the property would likely be
over the maxlmum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for residential and residentlal
accessory buildings, per ECAP.

[cid:1mage001.Jpg@01.D34C1.9.858362F0]

We are trying to get the other County departments and with the State Department of Fish
and Wildllfe to see about the adjacent property, at 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's
Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned by Christopher George, to see about the
beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after months being told that it would
soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of the pond (I can't tell its
size).

Hi Shawn, I thought l would weigh in but Just with CDA staff. There has been one complaining party (he's been very public about his complaint as well, see PC meeting minutes of 10/16.). He has taken it upon himself to see that enforcement Is done, to the extent warranted by our local ordinances/codes. He's keenly aware of the pending brewery ordinance which was also at the PC for action when he was there (he's been there at least 3.times). The PC has been receptive to hear him out, and the staff response has been that at this time we know of no unpermitted use (including a brewery), but that breweries will become possible very soon pending BOS action.
We don't know the owners final plans for the bullding and the varlous actlvities on the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure Is being bullt for some kind of assembly use, event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily have to look at everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our normal process.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1

1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Mission Peak Conservancy and Kelly Abreau ("Petitioners")
2 allege through this Verified Third Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
3 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") as follows:
4 I. INTRODUCTION
5 Respondent and Real Parties in Interest Violations of the

6 California Environmental Quality Act
1. This action challenges the legality of Respondent County of Alameda, by and
8 through its Community Development Agency, Building Inspection Department, Planning
Department, Public Works Agency, Fire Department, and Board of Supervisors ("the County"),
1.0 and Real Parties in Interest Christopher and Teresa George ("RPI*), to proceed with the
11 transformation of agricultural land into a resort like event and recreation center without any
12 environmental review in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act under California
13 Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq., and title 14 of California Code of Regulations §§ 15000
14 et seq. ("CEQA"), on properties commonly known as 3505 and 3163 Morrison Canyon Road,
15 located in an unincorporated portion of Alameda County near Fremont, California, in an area not
16 visible to the public ("the Properties"), including, but not limited to, the following:
17 The construction of a 12,000 square foot event center, also known as the
18 "agricultural barn", "barn", or "mini-Versailles";

19 The creation of a six million gallon lake stocked with unknown species of fish;
20 The creation of a dam and the alteration of a watercourse to create the lake;
21 The creation of a white sand beach alongside the lake;
22 The construction of a 6800 square foot "workshop";
23 The construction of a 2000 square foot greenhouse;
24 -The-construction of a large gazebo;
25 The construction of a mobile/manufactured home;
26 The excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars;
27 The installation of a winery or brewery;
28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF -

The construction of a courtyard connected to the 12,000 square foot "barn"
containing gas fire pit for entertainment, cooking area kitchen, lighting, seating
and retaining walls ("the courtyard");
The construction of a waterfall or watercourse feature;
The installation of a 500 feet gas line into the courtyard kitchen;

• The installation of a 2400 feet water line from a well to the "barn" storage tank;
7 The construction and grading of an elevated and landscaped road thousands of
8 feet long with an impermeable surface and an approximate 10%-20% grade; and
9 The construction of an "inground spa".
10 The amendment to Title 17 of the General Ordinance Code of Alameda County
11 No. 17.06.030(E) related to microbreweries in Zone A Districts which allows
12 agri-tourism and the commercial production of beer without a use or variance
13 permit and specifically drafted by RPI, promoted by RPI, and adopted with RPI's
14 interests in mind on or about April 9, 2019.
15 (collectively, defined as "the Project" or "the Project as a whole".)
16 2. The Properties on which the Project is located is in an agricultural and riparian
17 area. The Project is very large in scope, and whether as a whole, or by its individual
18 components, it will have a significant effect on the environment, yet the County failed to conductl
19 any environmental review of the Project as a whole, including, but not limited to, a preliminary
20 review of the Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project as a whole
21 qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project as a whole
22 (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an environmental impact report or a negative
23 declaration of the Project as a whole. The County has not issued any approvals, permits, or made
...... any-findings-with-respeet to the Project as a whole.

25 3. Instead, the County RPI are improperly piecemealing or segmenting the Project
26 into many sub-projects, and have obtained County approvals (building permits) for the 12,000
27 square foot event center, the large courtyard, the installation of a 500 foot gas line, and the
28 installation of a 2400 foot water line. RPI, on or about November 15, 2018, applied for County

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

1 /"corrective" building permits to legalize the gazebo, the new road, the greenhouse, and the 6800

2 square foot "workshop, all of which have already been constructed, or are under construction,

3 and are known to Respondent. On or about 2019, RPI applied for another building permit for the

4 "inground spa". Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the foregoing are

5 currently awaiting County approval and/or denials as of the date of the filing of this Third

6 Amended Petition and demonstrate illegal piecemealing of the Project.

7 4. Piecemealing applies to a project when a future action: "(1) is a reasonably

8 foreseeable consequence of the initial project; and (2) the future expansion or action will be

9 significant in that it will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its

10 environmental effects." (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of University of

11 California (1987) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396.) Related activities constitute a single project where "the

12 second activity is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the first activity; the second activity is

13 a future expansion of the first activity; or both activities are integral parts of the same project."

14 (Sierra Club v West Side Irrigation Dist. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 690, 698 (citations omitted).)

15 5. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI

16 will continue to engage in further piecemealing, as RPI are currently seeking, or will seek in the

17 imminent future, separate approvals (building permits) for the remaining sub-projects already

18 built without any permits, including, but not limited to, the six million gallon lake, dam and

19 watercourse alteration, the white sand beach alongside the lake, the mobile/manufactured home,

20 the excavation and grading of pastureland to create parking for up to 100 cars, the graded road,

21 and the installation of a winery or brewery. The County, pursuant to conditions described on

22 permit BLD2017-02969, dated November 21, 2017 for the courtyard, explicitly required RPI to

23 "submit permits for all structures on site that were built without permits", "prior to permit final".
.24 A-true and-correct copy-of this-permit is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is hereby

25 incorporated by reference.

26 6. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County and RPI

27 have, and currently are, improperly piecemealing the Project, and have obtained, and/or are

•28 seeking, separate County approvals for each separate sub-project or component of the Project in

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4

1 an effort to avoid CEQA review. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the
County mischaracterized each of the separate building permit approvals as ministerial in order to
exempt them from CEQA review. The County should have analyzed the Project as a whole, not
separately, which analysis would have required discretionary approvals and CEQA review.
7. The County already knew, as early as July 14, 2014, when RPI first sought

6 County approval for the 12,000 square foot event center or "barn", that the "barn" was a

7 component of a much bigger project which required CEQA review, but CEQA review did not

8 happen. A true and correct copy of the County email correspondence providing this information

9 and dated July 14, 2014, is attached to this Petition as Exhibit B, and is hereby incorporated by
10 reference.

11 The Evolution of the Project Definition and Its Effect on the

12 CEQA Statute of Limitations Based on the "Commencement of the Project"

13 8. Petitioners, however, did not have actual or constructive notice the "barn" was a

14 part of a much larger project like the County did in 2014 and 2015. When Petitioners first

15 complained to the County in 2016, they complained only of the "barn". At that time Petitioners

16 believed the "barn" alone was the "project". Petitioners had actual and constructive notice only

17 of the barn in the summer of 2016.1

18 9. The reasons for this are as follows: First, RPI did not apply for or receive any

19 other County approvals or permits for any other component of the Project except for the "barn"

20 until the summer or fall of 2017 when they sought permits for the construction of the large
21 courtyard attached to the "barn". Until that time, for more than two years, there were no other

22 public disclosures by either RPI or the County whatsoever regarding any component of the
23 Project except for the "barn", nor for the Project as a whole.

24-

25 Petitioners learned much later in 2018 that the courtyard construction may have begun earlier
26 a as a part of the "barn" before the permits for the courtyard were issued on or about November
21, 2017, since both structures
27 appear to be connected to each other. But as of the summer of 2016, Petitioners did not have actual or constructive notice of the courtyard and did not complain
28 to the County about the same, and any such reference to complaints made about it at that time (in 2016) were attorney error. The "courtyard", as Petitioners refer to it in this Petition, did not existl at that time.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5

1 10. Second, the County never held any public hearings or posted any public notices
2 about the Project as a whole a or any component thereof at any time, including for the "barn" or
3 the courtyard.

4 11. Third, the remote and hidden nature of the Properties worked to effectively hide
5 the components of the Project and the Project as a whole from a public view, especially since the

6 public park adjacent to the Properties, where one can distantly view some portions the Properties,
7 was closed and was not accessible to the public until early summer of 2017.

8 12. The result of these combined factors is that the definition of the Project, as
9 described in paragraph 1, evolved over time based on Petitioners' notice of the components that
10 make up and changed the definition of the Project as a whole, and based on the fact that some of
11 the components simply did not exist when the "barn" construction began in 2015 or when the

12 permit issued that same year. The scope and definition of the Project expanded over time to
13 include more and more of the components described above in paragraph 1, some of them as
14 recent as this year, as more fully described below.

15 13. The County has not issued any formal approvals for the Project (as a whole),
16 therefore, the appropriate statute of limitations to apply is the 180-day statute of limitations
17 under California Public Resources Code §21167(d) and 14 California Code of Regulations
18 15112(c)(5)(B) that runs from the "commencement of the project". (See, December 13, 2018
19 Order on Demurrer to First Amended Petition filed in this action; and June 21, 2019 Tentative
20 Order on Demurrer and Motion to Strike Second Amended Petition.)

21 14. The "commencement of the project" is when (1) a public agency or private entity
22 has disclosed that it has committed itself (commencement) to an action that is stable, finite and
23 capable of being defined with accuracy (project), (2) the action may cause either a direct physical
-24- change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
25 environment (project subject to CEQA) and (3) the petitioner or the public is on constructive
26 notice of both the proposed action and its possible effect on the environment." (Id.) (See also,
27 Communities for a Better Environment v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2016) 1
28 Cal.App.5th 715, 726, "we acknowledge that if there were any situation in which it would be

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6

1 warranted to delay the triggering of a limitations period in the manner CBE urges, it would be

2 one in which no public notice of the project was given and the project's commencement was not

3 readily apparent to the public.)
15. Part one of the above definition necessarily requires the action, in this case, the

5 Project (as a whole), is a stable, finite and capable of being defined with accuracy. When the

6 definition of the Project as whole continues to change as new components are added as alleged
7 herein and described more fully below, the "action" is not stable, finite or capable of being

8 defined with accuracy because it continually evolves. Said another way, a project is only stable,
9 finite and being capable of being defined with accuracy until the next significant change comes
10 along.

11 16. Part two of the definition requires that the "action" - the Project as a whole - is
12 subject to CEQA, which is alleged in this Petition at 11 1-7; 90-102.

13 17. Part three of the definition constructive notice - is defined by California Civil

14 Code § 19 as "Every person who has actual notice of circumstances sufficient to put a prudent

15 a person upon inquiry as to a particular fact has constructive notice of the fact itself in all cases in

16 which, by prosecuting such inquiry, he or she might have learned that fact."

17 18. "Constructive notice of the proposed action" necessarily requires that Petitioners
18 have constructive notice of the contents of the "proposed action", or "project", i.e. the
19 components of the Project. Thus, when significant components of the Project as a whole

20 continue to change and grow, the time when Petitioners acquired constructive notice of the
21 Project as a whole also change.

22 19. The Project as a whole commences when it is constructively known to Petitioners,
23 and when it keeps changing, SO does the "commencement of the project" keep changing. As of
--24 the date of this filing, the "commencement of the Project", as defined herein, began no earlier
25 than November 21, 2017, and possibly as late as November 15, 2018 or even this year, as

26 described below.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7

1 2015 to the Summer of 2017

2 20. From 2015 until the summer of 2017, the definition of the Project for purposes of
3 this CEQA action included only the construction of the 12,000 square foot "barn" or "mini-
4 Versailles". allegedly being built to replace an old barn RPI had torn down. Petitioners did not

5 have any constructive or actual knowledge of any other portion of the Project as defined herein,

6 many components of which did not even exist at that time, as described more fully, below, and
7 other components of which were undisclosed because RPI had violated the law and built

8 unpermitted structures. None of the other components of the Project other than the "barn" were

9 disclosed to the public by the County or RPI via permits or applications for the same during this
10 time frame, and as stated herein, the Properties are hidden from public view in a remote location.
11 Petitioners had no notice, actual or constructive, or reason to suspect, know or believe during this
12 time frame that the Project consisted of more than just the "barn," in part because RPI had
13 violated the law and built unpermitted structures.

14 21. At that time, the Project a as a whole had not commenced. The only part of the
15 Project that had "commenced" between 2015 and the summer of 2017 was the "barn". since

16 because (1) he County and RPI had only "disclosed that it has committed itself" to the

17 construction of the "barn", not the a Project as a whole as defined herein, and (2) Petitioners did
18 not have constructive notice of the Project as a whole at that time, only the barn. There were no
19 approvals or disclosures by the County or RPI that it was committing themselves to the Project
20 as a whole. In fact, many portions of the Project as a whole physically did not exist during this
21 time frame, such as the large courtyard, the waterfall/watercourse, the new graveled road, the gas
22 line, the water line, and the inground spa. Furthermore, it took the County five months or more

23 to approve the "barn" permit. The County initially refused to the grant the agricultural
exemption for the "barn" because it was two stories (the County only allow one story), and the
25 "barn" contained mechanical, electrical, and plumbing components. Following a flurry of
26 County activity regarding the "barn". including "all hands" on deck type meetings, per Planning
27 Director Albert Lopez, the County also recognized "[w]e seem to be into the first part of a "plan

28 of larger development", as we say in the C3 world."(referring to the "barn" as a commercial

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8

1 "C3" type development.) The County, however, ultimately approved the "barn" permit despite
2 its CEQA concerns, and told RPI that it will assist RPI in "getting the building permit to
3 complete this portion of the project". This is just more evidence that the County was not only
4 piecemealing intentionally, but that it had committed itself only to the "barn" portion of the
5 project, not the Project as a whole. even though they recognized it was a "portion of the project"
6 as a whole, since they were approving or "committing" to just the "barn" portion.
7 22. During this time frame, Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege
8 that RPI did not disclose any of the other individual components of the Project that existed at that
9 time to the County or the public at large, including the lake, the dam, the beach, the gazebo, the
10 workshop, the parking lot and the greenhouse. Petitioners did not have actual or constructive
11 notice of these undisclosed individual components of the Project during this time frame (2015 to
12 summer of 2017). The only "proposed action" Petitioners had constructive notice of was the
13 construction of the "barn".

14 The Summer and Early Fall of 2017
15 23. In or around the summer of 2017, the definition of the Project changed and grew
16 to include the lake, the dam, the beach, the gazebo, the workshop, the greenhouse and the paved
17 road. Petitioners obtained actual notice of these components of the Project, but it still did have
18 constructive notice of the Project as whole as it is defined herein because (1) the Project as a
1.9 whole was still not stable, finite and capable of being defined with accuracy during this time
20 because it grew again to include significant changes (2) neither the County nor RPI "disclosed"
21 they had "committed" themselves to the Project as a whole, and (3) Petitioners did not have
22 constructive notice of the Project as a whole at that time because it grew again to include
23 significant changes.

24 24. After-not receiving any information or feedback from the County for more than a
25 year, and after the Vargas Plateau Regional Park re-opened after a series of lawsuits filed by RPI
26 (see 11 112-117), Petitioners began to perform their own research and inquiry about the
27 Properties, and complained to the County about what they believed they found in or around the
28 summer of 2017.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

1 25. During late spring and/or early summer 2017, Petitioners took to Google Earth as
2 well as Vargas Plateau Regional Park to attempt to learn more about the "barn". Google Earth
3 and aerial historical images of the Properties revealed not only the "barn" and some of its
4  characteristics, but the existence of the lake, the dam, the white sand beach, the parking lot, the
5 gazebo, the greenhouse, the manufactured home, and the workshop, all of which Petitioners

6 believed were constructed without permits and thus formally undisclosed to the County.

7 26. This was the first expansion of the project definition, where it changed from
8 including only the barn, to include the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot, the greenhouse,
9 the workshop, the gazebo and the manufactured home.

10 27. Soon thereafter, Petitioners complained to and notified the County of these
11 components of the Project they had observed (in the summer of 2017), and notified the County
12 that Petitioners believed CEQA applied to the Project as it was defined at this time, and that the
13 County was failing in its duty to conduct CEQA review of the Project as it was defined at that
14 time. Petitioners complaints to the County were related to those components of the Project of
15 which Petitioners had knowledge and that existed at the time, and did not include complaints of
16 the Project as a whole a as it is defined in this Petition and of which they did not have constructive
17 knowledge.

18 28. The Project as a whole a still did not "commence", for statute of limitations

19 purposes, in the summer of 2017, because the definition of the Project as a whole grew and

20 changed again in or around November 21, 2017, and throughout 2018 into 2019, as did

21 Petitioners' constructive notice of the new definition and components of the Project. (the

22 "proposed action".) The Project as a whole - the a "action" was not stable, finite, or capable of
23 being described with accuracy at that time because the components of the Project as a whole
continued to change, and because many of its components did not exist at that time.

25 29. The County or RPI also did not "disclose" it "committed" themselves the Project

26 as a whole at that time, or to any other component of the Project. Petitioners complained, but
27 during the summer and fall of 2017, neither the County nor RPI had "disclosed" it "committed"

28 itself to any of the previously undisclosed components of the Project, or to the Project as a wholel

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 10

1 (as it was defined then). To the contrary, Petitioners were the ones who "disclosed" the various

2 components of the Project to the County in an effort to get the County to do its job and conduct

3 CEQA review of the Project as it was then. Petitioners had no idea at that time whether the

4 County was "committed" to allowing RPI to continue to move forward on the whole, part, or

5 none of the Project as it was defined at that time. Equally importantly, Petitioners had no actual

6 or constructive knowledge whether the County had committed itself to a particular course of

7 action and, in fact, as discussed below, in paragraphs 30 - 32, the County had not committed

8 itself to a particular course of action and as late as October and November, 2017, was still

9 considering which course of action it would commit itself to - approving the Project (as it was

10 then known to exist) without further review or accepting Petitioners' concerns and requiring

11 CEQA review.

12 30. Petitioners were not aware at the time that the County had visited the Properties in
13 response to their complaints in the summer of 2017 regarding the components of the Project that

14 they knew of and existed at the time, nor were they aware of the wrangling that went on during

15 this time frame between the County and RPI regarding the issuance of the building permit for the

16 courtyard and the overall use of the "barn". The County had most definitely not committed itself

17 to the courtyard component of the Project at this time, or the Project as a whole, despite a RPI's

18 intense efforts, including pulling some political strings.

19 31. For about a month or more during October and November 2017, RPI were

20 hounding the County to give them their building permit for the courtyard. In fall 2017, the

21 County visited the Properties and came away with the conclusion that: "We are trying to decide

22 how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not designed to be used as a barn:

23 radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and construction, adjacent deck,
-24-1 admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See attached pictures taken this past Friday.) This begs
25 the question, if used currently as an accessory entertainment building for the existing house, then

26 the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum floor area for the residential buildings and residential accessory
27 buildings applies. understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be at 12,000 sq. ft. floor

28 area (both floors combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor area, the property

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 11

1 would likely be over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for residential and

2 residential accessory buildings, per ECA. We are trying to get the other County departments
3 and with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to see about the adjacent property, at
4 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned by

5 Christopher George, to see about the beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after

6 months being told that it would soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of

7 the pond (I can't tell its size)." (Ex. E.; emphasis added). Petitioners were not aware of these

8 activities and this email until in or about March or April, 2018. Equally if not more importantly,

9 though, these activities clearly established that the County had not yet committed itself to a
10 particular course of action, approving the Project (as it was then known to exist) without further
11 review or accepting Petitioners' concerns and requiring CEQA review. As the County's email
12 above states, as of this date, the County was still "trying to decide" what to do, was still "trying
13 to get" input from other County departments and the state Department of Fish and Wildlife" and
1.4 still needed "to see about" the other unpermitted structures.

15 32. An hour and a half later on the same day, Planning Director for the County Albert
16 Lopez wrote to Mr. Wilson: "We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the
17 various activities on the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some
18 kind of assembly use, event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily
19 have to look at everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play
20 out through our normal process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to
21 learn more about his plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local
22 ordinances.» (Ex. E; emphasis added). This email also conclusively establishes as of that date,
23 the County still had not yet committed itself to a particular course of action. As of this point in
-24- time, the County still "[did]n't know" RPI's final plans or RPI's activities; the County still

25 "[had] to look at" the information Petitioners had brought to the County's attention; the County
26 still had "to learn more about" RPI's plans; the County still had to "discuss how those plans align
27 with our various ordinances." Because the County was still in the process of deciding which
28 course of action it would pursue, it had not yet committed itself to a particular course of action.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 12

1 33. Petitioners also did not have constructive notice of, nor were they aware during
2 this time, that the "barn" was being built for assembly use as the Court stated in its Tentative
Order dated June 21, 2019. ("An email dated 10/23/17 indicates that a member of the public wasl
4 aware that the barn on the George's property was being built for assembly use." Tentative Order
5 dated June 21, 2019, at 8:26-9:3.) Rather, it is the County that admits in their correspondence
6 described herein and attached as Exhibit E that the "barn" is clearly being built for assembly use,
7 not Petitioners or another member of the public. (See, Ex. E.)
8 34. Petitioners may have had their suspicions of the future use of the "barn" for
9 assembly use, but they did not have constructive notice that it was intended for the same at that
10 time, especially when the County insists to Petitioners that the use of the barn and the Properties
11 is agricultural and "legal land use wise", (See 135.) Petitioners did not have knowledge of the
12 contents of these internal County emails until many months later in 2018 following a California
13 Public Records Act request.

14 35. In an email to Petitioner MPC on November 14, 2017, Planning Director Lopez
15 communicated to Petitioners that the County still has not "committed itself"' to the Project as it
16 was defined at that time, or any (unpermitted) component of it, writing that the County is looking
17 into the "the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of
18 the property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner".
19 "[BJased on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are beingl
20 looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to
21 discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an
22 ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting
23 all the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.". "[NJo discretionary permits
24 have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through-the code enforcement
25 process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded
26 the concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting
27 their response." (Ex. C.) This email provided actual notice to Petitioners that, consistent with
28 the prior activities and emails of which Petitioners were not aware until in or about March or

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13

1 April, 2018, the County still had not committed itself to a course of action. Indeed, this email

2 holds out the proposition that in fact the County may very well conclude that CEQA review

3 would be ordered.

4 36. Nothing in the above-described correspondence gives any indication that the

5 County has effectively signed on or committed itself to RPI's Project as it was defined at that
6 time. it To the contrary, it demonstrates the County was engaged in an "ongoing" action that was
7 "working toward resolution", not a "commitment" yet and in fact, refers to the possibility that as
8 a result of this on-going process, the County still may very well commit itself to CEQA review.

9 37. RPI were irate by November 2017, irked that the County had not provided its
10 approval for the building permit for the courtyard, and let the County know it. If the County had
11 committed itself to a course of action by this point in time, RPI would not have been irate. The

12 County, however, concerned at that time that the "barn" and the entertainment courtyard
13 connected to the "barn", were clearly not intended for agricultural use and occupancy, advised

14 RPI that in order to receive County approval for the courtyard, RPI would first have to bring
15 every existing structure that had built illegally into compliance.

16 38. This did not go over well with RPI, so the County offered another alternative, a
17 Deed Use Restriction restricting use to agricultural use. Mr. George initially agreed to the deed
18 restriction, but then changed his mind and backtracked. So, no such deed restriction was signed
19 or recorded.

20 November 21, 2017 to the Present

21 39. Only a week later, however, on November 21, 2017, the County appeared to
22 mysteriously cave to RPIs demands, and issued the building permit for the courtyard attached to
23 the "barn". The definition of the Project again changes at this time to now include the significant
and new courtyard component that is attached to the "barn".

25 40. The issuance of this building permit on November 21, 2017 represented the
26 "tipping point," representing the earliest possible point in time at which Petitioners could be said

27 to have had either actual or constructive knowledge that the County would not require CEQA
28 review for the Project (as it was then known to exist). Only one week earlier, the County had

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 14

1 held out the possibility to Petitioners that as a result of the on-going code enforcement process,

2 CEQA might in fact be ordered. The issuance of the November 21, 2017 building permit

3 indicated that the County would not require CEQA review or else it likely would not have issued
4 the building permit. Thus, even if Petitioners could be said that the Project (as it was then known
to exist) was stable and finite at some prior point in time (and Petitioners contend it was not
stable and finite as of November 21, 2017), November 21, 2017 was the earliest point in time

7 that Petitioners could be said to have had constructive knowledge that the County had committed

8 itself to particular course of action. That course of action was not to require CEQA review and

9 only as of November 21, 2017 was this necessary element of committing to a particular course of a
10 conduct met.

11 41. Even as to the "stable and finite" element, the Project was still not stable and

12 finite. Taking the in the totality of the circumstances, including the fact that the County had

13 actual notice of the Project and its components as it was defined at that time from their site

14 inspection of the Properties, including the "barn", the lake, the dam, the parking lot, the sand
15 beach, the gazebo, the workshop, the greenhouse and the manufactured home, by issuing the
16 courtyard permits, instead of rejecting them, the County has engaged in piecemealing, and has
17 disclosed it committed itself to RPI's development of the whole Project without CEQA review of

18 the whole Project.

19 42. The County, by issuing the courtyard permits on November 21, 2017, the second

20 set of building permits for separate components of the Project (the "barn" and the attached
21 courtyard), has also disclosed that it is committing itself to the piecemealing of the Project, and
22 has acquiesced to RPI's development of the Project without CEQA review of the whole Project,
23 committing itself to the same. Petitioners have constructive notice of this new definition of the
24  Project as a whole by virtue of the public disclosure of the courtyard permits.
25 43. Had the County not approved the courtyard permits, throwing up the guardrails at

26 that point with the knowledge it had regarding the Project as a whole and what it contains, and
27 instead conducted CEQA review of the Project as a whole, then Petitioners would not have had

28 to file this lawsuit.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 15

1 44. But until that point, Petitioners did not have either constructive notice of the

2 Project as a whole (since the definition substantially changed when the massive courtyard in all

3 its splendor was just added), nor did the County or RPI "disclose" its intention to "commit" to

4 the illegal piecemealing and development of the Project as a whole until it issued the courtyard

5 permits. By issuing those permits, the County disclosed and provided constructive notice to

6 Petitioners that it was committed to the illegal piecemealing of the Project, and the illegal

7 development of the whole of the Project without CEQA review, thus commencing the Project as

8 it was defined at that time.

9 45. However, throughout 2018 and 2019, the definition of the Project still changed,

10 and arguably, delayed the commencement of the Project and thus the limitations period even

11 longer.

12 The Changes to the Project Definition in 2018 Regarding Use and

13 Petitioner's Knowledge of the Same

14 46. In the summer and early fall of 2018, Petitioners had actual notice that the use of

15 the "barn" was not going to be for a traditional barn type uses, but for assembly use, contrary to

16 the assertions the County and RPI repeated ad nauseum throughout 2017 and into 2018. Around

17 this time, the County disclosed it had committed itself to the use of the barn as assembly use.

18 Previously, Petitioners had their suspicions, but the County and RPI insisted they were wrong
19 over and over. County documents obtained by Petitioners in March or April 2018 pursuant to a

20 California Public Records Act request belied the County and RPI's claim the use was

21 agricultural, but still the County and RPI maintained this front to Petitioners, until about the

22 summer of 2018.

23 47. RPI admitted that the "occupancy limit" for the "barn" was 400 persons in the

24 courtroom in the summer of 2018, and that they had obtained or will obtain an occupancy permit

25 indicating the same. RPI also admitted during this time frame that wedding parties were held at

26 the "barn".

27 48. Petitioners then obtained a letter in or about September 2018 from the County

28 after months of diligently seeking records from the Fire Department about the "barn". This letter

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 16

1 was dated August 17, 2017 from RPI to the Fire Department in which RPI unequivocally states

2 they will not use the "barn" as a barn. It will not store agricultural equipment, or animals, but it

3 will be used as listed on the plans, which indicate an event center. A true and correct copy of the

4 August 17, 2017 letter to the Fire Department from RPI is attached to this Complaint as Exhibit

5 D and incorporated by reference. This letter was not a part of the records Petitioners received in

6 the spring of 2018 pursuant to the Public Records Act request.

7 49. The building plans RPI submitted to the County for the "barn" and the courtyard

8 classify the actual use will be for an event center and/or banquet hall, a mixed Occupancy of "A-

9 2" assembly, and "U" utility. Petitioners learned this information as a result of and after

10 obtaining the "barn is not a barn letter" described in paragraph 42, which referenced the use of
11 the "barn" as those consistent with those described in the plans.

12 50. Although Petitioners had their suspicions in the summer and fall of 2017 that the
13 "barn" and the Project as defined at that time were not built or used for agricultural purposes,

14 they did not have constructive notice of the intended use - facts that would lead them to know or

15 learn that the use was for assembly - in part because the County and RPI actively concealed

16 these facts from Petitioners until 2018, and denied them repeatedly. (See, Ex. C., County email

17 correspondence dated July 11, 2017 and November 14, 2017 claiming the "barn" is "legal land

18 use wise".)

19 51. When Petitioners tried to learn of the facts supporting the same on or about

20 November 5, 2017 by attempting to pture drone footage of the structures, their attempts were

21 literally shot down by RPI.

22 52. The County admitted on at least two occasions that if the use of the "barn"

23 changes (to a non-agricultural use), then CEQA would be needed to obtain the required
24-1 conditional use permits. (See, Ex. C and Ex. F, transcript of August 16, 2018 hearing.)

25 53. The use of barn changed as of 2018, the County and RPI did not disclose to the

26 public or Petitioners that they committed themselves to assembly use of the "barn" until 2018,
27 and Petitioners did not have constructive knowledge until 2018 (and within 180 days of the filing

28 of the original Petition on May 18, 2018) of the changed use of the "barn" to assembly use, not

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 17

1 agricultural. On or about April 9, 2019, the County adopted an amendment to Title 17 of the

2 Alameda County Municipal Ordinance Code that allows agri-tourism and the production of beer

3 in Zone A district properties like RPI's. While facially this amendment appears to have been
approved for the overall benefit of the general population of Alameda County, in truth, this
amendment was not only promoted by RPI, the amendment was drafted in part by RPI, for the

6 benefit of RPI, and is an integral part of the Project, and Petitioners learned of this the night
before the filing of this Petition. From inception in 2013, RPI have been more than just

8 instrumental in pushing for the amendment. RPI's lawyers drafted portions of the amendment,
which portions, per the County, were approved by the County. In fact, RPI requested a final

10 draft of the amendment so he could have his lawyers have one more crack at it just to make sure
11 it was "safe". County counsel allegedly advised against providing RPI and his lawyers with the

12 final draft. Meanwhile, RPI have publicly declared in the various meetings and in emails to the

13 County that he has absolutely no interest in the brewery ordinance (that he helped draft) and will

14 never open a brewery on the Properties, all the while communicating with the County about the

15 status of the amendment, the contents of the amendment, and the opponents to the amendment up

16 to and including 2018 and 2019. This is further evidence that the Project was still not stable and

17 finite, as another major component has been added, and that Petitioners did not have constructive

18 notice that the amendment was a part of the Project until July 18, 2019, when it discovered RPI's

19 deep involvement in the amendment process (contrary to his public statements) in order to allow

20 RPI to again attempt to side track the CEQA process and have their brewery as a matter of right

21 without having to go through the CEQA process, making it an instrumental component of the

22 Project as whole. A brewery under this amendment does not require the owner to obtain :

23 conditional use permit, a variance or other permit to open and develop a commercial brewery.
24l This Ordinance was heavily sponsored, promoted, and even written by RPI, with RPI only in

25 mind, and the County knew it. Petitioners, however, did not have constructive notice that it was

26 a part of the Project until July 18, 2019.

27

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 18

1 The Commencement of the "Permitted Project" and the Discretionary Permit Approvals

2 as the Basis for the 180 day Limitations Periods

3 54. As of November 21, 2017, the County had Permitted and approved two separate

4 components of the Project, the "barn" and the "courtyard", and was setting itself up for more.

5 55. The courtyard permit requires that RPI must bring every other structure built

6 illegally into compliance. (Ex. A.) According to this permit, RPI will have to submit permit

7 applications for every structure built without permits (which is all but the "barn") in order to

8 bring them into compliance, amounting to even more potential for piecemealing and avoidance

9 of CEQA review of the whole Project.

10 56. This sequence of continuing piecemealing, in fact, has already begun. On or
11 about November 15, 2018, RPI submitted "corrective" permits for some of the undisclosed

12 structures they built, including the 6000 square foot workshop, the greenhouse, and the gazebo.

13 Also submitted in 2018 or 2019 were the applications for permits for the new driveway, the 2400

14 feet long water line, the 500 foot gas line, and the "inground spa".

15 57. None of these recent permit applications have been approved or denied by the

16 County as of the date of the filing of this Petition.

17 58. The following is a list of the permits the County issued (without any CEQA

18 review) between 2014 and the present, representing the portions of the Project that have been

19 "piecemealed" to date:

20 a. BLD2014-02024 of August 29, 2014 construction of eight feet high retaining
21 walls and site drainage system "per approved plans" for the 12,000 square foot event

22 center or "ag barn";

23 b. BLD2014-02739 of February 6, 2015 - foundation permit for the 12,000 square

24 foot event center or "barn";

25 c. BLD2014-01654 of November 5, 2015 - construction of the 12,000 square foot

26 event center or "barn" (renewed by BLD2017-03666 on November 8, 2017)

27 d. BLD2017-02969 of November 21, 2017 - construction for the courtyard

28 connected to the event center (renewed on January 4, 2019)

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 19

1 e. BLD2018-01508 of May 8, 2018 gas line installation to the courtyard
2 f. BLD2018-01949 of June 15, 2018 - waterline installation from well to "barn"

3 storage tank

4 g. BLD2018-03182 of September 27, 2018 - supplemental permit to BLD2018-
5 01949 for additional 2,400 feet of waterline from well to "barn" storage tank.
6 59. On or about November 15, 2018, the County and RPI applied for and/or opened
7 the following new permits for the Properties:

8 h. BLD2018-03850 - legalize pre-fab 6,000 square foot metal shop building, and

9 323 square foot gazebo;
10 i. BLD2018-03851 - agricultural exemption for the 2,880 square foot greenhouse,
11 which has been "routed for departmental approvals";
12 j. SAM2014-00001 - extension of private driveway to future on-site building
13 (access road or driveway); and

14 a k. BLD2019-01748 - a "new in ground spa". (d through k, collectively defined as,
15 "the Permitted Project", being all permits issued by the County after November 21,
16 2017, and thus not including any of the "undisclosed" or unpermitted work either.)
17 60. The County has not, however, issued any approvals, permits, or made any
18 findings with respect to the Permitted Project as a whole, but such approval, permit, or findings
19 would be a discretionary decision.

20 61. The definition of the Permitted Project has changed over time with each new
21 application submitted by RPI and/or issued by the County related to the development of the
22 Properties by RPI, and may continue to change each time RPI applies for or the County issues a
23 a new permit for a new and significant component of the Permitted Project. The definition of the
-24  Permitted Project will likely grow to include the sub-projects for which RPI must obtain the

25 "corrective permits", but for which RPI have not yet applied, such as the lake, dam, watercourse
26 alteration, beach, graveled road, manufactured home, and parking lot.

27 62. Although the County has mischaracterized the building permits issued for the

28 Permitted Project as ministerial, the level of discretion actually exercised and authorized by the

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 20

1 County in determining the approvals and any conditions attached thereto meet the definition of

2 discretionary approvals under CEQA.

3 63. The statute of limitations applicable to the Permitted Project as a whole is a 180

4 days after commencement of the Permitted Project as a whole, under Title 14 of the California

5 Code of Regulations section 15112(c)(5)(B) and California Public Resources Code § 21167(d),

6 where the County has not made any formal approval of the Permitted Project as a whole.

*7 64. The "commencement of the project" is when (1) a public agency or private entity

8 has disclosed that it has committed itself (commencement) to an action that is stable, finite and

9 capable of being defined with accuracy (project), (2) the action may cause either a direct physical
10 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

11 I environment (project subject to CEQA) and (3) the petitioner or the public is on constructive

12 notice of both the proposed action and its possible effect on the environment." (Id.)

13 65. The commencement of the Permitted Project as a whole began, at the earliest, on

14 or about November 21, 2017, and within 180 days before the filing of the original Petition on

15 May 18, 2018.

16 66. In the alternative, the statute of limitations for the various sub-parts of the

17 Permitted Project is 180 days from the approval of each sub-project, all of which have occurred

18 within 180 days of the filing of the original Petition.

19 The County's Abuse of Discretion regarding

20 CEQA and the Project and/or the Permitted Project

21 67. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a

22 I demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion

23 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,

-24 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair. Failure to exercise

25 discretion is itself an abuse of discretion. (June 21, 2019 Tentative Order, citing Ashburn v. AIG

26 Financial Advisors, Inc. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 79, 97.)

27

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 21

1 68. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the

2 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals

3 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful.
69. The County also abused its discretion when it failed to exercise its discretion and
conduct any review or reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with

6 respect to the Project as a whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early

7 as July 2014 that CEQA was required, and that discretionary approvals were going to be

8 required.

70. The County did not hold any public hearings, or post any public notices,

10 regarding CEQA and the Project, CEQA and the Permitted Project, or any component of the
11 Project or the Permitted Project, including but not limited to, notice(s) of exemption(s) from

12 CEQA.

13 71. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any

14 actions, uses, or permits for the Properties described herein without complying with CEQA,

15 including compliance with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent

16 to only approve actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a

17 whole, or, in the alternative, mandating Respondent only approve further actions or permits on

18 the Properties that consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to

19 comply with CEQA, including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project

20 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project

21 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061),

22 an initial study of the Project and/or the Permitted Project a as a whole (CCR § 15063), and the §
23 preparation of either an environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project

24 and/or the Permitted Project as a whole.

25 72. Petitioners also seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,
26 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made
27 by the County regarding the any part of the Project, and/or the Permitted Project, including the

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 22

1 rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any decisions regarding

2 exemption from CEQA.

3 II. PARTIES

4 73. Petitioner MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY is a neighborhood political

5 advocacy organization dedicated to the preservation of the environment, protection and

6 enhancement of park access, and the construction of a network of bicycle and pedestrian trails in

7 southern Alameda County near Fremont, California, including the area in which the Project and
8 the Permitted Project are located in Vargas Plateau.

9 74. Petitioner KELLY ABREAU is an individual and is now, and at all times

10 mentioned in this Petition was a resident of Fremont in Alameda County.

11 75. Respondent County of Alameda is a government entity located in the State of

12 California.

13 76. Petitioners are persons beneficially interested in and aggrieved by the acts,

14 decisions, and omissions of Respondent as alleged in this Petition. Petitioners have fundamental

15 vested rights and interests which are adversely effected by the acts, decisions, and omissions of

16 Respondent. Unmitigated, significant and damaging environmental effects associated with the

17 Project and/or the Permitted Project, and the effects will adversely impact the Petitioners as well
18 as the public generally.

19 77. Respondent is charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law

20 including CEQA, and their own local ordinances and codes including those that regulate zoning.
21 The Board of Supervisors is the duly constituted legislative body, and highest administrative

22 body in the County. The Board is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things, that all
23 applicable, federal, state and county laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and implemented. The

2-4 Respondent, through the Board of Supervisors, Community Development Agency, Planning

25 Department, Building Inspection Department, Fire Department, Department of Environmental

26 Health, and Public Works Agency, has failed to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project
27 and/or the Permitted Project. The Respondent has also failed to comply with its own regulations

28 and duties with respect to zoning.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 23

1 78. Real Parties in Interest Christopher George and Teresa George are individuals and

2 the owners of the Properties, and are the proponents of the Project and/or the Permitted Project,

3 and any and all portions thereof.

4 79. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein

5 as DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 20 through

6 40, inclusive and, therefore, sues these Respondents and Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious

7 names. Petitioners will seek leave to amend the Petition, if necessary, to allege the true names

8 and capacities when ascertained.

9 80. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all times material

10 hereto, each DOE Respondent named in this Petition was the agent and employee of each of the

11 other Respondent herein, and was at all times material thereto, acting within the course and

13 III. JURISDICTION, VENUE AND EXHAUSTION

14 OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15 81. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to § 1085 of the California

16 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§ 21168 and 21168.5 of the California Public Resources Code.

1.7 82. Venue is proper in Alameda County under §§ 394 and 305 of the California Code

18 of Civil Procedure as the county in which the real properties in dispute are located and as a

19 county in which Respondent and RPI reside.

23 true and correct copy of the Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein by
24  this reference.

25 84. Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA as described herein constitute

26 prejudicial abuses of discretion. As alleged in this Petition, Respondent failed to proceed in the

27 manner required by law, failed to make mandatory findings, and/or made findings not supported

28 by substantial evidence. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, adequate remedy at law and, along

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 24

1 with members of the public, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of Respondent's violations of

2 CEQA.

3 85. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of California Public Resources

4 Code section 21167.7, and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388, by mailing a copy of

5 the original Petition for Writ of Mandate on or about May 18, 2018 to the State Attorney

6 General. A true and correct copy of the Service of the original Petition for Writ of Mandate and

7 Notice of Commencement of Action on the Attorney a General, and a true and correct copy of the

8 Service of this Petition, is attached hereto as Exhibit G, respectively, and incorporated herein by

this reference.

10 86. California Public Resources Code § 21177 regarding the exhaustion of remedies

11 requirement that must be satisfied in order to maintain CEQA action does not apply to

12 Petitioners in accordance with subsection (e), which states, "This section does not apply to any

13 alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or

14 other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to

15 the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

16 (Cal. Public Resources Code § 21777(e).) Respondents have held no public hearings or issued

17 any public notice regarding CEQA review of the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or any

18 portion thereof.

19 IV. STANDING

20 87. Petitioners have standing as parties beneficially interested in the issuance of the

21 requested writ of mandate because the Project and/or the Permitted Project, as alleged more

22 specifically herein, will have significant adverse environmental impacts affecting the individuals

23 named herein as well as the general public.

24 88. Petitioners have a beneficial interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all their legat

25 duties as alleged in this Petition. Further, issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will

26 confer significant benefits on the general public by requiring Respondent to carry out their duties

27 under CEQA. Issuance of the relief requested will also result in the enforcement of important

28 rights affecting the public interest by compelling the County to engage in a fair, objective, and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 25

1 legally adequate analysis of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, and ensure that the public

2 has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the impacts of the same.

3 89. The significant adverse environmental impacts include, but are not limited to,

4 increased traffic and safety issues, habitat and waterway destruction, agricultural land

5 destruction, increased sewage and refuse, and the exploitation of, and harm to, groundwater

6 resources.

7 V. CEQA REQUIREMENTS

8 90. Respondent is subject to the requirements of CEQA when evaluating a project

9 that may have a significant effect on the environment. The Project and the Permitted Project are

10 a "project," as that term is defined by CEQA, such that they are "an activity which may cause
11 either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

12 change in the environment", and which is "[a]n activity that involves the issuance to a person of

13 a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies."

14 (California Public Resources Code § 21065.)

15 91. CEQA requires Respondent to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of

16 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that

17 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

18 significant adverse environmental impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen

19 such impacts.

20 92. CEQA also requires Respondent to evaluate the environmental impacts of "the

21 whole of an action". (California Code of Regulations § 15378(A).) Under CEQA, Respondent

22 must analyze the environmental impacts of all reasonably foreseeable portions of the Project

23 and/or the Permitted Project, and cannot separate Project or the Permitted Project into its

24 separate and smaller components such that each individual component has a lesser environmental

25 impact than the whole together, thus ignoring the impact of these projects a as a whole.

26 93. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent, knew as
27 early as July 2014 that the "barn" was one part of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, yet

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 26

1 Respondent impermissibly issued separate discretionary approvals for individual components of

2 the Project and/or the Permitted Project without any CEQA review of these a whole.

3 94. Had Respondent performed an initial CEQA review of the whole of the Project

4 and/or the Permitted Project, substantial evidence would have led to the undeniable conclusion

5 a that replacing a barn with a "mini Palace of Versailles" complete with a plaza courtyard,

6 expanding a cattle pond into a lake stocked with unknown species of fish, with an artificial

7 white-sand beach on the north side, damming the watercourse to create the lake, grading the

8 former rolling pastureland into parking lot(s) with space for 100 cars, and erecting a barn with a

9 brewery or a workshop and storage shed for antique, steam-powered farm equipment, would

10 create and has created significant and multiple environmental impacts more than sufficient to

11 trigger CEQA compliance and a report on the same.

12 95. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent has

13 determined that exemptions apply individually to each and/or some of the components of the

14 Project and/or the Permitted Project, or that the approvals were all ministerial approvals, versus

15 determining whether any exemption applies to the Project or the Permitted Project as a whole.

16 Exemptions to CEQA, however, do not apply to the Project or to the Permitted Project.

17 96. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County

18 determined the individual components, or some of them, that make up the Project are exempt

19 individually based on certain categorical exemptions, including, but not limited to:

20 California Code of Regulations § 15302 - "replacement or reconstruction of

21 existing structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the

22 same site as the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose

23 and capacity as the structure replaced."
California Code of Regulations § 15304 - Class 4 "minor public or private
25 alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve

26 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural

27 purposes."

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 27

1

2 California Code of Regulations § 15303 - Class 3 "construction and location of

C) limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures; installation of small new

4 equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of existing small

5 structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in
the exterior of the structure."

6 97.

7 The "barn" and the courtyard, although placed on the same space where the old

8 barn was located, does not have "substantially the same purpose and capacity as the structure
replaced." (California Code of Regulations § 15302.)

98.

10 The lake, the dam, the parking lot, the driveway or access road which extends

11 thousands of feet southeast, a more than one-half mile long water line, and the beach are not

12 "minor public or private alterations in the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do

13 not involve removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry or agricultural purposes."
(California Code of Regulations § 15304.)

14 99.

15 The gazebo, the manufactured home, and the 6800 square foot barn are not

16 "limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures". (California Code of Regulations §
15303.)

17 100.

18 Furthermore, there are exceptions to the categorical exemptions under CEQA.
California Code of Regulations § 15300.2(b) and (c), state:

19

20 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the

21 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type
significant. in the same place, over time is

22

23 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where

24 a there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

25 environment due to unusual circumstances. (California Code of Regulations §
15300.2(b) and (c), emphasis added.)

26 101.

27 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that if any exemptions do

28 apply to the Project, or the Permitted Project, or to any components thereof, these exceptions to

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 28

1 the exemptions preclude the County from relying on the exemptions to foreclose CEQA review

2 and reporting.

3 102. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that no exemptions under

4 CEQA apply to the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or to any components thereof, and

5 challenge any and all of Respondent's findings to the contrary.

6 VI. THE ALTERATIONS MADE TO THE PROPERTIES

7 103. The Properties sit upon an approximate 700 acre spread of land in the hills of

8 Sunol east of Fremont, near the Vargus Plateau Regional Park owned by the East Bay Regional

9 Park District. This land was traditionally an agricultural area, and included a small and seasonal

10 cattle pond and stream, two barns, each over a hundred 100 years old, and a small residential a

11 home. The road leading up to the Properties, Morrison Canyon Road, is narrow and hazardous

12 road. Petitioners have complained to the city and the park district about the dangerous condition

13 of this road, especially when traffic volume is high to and from The Properties.

14 104. When RPI began to transform the Properties into the resort-like recreation center,

15 they kept it secret from the County. RPI did not seek or obtain any County approvals or permits

16 at the time of the construction and creation of the lake, the dam, the beach, the parking lot, the

1.7 brewery, the greenhouse, the gazebo, the manufactured home, or the other 6,800 square foot

18 workshop. The only approvals RPI sought from the County before the filing of the original

19 Petition, were related to the "barn" and the courtyard.

20 105. Building plans for the "barn" describe a 12,000 square foot multi-story event
21 center with a 2,000 square foot deck, radiant in-floor heating, copper roofing, dormers and
22 cupolas, 400 amp electrical service, a large septic system, restrooms with disability access, an

23 elevator, panic hardware on the exit doors suitable for large gatherings of people, a fire sprinkler
24- system, a groundwater treatment system for the production of beer and wine, two walk-in

25 refrigerators for the storage of kegs of beer and barrels of wine, class IV heavy-frame timber

26 suitable for an entertainment facility that can accommodate large groups of people.

27 106. The "ag barn", however, houses no animals, no farm equipment, and is not being

28 used a barn per RPI. (See, Ex. D.) The 3,000 sq ft barn that the RPI demolished, and replaced

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 29

1. with a much larger structure, was more than a half-century old. The old barn had a traditional

2 appearance and typical size.

3 107. The cattle stock pond was expanded into the six-million gallon lake, replete with

4 the white sand beach and a large a a gazebo with a masonry/stone exterior. The watercourse leading
5 to the stock pond was cut off completely by the earthen embankment dam.

6 108. A low hill in between the 12,000 square foot "barn," the lake and the main gate of
7 the Properties was graded and excavated to a flat surface that provides parking for up to 100 cars,
8 and displaced approximately 1,200 cubic yards of earth. Petitioners are informed and believe

9 and thereon allege, that just recently, in the summer of 2018, RPI began construction of a new
10 road. Petitioners do not know at this time to where the road is going, or why it is being built, but
11 it is thousands of feet long, graveled, raised, landscaped, and allows for water run-off to lead to
12 the watercourse that dumps into the lake.

13 109. The 6,800 square foot workshop is not a barn in structure or use, and Petitioners

14 are informed and believe and thereon allege it is or has been used for brewing beer and restoring,
15 repairing, and storing antique steam-powered farm equipment and tractors. Mr. George
16 announced and advertised that beer labeled "Sunol Ridge" had been produced at Properties as of
17 2013-2015.

18 110. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the courtyard with its
19 fireplace, outdoor kitchen, and 13-foot high retaining walls is connected to the "barn", and was

20 built at or around the same time construction began on the "barn", although Petitioners were not
21 aware of that at the time. The lakefront waterfall feature is also listed on the November 21, 2017

22 permit. In 2019, RPI submitted an application for an "inground spa".

23 111. All in all, RPI are transforming the formerly traditional ranch and farm property
24  into a large resort-style entertainment and event facility, all done without any CEQA-review..-........

25 112. Ironically, Mr. George shared or shares Petitioners' concerns with traffic and

26 safety on Morrison Canyon Road, and raised the same in two lawsuits he filed in 2008 and 2016

27 against the East Bay Regional Park District ("EBRPD") for CEQA violations with respect to a

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 30

1 park located next to (west of) the Properties and accessed via Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas

2 Rd.

3 113. In the first lawsuit, Mr. George described Morrison Canyon Road as "a steep,

4 rural residential one-lane road that ranges in width from 10 to 12 feet with no shoulder on what

5 the EBRPD calls Upper Morrison Canyon Road and which contains areas less than 9 feet in

6 width on what the EBRPD calls Lower Morrison Canyon Road. Vargas Road, a portion of which

7 is owned and maintained by the City of Fremont and another portion of which is owned and

8 maintained by the County of Alameda, is a rural residential road, varying in width from

9 approximately 12 to 18 feet. Both roads have sharp horizontal curves and at least one sharp

10 vertical curve, with limited sight distance, and are below City of Fremont standards for

11 residential roads. It has been acknowledged by both EBRPD and the City of Fremont that these

1.2 roads are substandard." (First Amended Verified Complaint for Petition for Writ of Mandate,

13 Alameda County Superior Court Case No. HG08385193, Jack Balch and Christopher George V.

14 East Bay Regional Parks District (the "George Petition").)

15 114. The George Petition alleged in part:

16 "4. In addition, EBRPD also violated CEQA by:

1.7 (A) Failing to assess the environmental effects and related safety issues along

18 Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon Road generated from the Larger Project and

19 the phasing of the Larger Project, including Phase I and any limited opening of

20 the Park to the public in summer 2008.

21 (B) Failing to adequately assess the traffic and resulting adverse

22 environmental impacts and related safety issues along Vargas Road and Morrison

23 Canyon Road from the Larger Project and the phasing of the Larger Project,

24 including any limited opening of the Park to the public in summer 2008.

25 (C) Failing to adequately assess the parking needs generated by the Larger

26 Project and the phasing of the Larger Project, including any limited opening of the

27 Park to the public in summer 2008.

28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 31

1 (D) Failing to undertake a traffic study of Vargas Road and Morrison Canyon

2 Road and instead a relying merely on a traffic count on Vargas Road prior to

3 approving the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration and Land Use

4 Plan.

5 (E) Delegating to the City of Fremont implementation of unspecified

6 mitigation measures and failing entirely to assess the adverse impacts on County

7 owned portions of Vargas Road and how those will be mitigated.

8 (F) Failing to adopt a monitoring plan to ensure implementation of mitigation

9 measures.

10 (G) Failing to respond to ongoing comments by resident neighbors concerning
11 the conditions of Vargas and Morrison Canyon Roads and mitigation necessary to
12 accommodate additional traffic."

13 115. The George Petition also complained that EBRPD had intended to construct a
14 parking lot at the Regional Park, one with 25 spaces and the other with 40 to 60 spaces.
15 116. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege a settlement was reached
16 in 2012 in which the EBRPD was required to make certain improvements to Morrison Canyon
17 Road and limit the parking lot to 25 spaces, but Mr. George and Mr. Balch filed a second lawsuit
18 in 2016, Balch v. East Bay Regional Park District, Case No. RG16814952, Alameda County of
19 Superior Court, alleging the road improvements were not performed in accordance with the

20 settlement agreement. An April 2017 settlement was reached in the 2016 lawsuit, which called
21 for more road improvements.

22 117. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the improvements to
23 Morrison Canyon a Road made as a result of these lawsuits and settlement agreements amounted
24- to $300,000- $400,000, hardly sufficient to address the multiple, serious substandard road

25 deficiencies and safety hazards alleged by the George Petition, and shared by Petitioners.

26 118. RPI also have constructed a parking lot on the Properties which may
27 accommodate up to 100 cars, and this is four times the limit on the number of spaces that Mr.

28 George insisted on for the EBRPD lot.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 32

1 119. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege RPI have hosted events at

2 the Properties with over 40 cars in attendance on multiple occasions in recent years.

3 120. Despite the fact that Morrison Canyon Road and Vargas Roads remain

4 substandard, as they were at the time of the filing of the George Petition, Mr. George and the

5 County have claimed and/or determined that CEQA review for the Project and/or the Permitted

6 Project is not required when The Properties are essentially a park, resort, event facility, brewery

7 and/or winery that is comparable in area and has as many peak hourly visitors, if not more, than

8 the adjacent East Bay Regional Park he shut down for the very same concerns alleged in this

9 Petition. (The Properties have 700 acres and Vargus Plateau Regional Park has approximately

10 1200 acres.) In other words, the Regional Park is subject to vigorous CEQA review, but Mr.

11 George's own "park" is not.

12 VII. THE COUNTY'S DISCRETIONARY APPROVALS

13 AND THE CODE AND PERMIT ENFORCEMENT ACTION

14 121. Although the County has not issued any approvals, discretionary or otherwise,

15 with respect to the Project as a whole or the Permitted Project as a whole, the County did issue

16 discretionary approvals with respect to certain individual components of the same, including but

17 not limited to the "barn" and the courtyard. The County issued permit number BLD2014-02739

18 for the foundation of the 12,000 square foot "barn" on or about February 6, 2015, and BLD2014-
19 01654 for the construction of the same on or about November 5, 2015. The County issued

20 permit number BLD2014-02024 on or about August 29, 2014 for retaining walls. No other

21 applications for permits (other than renewals for these permits) were submitted or other permits

22 issued until November 21, 2017 for the courtyard.

23 122. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege, based on a journalistic
24 investigation arising out of the 2014-2015 Report of the Alameda County Grand Jury, that the
25 permits for the "mini palace of Versailles", or "barn". were fast-tracked and avoided CEQA

26 review in a highly irregular manner. Prior to their issuance, the County Planning Department

27 wrote the following assessment in an email communication dated July 14, 2014: "Please do not

28 issue any permits at this time. It's part of a much larger project that does require CEQA and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 33

1 rezoning." (Ex. B.) Regardless of this directive, Respondent issued the permits for the "barn"

2 just a few months later, without any CEQA review.

3 123. In or around 2016, Petitioners began complaining to the County about the "barn"

4 only. Not the Project as a whole, or any other component of the Project, not the Permitted

5 Project or any component of the Permitted Project, just the "barn". At that time, the "barn" was

6 the "project", and the only component of what eventually evolves into the Project as a whole

7 defined herein.

8 124. For about a year, Petitioners do not hear a word from the County regarding their

9 complaints about the "barn". Finally, in or around summer or fall of 2017, after Petitioners

10 complained to the County about the barn and other components of the Project that they had

1.1 learned of that summer, the County engaged in a code and enforcement action that reinforced, or

12 should have reinforced, what it had known as of 2014---that the "barn" is no barn, but an event

13 center that is "part of a much larger project that does require CEQA and rezoning."

14 125. Albert Lopez, Planning Department Director for the County, states in a July 11,

15 2017 internal email, "it a came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of

16 Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter

17 saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It

18 was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself

19 was permitted by BID [Building Inspection Dept] and we signed off on it. We went back and

20 forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an

21 existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA."

22 126. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that the County's decision

23 to exempt the "barn" from CEQA, its zoning approval for the building permit for the "barn", and
24  the approval of the building permit itself, were discretionary actions that required the exercise of
25 personal judgment and deliberation. The discretionary actions would have had the ability to

26 mitigate environmental damage, in that the County admitted it knew the "barn" "was clearly

27 being planned to be something other than a barn" (personal judgment), admitted it "went back

28 and forth on CEQA" (deliberation) and "ultimately determined", (personal judgment and

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 34

1 deliberation), that the "barn" was exempt from CEQA. During the latter half of 2018, for at least
2 five months, the County was deeply involved in deliberations regarding the "barn" and whether
3 to approve it, contrary to statements the County has made under penalty of perjury in this case.
4 The County did much more than just check the boxes on the building permit application. They
5 even accepted, after much deliberation, a CEQA "report" on the "barn" allegedly prepared by
6 RPI's own private environmental consultant, when they knew it was a part of much larger
7 project. In fact, the agricultural exemption was denied at first.

8 127. The County did not simply determine whether zoning allowed the "barn" to be
9 built in the requested location, it also exercised personal judgment and deliberation in
1.0 determining whether or not the "barn" was in fact a barn, if it was going to be actually used as a
11 barn, what conditions, if any, should be attached to the County's approval of it, and finally,
12 whether or not it should be approved. The County used its personal judgment as to the wisdom
13 and/or manner of carrying out this subsidiary "barn" project, and County emails from this time
14 frame offer abundant evidence of the same.

15 128. Just because the County did not make any effort to mitigate the potential
16 environmental damage, does not imply or demonstrate that they did not have the authority or
17 discretion to do so. If the County had made the correct determination that the "barn" is not a
18 barn and was not going to be used as a barn, the approvals as they are would not have issued.
19 RPI would have had to obtain a conditional use permit prior to construction, a zoning variance
20 and/or adjustment, each of which would require CEQA review and discretionary approvals as
21 Respondent has admitted.
22 129. Approximately three years after the first permit was issued for the "barn,' RPI
23 sought County approval to construct the entertainment courtyard, literally attached to the event
24 center. At the same time, however, on or about August 17, 2017,-RPI -wrote-a-letter-to-the-----
25 County in which they admitted that the "barn is not to be used a as a traditional barn", "no animals
26 nor equipment nor stables [sic] housed in this barn". but RPI intend to use the "barn" "as
27 indicated on the plans submitted to you and the county." (Ex. D.) The plans submitted to the
28

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 35

1 County indicate that the actual intended use for the 12,000 square foot structure is for a banquet

2 hall with assembly occupancy.

3 130. During this time frame, while RPI were actively seeking County approval for the

4 building permit for the entertainment courtyard, the County had also opened a code enforcement

5 investigation, likely because of Petitioners complaints. RPI regularly relied on Shawn Wilson,

6 Chief of Staff to County Supervisor Bob Haggerty, as their point man in communications with

7 the County.

8 131. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Mr. Wilson exercised

9 undue political influence to demand the staff of the County issue the required building permits.

10 Mr. Wilson sent dozens if not hundreds of emails to the County on behalf of RPI as a part of the

11 endeavor to exert influence, and it ultimately worked. The County approved the courtyard, but

1.2 not before exercising its discretion over the course of several months in determining whether or

13 not to provide it, and under what conditions.

14 132. Mr. Lopez, on July 11, 2017, wrote to Rodrigo Orduna in the Planning
15 Department: "Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show a

16 mini beach has been created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not

17 clear which structures are legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and

18 others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous

19 stock pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we

20 never authorized that work, and CEQA probably wasn't done. So I would start by digging out the

21 old file, see what was approved and what was already existing, and then compare that with what

22 is built today. Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting complaints, try and get

23 access to the site, which is remote." (Ex. C.)

2 133. Four months later, after the site visit to the Properties, Mr. Orduna wrote: "We

25 are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not designed to

26 be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom design and
27 construction, adjacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See attached pictures taken

28 this past Friday.) This begs the question, if used currently as an accessory entertainment building

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 36

1 for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum floor area for the residential buildings
2 and residential accessory buildings applies. I understand that the "barn" by itself, may already be

3 at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors combined) or close to it. If we are to add the house floor
area, the property would likely be over the maximum 12,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for
residential and residential accessory buildings, per ECA. We are trying to get the other County
6 departments and with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife to see about the adjacent
property, at 3163 Morris Canyon Road, Assessor's Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned

8 by Christopher George, to see about the beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after
months being told that it would soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of
10 the pond (I can't tell its size)." (Ex. E.)

11 134. An hour and a half later on the same day, Planning Director Lopez wrote to Mr.
12 Wilson, indicating the County knew the "barn" was being built for assembly and not agricultural
13 purposes: "We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the various activities on
14 the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure is being built for some kind of assembly use,
15 event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarily have to look at everything
16 given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our normal
17 process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to learn more about his

18 plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our varíous local ordinances." (Ex. E.)
19 135. In an email to Petitioner MPC on November 14, 2017, Planning Director Lopez
20 writes: "the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss [sic] the overall use of the
21 property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner"..
22 *[BJased on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being
23 looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to
24- discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an
25 ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all
26 the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.". "[NJo discretionary permits
27 have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement
28 process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 37

1 concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their

2 response." (Ex. C.) The use, however, has changed - from agriculture to event center - and

3 CEQA is required.

4 136. RPI were irate by November 2017, irked that the County had not provided its

5 approval for the building permit for the courtyard, and let the County know it. The County,

6 however, was concerned that the "barn" and the entertainment courtyard connected to the "barn",

7 were clearly not intended for agricultural use and occupancy. The County advised RPI that in

8 order to receive County approval for the courtyard, RPI would have to bring every existing

9 structure that had built illegally into compliance.

10 137. This did not go over well with RPI, so the County offered another alternative, a

11 Deed Use Restriction restricting use to agricultural use. Mr. George initially agreed to the deed

12 restriction, but then changed his mind and backtracked. So, no such deed restriction was signed
13 or recorded.

14 138. The County, however, once again made the wrong determination that the "barn"

15 is really going to be used as a barn, and concluded the courtyard attached thereto is really going
16 to be used for agriculture, once again avoiding CEQA review of anything.

17 VIII. CAUSES OF ACTION

18 First Cause of Action

19 Writ of Mandate - CEQA Violations

20 (Against Respondent)

21 139. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
22 paragraphs through 138 as though fully stated herein.

23 140. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to conduct any environmental analysis at
any time of the Project as a whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as

25 early as July 2014 that the "barn" was part of a much larger project that required CEQA,

26 rezoning and discretionary approvals.

27 141. Respondent also violated CEQA by piecemealing the Project and/or the Permitted

28 Project into separate sub-projects and approving each sub-project individually in order to avoid

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 38

1 complying with CEQA, and by exempting the "barn" and/or any other structure from CEQA

2 review, when it knew as early as July 2014 that the "barn" was a part of a much larger project

3 that required CEQA, rezoning, and discretionary approvals.

4 142. Respondent also violated CEQA by approving the discretionary permits for
construction of the "barn" and the courtyard, and approving them as to zoning, based on false

6 claims of agricultural use, and contrary to all the evidence. Respondent has admitted that if the

7 uses changes from agriculture, then CEQA will be required. The use has changed, the County

8 knows it, and CEQA is required.

9 143. Where the County has discretion, mandamus relief is available upon a
10 demonstration of an abuse of that discretion, or to compel the County to exercise discretion

11 where it has not done so. A decision is an abuse of discretion if it is arbitrary, capricious,
12 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

13 144. The County abused its discretion when it approved the building permits under the
14 Permitted Project as "agricultural" and thus without CEQA review, because these approvals
15 based on "agricultural" were entirely lacking in evidentiary support and are unlawful.
16 145. The County abused its discretion when it failed to conduct any review or

17 reporting in compliance with the provisions set forth under CEQA with respect to the Project as
18 whole, and/or the Permitted Project as a whole, when it knew as early as July 2014 that CEQA
19 was required, and that discretionary approvals were required.

20 146. The County abused its discretion when it determined that exemptions apply
21 individually to a portion of the Project and/or the Permitted Project, or that the approvals were all
22 ministerial approvals, versus determining whether any exemption applies to the Project or the

23 Permitted Project as a whole.

24 147. Petitioners seek a Court Order (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any

25 actions, uses, or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance
26 with CEQA's prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve
27 actions, use, or permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, or, in the

28 alternative, mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 39

1 consider the Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA,
2 including, but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted
3 Project as a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted
4 Project as a whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the
5 Project and/or the Permitted Project as whole (CCR § 15063), and the preparation of either an

6 environmental impact report or a negative declaration of the Project and/or the Permitted Project

7 as a whole.

8 148. Petitioners also seek a Court Order mandating the County to vacate, set aside,

9 rescind, and void all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made
10 by the County regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project,
11 including the rescission of all authorizations to proceed with construction, and any approvals
12 regarding exemption from CEQA.

13 149. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
14 Procedure section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action and the Court finds a significant benefit
15 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
16 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

17 Second Cause of Action

18 Public Nuisance

19 (Against Respondent and RPD)

20 150. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

21 paragraphs 1 through 149 as though fully stated herein.

22 151. Respondent, by abusing its discretionary authorities as described herein, has
23 created dangerous conditions on the Properties and to the surrounding area, including, but not
24- limited to, Morrison Canyon Road, that are probable and immiment. "RPI, as the proponent of
25 the Project and/or the Permitted Project, has also created the dangerous conditions on the

26 Properties and the surrounding area, and has admitted the existence of such dangerous conditions
27 by virtue of his own lawsuit against the East Bay Regional Parks District regarding Vargas

28 Plateau Regional Park adjacent to the Properties.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 40

1 152. These dangerous conditions, include, but are not limited to, dangerous traffic and

2 road safety conditions, harm to underground aquifers and streams near the Properties through

3 excess sewage and waste, harm to the riparian habitat and wildlife at or near the Properties,

4 including the next door East Bay Regional Park, and potential fire hazards in a high risk fire

5 zone.

6 153. These dangerous conditions affect the public at large, especially considering the
7 Vargas Plateau East Bay Regional Park is located right next to the Properties, and those who use

8 the park, access it via Morrison Canyon Road.

9 154. These dangerous conditions create an imminent and probable danger such that
10 RPI have hosted and will continue to host large events with hundreds of people and vehicles

11 using Morrison Canyon Road despite the fact RPI do not have the requisite permits to host such

12 events. While such permits are required by the County to host such events, RPI have flagrantly
13 disobeyed this requirement as alleged herein, and Petitioners are informed and believe and

14 thereon allege that RPI will continue to host large events and continue to build unabated at the

15 Properties regardless of whether they have the proper permits.

16 155. These dangerous conditions are those by which an ordinary person would be

17 reasonably annoyed or disturbed, not only because of the danger itself, but because the illegal
18 construction on the Properties has created the dangerous conditions, as well as the corrupt

19 manner in which they were allowed to be constructed.
20 156. The extent of the construction and the seriousness of the dangers, as described in
21 this Petition, outweighs the social utility of Respondent and RPI's illegal conduct and

22 construction, of which social utility there is none.

23 157. Petitioners have not consented to the Respondent's or RPI's conduct.

24 158. Petitioners have suffered harm that was different from the type of harm suffered
25 by the general public. Petitioner's suffered a special injury as a result of respondent's public
26 nuisance in that at a public meeting on May 1, 2019 a female agent, representative and/or

27 employee of RPI Christopher George destroyed personal property consisting of posters prepared

28 by and paid for by petitioner MPC and physically assaulted MPC member Laurence Edelson, for

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 41

1 which assault a police report was made, and a second male agent, representative and/or employee
2 of respondent Christopher George destroyed additional personal property consisting of additional

3 posters prepared by and paid for by petitioner MPC. The public meeting was to address the

4 closure of a portion of Morrison Canyon Road for public safety and environmental reasons and

5 the posters depicted a photograph of the "Versailles Barn, the letter signed by respondent George

6 to the effect that the alleged "barn" would not be used to store agricultural equipment, house

7 animals or contain stables, the LLC registration by respondent George related to beer and a

8 brewery, comments from a Fremont City Council meeting and/or public officials regarding the

9 narrow and dangerous condition of Morrison Canyon Road and a newspaper article regarding the
10 above-described issues.

11 159. But for MPC's core mission and direct involvement in the issues that are the

12 subject of the public nuisance, petitioner MPC would not have suffered the aforementioned

13 destruction of personal property and physical assault on one if its members.

14 160. Respondent's and RPI's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Petitioners
15 harm, such that the County and RPI, through their actions and inaction as described herein,

16 created the dangerous conditions on the Properties.

17 Third Cause of Action

18 Declaratory Relief

19 (Against Respondent)

20 161. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in

21 paragraphs 1 through 160 as though fully stated herein.

22 162. A dispute and an actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondent
23 concerning their rights and duties in that Petitioners contend, and Respondent denies, the
11 following:

25 a. That the Project as a whole and/or the Permitted Project as a whole require CEQA a
26 review;

27 b. That the Project, the Permitted Project, and/or portions thereof are not exempt

28 from CEQA;

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 42

1 C. That Petitioners fundamental rights have been violated.

2 163. Petitioners desire a judicial determination of the respective rights and duties of
3 Petitioners and Respondents with respect to CEQA applicability to the Project and/or the

4 Permitted Project.

5 164. Such declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time in order that

6 Petitioners and Respondent may ascertain Respondent's obligations under CEQA with respect to
7 the Project and/or the Permitted Project and Petitioners' rights.

8 Fourth Cause of Action

9 Injunctive Relief

10 (Against Respondent)

11 165. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the allegations contained in
12 paragraphs 1 through 150 as though fully stated herein.

13 166. Respondent has unlawfully issued authorizations for construction of the Permitted

14 Project and portions of the Project in violation of CEQA, and have failed to conduct CEQA

15 review of the Project or the Permitted Project as a whole, when the County knows it is required.
16 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the County unlawfully determined that
17 portions of the Project or the Permitted Project are exempt from CEQA.

18 167. Unauthorized construction and use is ongoing at the Properties. Petitioners are
19 informed and believe and thereon allege the brewing activities continue, and large events
20 continue to be held on a regular basis, using Morrison Canyon Road as access.

21 168. Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege large events, such as
22 weddings, have been and continue to be held at the Properties even though RPI do not have the
23 proper permits.
169.--Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege the damage done to the
25 environment already and in the future as a result of the Project and/or the Permitted Project
26 and/or portions thereof, as well as the illegal uses of the same, will continue unmitigated unless
27 the County and RPI are ordered to halt construction and all approvals pending a judgment by this
28 Court that CEQA review and reporting is required for the entire Project and/or Permitted Project.

THIRD AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 43

1 170. Petitioners demanded and requested that Respondent and RPI refrain from the
2 conduct alleged herein and sought CEQA compliance, but Respondent failed and refused the
3 requests and, unless restrained by an order of this court, will continue construction, and continue

4 to authorize construction and impermissible uses of the Properties.

5 171. By reason of the wrongful and unlawful acts, Petitioners have and will sustain

6 great and irreparable injury as described herein with respect to habitat and waterway alteration
and/or destruction and increased traffic and the safety issues presented due to the condition of
8 Morrison Canyon Road. It will be impossible for Petitioners to obtain adequate relief by way of

9 money damages, and therefore, is without an adequate remedy at law.
10 172. Petitioners seek temporary stay order, temporary restraining order, and
11 preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining RPI and Respondent, their agents, employees,
12 officers, and representatives from undertaking any construction, grading, excavation, order or

13 delivery of construction materials, installation or development, issuing any construction or
14 development approvals or permits, making any contracts, allowing or sponsoring any large
15 gatherings or assemblies whether for public use or private enjoyment in the "agricultural barn" or
16 on other portions of the Properties, or taking any other action to implement in any way the
17 Properties and any portion thereof pending judgment of this Court and/or compliance with
18 CEQA.

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners request judgment against Respondent as follows:
20 1. For a writ of mandate (a) enjoining Respondent from approving any actions, uses,
21 or permits on the Properties without complying with CEQA, including compliance with CEQA's
22 prohibition against piecemealing, (b) mandating Respondent to only approve actions, use, or
23 permits related to the Properties that consider the Project as a whole, a or, in the alternative,
4- mandating Respondent only approve actions or permits on the Properties that consider the
25 Permitted Project as a whole, and (c) mandating Respondent to comply with CEQA, including,
26 but not limited to, conducting a preliminary review of the Project and/or the Permitted Project as
27 a whole, (CCR § 15060), an evaluation of whether the Project and/or the Permitted Project as a
28 whole qualifies for an exemption under CEQA (CCR § 15061), an initial study of the Project

3 as a whole.

4 2. For a writ of mandate ordering the County to vacate, set aside, rescind, and void

5 all of the approvals, permits, actions, resolutions, decisions and findings made by the County

6 regarding any part of the Project, and/or any part of the Permitted Project, including the

turnaround Subject: Re: RE: Staff member for code enforcoment, and staff member for permitting of paved

... Coode

as.one I'II be in Oakland for a good chunk of the day, so T'il give you quick summary here. Jana worked on this of her last big projects, Chris George was the applicant - it came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than a barn, so we sent a letter saying if the use changes to something that is not ag related we would send

/

code enforcement. It was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself was permitted by BID and we signed off on it. We went back and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA. There was some talk of a possible brewery which is probably why D1 has been pushing for the ordinance to allow it. As of now, I have not heard of any reason to believe there is a brewery going on out there, but maybe there is. The interference of D1 was the subject of a grand jury report from 2015 I believe, so you can go back and read that if you want to.

Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to show a mini beach has been created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not clear which structures afe legal or not, but my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous stock pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we never authorized that work, and CEQA probably wasn't done.

So I would start by digging out the old file, see what was approved and what was already existing, and then compare that with what is built today, Maybe even call the applicant telling him we're getting complaints, try and get access to the site, which is remote. Access from Morrison Canyon is shared by EBRPD/Vargas Plateau which is one of the reasons Kelly has it out for Mr. George. George sued EBRPD due to a substandard roadway which closed access to the park (http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/07/15/neighbors-force-Just-opened-fremont-park-to-close/)for

.. •1 some time. I think Kelly actually lives in Fremont and uses the park, 8o he's now looking into Mr. George's business. I don't know the degree to which D1 would get involved now in a code enforcement action, but I'm assuming they would get minimally involved, and in D2 which doesn't have the same history/ties with the owner. I'm pretty sure the property is actually

Subject: Re: More Background - Historical images of the Vargas Plateau development
Thanks Chris for including us on this email string, I can hopefully provide some more baokground information about what is and what is not happening at the site. From its inception, the project has been proposed to be a non-commercial venue, it is being proposed for personal use and storage and the building permit that was obtained reflects this use. Based on recent complaints we have visited the site 2 times of the last month or so to look at the ongoing construction of the barn facility as well as discuss the overall use of the property and any other permits that may need to have been secured by the property owner.
The use of the main barn, as mentioned above, is not being proposed for anything other than storage and personal use, there is no proposal to open a brewery, winery or any other commercial activity at the site. Although the construction is of a quality not usually associated with a barn, this is a matter of personal taste and that is not something we regulate.
For various reasons we are also concerned about the use of the property going forward, especially given the condition of the road and other possible limitations of the site. To that end, the property owner has received a draft document that would limit the use of his property and has in concept agreed to language that could ultimately result in a recorded deed restriction.
Further based on the complaints that we have received, other structures on the property are being looked at as well, and the property owner has met several times with the building department to discuss what he needs to do to bring some of those structures into compliance. This is an ongoing code enforcement case and naturally we are working towards resolution and getting all the buildings on the parcel permitted and up to county code.
There is also some questions regarding the Williamson Act and whether or other uses on his property that are not related to agriculture. The uniform rules adopted by the county.. do allow other uses that are compatible with Agriculture and given not the owner can have

that the property owner will be okay in terms of what the Williamson Act requires. We are further looking into this issue and will have more information later. the large size of the parcel it's likely

-Ihope this is.helpful to dispel some-of the rumors about the potential-use of the-barn being constructed. This is an ongoing code enforcement case which will take some time to resolve fully, but I just wanted you to know that we are actively pursuing cach and every complaint that we have received, and are communicating with the property owner on an almost daily basis.
Also, there is nothing occurring on the property that believe conflicts with the East County area plan; references to some of the policies in that plan Idon't think are relevant to this discussion. It could be -.

that additional information comes forward that could change that conclusion but at this time I'm fairly confident in this determination.
Lastly, no discretionary permits have been required so far based on the proposed use, and if through the code enforcement process this remains true, then the CEQA process will not be necessary. We have forwarded the concerns related to biological habitat to the appropriate State officials, and are awaiting their response.
I'd be happy to discuss some of this over the phone if needed, I'll be out of the office after today until next week, which as is you know is a short week, so please let me know if you like to speak before then.

I'll be in Oakland for a good chunk of the day, so I'll give you quick summary here. Jana worked on this as one of her last big projects, Chris George was the applicant - it came in as a "barn" structure that looked more like a mini palace of Versailles. It was clearly being planned to be something else than barn, so we sent a letter saying if the use is changes to something that is not ag related we would send code enforcement. It was the best we could do at the time since the "barn" was legal land use-wise. The structure itself was permitted by BID and we signed off on it. We went back and forth on the CEQA process and ultimately determined that since it was being built to replace an existing barn over disturbed area, we exempted it from CEQA. There was some talk of a possible brewery which is probably why D1 has been pushing for the ordinance to allow it. As of now, I haye not heard of any reason to believe there is a brewery going on out there, but maybe there is. The interference of D1 was the subject of a grand jury report from 2015 I believe, so you can go back and read that if you want to.
Kelly has appeared at the PC twice, showing aerial photos that seem to shaw.a mini.beach has been- created, a tent structure and perhaps other smaller structures built. I'm not clear which structures ale legal or not, but: my sense is that some of them were pre-existing and others probably new - for sure the tent is new. The mini beach, with the disruption of a previous stook pond, sand import and waterfall/dam is concerning for habitat reasons. I'm pretty sure we never authorized that work, and CEQA probably wasn't done,

It was my understanding based on the meeting that Chris George will be removing the tent.
What I do not understand and perhaps you can help me with this one, but It was not clear what the County Planning department was investigating and why,
Or, does this Investigation stem from the comments made under public comment at the EBZA a few months back or was there something formal sent to Planning.

Greetings, Shawn.

We are trying to decide how anybody can think of that building as a barn. It is clearly not
designed to be used as a barn: radiant heat floors, approx. 300 amp electrical, custom
design and construction, adJacent deck, admitted use as family dance floor, etc. (See
attached pictures taken this past Friday.) This begs the question, If used currently as an

accessory entertainment bullding for the existing house, then the 12,000 sq. ft. maximum
floor area for the residential buildings and residentlal accessory buildings applles. I
understand that the "barn" by Itself, may already be at 12,000 sq. ft. floor area (both floors
combined) or close to It. If we are to add the house floor area, the property would Ilkely be
over the maxlmum 1.2,000 sq. ft. floor space threshold for residential and residentlal
accessory buildings, per ECAP.

[cld:image001.Jpg@01D34C1.9.858362F0J

We are trying to get the other County departments and with the State Department of Fish
and Wildllfe to see about the adjacent property, at 3163 Morrls Canyon Road, Assessor's
Parcel Number 096-0056-003-00, also owned by Christopher George, to see about the
beach, lawn, canopy that has not yet been removed after months being told that it would
soon be, gazebo built without permits on a deck at the edge of the pond (I can't tell its
size),

Hi Shawn, I thought I would weigh in but just with CDA staff. There has been one complaining party (he's been very public about his complalnt as well, see PC meeting minutes of 10/16.). He has taken It upon himself to see that enforcement is done, to the extent warranted by our local ordinances/codes. He's keenly aware of the pending brewery ordinance which was also at the PC for action when he was there (he's been there at least 3.tlmes). The PC has been receptive to hear him out, and the staff response has been that at this time we know of no unpermitted use (including a brewery), but that brewerles will become posslble very soon pending BOS action.
We don't know the owners final plans for the building and the varlous activities on the two parcels, but clearly the main large structure Is belng bullt for some kind of assembly use, event center or other larger gatherings of people. We will necessarlly have to look at everything given the amount and specificity of the complaints, and let it play out through our normal process. I encourage a meeting with Mr. George as soon as possible to learn more about his plans, so we can discuss how those plans align with our various local ordinances.

due diligence in trying to figure out what the right
permitting structure was..

5 They made that determination in 2014, when they
decided that this was a barn. It qualified as an

6 allowable use.

7 then. And they issued the building permit for it

8 So, again, to the extent that they're challenging
that decision, that happened a long time ago.

11 Petitioners are

1.2 saying it was permitted as a barn, but it
was built as something else.

13

14 That's not a problem for the county?
MS. KING: I think the structure was budlt
15 exactly as it was permitted. I don't think there is

16 evidence that the structure itself is different. any

17

18 I think what Petitioners are arguing is, they're

19 worried that there'g been a change in use, or that the
Georges intend to

20 change the uge and have it be an event
center, instead of a barn.

5 that the county is acknowledging that if there is a change
of use, that it, therefore, triggers CEQA review.
6 THE COURT: Right.

7 MR. JUSTI: Right. And we agree with that
8 position.

9 THE COURT: But have

10 that before? you heard the county say

11 MR. USTI: No.

12 THE COURT: So let me ask Mr. Ballesteros and
4a' 13 Mr. Cavin, if you agree with. that?

15 And for the record, if you want to go talk to
your client, you can do that.

16 MR. BALLESTEROS: No. I don't think we need to
17 talk to the client.

18 We

19 understand --. I think that's replete in the

20 e-mails and the communications back and forth between our
client and the county.

21 If you're really planning a commercial event

23 things.

24 We're going to make you jump through these hoops.
And Mr. George and hig wife are well aware of that.

2 plans say on top of them that the county stamped.
3 It's okay f I have a Quinceanera, a
4 graduation party, whatever, at my house? That doesn't
5 magically transform my house into an event center. And it
6 doesn't magically trigger CEQA review, even though my
7 house was built in 1992, or '89, or whenever the heck it
8 was built. 1M

10 different than what weive applied for, we're going to need
11 to jump through more hoops.

18 As Counsel suggested, if this were commercial
19 use, it would be different.

20 The use issue is not whether it's commercial or
21 private. It's whether it's a barn, or something other
