Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner SUPPORTERS ALLIANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

3 ("SAFER", "Petitioner") petitions this court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondents

4 CITY OF LOS ANGELES, LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL and LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT
OF CITY PLANNING ("Respondents" or the "City") and Real Parties in Interest ATLAS CAPITAL

6 GROUP LLC, and CHINATOWN STATION OWNER LLC ("Real Parties"). Petitioner challenges
7 Respondents' March 22, 2019 decisions, including: (1) certification of the Final EIR for the College
8 Station Project mixed-use development project; (2) adoption of related findings and mitigation
monitoring plan; and (3) approval of the College Station Project including entitlements of the Project
10 under VTT-74200-2A and CPC-2012-2054-GPA-ZC-HD-MCUP-SPR.

11 2. Because the EIR violates several of CEQA's requirements, the approvals that are reliant
12 upon it must be overturned. Additionally, the Project does not contain the amount of affordable housing
13 required by Measure JJJ. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct Respondents to
14 set aside the EIR certification and Project approvals.
15 PARTIES

16 3. Petitioner SAFER is California nonprofit public benefit corporation with members who
17 live and/or work in the County of Los Angeles. The primary objective and purpose of SAFER is to
18 contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment; to advocate for programs, policies,
19 and development projects that promote not only good jobs but also healthy natural environment and
20 working environment, including but not limited to advocating for changes to proposed projects and
21 policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve

22 wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with
23 applicable land use ordinances; to work to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the environment
24 without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable and unintended consequences; to
25 promote environmentally sustainable businesses and development projects, including providing
26 comments raising environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects; to advocate
27 for changes to proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between employment,
28 the human population, and resource use which will permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of

1
• Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F life's amenities by the general public; to take steps to preserve important historic, cultural, and natural

2 aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment which supports

3 diversity and variety of individual choice; and to carry on other charitable and educational activities

4 associated with this goal as allowed by law. SAFER's members who live and/or work near the Project

5 have several legally cognizable interests in the Project and will be negatively affected by the Project's

6 adverse environmental impacts and improper approval. The interests of Petitioner and its members are

7 unique and will be directly impacted by the Project. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself, their

8 members, and in the public interest. Petitioner and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in

9 Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be
10 directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates provisions of law as set forth in this

11 Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of life in the
12 surrounding community. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial
13 benefit on the public by protecting the public from the procedural, environmental, and other harms
14 alleged herein.

15 4. Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation in whose jurisdiction the
16 Project will be located.

17 5. Respondent the Los Angeles City Council ("City Council") serves as the legislative body
18 of the City of Los Angeles for the planning and provision of services related to public needs and the

19 requirements of state laws. As the elected representatives of the people of the City of Los Angeles, the
20 members of the City Council establish overall City priorities and set policy. Respondent City Council is
21 the governing body of the City, and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the
22 Project. The City Council voted on March 22, 2019 to approve the Project, including certification of the
23 EIR.

24 6. Respondent Los Angeles Department of City Planning is the "lead agency" for the
25 Project for purposes of Public Resources Code $21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting

26 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

27 7. Real Party in Interest Atlas Capital Group LLC, (*Atlas") is a California limited liability
28 corporation with a principal place of business at 699 Lewelling Blvd., Suite 146, San Leandro,

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

California, 94579. Atlas Capital Group, LLC is listed on the Notice of Determination as the Project

2 applicant.

3 8. Chinatown Station Owner LLC ("CSO") is a Delaware Corporation with a principal

4 place of business at 450 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10022. Chinatown Station Owner, LLC is

5 listed on the City's Initial Study, Draft Environmental Impact Report, and Final Environmental Impact

6 Report as the Project applicant.

7 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

9 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and

10 21168.5.

11 10. Venue is proper in Los Angeles County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil
12 Procedure section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Los Angeles.

13 11. Venue is proper in this Court under California Code of Civil Procedure §§394 (actions
14 against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally) because Respondents include a city

15 and local agencies based in the County of Los Angeles and because the cause of action alleged in this

16 Petition arose in the County of Los Angeles and the Project will occur within the County of Los

17 Angeles.

18 STANDING

19 12. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because they are
20 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Petitioner
21 has a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the

22 Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as
23 set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial harm to the natural environment and the quality of

24 life in the surrounding community. In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the

25 environment will be adversely affected and injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA when

26 certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

27 13. Petitioner actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process in an
28 attempt to ensure Respondents complied with CEQA and all other applicable laws.

3
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 14. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

3 Petition. Petitioner have actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

4 prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice of

5 determination. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

6 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

7 15. CEQA allows petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ petition all

8 deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th

9 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written
10 comments on the Project, and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
11 16. Respondents have taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and adopting the

12 Approvals. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but not
13 limited to CEQA prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners
14 possess no effective remedy to challenge the Approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this

15 lawsuit.

16 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

17 17. On March 22, 2019, the City Council approved the Project subject to approval of the
18 Mayor.

19 18. On April 9, 2019, Respondents posted a Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the
20 approvals of the Project.
21 19. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondent's decision to certify the
22 Project EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the NOD. (Guidelines, §§ 15094, subd. (g),

23 15112, subd. (c)(1).) The 30th day after the April 9, 2019 NOD falls on Thursday, May 9, 2019.
24 20. Thus, Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of

25 limitations.

26 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

27 21. On May 1, 2019, Petitioner served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit, in

28 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1: Notice of Intent to File

4
/erified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 Petition Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.)

2 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

3 22. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects
4 to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. (See Exhibit 2: Petitioner's Notice of Intent to

5 Prepare Record.)

6 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

7 23. Petitioner brings this action as private attorney generals pursuant to Code of Civil

8 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting
9 the public interest.
10 24. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the
11 general public by requiring Respondents to carry out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws
12 before approving the Project.

13 25. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
14 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally adequate
15 analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has meaningful opportunity to review and
16 comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

17 26. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees
18 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party will proceed with a plan and
19 development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise have
20 been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible

21 mitigation measures.

22 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

23 27. Petitioner asserts that Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously when certifying the
24 EIR and approving the Project.

25 28. In accordance with Government Code section 800, and other applicable laws, Petitioner
26 is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this Petition to overturn Respondents' arbitrary or
27 capricious actions.

28

5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

IRREPARABLE HARM

2 29. Petitioner and its members live and/or work near the Project site and in the County of

3 Los Angeles. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents' failure to provide

4 environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the Project's true

5 impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental decision-

6 making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business owners in the

7 affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project. Petitioner is also

8 harmed by the failure of the City to require Real Parties to comply with Measure JJJ, which would
9 require additional affordable housing and other public benefits.

10 30. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

11 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the
12 Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of
13 State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal remedy could fully

14 and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.
15 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

16 31. On March 15, 2018, the City released a Draft EIR for public review and comment

17 describing a Project including the development of up to approximately 642,239 square feet of floor area

18 within six residential buildings above a two-level podium structure and spatially arranged around a

19 series of garden courtyards in Los Angeles, California located at 129-135 W. College Street and 924 N.
20 Spring Street. The Project sought a General Plan amendment, zone change, and height district change.
21 32. The Project described in the Draft EIR ("DEIR") included construction of six buildings
22 with 770 dwelling units, including 355 studios, 360 one-bedroom units (including 10 townhomes), and

23 55 two-bedroom units, and up to approximately 51,390 square feet of retail, restaurant, and other
24 commercial space. The Project described in the EIR included no affordable housing, and only included
25 "market-rate" housing. According to the DEIR, the largest of the four retail spaces (37,520 square feet)

26 would front onto West College Street at the southern end of the Project Site and would be programmed

27 for use as a market, including a grocery store, restaurant, coffee shop, and juice bar. The three other

28 commercial areas would front onto Spring Street and include: (1) a 2,970-square-foot retail space; (2)

6
erified Petition for Writ of Mandate

F an 1,880-square-foot health club spa; and (3) a 9,410-square-foot retail space potentially including two

2 food retail spaces, a coffee shop, an ice cream store, and a barber shop. The Project's public open space
3 included two plazas and three outdoor "pocket" seating areas totaling approximately 15,697 square feet.

4 Vehicle parking totaling 1,179 stalls would be accommodated within one-and-one-half levels of
5 subterranean parking and two above-ground podium levels. A total of 899 bicycle spaces would also be

6 provided.

7 33. On August 31, 2018, the City issued the Final EIR ("FEIR") for the Project. The Project

8 I description in the FEIR was identical to that in the DEIR, with all 770 residential units being "market-
9 rate" housing, and none designated as affordable housing.
10 34. On November 6, 2018, the Advisory Agency of the City Planning Commission issued a
11 Letter of Determination stating that it had certified the FEIR and adopted the associated findings and
12 mitigation monitoring program.

13 35. The decision of the Advisory Agency was timely appealed to the Planning Commission.
14 36. On January 18, 2019, the Planning Commission approved the Project.
15 37. During the hearing several members of the Planning Commission raised concerns that
16 the Project did not include any affordable housing, and requested that the Real Parties to agree to 11%
17 affordable housing, which would have been required by Measure JJJ.

18 38. After a short recess, the Real Parties agreed to include a condition that 5% of the

19 residential units of the Project be affordable housing.
20 39. This revised Project was never described or analyzed in any CEQA document.
21 40. On February 6, 2019, Petitioner and other entities appealed the decision of the Planning
22 Commission to the Los Angeles City Council.

23 41. On March 6, 2019, Petitioner submitted extensive written comments regarding the FEIR
24 to the Planning and Land Use Management Committee of the Los Angeles City Council ("PLUM").
25 Petitioner submitted the expert comments of certified traffic engineer Daniel T. Smith, PE. According
26 to Mr. Smith, the FEIR failed to account for traffic from Dodger Stadium, located less than a half-mile
27 (0.38 miles) away from the Project site. Mr. Smith also pointed out that the FEIR utilized an improper
28 baseline from which to analyze the Project's traffic impacts because the FEIR used traffic counts taken

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 in 2015 to establish existing conditions at the Project site even though the DEIR was not released until

3 March of 2018. Mr. Smith also noted that the FEIR failed to address cumulative impacts on traffic from

4 the numerous other projects under development near and around the Project.

42.

5 Petitioner noted that, due to the Project site's history of being a rail freight yard, the

6 FEIR was flawed for its failure to identify existing soil and groundwater conditions at the site, which

7 would be necessary to identify and mitigate the potential risks to construction workers, future on-site
workers, nearby residents, and potential groundwater impacts.

8 43.

9 Petitioner also submitted the expert comments of certified industrial hygienist Francis

10 Offerman, PE, CIH. Mr. Offerman concluded that the cancer risk of the Project due to formaldehyde in

11 composite wood materials would be between 120-180 in one-million, far in excess of the South Coast

12 Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") CEQA significance threshold of 10 in one-million.

44.

13 Petitioner also submitted an expert comment letter from the environmental consulting

14 firm Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE"). SWAPE concluded that the FEIR failed to

15 adhere to the guidance documents published by both the Office of Environmental Health Hazard

16 Assessment (OEHHA) and SCAQMD by failing to conduct an operational health risk assessment

17 (*HRA") for the Project. SWAPE conducted an operational HRA for the Project and concluded that the

18 cancer risk from the operation of the Project would be 120 in one-million, in excess of the South Coast

19 Air Quality Management District ("SCAQMD") threshold of 10 in one-million.

45.

20 SWAPE concluded that the EIR failed to make a significant attempt to evaluate or

21 reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions beyond compliance with basic GHG reduction measures

22 that all projects are required to implement, that the FEIR failed to adequately evaluate the Project's

23 GHG impact according to applicable SCAQMD guidance, and that the EIR's method of determining

24 significance neglected current, applicable scientific knowledge and regulatory schemes regarding GHG
emissions reductions.

25 46.

26 Petitioners also pointed out that the FEIR failed to account for the Project's impacts on
the nearby Los Angeles State Historic Park.
27 47.

28 Lastly, Petitioners noted that the FEIR failed to include sufficient affordable housing in
conflict with Measure JJJ and the City's General Plan and explained that lack of affordable housing

8
/erified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 has led to an increase in homelessness, which then contributes to urban decay.

2 48. On March 19, 2019, the PLUM Committee held a hearing and recommended that the
3 City Council approve the Project. At that hearing, a staff member of the Planning Commission stated

4 that Measure JJJ did not apply to the Project because the Project had been deemed complete in 2012 for
5 the purposes of the California Permit Streamlining Act.

6 49. On March 22, 2019, the Project came before the City Council for final approval subject
7 to the Mayor's approval. On March 21, 2019, Petitioner submitted written comments to the City

8 Council, incorporating Petitioner's previous comments and expanding on Measure JJJ and the Project's
9 lack of affordable housing. Petitioner noted that Measure JJJ went into effect on December 16, 2016.

10 Petitioner then explained that, pursuant to Measure JJJ, if a project resulted in a residential density
11 increase greater than 35%, then 5% of the total units must be affordable to Extremely Low Income
12 households and another 6% or 15% of the total units must be affordable to Very Low Income
13 households or to Lower Income households, respectively. If a project required a General Plan
14 amendment, zone change or height district change to allow a residential use where not previously
15 allowed, then 5% of the total units must be affordable to Extremely Low Income households and
16 another 11% or 20% of the total units must be affordable to Very Low Income households or to Lower
17 Income households, respectively. Moreover, projects within a one-half mile radius of a Major Transit
18 Stop, as defined in the Public Resources Code, are only eligible for Transit Oriented Community
19 ("TOC") incentives under Measure JJJ if at least 11% of the units are affordable for Very Low income
20 households, at least 20% of the units are affordable for Lower Income households, or at least 7% of the
21 units are affordable for Extremely Low Income households. Petitioner also pointed out that, although
22 the Project had been "deemed complete" for purposes of the Permit Streamlining Act in 2012, nothing
23 in the text of Measure JJJ, which went into effect on December 16, 2016, indicated that the
24 requirements of Measure JJJ would not apply to the Project, whose DEIR was not circulated for public
25 comment until March 15, 2018.

26 50. On March 22, 2019, the City Council approved the Project, and its CEQA
27 documentation, and refused to require compliance with Measure JJJ.

28 51. On April 9, 2019, the City Council issued a Notice of Determination for its decision

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

P approving the Project.

2 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA

3 52. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse

4 environmental effects without first undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing the

5 significant environmental effects of those projects whenever feasible.

6 53. CEQA mandates that "the long-term protection of the environment ... shall be the

7 guiding criterion in public decisions" throughout California. (PRC $21001(d).) CEQA requires

8 environmental factors to be considered at the "earliest stage. before [the project] gains irreversible
9 momentum," Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284 n.28, "at a point in the planning process

10 where genuine flexibility remains." (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296,
11 307 [internal quotation marks and citation omitted].) Moreover, "the 'foremost principle' in

12 interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible
13 protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Communities for
14 a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
15 54. CEQA generally requires that lead agency prepare and certify an EIR for any project
16 that may have a significant effect on the environment to identify those effects, alternatives to the

17 project, and mitigation of the effects. (PRC §$21002.1(a), 21061, 21100(a).)
18 55. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental effects of its

19 proposed actions in an EIR if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead

20 agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (PRC §21080(d).) A
21 "project" is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken or supported by a public agency "which may

22 cause either a direct physical change in the a environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

23 change in the environment." (PRC §21065; CCR §15378(a).)

24 56. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers

25 and the public about a project's environmental effects. (14 CCR §15002(a)(1).) "The EIR process

26 protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Laurel Heights Improvement

27 Ass'n v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

28 57. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to identify ways to avoid or reduce

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 environmental damage and prevent such damage "by requiring changes in projects through the use of

2 alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible."
3 (14 CCR §15002(a)(2), (3).) Put another way, "agencies are required to give major consideration to

4 preventing environmental damage" and "should not approve a project as proposed if there are feasible
5 alternatives or mitigation measures available that would substantially lessen any significant effects that

6 the project would have on the environment.3 (14 CCR §15021(a).)
7 58. CEQA requires the lead agency to conduct an "initial study" with respect to

8 environmental effects. (14 CCR §15063(a).) The initial study must describe "the environmental
9 setting" of the Project. (14 CCR §15063(d)(2).)
10 59. CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze all significant environmental effects of its
11 proposed actions in an EIR. (PRC §21100(b)(1); 14 CCR §15126(a).) The EIR must not only identify
12 the effects, but must also provide "information about how adverse the adverse impact will be."
13 (Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 831.)
14 60. "CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR 'whenever it can be fairly argued on the
15 basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact." (Quail
16 Botanical Gardens Found., Inc. v. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602 [quoting No Oil,
17 Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75].) The point is to a "impose a low threshold
18 requirement for preparation of an EIR." (No Oil, 13 Cal.3d at 84.) By definition, "expert opinion
19 supported by fact" constitutes substantial evidence. (PRC §21080(e)(1); 14 CCR §15064(f)(5).)
20 61. A project may have a significant effect on the environment if "possible effects of a
21 project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable," meaning "that the incremental effects
22 of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects,
23 the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (PRC §21083(b)(2).)
24 The definition of "cumulative impacts" is "two or more individual effects which, when considered
25 together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts." (14 CCR
26 §15355.) These "individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or a a number of
27 separate projects." (14 CCR §15355(a).)
28 62. If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 the project only if it has "[e]liminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the

3 environment where feasible" and finds that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are
"acceptable due to overriding concerns." (14 CCR §15092(b)(2).)

4 63.

5 If a proposed project "would not have a significant effect on the environment," then the

6 "lead agency" prepares "negative declaration" or a "mitigated negative declaration" instead of an
EIR. PRC $§21064, 21064.5, 21080(c).

7 64. An abuse of discretion under CEQA may be shown either because an agency failed to
8 proceed in the manner required by law or reached factual conclusions unsupported by substantial

9

10 evidence. (E.g., Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 935.) A

11 procedural failure is reviewed de novo; in contrast, greater deference is accorded an agency's factual

12 conclusions. (Id.) In any event, "the reviewing court is not to *uncritically rely on every study or

13 analysis presented by a project proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or

14 is unsupported study is entitled to no judicial deference.3 (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v.

15 Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355 [quoting Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 409 n. 12].)

16 There is a prejudicial abuse of discretion "if the failure to include relevant information precludes

17 informed decisionmaking and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the

18 EIR process." (Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712 [citing
Laurel Heights, 47 Cal.3d at 403-05].)

19 65. The EIR is an informational document that must accurately describe the project being
20 considered, accurately disclose any potentially significant environmental impacts of the project, and

21

22 inform decision-makers and the general public of mitigation measures and alternatives to the project
that would avoid or substantially lessen those impacts.

23 66.

24 CEQA is designed to ensure that the public lead agency identifies all potentially

25 significant environmental impacts of a proposed project, adequately discloses those impacts to the
public, and implements all feasible alternatives or mitigation measures necessary to avoid or
26 substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21100; CEQA Guidelines, §§

27 15126.6, 15370.)

28 67. It is improper for an EIR to defer its analysis or the formulation of mitigation measures

12
Jerified Petition for Writ of Mandate

until after certification of the EIR and approval of thé project, and mitigation measures must be

2 enforceable and contain specific enforcement standards. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4.

68. The EIR must also evaluate any impacts of the project that may be "cumulatively
4 considerable," and address the project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of past,

5 current, and probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064, subd. (h)(1), 15130, subd. (a),

6 15355.)

7 69. A lead agency cannot certify an EIR and approve a project with significant

8 environmental effects unless the agency makes a series of detailed findings. These include findings that

9 changes or alterations have been required that mitigate or avoid the project's significant effects on the
10 environment, or that specific considerations render the mitigation measures or alternatives "infeasible"
11 but that the benefits of the project nonetheless outweigh the project's significant environmental effects.

12 The lead agency's findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.
13 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091-15093.)
14 70. Noncompliance with the requirements outlined above constitutes prejudicial abuse of
15 discretion under sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, regardless of whether a
16 different outcome would have resulted if the lead agency had complied with those requirements in the
17 first place. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.) Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not
18 proceeded in a manner required by law or if the agency's determination or decision is not supported by
19 substantial evidence in the administrative record. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
20 71. Acting as the CEQA lead agency, Respondent had a mandatory duty to comply with
21 CEQA prior to approving the discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

22 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OF MEASURE JJJ

23 72. Measure JJJ, as codified at Los Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC") section 11.5.11,
24 was approved by Los Angeles voters on November 8, 2016 and became effective on December 13,

25 2016.

26 73. The residential affordability requirements of Measure JJJ apply to projects with ten or
27 more residential units which seek: (1) a discretionary General Plan Amendment; (2) any zone change or
28 height-district change that results in increased allowable residential floor area, density, or height; or (3)

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 a residential use where such use was not allowed previously. (LAMC § 11.5.11(a).)

2 74. Pursuant to Measure JJJ, "Rental Projects" which satisfy at least one of the above

3 provisions must provide the following:

4 (i) No less than the affordability percentage corresponding to the level of density increase
5 as provided in California Government Code Section 65915(f), inclusive of any Replacement Units; or
6 (ii) If the General Plan amendment, zone change or height district change results in a

7 residential density increase greater than 35%, then the Project shall provide no less than
5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income households, and either

8 6% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income households or 15% of the total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households, inclusive of any Replacement
9 Units: or

10 (iii) If the General Plan amendment, zone change or height district change allows a residential use where not previously allowed, then the Project shall provide no less than
11 5% of the total units at rents affordable to Extremely Low Income households, and either 11% of the total units at rents affordable to Very Low Income households or 20% of the
12 total units at rents affordable to Lower Income households, inclusive of any Replacement
Units. (LAMC § 11.5.11(a)(1).)
13 75. Measure JJJ also contains alternative compliance options under which a project can
14 satisfy Measure JJJ's affordability provisions without providing affordable units on-site. These
15 alternative compliance options are (1) construction of affordable units off-site, (2) acquiring property
16 containing "At-Risk Affordable Units," or (3) payment of an in-lieu fee. (LAMC § 11.5.11(b).)
17 76. In addition to affordability requirements, projects subject to Measure JJJ must meet the
18 following labor standards:
19 All building and construction work on the project will be performed at all tiers by
20 contractors which (a) are licensed by the State of California and the City of Los Angeles;

21 (b) shall make a good-faith effort to ensure that at least 30% of all their respective workforces' construction workers' hours of Project Work shall be performed by
22 permanent residents of the City of Los Angeles of which at least 10% of all their respective workforces' construction workers' hours of Project Work shall be performed by
23 Transitional Workers whose primary place of residence is within a 5-mile radius of the covered project; (c) employ only construction workers which possess all licenses and
24 certifications required by the State of California and the City of Los Angeles; (d) pay

25 their construction workers performing project work the area standard wages in the project area; and (e) have at least 60% of their respective construction workforces on the project
26 from: (1) workers who have graduated from a Joint Labor Management apprenticeship training program approved by the State of California, or have at least as many hours of
27 on-the job experience in the applicable craft which would be required to graduate from

28 such a state approved apprenticeship training program, and (2) registered apprentices in an apprenticeship training program approved by the State of California or an out-of-state, federally-approved apprenticeship program. (LAMC § 11.5.11(i).)

14
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

77. Measure JJJ limits its applicability in only one scenario: "Notwithstanding any other
2 provision of this Section, the requirements of this section may be waived or adjusted only if a Project
applicant shows, based on substantial evidence, that compliance with its requirements would result in a

4 deprivation of the applicant's constitutional rights." (LAMC § 11.5.11(h) [emphasis added].)
5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Violation of CEQA
7 (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) (Code of Civil Procedure 8 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)
8 78. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs, in
9 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.
10 79. By relying on the EIR's flawed analysis of the Project, and approving the Project and
11 certifying the EIR, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion because their decision is not
12 supported by substantial evidence and because they failed to proceed in a manner required by law, as
13 follows:
14 A. Air Quality. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the impact of toxic air
15 contaminants ("TACs"). The EIR failed to include an operational health risk assessment ("HRA") using
16 the proper methodology required by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment
17 ("OEHHA"). The OEHHA HRA shows that the Project will create a cancer risk far above the
18 applicable CEQA significance threshold. Respondents abused their discretion by failing to employ the
19 proper HRA methodology, by failing to disclose the Project's significant cancer risks, and by failing to
20 adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. To the extent the EIR contains mitigation
21 measures, development of specific mitigation measures is impermissibly deferred.
22 B. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate
23 the Project's substantial adverse impact with respect to greenhouse gases ("GHGs"). The EIR concludes
24 that the Project's GHG impacts are less than significant, but the conclusions are not supported by
25 substantial evidence, as follows:
26 i. The EIR did not make a significant attempt to evaluate or reduce GHG
27 emissions beyond compliance with basic GHG reduction measures that all projects are required to
28 implement.

15
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

4 ii.

2 The EIR fails to adequately evaluate the Project's GHG emissions
according to applicable SCAQMD guidance.

3 iii.

4 The EIR's method of determining the significance of the Project's GHG

5 emissions neglects current, applicable scientific knowledge and regulatory schemes.

iv.

6 Expert evidence demonstrates that the Project will have significant GHG
impacts, exceeding applicable CEQA significance thresholds.

7 V.

8 Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

9 required by law by failing to disclose the Project's significant GHG impacts and by failing to propose
feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce those impacts. To the extent the EIR contains
10 mitigation measures, development of specific mitigation measures is impermissibly deferred.

11 C.

12 Indoor Air Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate

13 the Project's substantial adverse impact with respect to indoor air quality, and its conclusions are not
supported by substantial evidence, as follows:
14 i.

15 The EIR did not make a significant attempt to evaluate, analyze, or

16 mitigate the significant impacts of the Project on indoor air quality.

ii.

17 Expert evidence demonstrates that the Project will have significant indoor

18 air quality impacts, exceeding applicable CEQA significance thresholds.

iii.

19 The EIR impermissibly defers development of mitigation by failing to

20 propose specific feasible mitigation measures and environmentally superior alternatives.

D.

21 Public Services. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the

22 Project's impact on the Los Angeles State Historic Park. The EIR contains no analysis of the Project's

23 impact on the Los Angeles State Historic Park, despite the fact that the Park is located immediately
across the street from the Project site.

24 E.

25 Traffic. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's

26 substantial adverse impact with respect to traffic, and its conclusions are not supported by substantial
evidence, as follows:

27 i.

28 proper baseline. The EIR's traffic methodology violates CEQA it because it fails to use the

16
Terified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 ii. The EIR fails to consider and analyze the traffic from Dodger Stadium

2 located 0.38 miles from the Project site.

3 ili. The EIR fails to consider the cumulative impacts on traffic caused by the
Project and other projects which currently being developed or will foreseeably be developed.
iv. The EIR impermissibly defers development of mitigation by failing to

6 propose specific feasible mitigation measures and environmentally superior alternatives.
7 F. Hazardous Materials. The EIR fails to adequately respond to expert comments
pointing out significant soil contamination issues at the Project site. The EIR fails to analyze the soil
contamination and fails to propose adequate mitigation measures to address this impact. To the extent
10 the EIR contains mitigation measures, development of specific mitigation measures is impermissibly
11 deferred.

12 G. Cumulative Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate
13 the Project's substantial adverse cumulative impacts, and its conclusions are not supported by substantial
14 evidence. The EIR did not conduct an appropriate cumulative analysis, but instead merely assumed that
15 the Project's cumulative impacts would be less than significant if its individual impacts were less than
16 significant. By conducting the flawed analysis Respondents failed to a proceed in a manner required by
17 law. CEQA does not allow an agency to avoid looking at an incremental contribution to a cumulative
18 condition simply because a program- or project-level impact is less than significant. CEQA requires
19 consideration of the severity of existing environmental impacts because "the greater the existing
20 environmental problems are, the lower the threshold should be for treating a project's contribution to
21 cumulative impacts as significant." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources
22 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 120.)

23 H. Findings. Respondent failed to adopt legally adequate findings, supported by
24 substantial evidence, before approving the Project. Respondent lacked substantial evidence to
25 demonstrate the specific mitigation measures and alternatives proposed by expert commenters were
26 infeasible. As a result of the inadequacies in the environmental analysis identified above, the findings
27 adopted by Respondent are not supported by substantial evidence as required by CEQA. (Pub.
28 Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091, 15092, 15093.)

17
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

- 80.

2 a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

3 approving the Project in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and Petitioner is

4 entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate setting aside all approvals that were issued in reliance on the
certified EIR.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6

7 Violation of Los Angeles Municipal Code 11.5.11 (Measure JJJ)

81. (Code of Civil Procedure $ 1085 or in the alternative §1094.5)

8 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs, in

9 their entirety, as if fully set forth herein.

10 82. Measure JJJ applies to the proposed Project.

11 83. Respondents failed to require that the Project adhere to the requirements of Measure JJJ.

12 84. Respondents and Real Parties failed to justify their non-application of Measure JJJ by

13 providing substantial evidence that the enforcement of Measure JJJ would deprive the Real Parties in

14 Interest of their constitutional rights.

15 85. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents approved the Project in a manner that a

16 does not comply with the requirements of Measure JJJ and Petitioner is entitled to issuance of a writ of

17 mandate setting aside all approvals of the Project.

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as

20 follows:

21 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to:

22 (a) vacate and set aside its certification of the Final EIR, CEQA findings, statement

23 of overriding considerations, and approval of the Project on the grounds that adequate CEQA

24 compliance did not precede those actions;

25 (b) vacate and set aside its approval of the Project on the grounds that the City failed

26 to require Real Parties to comply with with Measure JJJ;

27 (c) comply with CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines in any subsequent action

28 taken to consider approval of the Project;

18

(d)

2 the Project. comply with Measure JJJ in any subsequent action taken to consider approval of

4 For a temporary and permanent stay to prevent Respondents and Real Parties in Interest

5 from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this

6 litigation and subsequent to the Court's issuance of a peremptory writ;

3.

7 For an order awarding Petitioners' attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section

8 1021.5, Government Code section 800, and other applicable authority;

4. For costs of suit; and

Dear Addressees:

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code ("PRC) § 21167.5, that Petitioner
Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility ("SAFER") (*Petitioner") intend to file a
Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the
California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), PRC § 21000 et seq., against Respondents
City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles City Council, Los Angeles Department of City Planning, and Mayor Eric Garcetti regarding challenging the March 22, 2019 decision of the City Council and the April 2, 2019 decision of Mayor Garcetti including their: (1) certification of the Final EIR for the College Station Project mixed-use development project; (2) adoption of related findings and mitigation monitoring plan; (3) approval of the College Station Project including entitlements of
