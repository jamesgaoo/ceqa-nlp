Petitioner, San Franciscans for Balanced and Livable Communities, alleges:
On January 21, 2021, the Regents of the University of California ("Regents"), on behalf of the
3 University of California, San Francisco, approved the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan
4 ("CPHP"), Long Range Development Plan Amendment #7, and Amendment #2 to the Physical Design
Framework (collectively referred to herein as the "Project"); and certified an Environmental Impact

6 Report ("EIR") for the Project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub.

7 Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).

8 2. The CPHP describes itself as a master plan-level guidance for the overall physical environment at

9 the Parnassus Heights Campus of the University of California, San Francisco. The CPHP consists of

10 four Initial Phase projects to be completed by 2030 including a new hospital, new research and academic
building, Irving Street arrival improvements, improvement to the existing Aldea Housing complex and
11 modifications to the boundary of the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve. The CPHP envisions future
12 phases that would be constructed through 2050. The CPHP calls for 2.9 million gross square feet of new
13 building space at the Parnassus Heights Campus. Because of the extensive new development
14 contemplated under the CPHP, the Project amends the 2014 Long Range Development Plan ("LRDP")
15 for the campus.
16 3. This action challenges Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of the EIR on
17 grounds that these decisions violate CEQA.
18 Parties

20 unincorporated association of residents and taxpayers of the City and County of San Francisco.

21 Petitioner has a strong interest in the preservation of the environment. Members of Petitioner include

22 residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the violations of

23 CEQA. Petitioner and its members submitted comments on the Project that addressed the inadequacies

24 of Respondents' environmental review and CEQA compliance.

19 or pending herein. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Respondents' true

20 names and capacities when ascertained.

21 12.

22 Petitioner is informed and believes that at all times herein alleged, Respondents and each of them

23 were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and while doing the things herein

24 alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency and employment.

13. Statute of Limitations

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

written notice of commencement of this action on February 17, 2021. The Notice of Commencement of

2 Action and Proof of Service are attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
3 15. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section
4 388, Petitioner has provided a copy of this pleading to the Attorney General's office. (See Exhibit 2
attached hereto.)
Jurisdiction and Venue

7 16. Petitioner brings this action in mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085,

8 1088.5, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5. The Court has jurisdiction
over these claims.
9
17.
10 Venue is proper in Alameda County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 393(b) because

11 the Project's environmental impacts will partially occur in Alameda County and pursuant to Code of
Civil Procedure section 394, subdivision (a), because the Regents are situated in Alameda County.
12 Standing
13 18. Petitioner and its members have a strong interest in the preservation of the environment.
14 Petitioner and, to the extent applicable, its members are beneficially interested in Respondents' full
15 compliance with CEQA. Petitioner's members include residents of San Francisco affected by the
16 Project whose interests will be adversely affected by Respondents' approval of the Project and
17 certification of the EIR
18 19. Members and representatives of Petitioner have submitted comments on and objections to
19 Respondents' lack of compliance with CEQA during the administrative proceedings leading to approval

20 of the Project. Accordingly, Petitioner is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources

21 Code § 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in the

22 litigation by individual members is not required.

23 20. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project.

24 Petitioner has the right to enforce the mandatory duties that CEQA imposes on Respondents.

25 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

21.
26 Respondents' approval of the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal
procedures.
27 22. In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Petitioner objected to
28 Respondents' approval of the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to

4 non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to Respondents during the public.

5 comment period for, or prior to the close of the public hearing on, the Project.

6 24. In the alternative, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (e), there was

7 no opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition

8 prior to Respondents' approval of the Project.
Private Attorney General Doctrine
25.
10 Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

11 section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public
interest.
12 26. Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons
13 by ensuring that Respondents complete adequate environmental review of the Project's environmental
14 effects.
15 27. Issuance of the relief requested herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting
16 the public interest. By compelling Respondents to complete adequate environmental review of the
17 Project's environmental effects, Petitioner will vindicate the public's important CEQA rights to public
18 disclosure regarding and public participation in government decisions that affect the environment.
19 28. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's

20 fees appropriate in this procceding because the transgressor is the agency whose duty it is to enforce the

21 laws at issue in this proceeding.

22 Factual Background

23 29. The Parnassus Heights Campus includes 107 acres in the Inner Sunset neighborhood of San

24 Francisco. The 61-acre Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve occupies the central and southern portion of

25 the campus.
30.
26 As described to the Regents in the staff report on the Project, in response to neighborhood

27 concerns about development of the Parnassus Heights campus site, in 1976 the Regents adopted a

28 resolution in connection with the 1976 LRDP entitled "Designation of Open Space Reserve, Alteration
of Campus Boundaries, Commitment of Houses to Residential Use, Authorization to Negotiate Sale of

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

Properties and Commitment to Transportation Studies, San Francisco" ("1976 Regents' Resolution").

2 31. The 1976 Regents' Resolution called for: (1) designating the Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve
3 as permanent open space; (2) altering the boundaries of the Parnassus Heights campus site to exclude
certain properties, making the new boundaries permanent, and prohibiting UCSF from further physical
expansion within a defined surrounding area; (3) establishing a cap on the total amount of structured

6 space within the campus boundaries so that it would not exceed 3.55 million gross square feet, excluding
space committed to residential use on certain streets and avenues (known as the "space ceiling"); (4)

8 converting certain former residential structures used as office space back to residential use; (5) selling

9 certain lots and structures on Third Avenue; (6) allocating funds to study traffic in the area; and (7)

10 recognizing the principle of administering the campus site so that the annual average daily population of

11 the campus site remains substantially in accordance with projections contained in the 1976 LRDP EIR.
This was: promise to the neighborhood in exchange for substantial development at the Parnassus
12 Heights Campus and other locations.
13 32. The 1976 Regents' Resolution excluded housing from counting against the space ceiling. As part
14 of the approval of the 2014 LRDP the 1976 resolution was revised to exclude housing known as the
15 "Aldea Housing" from counting against the space ceiling. The Aldea Housing was the only existing
16 housing excluded from counting against the space ceiling. Between the 1976 Regents' Resolution and
17 approval of the Project, Respondents never revised the space ceiling,
18 33. The 2014 amendment also tied the average daily population goal for the campus to the
19 projections contained in the most recent LRDP and removed references to aspects of the 1976 Regents'

20 Resolution that had already been fulfilled.

21 34. The 2014 LRDP also formally renamed the 1976 Regents' Resolution as the "Regents Action

22 Regarding the Parnassus Heights Campus Site."

23 35. The Project guts the space ceiling. The Project revises the 1976 Regents' Resolution to increase

24 feet of the space ceiling to 5.05 million gross square feet, or a net increase of 1.44 million gross square

25 space. Since housing was excluded from the calculation, the resulting development will be

26 approximately 6 million gross square feet, nearly doubling the space ceiling promised by the Regents in
the 1976 Resolution. Understandably, members of the public feel betrayed by the actions of UCSF,
27 which will result in buildings that overwhelm the neighborhood and campus environs.

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

First Cause of Action

2 (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

3 36. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the preceding paragraphs this Petition as though set
forth herein in full.

37.
5 The EIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's environmental impacts; identify and analyze

6 mitigation measures that would substantially reduce or avoid the Project's significant environmental
impacts; analyze a range of reasonable alternatives to the Project; or respond to significant
7 environmental comments on the Draft EIR.
8 38. Respondents' CEQA findings fail to make required findings; fail to support findings with
9 substantial evidence; and fail to adopt feasible alternatives that would substantially reduce or avoid the
10 Project's significant environmental impacts.
11 39. Examples of Respondents failure to comply with CEQA include, but are not limited to, the issues
12 discussed in the following paragraphs.
13 40. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's significant impacts on historically and culturally
14 significant buildings. The Project proposes to demolish UC Hall and the series of Zakheim murals

15 located within Toland Hall auditorium in UC Hall. The EIR finds that UC Hall and the Zakheim murals

16 are historically and culturally significant and their demolitions represent significant environmental

17 impacts. The EIR also finds that significant environmental impacts are "unavoidable" because

18 preserving these resources would be infeasible. The EIR's finding that preserving these resources is

19 infeasible is based on errors of law and is not supported by substantial evidence. Furthermore, the EIR

20 fails to analyze many buildings of historical significance. The EIR also fails to evaluate the Parnassus

21 Heights Campus as a "historic resource" or "historic district" defined in Public Resources Code section

22 5020.1. Therefore, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
41. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze and disclose the Project's impacts on beach water quality, water
23 recreation and wastewater public services. The EIR fails to adequately describe the environmental and
24 regulatory setting with respect to the severely degraded water quality conditions at San Francisco's
25 beaches, in both the bay and ocean, and the demonstrated ability of San Francisco's Combined Sewer
26 System to prevent these conditions and the ineffective regulatory system governing San Francisco's
27 sewage treatment plants. Moreover, the EIR's conclusions that water quality impacts will be less than
is 28 significant is based on errors in law. Therefore, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by

Law Offices of Thomes N. Llppe

Petition for Writ of Mandate (CEQA); Case No.

1 law.

2 42. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on air quality and air quality related
3 cancer risk.

4 43. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on energy usage.

5 44. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and climate

6 change.

7 45. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on transportation, including transit

8 capacity, Vehicle Miles Traveled, parking, and traffic congestion.
46.
9 The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's noise impacts.
47.
10 The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on aesthetics and visual resources.
48. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts from its inconsistency with local planning
11 and zoning controls, including zoning and other regulations governing scenic quality, land use, and other
12 environmental resources.
13 49. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's wind impacts.
14 50. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's land use impacts.
15|51. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on population and housing.
16 52. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on biological resources.
17 53. The EIR unlawfully defers its analysis of impacts caused by construction of the new hospital.
18 54. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's hazardous materials impacts.
19 55. 56. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's shadow impacts.

20 The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's impacts on public services.

21 57. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze the Project's growth inducing impacts.

22 58. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze a range of reasonable alternatives.

23 59. CEQA requires that Respondents provide adequate responses to comments raised during the

24 comment period for the Project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.) Respondents failed to adequately

25 respond to comments raised by Petitioner and others.
60. These violations of CEQA are described in more detail in the comment letters submitted to
26 Respondents regarding the Project and the Project EIR, including but not limited to the following letters:

2 Murals from Thomas Lippe on behalf of Petitioner.
61. Respondents must prepare an EIR that conforms with all of the procedural and substantive
4 requirements of CEQA. Certification of the Project EIR, which lacked both procedural and substantive
requirements under CEQA, constitutes an abuse of discretion.

6 62. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA.

7 63. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to conduct adequate

8 environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in a manner required by law in
approving the Project.
64.
10 At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with CEQA, prepare

11 adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of law. Notwithstanding such
an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform their duty to comply with CEQA and
12 all other relevant provisions of law.
13 65. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents are threatening to
14 proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said implementation of the Project will
15 irreparably harm the environment and will result in significant and unmitigated adverse environmental
16 impacts.
17 66. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation and development
18 in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure, degrade, and impact the
19 environmental values of the City and County of San Francisco and the State of California. Petitioner

20 will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

21 67. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction should issue restraining

22 Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

23 68. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent

24 injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the Project and adoption of the EIR.

25 Prayer for Relief

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief:
69. For a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9 and Code
27 of Civil Procedure sections 1085 or 1094.5:

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan and Long Range Development Plan Amendment #7
Dear Chancellor Hawgood and Regents of the University of California:
This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that on or before February 22, 2021, San Franciscans for Balanced and Livable Communities ("San Franciscans') intends to file a lawsuit challenging the January 21, 2021, adoptions of the the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan ("CPHP"), Long Range Development Plan Amendment #7, and Amendment #2 to the Physical Design Framework (collectively referred to as the "Project"); and certification of an associated Environmental Impact Report by the Regents of the University of California and the University of California, San Francisco. The action will challenge these decisions on grounds that they violate the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
San Franciscans is interested in discussing settlement of this dispute without the need for litigation. Given the short, 30-day statute of limitations that presumably applies here, however, San Franciscans will file the action forthwith. That said, San Franciscans proposes that the University meet with San Franciscans as soon as possible to discuss the CPHP project and to explore possible resolutions that might obviate the need for San Franciscans to continue to prosecute the action.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours, Tom Afgze
