13 LAND COMPANY, LLC, a California limited liability company (Lapis); RUBY PROPERTY
14 HOLDINGS, LLC, a Delaware corporation (Ruby); by and through their attorneys LeBeau-Thelen,
15 LLP, (collectively Plaintiffs), allege as follows:
16 INTRODUCTION
17 1. The Cuyama Valley Groundwater Basin (Basin) as defined by the California
18 Department of Water Resources (DWR) Bulletin 118 as Basin No. 3-013, encompasses an area of
19 about 378 square miles (approximately 8,685 acres) of which about 168 square miles are within Santa
20 Barbara County, 120 square miles are within Ventura County, 77 square miles are within San Luis
21 Obispo County, and 13 square miles within Kern County. A map of the Basin is attached hereto as
22 Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference.
23 2. Plaintiffs request that the court conduct a comprehensive groundwater adjudication
24 pursuant to Part 2, Title 10, Chapter 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure (commencing with Section 830,
25 et seq.) to determine all rights to extract and store groundwater in the Basin, whether based on
26 appropriation, overlying right, prescription or other basis of right, and use of storage space in the Basin
27 including but not limited to the relief set forth in section 834; for a preliminary injunction pursuant to
28
2
COMPLAINT FOR COMPREHENSIVE GROUNDWATER ADJUDICATION OF THE CUYAMA VALLEY
GROUNDWATER BASIN (NO. 3-013) QUIET TITLE AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 section 847, for a physical solution pursuant to section 849, for quiet title against adverse claims

2 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 760.010 et. sec., along with all declaratory, equitable and

3 legal relief appropriate in this comprehensive adjudication and to enter judgment based upon the

4 criteria set forth in section 850 (comprehensive adjudication).

5 3. This comprehensive adjudication is necessary to protect the Basin's limited water

6 supply that is vital to the health, safety and welfare of all persons and entities that depend upon waters

7 from the Basin, to ensure that the waters of the Basin are put to maximal reasonable beneficial use

8 pursuant to Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, and to sustainably manage the Basin

9 pursuant to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (Water Code §§ 10720-10737.8 et al.).

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 4. This court has initial subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

12 section 834.

13 5. Portions of the Basin lie within four counties: San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara

14 County, Ventura County and Kern County. Venue is initially proper in this court because a portion of

15 the lands, water rights and other real property that are the subject of this action are located within the

16 County of Kern. (Code Civ. Proc., § 392 (a)(1).) §

17 6. All judges of the Superior Courts of San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara County,

18 Ventura County, and Kern County are disqualified from hearing this action, and Plaintiffs request that

19 the chairperson of the Judicial Council assign a judge to preside over this comprehensive adjudication.

20 (Code Civ. Proc. § 838(a)(1).)

21 7. This comprehensive adjudication is presumed to be a complex action under Rule 3.400

22 of the California Rules of Court. (Code Civ. Proc., § 838(b).) Code of Civil Procedure sections 170.6

23 and 394 do not apply to this proceeding. (Code Civ. Proc., § 838(c).)

COMPLAINT FOR COMPREHENSIVE GROUNDWATER ADJUDICATION OF THE CUYAMA VALLEY GROUNDWATER BASIN (NO. 3-013) QUIET TITLE AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 12. Plaintiffs are informed and believe the Basin is, and has been, in a condition of long-

3 term overdraft as defined by Code of Civil Procedure, section 832, subdivision (d).

4 13. In 2014, the State of California adopted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

5 (SGMA) "[tJo provide for the sustainable management of groundwater basins," and "[t]o provide a

6 more efficient and cost-effective groundwater adjudication process that protects water rights, ensures

7 due process, prevents unnecessary delay, and furthers the objectives" of sustainable groundwater

8 management.

9 14. The Basin is one of 21 groundwater basins designated by DWR as being in a state of

10 critical overdraft.

11 15. In 2017, in response to SGMA, the Cuyama Basin Groundwater Sustainability Agency
12 (GSA) was formed and in January 2020 the GSA submitted its Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP)

13 to DWR for review and approval. At the time this Complaint is filed the GSP has not been approved.

14 16. This Complaint seeks a judicial determination of rights to all water within the Basin. A

15 comprehensive adjudication is necessary to protect and conserve the limited water supply that is vital

16 to the public health, safety, and welfare of all persons and entities in the Basin. Plaintiffs bring this
17 action to protect the general welfare of the Basin, protect Plaintiffs' right to pump groundwater and to

18 achieve sustainability of the Basin. Plaintiffs are informed and believe that only a comprehensive

19 adjudication determining all rights to extract groundwater from the Basin, preliminary injunction,
20 physical solution and court judgment will be sufficient to achieve these results.

21 17. Any judgment and physical solution in this proceeding approved by the court may as
22 necessary be submitted to DWR for review and approval pursuant to Water Code sections 10733.6 and
23 10737.4.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Comprchensive Adjudication and Physical Solution - Against all Defendants)

26 18. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 17 above.
27 19. Plaintiffs and one or more of the Defendants are extracting and/or storing and have
28 extracted and/or stored groundwater from or in the Basin and claim rights to extract and/or store
COMPLAINT FOR COMPREHENSIVE GROUNDWATER ADJUDICATION OF THE CUYAMA VALLEY GROUNDWATER BASIN (NO. 3-013) QUIET TITLE AND PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

1 groundwater from or in the Basin.

2 20. There is presently no viable means to cure the Basin's overdraft through artificial

3 recharge or other supply augmentation strategies.

4 21. Disputes have arisen and there are competing claims regarding the parties' respective

5 rights and priorities to extract and use water from the Basin.

6 22. This action is necessary to comprehensively determine and adjudicate all groundwater

7 rights in the Basin, establish a physical solution and judgment, including continuing jurisdiction, for

8 the perpetual sustainable management of the Basin consistent with common law water rights, Article

9 X, section 2 of the California Constitution, and Code of Civil Procedure section 850.

10 23. Upon a showing that the Basin is in a condition of long-term overdraft, the court may,
11 and Plaintiffs hereby request, that the court issue a preliminary injunction which may include (1) a
12 moratorium on new or increased appropriations of water in the Basin, (2) a limitation on, or reduction

13 in, the diversion or extraction of water in the Basin, (3) an allocation among the parties establishing

14 amounts of extraction from the Basin allowed during the pendency of the comprehensive adjudication,

15 and (4) procedures for voluntary transfers within the Basin. (Code Civ. Proc., § 847)

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Quiet Title - Against all Defendants)

18 24. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations in paragraphs 1 through 23 above.

19 25. Plaintiffs hold record fee simple title or have the right to use the real properties
20 identified on Exhibits "B" and "C" including legal attributes to such title.

21 26. The properties as to which a determination is sought are identified on Exhibits "B" and

22

23 27. A determination is sought as to the Plaintiffs' title or interests in and to the Basin water

24 supply and rights to store water as against any adverse claims by Defendants and each of them.

25 28. On information and belief, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have some adverse claim or
26 claims against the title or interest of the water rights or storage rights appurtenant to the properties

27 identified in Exhibits "B" and "C" and that such claims are without right and are denied.
