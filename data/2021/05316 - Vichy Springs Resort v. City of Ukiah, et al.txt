23 I. INTRODUCTION

24 1. This Petition seeks, among other things, to set aside building permits issued on or

25 about December 21, 2017, by Respondents the City of Ukiah and the City Council of the City

26 of Ukiah (collectively the "CITY") to the Ukiah Rifle and Pistol Club, Inc. (the "GUN CLUB"),

27 allowing the demolition of the main range and construction of a different and modern structure, "one

28 of the biggest projects in recent Club history" (hereafter referred to as "the PROJECT*). Petitioner
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate

414

2 VICHY SPRINGS RESORT brings this action because the CITY and Respondent the County of

3 Mendocino and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Mendocino (collectively the "COUNTY")

4 did not, and refuse to, comply with their own land use laws and State environmental laws, including

5 the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) (CEQA), in

6 allowing the issuance of the building permits for the GUN CLUB, as has been the case with many
other similar previous land use approvals. The CITY, moreover, has been misapplying, and thus
7 failing to enforce, the terms of its long-term lease with the GUN CLUB.

8 2.

9 More generally, the CITY and the COUNTY have a pattern and practice of failing

10 to regulate the GUN CLUB, which hurts the environment and the public, including Petitioner. In

11 particular, the extensive use of lead bullets on the subject property has caused a buildup of lead

12 throughout the site, with the result, among others, that water flowing off the property contains

13 hazardous lead levels far in excess of what federal and state regulatory authorities consider

14 acceptable for wildlife, human health, or drinking water purposes. These problems will only grow
worse over time without intervention by this court.

15 3.

16 Consequently, Petitioner seeks the following relief: (i) a peremptory writ of mandate

17 directing the CITY to set aside its approval of the above-described building permits; (ii) a

18 declaration that the CITY and COUNTY have engaged, and continue to engage, in an unlawful

19 pattern and practice of ignoring their obligations to enforce pertinent land use and environmental

20 laws with respect to the ongoing operation of the GUN CLUB, including, in particular, the Planning

21 and Zoning Law (Government Code §65000 et seq.) and CEQA; (iii) an injunction requiring the

22 CITY and the COUNTY to regulate the GUN CLUB pursuant to, and consistent with, the CITY's

23 Lease with the GUN CLUB and the two local agencies' respective regulatory powers over land use

24 and environmental quality occurring at the GUN CLUB, and an injunction directing the GUN CLUB

25 to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities within the GUN CLUB site until such

26 time, if ever, as both the CITY and the COUNTY have granted all of the necessary governmental

27 authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such activities to proceed in a lawful manner.

16 III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17 13. The property occupied by the GUN CLUB is owned by the CITY OF UKIAH in an

18 unincorporated area of the County of Mendocino.

19 14. The GUN CLUB originally leased the property from Leo Franceschi Johnson, Linda

20 Franceschi, and Harry Franceschi ("FRANCESCHIS"). The property leased by the GUN CLUB is

21 not zoned for shooting ranges under the Mendocino County Zoning Code. (See Mendocino Zoning

22 Code $20.060.010.) The County designated the GUN CLUB as a nonconforming use in 1982.

23 15. On or about December 20, 1993, the CITY acquired the property at 2300 Vichy

24 Springs Road (approximately 96.82 acres of real property) from the FRANCESCHIS. The CITY

25 asserted that the public purpose for the purchase of the real property was to use it as a buffer zone

26 against additional residential development occurring on the south side of Vichy Springs Road, which

27 could impact then existing landfill operations.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate

F 16. The purchase was approved at the December 15, 1993 City Council Meeting. Prior

2 to voting on the purchase, the City Manager informed the Council members that the property was

3 used for the GUN CLUB's operations, and that the CITY would assume the existing 50-year lease

4 between the FRANCESCHIS and GUN CLUB, which was set to expire in 2044.

5 17. Contrary to the City Manager's representations to the City Council, the new.Lease

6 had not yet been executed by the FRANCESCHIS and the GUN CLUB prior to the Council hearing

7 on December 15, 1993. Indeed, the FRANCESCHIS and the GUN CLUB did not execute the Lease

8 until the next day, December 16, 1993. The new Lease was thereafter accepted by the CITY.

18. The CITY did not prepare an Environmental Impact Report or Negative Declaration

10 for its actions purchasing the property or assuming the lease; nor did the CITY otherwise issue a

11 Notice of Exemption asserting that such actions were exempt from CEQA.

12 19. The Lease does not require the GUN CLUB to provide any public benefit. The GUN

13 CLUB is not open to the public, except for events controlled by the GUN CLUB. The GUN CLUB
14 | exclusively controls club membership and otherwise limits public access to the property at 2300

15 Vichy Springs Road. There is a coded, locked gate for exclusive use by members. New membership

16 requires sponsorship by existing members. The GUN CLUB also requires that its members maintain

17 a membership with the National Rifle Association (NRA).

18 20. 5 Section 5 of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "at all times during the term

19 of this Lease, Lessee shall maintain the leased premises in an orderly condition and in conformity

20 with all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations of any governmental body pertaining to the use

21 thereof."

22 21. Section 11 of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "Lessee shall not intentionally

23 or negligently commit or permit others to commit waste or nuisance, public or private, upon any

24 portion of the leased premises. Lessee shall not discharge, release, improperly store or dispose of

25 on the leased premises any hazardous or toxic substance as defined in local, state or federal law...."

26 22. Section 13(a) of the Lease provides, in pertinent part, that "Lessee shall not, without

27 Lessor's prior consent, make any alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or modification to,

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
5. Petition for Writ of Mandate

*

F on, in, or upon the leased premises, except for nonstructural alterations not exceeding $5,000.00 in

2 costs. Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its consent."

3 23. Section 14(a) of the Lease provides that Lessee accepts the leased premises in its as

4 is condition and "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances,

5 rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the leased premises,

6 including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental enactments.

7 Lessee shall at its sole cost and expense, promptly comply with any such laws, statutes, ordinances,

8 rules, regulations, orders and requirements in effect during the term or any part of the term of this
Lease Agreement, should the same be necessary in connection with Lessee's continuing use of the

10 leased premises."

11 24. Since the CITY purchased the property, the GUN CLUB's membership has grown

12 from 40 to over 1,000 members. The GUN CLUB has dramatically increased the number of special

13 events it hosts. It has also allowed, for many years, overnight camping on multiple occasions.

14 25. The GUN CLUB has constructed new and/or modified the structures located on the

15 CITY -owned property. A new club house and kitchen were built, and the GUN CLUB has spent

16 over $350,000.00 on three new ranges (pistol, rifle, and traps). The use of these ranges has led to a
17 proliferation of lead bullets throughout the subject site, resulting in, among other things, the
18 contamination of water flowing from the property.

19 26. The GUN CLUB did not obtain the CITY's approval for these projects or apply for

20 a use permit or obtain building permits from Respondent COUNTY. Presently, the CITY contends

21 that the CITY-owned property leased to the GUN CLUB is not subject to planning, zoning laws or

22 the proper exercise of police power by either the CITY or COUNTY. The CITY does not regulate

23 the GUN CLUB in accordance with the Lease, CEQA, the Ukiah City Code, or the Ukiah General

24 Plan. Nor does the CITY require the GUN CLUB to comply with Mendocino County laws. The

25 COUNTY similarly does not regulate the GUN CLUB in accordance with CEQA, the Mendocino

26 County General Plan, or County Zoning and Building Codes. As a result of the indifference of both

27 the CITY and the COUNTY to the activities occurring within the GUN CLUB site, the property has

28

- 6- Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 become an island of unregulated private activity in which unsupervised individuals are engaged in

3 actions, some of which are dangerous and/or harmful to the environment, that could not lawfully

4 occur without governmental authorization on typical private property located in the COUNTY'S
unincorporated area.

5 27.

6 Under Section 13(a) of the Lease, as noted above, the GUN CLUB is required to
obtain the CITY's consent prior to making alternations and improvements. The CITY interprets

8 Section 13(a), however, as though the CITY's approval is limited solely to assuring that the

9 structures or other improvements comply with the applicable building codes as adopted by the CITY.

28.

10 Furthermore, despite the above-quoted language in Sections 5 and 14(a) of the Lease,

11 the CITY does not require the GUN CLUB to comply with CEQA, the General Plan of the CITY,

12 the Mendocino County General Plan or the Zoning and Building Codes of the COUNTY.

29.

13 The CITY's narrow interpretation of its powers under the Lease overlooks the plain

14 language of sections 5, 13(a), and 14(a). As noted above, Section 13(a) allows the City to withhold

15 its approval of proposed "alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or modification to, on, in,

16 or upon the leased premises," as long as doing so is not "unreasonable." As also noted above,
Section 5 requires the GUN CLUB operators to "maintain the leased premises conformity with
17 | all applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations," while Section 14(a) makes the operator's use of

18

19 the property expressly "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes,

20 ordinances, rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the

21 leased premises, including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental

22 enactments." Similar language can also be found in section 11 of the Lease.

30.

23 Petitioner asserts that, under the unique circumstances associated with the Lease, the

24 CITY must interpret and apply Section 13(a), together with Sections 5, 11, and 14(a), in a manner

25 that forcefully protects the public interest via the full regulatory authority of the CITY, including its
police power and its obligations as an owner of public property. Thus, it would be entirely
26 "reasonable" for the CITY to disallow proposed "alterations, improvements, additions, changes, or

27

28 modification to, on, in, or upon the leased premises" that CITY officials conclude would be contrary

Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 7 -

1 to the general welfare, contrary to public health and safety, contrary to the property's general plan

2 or zoning designations, or unacceptable from an environmental standpoint.

3 31. The CITY's notion that its authority over the GUN CLUB under the Lease is limited

4 just to the issuance of building permits is also undermined by the plain language of the CITY's own

5 Ukiah City Code, which does not authorize the CITY to extend its regulatory jurisdiction into the

6 COUNTY's unincorporated area. Through Section 3000 of the Ukiah City Code, the City Council

7 has adopted and made "effective within the City" the model codes and specific appendices listed and
defined in Sections 3001-3011 of the Ukiah City Code (Building Regulations Chapter). In turn,

9 Section 3012 of the Ukiah City Code defines "jurisdiction," as used in any of the model codes

10 adopted, to mean the "City of Ukiah." The GUN CLUB property is not within the City.

11 32. While the CITY, notwithstanding both the broad language in sections 5, 11, 13(a),

12 and 14(a) of the Lease ás well as the CITY's absence of regulatory authority over land outside its
13 municipal boundaries, disavows any regulatory authority over the GUN CLUB other than the
14 issuance of building permits, the COUNTY takes an even narrower view of its authority over the

15 GUN CLUB. Because the subject property is owned by the CITY, the COUNTY claims that its own
16 regulatory authority does not extend to the property. The basis for this contention is found in
17 Government Code sections 53090 and 53091. The latter statute requires that "[e]ach local agency

18 shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the county or city in

19 which the territory of the local agency is situated."(Government Code §53091(a), italics added.) The

20 former statute provides, however, that the term "local agency" does not include a city. (Id.,

21 §53090(a).) Thus, in general, property owned by a city in a county unincorporated area is not subject

22 to the county's building and zoning ordinances. Here, the COUNTY reasons that, because the CITY

23 owns the GUN CLUB, the property cannot be subject to the COUNTY's building or zoning

24 ordinances, despite the fact that the GUN CLUB leases the property from the CITY and uses it for

25 its own private purposes. The COUNTY maintains this position despite being fully aware of the

26 CITY's own hands-off approach to what occurs within the GUN CLUB site.

27

Petition for Writ of Mandate - 8 -

?

33. As is evident to any observer, the unwillingness of either the CITY or the COUNTY

2 to regulate activities occurring within the GUN CLUB site has created an island of virtual regulatory

3 anarchy within the COUNTY's unincorporated area. Both the CITY and the COUNTY cannot be

4 correct in refusing to oversee and regulate what occurs on the GUN CLUB site, particularly given

5 the operator's reckless use of lead, which has contaminated not only the GUN CLUB site but also

6 adjacent waterways and private and public properties. Indeed, both of these local agencies are

7 incorrect in their views of their obligations regarding the subject property. Both the CITY and the

8 COUNTY are obligated to protect the public interest and general welfare by regulating and
supervising the often dangerous and environmentally harmful activities occurring with the GUN

10 CLUB. First, the CITY must assert its authority and obligations through its role as Lessor under

11 sections 5, 11, 13(a), and 14(a) of the Lease. And second, the COUNTY must treat the property as

12 de facto private property in its unincorporated area, and thus subject to the full panoply of the

13 COUNTY's regulatory powers, including its police power and its statutory authority under, inter alia,

14 the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA. Alternatively, at least one of the two local agencies should

15 assert some level of control over the GUN CLUB: either the CITY through its role as Lessor, or the

16 COUNTY in a regulatory capacity.

17 IV. THE PROJECT

18 34. In order to accommodate the increase in use, the GUN CLUB is undertaking to

19 demolish the main range and rebuild with a different and modern structure. Copies of the GUN

20 CLUB's announcement as to its proposed PROJECT, the Building Permit Application to the CITY

21 and Plans, detailing the scope of work, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A". (*the PROJECT")

22 35. The GUN CLUB's soil is contaminated with lead and clay pigeons; and runoff from

23 the ranges, rich in lead, has already contaminated water flowing off the site and will continue to do

24 SO on a greater scale under the PROJECT. The demolition of this lead-contaminated building and

25 the grading and storage of lead contaminated soil will have a direct impact on the environment. The
26 PROJECT will also increase noise, traffic, and safety concerns which will directly impact the
27 I environment.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukigh, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate . 9.

L 36.

2 Under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the GUN CLUB must get the CITY's discretionary

3 approval for the demolition and construction of the main range. As discussed earlier, that provision

4 gives the CITY discretion to withhold or impose conditions on such proposed changes, as long as

5 the CITY's action is reasonable. The need for the CIT'Y's discretionary approval will trigger CEQA.

37. The CITY has issued building permits and the PROJECT commenced on/or about
6 January 2, 2018 without any CEQA review. Additionally, the CITY does not have the power under

7

8 the Ukiah City Code to issue building permits for GUN CLUB property outside the CITY. Ofequal

9 importance, the PROJECT is contrary to the Mendocino County Code, as Section 20.204.015(B)

10 thereof provides that, once a nonconforming structure is voluntarily demolished, the nonconforming
use cannot be resumed.

11 38.

12 As stated above, the COUNTY designated the GUN CLUB as a nonconforming use

13 in 1982. Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B) provides that "whenever a structure, the

14 use of which does not conform with the regulations for the zone in which it is located, or a structure

15 which does not comply with the standards of yard spaces, height of structures, distance between
structures, parking, etc., prescribed in the regulations for the zone in which it is located shall be
16  voluntarily razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations

17

18 of the zone in which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed."

39. Mendocino County Code § 18.08.010 provides as follows:

19

20 "Except as otherwise exempted by the California Building Code and/or other county ordinances, no person, firm, or corporation shall

21 erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, occupy, remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure in the

22 unincorporated area of the County or cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate building permit for each such

23 building or structure as required by this Title. Permits shall be issued and fees collected by the Planning and Building Services Department.'

24 40.

25 After the main range is "voluntarily razed", under Mendocino County Code co

26 20.060.025 R-L Rangeland District, the GUN CLUB's use, a civic use type, "lodge, fraternal and

27 civic assembly", is only permitted upon the issuance of a Major Use Permit.

41.

28 Mendocino County Code § 20.216.005(B) provides that "It shall be the duty of the

Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukigh, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 10 -

~

I Planning and Building Services Department and of the officers of County herein and/or otherwise

2 charged by law with the enforcement of this Division to enforce this Division and all provisions of

3 the same."

4 42. Mendocino County Zoning Code § 20.216.025, Public Nuisance Abatement,

5 provides that:

6 "Any use of the property or any building set up, erected, built, moved or maintained contrary to the provisions of this Division shall be and 7 the same is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The office of the County Counsel shall immediately commence action or 8 actions, proceeding or proceedings, for the abatement, removal and enjoinment thereof in the manner provided by law and shall take such 9 other steps and shall apply to such court or courts as may have
jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate and remove such 10 building or enjoin such use and restrain and enjoin any persons, firms, or corporation or other entity from setting up, erecting, building, 11 moving or maintaining any such building or using any property

12 contrary to the provisions of this division."

13 Mendocino County Code § 1.04.020, Definitions and Rules of Construction, provides

14 that "shall" is mandatory.

15 43. Petitioner and the public will be harmed as a result of the CITY's and COUNTY's

16 ongoing policies and practices of bypassing the requirements of CEQA and ignoring the procedural

17 and substantive requirements of the COUNTY's own zoning ordinances. Petitioner has notified the

18 CITY and COUNTY of these acts orally and in a letter dated October 31,2017. On November 16,

19 2017, Petitioner notified the CITY that under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the CITY's actions in

20 response to the GUN CLUB's request is subject to CEQA.

21 44. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies in that the PROJECT is

22 proceeding and there are no appeal or administrative procedures provided by state or local laws.
23 Such efforts were not required as a precondition to filing this litigation, however, as neither the CITY

24 nor the COUNTY provided any opportunity for public review and comment on its position or any

25 opportunity to participate in any hearing or submit evidence. (See Public Resources Code §21167(e)

26 [exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required under CEQA "there was no public hearing

27 or other opportunity for members of the public to raise .. objections orally or in writing prior to the

1 approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law"];

2 Government Code $65009(b) [similar language limiting the application of the exhaustion doctrine

3 under the Planning and Zoning Law].)

4 45. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

5 of law because Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental
6 damage and by the Respondents' violations of CEQA, the Ukiah City Code and General Plan, and
7 Mendocino County planning, zoning and building laws.

8 V. VENUE AND JURISDICTION

9 46. This court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
10 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus); and

11 Public Resources Code sections 21167(d) (statute of limitations) and 21 168.5 (traditional mandamus

12 review under CEQA).

13 47. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to. Code of Civil Procedure sections 393
14 (actions against public officers) and 395 (actions generally) because the offices of both the CITY and

15 the COUNTY, as well as Petitioner's place of doing business (and locus of harms), are all located

16 in Mendocino County.

17 48. On January 3, 2018, before the commencement of this action, Petitioner served

18 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the

19 requirements of Public Resource Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of this notice and

20 its proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit "B" and incorporated herein by this reference.

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Failure to Comply with CEQA Against the CITY and the COUNTY)

23 49. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth
24 herein paragraphs 1-48.

25 50. CEQA applies to all nonexempt discretionary projects. (Public Resource Code

26 §21080(a).) A "project" is an activity undertaken, approved, funded, or permitted by a public agency

27 that may cause a direct, or reasonably foreseeable indirect, physical change in the environment,

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukigh, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 12 -

(Public Resource Code $21065.) The GUN CLUB's proposed activity is a project under CEQA. The

2 CITY and COUNTY have the ability and authority to mitigate environmental damage or to deny the

3 PROJECT.

4 51. The CITY asserts that private projects that only require a ministerial permit by a

5 public agency are not projects subject to CEQA and building permits are generally considered

6 ministerial permits to which CEQA does not apply.

7 52. In taking this position, the CITY ignores both its function as Lessor of the subject

8 property and the plain language of Section 13(a) of the Lease, which gives the CITY discretion over

9 potential actions proposed by the GUN CLUB, and makes the CITY's action in response to the

10 request from the GUN CLUB subject to CEQA.

11 53. Section 13(a) of the Lease provides that "Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its

12 consent," which language gives the CITY discretion within the meaning of CEQA either to deny or

13 to condition the GUN CLUB's request to make improvements on the CITY owned property. Section

14 13(a), moreover, must be understood in light of Sections 5, 11, and 14(a) of the Lease. Section 5

15 requires the GUN CLUB operators to "maintain the leased premises conformity with all
16 applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations," while Section 14(a) makes the operator's use of the

17 property expressly "subject to all applicable local, county, state and federal laws, statutes,

18 ordinances, rules and regulations governing, directing or otherwise affecting Lessee's use of the

19 leased premises, including, but not limited to, any and all zoning, land use, health and environmental

20 enactments." Section 11 contains similar language. Although this language prevents the CITY from

21 unreasonably withholding its consent, the CITY may reasonably determine that the environmental

22 effects of the GUN CLUB's proposals are unacceptable or should be made subject to mitigation

23 requirements. Any other interpretation of the Lease would be unlawful, as it would transform the

24 Lease into a wholesale delegation of the CITY's police power to a private party, which cannot

25 lawfully occur.

26 54. Under CEQA, a discretionary approval exists where the CITY has the authority to

27 exercise subjective judgment in denying or conditioning the PROJECT to avoid or reduce its

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukigh, et al
Petition for Writ of Mandate • 13 -

1 environmental impact. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, div. 6, ch. 3 ["CEQA Guidelines"] §15357.)

2 Conversely, a ministerial approval exists where the GUN CLUB can legally compel the PROJECT

3 approval without any change in design that might alleviate adverse environmental consequences, and

4 the CITY exercises little or no judgment and merely determines whether the PROJECT conforms

5 to fixed, objective standards. (CEQA Guidelines §15369.)

6 55. Since under Section 13(a) of the Lease, the GUN CLUB cannot compel approval

7 without any changes in the design of its PROJECT which might alleviate adverse environmental

8 consequences, the CITY's actions in response to the GUN CLUB's request are thus subject to
CEQA. The fact that the GUN CLUB seeks a building permit, which in normal circumstances could

10 be ministerial, does not limit the CITY's discretion as Lessor under Section 13(a).

11 56. The actions of the CITY in allowing the PROJECT, without any CEQA compliance,

12 is prejudicial abuse of discretion because the CITY failed to proceed in a manner required by law

13 as follows: The CITY has improperly determined that the GUN CLUB's PROJECT is not subject

14 to CEQA, has failed to determine whether the PROJECT will have a significant effect on the

15 environment, and has wrongfully issued building permits for a structure on property located outside
16 of its jurisdiction.

17 57. The PROJECT may cause a significant impact on the environment, including, but not

18 limited to, the use and storage of hazardous materials and water, air, noise, safety, fire, and traffic

19 impacts, plus the impact on a state landmark (the Vichy Springs Resort) and neighboring properties.

20 Consequently, the CITY has prejudicially abused its discretion and fajled to proceed in a manner

21 required by law by failing to undertake any CEQA review and wrongfully determining that the

22 PROJECT is not subject to CEQA.

23 58. Because, under the Lease, the CITY is no longer functioning as the owner of the
24  subject property but instead has delegated most of the responsibilities of ownership to a private party

25 (the GUN CLUB), the COUNTY has regulatory land use jurisdiction over the property, which lies

26 in the unincorporated area, notwithstanding Government Code § 53091. In addition to the CITY's

27 CEQA obligation under the Leae, the COUNTY's regulatory obligation over the property include

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate . 14

1 the need to comply with CEQA prior to exercising its discretion to authorize land use changes or
2 intensification of use with potential adverse environmental consequences. The PROJECT thus

3 cannot lawfully proceed absent appropriate regulatory approvals from the COUNTY, preceded by
compliance with CEQA.

5 59. Because both the CITY and the COUNTY are required to exercise some sort of

6 regulatory authority over the subject site, both entitles are subject to CEQA with respect to their
dealings with the GUN CLUB. In such a situation, the two entities can work out between themselves

8 which one should function as the "lead agency" and which one should function as a "responsible

9 agency". (CEQA Guideline 15051) Under the CEQA Guidelines 15367, the lead agency is "the

10 public agency which has the principal responsibility for carrying out or approving a project".

11 60. Under the CEQA Guideline 15020, each public agency is responsible for complying

12 with CEQA and the Guidelines. Section 15020 provides that "A public agency must meet its own

13 responsibilities under CEQA. It shall not rely on comments from other public agencies or private

14 citizens as a substitute for work CEQA requires the lead agency to accomplish." Petitioner believes

15 that the COUNTY should function as the lead agency, and the CITY should function as a responsible

16 agency. This division of labor makes sense because the COUNTY's regulatory authority over the

17 property is greater than that of the CITY, which can affect on-site activities primarily through its role

18 as Lessor. Consequently, the COUNTY has prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed

19 in a manner required by law by failing to undertake any CEQA review and allowing the PROJECT

20 to proceed.

21
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
22

23 (Against the CITY and COUNTY for Violation of Mendocino County Zoning Ordinance and Violation of Ukiah Code)

24 61. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

25 herein paragraphs 1-60.

26 62. The building permits are invalid and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion as

27 the CITY does not have the power to issue building permits to the GUN CLUB since the property

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al,
Petition for Writ of Mandate 15•

-4

r is outside the city limits. Any authority exercised by the CITY over onsite activities must be via

2 Section 13(a) of the Lease, as understood against the backdrop of Sections 5, 11, and 14(a). Any such

3 approval by the CITY must be in addition to a land use approval granted by the COUNTY. The

4 COUNTY's acquiescence in allowing the PROJECT is a prejudicial abuse of discretion under

5 Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B), which provides that, once the main range is

6 demolished, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. The building permits are invalid and must

7 be set aside. The COUNTY has a mandatory duty to enforce its Zoning laws. (See also Mendocino

8 County Code 20.216.005(B) and 20.216.025). Petitioner seeks a Writ of Mandate as prayed.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of Planning Laws)

11 63. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

12 herein paragraphs 1-62.

13 64. The building permits are invalid and constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that

14 the CITY failed to proceed in the manner required by law as the CITY did not consider its General

15 Plan policies or the General Plan policies of Mendocino County. Under the Lease, the PROJECT

16 must be in compliance with the General Plan policies of the CITY and the COUNTY.

17 65. For example, there is no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan

18 policies of the CITY:

19 Policy CT-1.2: City and County Staff shall include traffic and circulation information in
20 staff reports to their respective

21 Planning Commissions.

22 Policy CT-1.3: All proposed development shall be reviewed for its immediate and

23 cumulative transportation impacts.

24 Policy CT-16.4: Balance the need for new development
with methods of accommodating

25 increasing traffic.

26 66. There is also no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan policies

27 of Mendocino County:

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate 16 -

had Policy DE-98: The County will protect residential areas and other noise-sensitive

2 uses from excessive noise by doing the following: 1) Requiring that new land uses, new roadways, and other new

3 noise sources do not create unacceptable noise levels on adjacent parcels.

4 ***

5 3) Requiring the County decisions which would cause or allow

6 an increase in noise created by stationary or mobile sources (such as development of noise-generating land uses or the

7 construction of new or wider roadways) be informed by a noise analysis and accompanied by noise reduction measures to keep noise at acceptable levels.

8 Policy DE-121:

9 New discretionary development will be required to demonstrate that basic infrastructure is available and has adequate capacity to serve the project without degrading, existing level of service standards.
10 Policy DE-203:
11 All development projects shall include plans and facilities to store and manage solid waste and hazardous materials and wastes in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
12 Policy DE-208:
13 Land uses, densities and intensities shall be designed to reduce human risk and exposure to hazardous conditions and events.

14 Policy DE-214: The County shall deny development proposals that present substantial

15 fire hazard risk to residents and safety providers responding to a wildland fire.

16 Policy DE-215: Development shall be located, designed and managed to reduce fire

17 risk to life, property and natural resources, and incorporates adequate fire protection consistent with the General Plan and adopted regulations.
18 67.

19 The CITY's approval must be consistent with the applicable General Plan policies

20 of the CITY and Mendocino County. The CITY's actions were arbitrary and capricious and there

21 is no substantial evidence to support the issuance of the building permits. The building permits are
invalid and must be set aside.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Declaratory Relief - Failure to Regulate)

24 68, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

25 herein paragraphs 1-67.

26 69. Respondent CITY and COUNTY refuse to regulate the activities of the GUN CLUB

27 on the CITY owned property, and have a pattern or practice a of not complying with CEQA, the

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate . 17 -

-

Planning and Zoning Law, their respective General Plans, and other pertinent governing regulatory

2 authorities. The GUN CLUB's requests for approval under Paragraph 13(a) of the Lease is subject

3 to environmentäl review under CEQA. Furthermore, the GUN CLUB should seek from the
4 COUNTY whatever regulatory approvals would be needed to ensure that GUN CLUB projects are

5 consistent with the COUNTY's General Plan, zoning, and other applicable County regulatory

6 requirements. Such requests for approvals will trigger the COUNTY's own obligations under CEQA

7 where the approvals sought would require the COUNTY to exercise discretion and have some

8 potential for adverse environmental effects.

70. When presented with a request from the GUN CLUB to make any alterations,
10 improvements, additions, changes, or modification to, on, in, or upon the leased premises, the CITY

11 must consider whether the proposed activity is a "project" under CEQA and, if so, must conduct a

12 preliminary revièw in order to determine whether the activity may be exempt from CEQA or requires

13 the preparation of either a negative declaration or an EIR. The CITY has an established policy of not

14 complying with CEQA. The CITY's practice, under Paragraph 13(a) of the Lease, is that the CITY

15 will consent to the proposed activity by the GUN CLUB on condition that the GUN CLUB applies

16 for and receives building permits. This practice is unlawful because the CITY does no

17 environmental review prior to approving permit requests, and because the CITY does not have the

18 authority to issue building permits outside the city limits. As explained above, Section 13(a) of the

19 Lease gives the CITY gufficient discretion to require CEQA compliance prior to approval of requests

20 made by the GUN CLUB.

21 71. Respondent COUNTY contends that it has no authority to regulate the GUN CLUB

22 property, even though it is located in an unincorporated portion of the County and is used for private

23 GUN CLUB purposes. The CITY contends that it has no power to regulate, except for the issuance

24 of building permits, because the GUN CLUB property is outside of city limits.

25 72. Respondent COUNTY contends that pursuant to Government Code sections 53090

26 and 53091, cities and counties are mutually exempt from each other's building and zoning

27 ordinances and, therefore, the CITY is exempt from the COUNTY's building and zoning regulations

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. - 18 - Petition for Writ of Mandate

on the property it owns, and the COUNTY has no jurisdiction to enforce its general plan, zoning,

2 and building regulations on the property. Over the years, the COUNTY's refusal to assert any sort
of regulatory authority over the property amounts to an established policy of simply ignoring what

4 occurs on the property, to the detriment of the public interest and environment. If the COUNTY had
5  been properly regulating the GUN CLUB in recent years, the dangerous proliferation of lead

6 throughout the property and onto adjacent properties might not have occurred.

7 73. Petitioner alleges that the COUNTY is obligated to regulate lands within its

8 jurisdiction, including unincorporated areas of the County. Petitioner further alleges that the CITY,

9 under the Lease, and in accordance with Sections, 5, 11, 13(a) and 14(a) of the Lease, has an

10 obligation to ensure that its Lessee complies with applicable land use laws. Petitioner alleges that

11 the Mendocino County Building and Zoning Codes, the General Plans of the CITY and COUNTY,

12 and CEQA apply to the GUN CLUB.

13 74. Petitioner alleges that there is no immunity under Government Code sections 53090

14 and 53091 since the GUN CLUB is a private club engaged in its own private pursuits, in accordance

15 with a Lease that provides no public benefit or use. Further, Petitioner alleges that Sections 5, 11,

16 13(a) and 14(a) of the Lease require that the GUN CLUB be regulated and that immunity not apply.

17 The CITY assumed a lease between two private parties which provided for regulation of the GUN

18 CLUB and so immunity was waived. At present, the property is de facto private property subject to

19 the COUNTY's various regulatory powers on the same footing as other private property in the

20 unincorporated area. Yet the COUNTY treats the property as though the CITY used it for city

21 purposes (e.g., a corporation yard).

22 75. Respondents CITY and COUNTY wrongfully fail to require the GUN CLUB to

23 obtain Use Permits or to comply with General Plan policies, zoning requirements, building laws of

24 the County, or CEQA. The granting of a Use Permit by the COUNTY would require environmental

25 review under CEQA. Petitioner contends that the GUN CLUB has engaged in multiple violations
26 of applicableland use laws with the CITY's and the COUNTY's knowledge. This anarchic approach

27 to land use planning, which has resulted in the GUN CLUB's profligate use of lead bullets resulting

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Uklah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 19 -

5-

in widespread lead contamination, will continue throughout the remaining life of the Lease absent

2 intervention from this court.

3 76. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to changes

4 to non-conforming uses, and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. Mendocino

5 Zoning Code section 20.204.020 restricts changes to non-conforming uses absent a permit: "[a] non-

6 conforming use may increase its volume of operation provided the structure is not altered or enlarged

7 to accommodate its increase without obtaining a use permit." Since the CITY assumed the Lease
in 1993, the GUN CLUB has changed its non-conforming use and modified structures on the
property to accommodate the changed use. Petitioner has notified the CITY and COUNTY of these

10 changes, but to no avail.

11 77. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to camping,

12 and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Zoning Code section

13 20.060.025 requires facilities that permit camping to obtain a Major Use Permit. The State of

14 California requires a license to operate a campground. Yet the Gun Club allows unauthorized

15 overnight camping on the property.

16 78. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Building Code, and the CITY and

17 COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Building Code requires that "no

18 person, firm, or corporation shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, occupy,

19 remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure in the unincorporated area of the County or

20 cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate building permit for each such building

21 or structure...*"* (Mendocino County Code $18.08.010.) The GUN CLUB has not obtained a building

22 permit from the COUNTY for construction that has occurred since 1993.

23 79. The failure to regulate has created a continuing nuisance on the property since there

24 are excessive noise, traffic, pollution, fire hazards and safety concerns from the GUN CLUB's

25 activities on the CITY's property. The GUN CLUB's use of the land is impairing the use and

26 enjoyment of VICHY SPRINGS RESORT and neighboring properties.

27 80. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists relating to the rights and duties of

28
Vichy Springs Resori v. City of Ukiah, et al.
- 20 - Petition for Writ of Mandate

the parties herein. On the one hand, Petitioner contends, as described above, that the CITY and the

2 COUNTY have failed to regulate the GUN CLUB, and that the actions of the CITY and COUNTY
3 have created a continuing nuisance on the property. On the other hand, the CITY and the COUNTY

4 claim that they have no obligation to regulate the GUN CLUB or to enjoin the GUN CLUB's

5 activities. The COUNTY claims that, under Government Code sections 53090 and 53091, GUN

6 CLUB is exempt from the COUNTY's Building and Zoning Codes.

7 81. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of its rights, and a declaration as to the

8 construction and application of Government Code §§53090 and 53091 and a determination that the
GUN CLUB is subject to land use regulations by Respondents either because there is no immunity

10 or the Lease requires regulation. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time

11 under the circumstances in order that Petitioner may ascertain its rights under the law and a
12 determination that there is no immunity under Government Code §53090 and 53091 and/or under

13 the Lease.

14 82. Petitioner also seeks an injunction requiring the CITY and the COUNTY to compel

15 the GUN CLUB to comply with the applicable land use laws cited above. Unless Petitioner is

16 granted injunctive relief, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm in that the CITY's and

17 COUNTY's failure to regulate will further the adverse environmental impact described in this

18 Petition.

19 83. Petitioner also seeks preliminary and permanent prohibitory injunctions directing the

20 GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities within the GUN CLUB

21 site until such time, if ever, as either the CITY or the COUNTY, or both, have granted all of the

22 necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such activities to proceed in

23 a lawful manner.

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for Judgment as follows:

25 1. That the Court issue a peremptory Writ of Mandate commanding the CITY to rescind,

26 void and set side the building permits and any action authorizing the development of the PROJECT;

27 further commanding the COUNTY to undertake a zoning enforcement action preventing

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Petition for Writ of Mandate - 21 -

1 development of the PROJECT; and directing the CITY and the GUN CLUB to stop all activities

2 under the building permits until the CITY and COUNTY have complied with CEQA and all other

3 applicable state and local land use laws;

2. For a declaration that the CITY owned property leased to the GUN CLUB is subject

5 to land use regulations by the CITY and the COUNTY and a determination that there is no immunity

6 under Government Code $53090 and 53091;

7 3. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent mandatory

8 injunctions requiring the CITY and the COUNTY to regulate the GUN CLUB pursuant to, and

9 consistent with, the CITY's Lease with the GUN CLUB and the two local agencies' respective

10 regulatory powers over land use and environmental quality occurring at the GUN CLUB, including,

11 in particular, the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA;

12 4. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent prohibitory

13 injunctions directing the GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities

14 within the GUN CLUB site until such time, if ever, as both the CITY and the COUNTY have

15 granted all of the necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such

16 activities to proceed in a lawful manner;

17 5. For reasonable attorney's fees as provided by law, including Code of Civil Procedure

18 section 1021.5;

19 6. For costs of suit incurred herein; and

20 7. For such other and further relief that the court may deem just and proper.

23 I. INTRODUCTION

24 1. This Petition seeks, among other things, to set aside building permits issued on or

25 about December 21, 2017, by Respondents the City of Ukiah and the City Council of the City

26 of Ukiah (collectively the "CITY") to the Ukiah Rifle and Pistol Club, Inc. (the "GUN CLUB"),

27 allowing the demolition of the main range and construction of a different and modern structure, "one

28 of the biggest projects in recent Club history" (hereafter referred to as "the PROJECT"). Petitioner
Vichy Springs Resort y. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

U 3

VICHY SPRINGS RESORT brings this action because the CITY and Respondent the County of

2 Mendocino and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Mendocino (collectively the "COUNTY")

3 did not, and refuse to, comply with their own land use laws and State environmental laws, including

4 the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21000 et seq.) (CEQA), in

5 allowing the issuance of the building permits for the GUN CLUB, as has been the case with many

6 other similar previous land use approvals.

7 2. More generally, the CITY and the COUNTY have pattern and practice of failing

8 to regulate the GUN CLUB, which hurts the environment and the public, including Petitioner. In

9 particular, the extensive use of lead bullets on the subject property has caused a buildup of lead

10 throughout the site, with the result, among others, that water flowing off the property contains

11 hazardous lead levels far in excess of what federal and state regulatory authorities consider

12 acceptable for wildlife, human health, or drinking water purposes. These problems will only grow

13 worse over time without intervention by this court.

14 3. Consequently, Petitioner seeks the following relief: (i) a peremptory writ of mandate

15 directing the CITY to set aside its approval of the above-described building permits; (ii) a

16 declaration that the CITY and COUNTY have engaged, and continue to engage, in an unlawful

17 pattern and practice of ignoring their obligations to enforce pertinent land use and environmental
18 laws with respect to the ongoing operation of the GUN CLUB, including, in particular, the Planning

19 and Zoning Law (Government Code §65000 et seq.) and CEQA; (iii) an injunction requiring the

20 CITY and the COUNTY to regulate the GUN CLUB pursuant to, and consistent with, the two local

21 agencies' respective regulatory powers over land use and environmental quality occurring at the

22 GUN CLUB, and an injunction directing the GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly

23 authorized activities within the GUN CLUB site until such time, if ever, as both the CITY and the
24 COUNTY have granted all of the necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed

25 for such activities to proceed in a lawful manner.

15 capacities.

16 III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17 13. The property occupied by the GUN CLUB is owned by the CITY OF UKIAH in an

18 unincorporated area of the County of Mendocino.

19 14. The GUN CLUB originally leased the property from Leo Franceschi Johnson, Linda
20 Franceschi, and Harry Franceschi (*FRANCESCHIS"). The property leased by the GUN CLUB is

21 not zoned for shooting ranges under the Mendocino County Zoning Code. (See Mendocino Zoning
22 Code $20.060.010.) The County designated the GUN CLUB as a nonconforming use in 1982.

23 15. On or about December 20, 1993, the CITY acquired the property at 2300 Vichy
24 Springs Road (approximately 96.82 acres of real property) from the FRANCESCHIS. The CITY

25 asserted that the public purpose for the purchase of the real property was to use it as a buffer zone

26 against additional residential development occurring on the south side of Vichy Springs Road, which
27 could impact then existing landfill operations.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 4

1 16. The purchase was approved at the December 15, 1993 City Council Meeting. Prior
2 to voting on the purchase, the City Manager informed the Council members that the property was

3 used for the GUN CLUB's operations, and that the CITY would assume the existing 50-year lease

4 between the FRANCESCHIS and GUN CLUB, which was set to expire in 2044.

5 17. The CITY did not prepare an Environmental Impact Report or Negative Declaration

6 for its actions purchasing the property or assuming the lease; nor did the CITY otherwise issue

7 Notice of Exemption asserting that such actions were exempt from CEQA.

8 18. The Lease does not require the GUN CLUB to provide any public benefit. The GUN
9 CLUB is not open to the public, except for events controlled by the GUN CLUB. The GUN CLUB

10 exclusively controls club membership and otherwise limits public access to the property at 2300
11 Vichy Springs Road. There is a coded, locked gate for exclusive use by members. New membership
12 requires sponsorship by existing members. The GUN CLUB also requires that its members maintain

13 a membership with the National Rifle Association (NRA).

14 19, Since the CITY purchased the property, the GUN CLUB's membership has grown

15 from 40 to over 1,000 members. The GUN CLUB has dramatically increased the number of special

16 events it hosts. It has also allowed, for many years, overnight camping on multiple occasions.

17 20. The GUN CLUB has constructed new and/or modified the structures located on the

18 CITY -owned property. A new club house and kitchen were built, and the GUN CLUB has spent

19 over $350,000.00 on three new ranges (pistol, rifle, and traps). The use of these ranges has led to a
20 proliferation of lead bullets throughout the subject site, resulting in, among other things, the

21 contamination of water flowing from the property. The GUN CLUB did not obtain the CITY's

22 approval for these projects or apply for a use permit or obtain building permits from Respondent

23 COUNTY.

24 21. Government Code § 53091(a) requires that each local agency shall comply with all

25 applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the county or city in which the territory of

26 the agency is situated. Under Government Code $ 53090, local agency does not include : city or

27 county. Read together, cities which own property in unincorporated portions of a county are exempt

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate • 5

or immune from county ordinances and counties which own properties in cities are exempt or

2 immune from city ordinances. The CITY's exemption or immunity is not transferred to the GUN
CLUB, a private lessee, since the GUN CLUB's use of the property serves the GUN CLUB's private

4 interest.

5 22. The County believes the intergovernmental immunity provided in Government Code

6 §§ 53090 and 53091 applies to the Gun Club, the City's private lessee. Because of the County's
7 interpretation of Government Code §g 53090 and 53091, the County has a policy of not asserting
8 land use jurisdiction over the Gun Club's use of the leased premises under the Gun Club's Lease.
9 The City accepts the County's position that the County's General Plan, zoning, and building codes
10 do not apply to the Gun Club's activities on the property under the immunity provided in

11 Government Code §§ 53090 and 53091.

12 23. The CITY's and the COUNTY's interpretation of Government Code §§ 53090 and

13 53091 is unreasonable and arbitrary as the GUN CLUB is a private club engaged in its own private

14 pursuits. The GUN CLUB's use is not a public use for the public benefit. The GUN CLUB is not

15 an arm or agent of the CITY.

16 24. Additionally, the CITY through its contracting powers has the ability to regulate the
17 GUN CLUB by enforcing the Lease on the property and requiring the GUN CLUB to comply with
18 the COUNTY's General Plan, zoning and building codes. But, the CITY does not require the GUN
19 CLUB to comply with the COUNTY's laws. Instead, as to the GUN CLUB, the CITY has a policy
20 of issuing building permits outside of its jurisdiction.

21 25. Consequently, the CITY does not regulate the GUN CLUB in accordance with

22 CEQA, the Ukiah City Code, or the Ukiah General Plan. The COUNTY similarly does not regulate
23 the GUN CLUB in accordance with CEQA, the Mendocino County General Plan, or County Zoning
24 and Building Codes. As a result of the indifference of both the CITY and the COUNTY to the

25 activities occurring within the GUN CLUB site, the property has become an island of unregulated

26 private activity in which unsupervised individuals are engaged in actions, some of which are
27 dangerous and/or harmful to the environment, that could not lawfully occur without governmental

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 6-

1 authorization on typical private property located in the COUNTY's unincorporated area.

2 26. Both the CITY and the COUNTY cannot be correct in refusing to oversee and

3 regulate what occurs on the GUN CLUB site, particularly given the operator's reckless use of lead,

4 which has contaminated not only the GUN CLUB site but also adjacent waterways and private and
5 public properties. Indeed, both of these local agencies are incorrect in their views of their obligations

6 regarding the subject property. Both the CITY and the COUNTY are obligated to protect the public

7 interest and general welfare by regulating and supervising the often dangerous and environmentally

8 harmful activities occurring with the GUN CLUB. The COUNTY must treat the property as de facto

9 private property in its unincorporated area, and thus subject to the full panoply of the COUNTY's
10| regulatory powers, including its police power and its statutory authority under, inter alia, the
11 Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA. Alternatively, at least one of the two local agencies should

12 assert some level of control over the GUN CLUB: either the CITY through its role as Lessor, or the
13 COUNTY in a regulatory capacity.

14 IV. THE PROJECT

15 27. In order to accommodate the increase in use, the GUN CLUB undertook to demolish

16 the main range and rebuild with a different and modern structure. Copies of the GUN CLUB's
17 announcement as to its proposed PROJECT, the Building Permit Application to the CITY and Plans,

18 detailing the scope of work, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A". ("the PROJECT")

19 28. The GUN CLUB's soil is contaminated with lead and clay pigeons; and runoff from

20 the ranges, rich in lead, has already contaminated water flowing off the site and will continue to do
21 so on a greater scale under the PROJECT. The demolition of this lead-contaminated building and

22 the grading and storage of lead contaminated soil will have a direct impact on the environment. The

23 PROJECT will also increase noise, traffic, and safety concerns which will directly impact the
24 I environment.

25 29. The PROJECT is designed to provide shelter and comfort to the shooter by providing

26 protection from the sun, wind, shadows and rain which will increase the use and capacity. The

27 structure has 2 doors one at each end of the structure, a bathroom, a heater, and exterior lighting.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 The use of the main range structure will increase the proliferation of lead on the premises.
2 30. The COUNTY is authorized to issue a building permit and use permit for the GUN

3 CLUB's PROJECT. The CITY and the COUNTY must require the GUN CLUB to obtain approvals

4 from the COUNTY for the PROJECT as the property is in the COUNTY's jurisdiction.

5 31. The CITY does not have the power under the Ukiah City Code to issue building

6 permits for the GUN CLUB property outside the CITY. (See Ukiah Zoning Code § 9002 and 9351)

7 Of equal importance, the PROJECT is contrary to the Mendocino County Code, as Section

8 20.204.015(B) thereof provides that, once a nonconforming structure is voluntarily demolished, the
9 nonconforming use cannot be resumed.

10 32. As stated above, the COUNTY designated the GUN CLUB as nonconforming use
11 in 1982. Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B) provides that "whenever a structure, the

12 use of which does not conform with the regulations for the zone in which it is located, or a structure

13 which does not comply with the standards of yard spaces, height of structures, distance between
14 structures, parking, etc., prescribed in the regulations for the zone in which it is located shall be

15 voluntarily razed, the structure shall not be restored except in full conformity with the regulations

16 of the zone in which it is located, and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed."

17 33. Mendocino County Code § 18.08.010 provides as follows:

18 "Except as otherwise exempted by the California Building Code and/or other county ordinances, no person, firm, or corporation shall 19 erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, occupy,
20 remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure in the unincorporated area of the County or cause the same to be done
21 without first obtaining a separate building permit for each such building or structure as required by this Title. Permits shall be issued and fees collected by the Planning and Building Services 22 Department."

23 34. After the main range is "voluntarily razed", under Mendocino County Code §
24 20.060.025 R-L Rangeland District, the GUN CLUB's use, a civic use type, "lodge, fraternal and
25 civic assembly", is only permitted upon the issuance of a Major Use Permit. The COUNTY is
26 authorized to issue a use permit for the GUN CLUB's PROJECT. (See County Zoning Code §
27 20.196) The granting of a use permit by the COUNTY would require environmental review under

Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate $ 8

1 CEQA.

2 35. Mendocino County Code § 20.216.005(B) provides that "It shall be the duty of the

3 Planning and Building Services Department and of the officers of County herein and/or otherwise

4 charged by law with the enforcement of this Division to enforce this Division and all provisions of

5 the same."

6 36. Mendocino County Zoning Code § 20.216.025, Public Nuisance Abatement,

7 provides that:

8 "Any use of the property or any building set up, erected, built, moved or maintained contrary to the provisions of this Division shall be and the same is hereby declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance. The

10 office of the County Counsel shall immediately commence action or actions, proceeding or proceedings, for the abatement, removal and
11 enjoinment thereof in the manner provided by law and shall take such other steps and shall apply to such court or courts as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate and remove such 12 building or enjoin such use and restrain and enjoin any persons, firms,

: 13 or corporation or other entity from setting up, erecting, building, moving or maintaining any such building or using any property
14 contrary to the provisions of this division.'

15 Mendocino County Code § 1.04.020, Definitions and Rules of Construction, provides
16 that "shall" is mandatory.

17 37. Petitioner and the public will be harmed as a result of the CITY's and COUNTY's
18 ongoing policies and practices of bypassing the requirements of CEQA and ignoring the procedural
19 and substantive requirements of the COUNTY's own zoning ordinances. Petitioner has notified the
20 CITY and COUNTY of these acts orally and in a letter complaint dated October 31, 2017.
21 38. VSR's letter complaint objecting to the "construction of a new facility without County
22 CEQA process; Use Permit or Building Permits" was received by the COUNTY on November 3,
23 2017. On December 13, 2017, the COUNTY, without any notice to VSR or public input or hearing,
24 determined that the PROJECT is in the "jurisdiction of City of Ukiah per Lease Agreement. Permits
25 are obtained by the City". VSR's complaint was closed on December 13, 2017.
26 39. Another complaint of "operating a major shooting range without a use permit.
27 Making improvements and grading excavation without permits. Noise in excess and lead pollution

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 9-

in Russian River" was received by the COUNTY on January 9, 2017 but the COUNTY failed to act
2 on the complaint. A copy of the October 31, 2017 letter complaint from VSR, the COUNTY'S

3 response to the complaint, and the Code Violation Complaint are attached hereto as Exhibit "B".

4 40. The CITY issued building permits and the PROJECT commenced on/or about

5 January 2, 2018 without any CEQA review by the COUNTY. The COUNTY has the power to

6 modify, reduce, or mitigate the uses of the PROJECT to alleviate environmental impacts by:
7 requiring the GUN CLUB to engage in a proactive lead removal program that includes annual
8 reclamation efforts at the main range, requiring that the GUN CLUB develop and implement a
pollution prevention plan that complies with the EPA's 2005 Guidelines regarding the management
10 practices of shooting ranges, require that the GUN CLUB use lead free ammunition at the main range
11 until it can show that it is no longer contributing lead to Sulfur Creek and the Russian River, and by
12 limiting the hours of use and allowed uses at the main range.

13 41. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies in that the PROJECT is

14 proceeding and there are no appeal or administrative procedures provided by state or local laws.

15 Such efforts were not required as a precondition to filing this litigation, however, as neither the CITY

16 nor the COUNTY provided any opportunity for public review and comment on its position or any

17 opportunity to participate in any hearing or submit evidence. (See Public Resources Code §21167(e)
18 [exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required under CEQA "there was no public hearing

19 or other opportunity for members of the public to raise ... objections orally or in writing prior to the
20 approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law"];
21 Government Code §65009(b) [similar language limiting the application of the exhaustion doctrine

22 under the Planning and Zoning Law].)

23 42. Petitioner does not have plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
24 of law because Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental
25 damage and by the Respondents' violations of CEQA, the Ukiah City Code and General Plan, and

26 Mendocino County planning, zoning and building laws.

1 V. VENUE AND JURISDICTION

2 43. This court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

3 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), and 1085 (traditional mandamus); and

4 Public Resources Code sections 21167(d) (statute of limitations) and 21 168.5 (traditional mandamus

5 review under CEQA).

6 44. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

7 (actions against public officers) and 395 (actions generally) because the offices of both the CITY and

8 the COUNTY, as well as Petitioner's place of doing business (and locus of harms), are all located

9 in Mendocino County.

10 45. On January 3, 2018, before the commencement of this action, Petitioner served

11 written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondents in accordance with the

12 requirements of Public Resource Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of this notice and

13 its proof of service are attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and incorporated herein by this reference.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Failure to Comply with CEQA Against the CITY and the COUNTY)

16 46. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

17 herein paragraphs 1-45.

18 47. CEQA applies to all nonexempt discretionary projects. (Public Resource Code

19 §21080(a).) A "project" is an activity undertaken, approved, funded, or permitted by a public agency

20 that may cause a direct, or reasonably foreseeable indirect, physical change in the environment.

21 (Public Resource Code §21065.) The GUN CLUB's proposed activity is project under CEQA as

22 it requires a use permit from the COUNTY. Further, the CITY and COUNTY have the ability and

23 authority to mitigate environmental damage or to deny the PROJECT.

24 48. The CITY asserts that private projects that only require a ministerial permit by a

25 public agency are not projects subject to CEQA and building permits are generally considered

26 ministerial permits to which CEQA does not apply.

27 49. However, there is no City Code that allows the CITY to issue a building permit to the

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 11 -

A

1 GUN CLUB since the property is outside the CITY's jurisdiction. Through Section 3000 of the

2 Ukiah City Code, the City Council has adopted and made "effective within the City" the model codes

3 and specific appendices listed and defined in Sections 3001-3011 of the Ukiah City Code (Building

4 Regulations Chapter). In turn, Section 3012 of the Ukiah City Code defines "jurisdiction," as used

5 in any of the model codes adopted, to mean the "City of Ukiah." The GUN CLUB property is not

6 within the City.

7 50. The CITY must require the GUN CLUB to obtain approvals, including a building

8 permit and a use permit, for the PROJECT, from the COUNTY as the property is in the COUNTY's
jurisdiction. Because, the CITY is no longer functioning as the owner of the subject property but
10 instead has delegated most of the responsibilities of ownership to a private party (the GUN CLUB),

11 the COUNTY has regulatory land use jurisdiction over the property, which lies in the unincorporated

12 area, notwithstanding Government Code ! 53091. The COUNTY's regulatory obligation over the
13 property include the need to comply with CEQA prior to exercising its discretion to authorize land

14 use changes or intensification of use with potential adverse environmental consequences. The

15 PROJECT thus cannot lawfully proceed absent appropriate regulatory approvals from the COUNTY,

16 preceded by compliance with CEQA.

17 51. The actions of the CITY and the COUNTY in allowing the PROJECT constitute a

18 prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the CITY and the COUNTY failed to proceed in the manner

19 required by law and its decision is not supported by substantial evidence as follows: (a) The CITY
20 has wrongfully issued building permits and a Certificate of Occupancy for a structure on property

21 located outside of its jurisdiction and in violation of its codes, (b) the CITY has improperly

22 determined that the GUN CLUB's PROJECT is not subject to CEQA and filed an Exemption, (c)

23 the COUNTY has to exercise discretion and cannot have a blanket policy of no CEQA enforcement

24 against the GUN CLUB, (d) the COUNTY has a mandatory duty to enforce its zoning laws and has

25 to take some action on the violations in the GUN CLUB's PROJECT, (e) the CITY and the

26 COUNTY's interpretation of Government Code §§ 53090 and 53091 is arbitrary and unreasonable

27 as the GUN CLUB is a private club, and (f) the COUNTY's decision to take no action as to the GUN

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 12 •

CLUB's PROJECT is unreasonable and arbitrary in view of the environmental harm caused by the

2 PROJECT.

3 52. The PROJECT may cause a significant impact on the environment, including, but not

4 limited to, the use and storage of hazardous materials and water, air, noise, safety, fire, and traffic

5 impacts, plus the impact on a state landmark (the Vichy Springs Resort) and neighboring properties.

6 Consequently, the CITY and the COUNTY have prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to
7 proceed in a manner required by law as set forth above. The Building Permits and the Certificate

8 of Occupancy must be set aside. The COUNTY must comply with CEQA and consider the
9 PROJECT.

10
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
11
(Against the CITY and COUNTY for Violation of Mendocino 12 County Zoning Ordinance and Violation of Ukiah Code)

13 53. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth
14 | herein paragraphs 1-52.

15 54. The building permits are invalid and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion as
16 the CITY does not have the power to issue building permits to the GUN CLUB since the property
17 is outside the city limits. The CITY codes do not allow the CITY to grant building permits outside

18 of its jurisdiction. The CITY has no discretion to issue building permits and a Certificate of
19 Occupancy that violates its City codes. The CITY's actions are illegal and void.
20 55. The COUNTY's acquiescence in allowing the PROJECT is a prejudicial abuse of
21 discretion under Mendocino Zoning Code Section 20.204.015(B), which provides that, once the
22 main range is demolished, the nonconforming use shall not be resumed. The COUNTY is required
23 to enforce its zoning and building codes and must take some action as to the violations in the GUN

24 CLUB's PROJECT. (See also Mendocino County Code 20.216.005(B) and 20.216.025)
25 56. The COUNTY's action in allowing the CITY to issue a building a permit and a
26 Certificate of Occupancy in the COUNTY's jurisdiction is arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and

27 a violation of law. The COUNTY abused its discretion in that the COUNTY continues to maintain

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 13 •

1 its unreasonable and arbitrary interpretation of Government Code §§ 53090 and 53091, despite

2 recent Attorney General opinions.

3 57. The COUNTY's decision to take no action as to the GUN CLUB's PROJECT is an

4 abuse of discretion in view of the environmental harm caused by the GUN CLUB's activities.

5 Accordingly, the building permits and the Certificate of Occupancy must be set aside. The

6 COUNTY must take some action to enforce its zoning and building codes set forth herein.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Violation of Planning Laws)

9 58. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth

10 herein paragraphs 1-57.

11 59. The building permits are invalid and constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion in that

12 the CITY failed to proceed in the manner required by law as the CITY did not consider its General

13 Plan policies or the General Plan policies of Mendocino County. The PROJECT must be in

14 compliance with the General Plan policies of the CITY and the COUNTY.

15 60. For example, there is no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan

16 policies of the CITY:

17 Policy CT-1.2: City and County Staff shall include traffic and circulation information in
18 staff reports to their respective Planning Commissions.
19
Policy CT-1.3: All proposed development shall be
20 reviewed for its immediate and cumulative transportation impacts.
21
Policy CT-16.4: Balance the need for new development
22 with methods of accommodating increasing traffic.
23

24 61. There is also no evidence that the CITY applied the following General Plan policies

25 of Mendocino County:

26 Policy DE-98: The County will protect residential areas and other noise-sensitive

27 uses from excessive noise by doing the following:

28
Vicky Springs Resort v. City of Uliah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 14 -

1 1)

2 Requiring that new land uses, new roadways, and other new noise sources do not create unacceptable noise levels on adjacent parcels.
a m + 40 ***

3) Requiring the County decisions which would cause or allow an increase in noise created by stationary or mobile sources (such as development of noise-generating land uses or the construction of new or wider roadways) be informed by a

7 noise analysis and accompanied by noise reduction measures to keep noise at acceptable levels.

8 Policy DE-121: New discretionary development will be required to demonstrate that

9 basic infrastructure is available and has adequate capacity to serve the project without degrading, existing level of service standards.

10 Policy DE-203: All development projects shall include plans and facilities to store

11 and manage solid waste and hazardous materials and wastes in a safe and environmentally sound manner.

12 Policy DE-208: Land uses, densities and intensities shall be designed to reduce human

13 risk and exposure to hazardous conditions and events.
Policy DE-214:
14 The County shall deny development proposals that present substantial fire hazard risk to residents and safety providers responding to a wildland fire.
15 Policy DE-215:
16 Development shall be located, designed and managed to reduce fire risk to life, property and natural resources, and incorporates adequate

17 fire protection consistent with the General Plan and adopted regulations.

18 62.

19 The CITY's approval must be consistent with the applicable General Plan policies

20 of the CITY and Mendocino County. The CITY's actions were arbitrary and capricious and there

21 1S no substantial evidence to support the issuance of the building permits. The building permits are
invalid and must be set aside.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Declaratory Relief - Failure to Regulate)
24 63.

25 Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference as though fully set forth
herein paragraphs 1-62.

26 64.

27 Respondent CITY and COUNTY refuse to regulate the activities of the GUN CLUB

28 on the a CITY owned property, and have a pattern or practice of not complying with CEQA, the

Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 15

Planning and Zoning Law, their respective General Plans, and other pertinent governing regulatory
2 authorities. Furthermore, the GUN CLUB should seek from the COUNTY whatever regulatory

3 approvals would be needed to ensure that GUN CLUB projects are consistent with the COUNTY's

4 General Plan, zoning, and other applicable County regulatory requirements. Such requests for

5 approvals will trigger the COUNTY's obligations under CEQA where the approvals sought would

6 require the COUNTY to exercise discretion and have some potential for adverse environmental

7 effects.

8 65. Respondent COUNTY contends that it has no authority to regulate the GUN CLUB
property, even though it is located in an unincorporated portion of the County and is used for private

10 GUN CLUB purposes. The CITY contends that it has no power to regulate, except for the issuance

11 of building permits, because the GUN CLUB property is outside of city limits.

12 66. Respondent COUNTY contends that pursuant to Government Code sections 53090

13 and 53091, cities and counties are mutually exempt from each other's building and zoning

14 ordinances and, therefore, the CITY is exempt from the COUNTY's building and zoning regulations

15 on the property it owns, and the COUNTY has no jurisdiction to enforce its general plan, zoning,

16 and building regulations on the property. Over the years, the COUNTY's refusal to assert any sort

17 of regulatory authority over the property amounts to an established policy of simply ignoring what
18 occurs on the property, to the detriment of the public interest and environment. If the COUNTY had

19 been properly regulating the GUN CLUB in recent years, the dangerous proliferation of lead
20 throughout the property and onto adjacent properties might not have occurred.

21 67. Petitioner alleges that the COUNTY is obligated to regulate lands within its
22 jurisdiction, including unincorporated areas of the County. Petitioner alleges that the Mendocino

23 County Building and Zoning Codes, the General Plans of the CITY and COUNTY, and CEQA apply

24 to the GUN CLUB.

25 68. Petitioner alleges that there is no immunity under Government Code sections 53090

26 and 53091 since the GUN CLUB is a private club engaged in its own private pursuits, in accordance

27 with a Lease that provides no public benefit or use. At present, the property is de facto private

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 16 •

property subject to the COUNTY's various regulatory powers on the same footing as other private

2 property in the unincorporated area. Yet the COUNTY treats the property as though the CITY used

3 it for city purposes (e.g., a corporation yard).

4 69. Respondents CITY and COUNTY wrongfully fail to require the GUN CLUB to

5 obtain Use Permits or to comply with General Plan policies, zoning requirements, building laws of

6 the County, or CEQA. The granting of a Use Permit by the COUNTY would require environmental

7 review under CEQA. Petitioner contends that the GUN CLUB has engaged in multiple violations

8 of applicable land use laws with the CITY's and the COUNTY's knowledge. This anarchic approach
9 to land use planning, which has resulted in the GUN CLUB's profligate use of lead bullets resulting
10 in widespread lead contamination, will continue throughout the remaining life of the Lease absent
11 intervention from this court.

12 70. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to changes

13 to non-conforming uses, and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. Mendocino

14 Zoning Code section 20.204.020 restricts changes to non-conforming uses absent a permit: "[a] non-

15 conforming use may increase its volume of operation provided the structure is not altered or enlarged

16 to accommodate its increase without obtaining a use permit." (See also Zoning Code § 20.204.025)

17 Since the CITY assumed the Lease in 1993, the GUN CLUB has changed its non-conforming use

18 and modified structures on the property to accommodate the changed use. Petitioner has notified

19 the CITY and COUNTY of these changes, but to no avail.

20 71. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Zoning Code with respect to camping,

21 and the CITY and COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Zoning Code section
22  20.060.025 requires facilities that permit camping to obtain a Major Use Permit. The State of

23 California requires a license to operate a campground. Yet the Gun Club allows unauthorized

24 overnight camping on the property.

25 72. The GUN CLUB has violated the COUNTY's Building Code, and the CITY and

26 COUNTY have not compelled compliance. The COUNTY's Building Code requires that "no

27 person, firm, or corporation shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, occupy,

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al.
Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 17.

1 remove, convert, or demolish any building or structure in the unincorporated area of the County or

2 cause the same to be done without first obtaining a separate building permit for each such building

3 or structure..." (Mendocino County Code §18.08.010.) The GUN CLUB has not obtained a building

4 permit from the COUNTY for construction that has occurred since 1993.

5 73. The failure to regulate has created a continuing nuisance on the property since there

6 are excessive noise, traffic, pollution, fire hazards and safety concerns from the GUN CLUB's

7 activities on the CITY's property. The GUN CLUB's use of the land is impairing the use and

8 enjoyment of VICHY SPRINGS RESORT and neighboring properties.
9 74. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists relating to the rights and duties of

10 the parties herein. On the one hand, Petitioner contends, as described above, that the CITY and the

11 COUNTY have failed to regulate the GUN CLUB, and that the actions of the CITY and COUNTY

12 have created a continuing nuisance on the property. On the other hand, the CITY and the COUNTY

13 claim that they have no obligation to regulate the GUN CLUB or to enjoin the GUN CLUB's

14 activities. The COUNTY claims that, under Government Code sections 53090 and 53091, GUN

15 CLUB is exempt from the COUNTY's Building and Zoning Codes.

16 75. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of its rights, and a declaration as to the
17 | construction and application of Government Code §§53090 and 53091 and a determination that the

18 GUN CLUB is subject to land use regulations by Respondents either because there is no immunity

19 or the Lease requires regulation. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time

20 under the circumstances in order that Petitioner may ascertain its rights under the law and a
21 determination that there is no immunity under Government Code §53090 and 53091 and/or under

22 the Lease.

23 76. Petitioner also seeks an injunction requiring the CITY and the COUNTY to compel

24 the GUN CLUB to comply with the applicable land use laws cited above. Unless Petitioner is
25 granted injunctive relief, Petitioner and the public will suffer irreparable harm in that the CITY's and
26 COUNTY's failure to regulate will further the adverse environmental impact described in this

27 Petition.

28
Vichy Springs Resort v. City of Ukiah, et al. Second Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate - 18 .

1 77. Petitioner also seeks preliminary and permanent prohibitory injunctions directing the

2 GUN CLUB to cease all unauthorized or improperly authorized activities within the GUN CLUB

3 site until such time, if ever, as either the CITY or the COUNTY, or both, have granted all of the

4 necessary governmental authorizations and Lease approvals needed for such activities to proceed in

5 a lawful manner.

6

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for Judgment as follows:

8 1. That the Court issue a peremptory Writ of Mandate commanding the CITY to rescind,

9 void and set side the Building Permits, the Certificate of Occupancy, the Notice of Exemption and

10 the COUNTY's decision to take no action on the PROJECT; further commanding the COUNTY to

Big News!

This is big! REALLY BIG! Beginning Monday, November 6th the
Main Range will be closed for six to eight weeks. Why you ask?

118IHX3 Because, if everything goes as planned, the Main Range is getting torn down and replaced! This will be one of the biggest projects in
recent Club history. And boy do we all know how bad it needs to

> happen. The building will be straightened out to provide for better
safety. The roof will be raised. Modern sound proofing will be
installed. The list goes on and on! Who else is excited about this!?

ATTACHMENT TO COMPLAINT REGARDING LACK OF PROPER PERMITTING (2 pages)
1. Since 1982 the Ukiah Gun Club has had no use permit or building permits
2. The county (responsible entity) where the club is located has taken the position that It ls
the city's responsibllity to regulate.
3. The city (landlord) has publicly taken the position that it is the county that is responsible
to regulate
4. Items 2 & 3 above are documented in grand jury report 5. The county staff has members of the club, historically and now, as does the city
6. The club, since 1982, has built buildings, 4 ranges, septic systems, major grading,
automatic electrified trap throws with coin operation, wiring throughout several
buildings, lighting for facilities and for unpermitted (state permit required) campground.
7. There is no ADA compliance yet they are open to the public
8. Noise levels for neighbors exceed 90 decibels
9. Ricochets are very common with persons being hit, vehicles damaged and buildings
damaged on sight. Off sight two windows broken at our resort, one in the subdivision. 10. The club has started five fires in the last 25 years, two of which burned over 100 acres
and imperiled our resort and 250 neighbors in their homes.
11. The city in the last two years has issued one or two building permits. The city manager
has told me personally that he allowed this, even though he knew it was inappropriate
and not according to state rules as the club is in the county. He said he did this to assure
the construction is to UCB standards. I explained they were complicit in an illegal
construction scheme as in CA all projects are subject to CEQA and therefore either
zoning allows the use or a conditional use permit is necessary before a building permit
can be issued.
12. The club has neither of #11 above nor has a CEQA review ever been done.
13. Lead is everywhere and up to 6" deep.
14. Lead is carried offsite by wind and breezes in the form of lead dust. There has been a
dramatic increase in lead 50 feet from the club on common areas of the subdivision to
the south. Lead also leaves the sight with rain runoff to the Russian River,
15. This complaint is that there exists no proper use permit or CEQA study to allow the city
issued buliding permits. Also, the city has no standing to issue building permits in the
county. Therefore, the intended construction beginning 6 November is not permitted
regardless of the attempt by the club to circumvent and obfuscate the laws of CA and
CEQA by going around the CEQA/use permit process to gain a form of credibility with a
City of Ukiah building permit. There is a deflned separation of powers in CA and the
county is a division of the state the city is not. The county cannot pass its obligations to
the-eity-without-formal-annexation-of-the-property-by-the-city

MC-00008

Please uphold our county-wide rights to county Issued permits on county property. Require the
club to apply for use permit and if granted apply for county building permits just as our
business and all others in the county must do and have done. Please note the zoning
ordinances of the city also require either proper zoning which allows a use or a use permit for a
specific use.
This a is a very dangerous gun club unregulated and unpermitted. To allow an expansion without
proper CEQA review is improper and the contractor is risking his license if it continues.
The enclosed is only a partial list of the violations at this club.
Thank you,
