VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner and Plaintiff Friends of Oceano Dunes, Inc., a California not-for-profit
2 corporation ("Friends" or "Petitioner"), on its own behalf. on behalf of its members, on
3 behalf of the general public and in the public interest, petitions this Court for a writ of
4 administrative mandamus (C.C.P. § 1094.5), and/or a writ for traditional mandamus
5 (C.C.P. § 1085), and for injunctive relief, directed to Respondent/Defendant California
6 Coastal Commission ("CCC"), and Respondent/Defendant California Department of
7 Parks and Recreation ("State Parks") (with respect to the First Cause of Action, Count 4
8 only), and under Pub. Res. Code §S 21168 and/or 21168.5, for violations of the California
9 Environmental Quality Act, as follows:
10 By this Verified Petition and Complaint, Friends alleges:
11 INTRODUCTION
12 1. Friends brings this lawsuit to challenge Respondent and Defendant CCC's
13 March 18, 2021 unilateral amendment of existing coastal development permit ("CDP") 4-
14 82-300 for Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area ("SVRA") without full
15 compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). CDP 4-82-300, as
16 previously amended, authorized OHV recreation, beach driving and beach camping at
17 Oceano Dunes SVRA, and has done so for nearly 40 years. The CDP amendment
18 purports to eliminate OHV recreation, beach driving and beach camping at Oceano
19 Dunes SVRA in no less than three years, but also purports to authorize an immediate
20 Icessation of that recreational activity.
21 2. Several years ago, with the blessing of the CCC, State Parks began the
22 development of a "public works plan,' or "PWP,' in accordance with the Coastal Act, Pub.
23 Res. Code S 30605. A PWP is a long-range land use development plan that public
24 facilities may use in lieu of project by project coastal development permits. State Parks
25 expended enormous public funds (estimated at millions of dollars), and agency resources,
26 developing the proposed PWP, and conducted numerous public meetings to hear public
27 input on the plan. Parks also coordinated with other state and local government entities,
28 and regularly reported back to the CCC. In the last few days of December 2020, State

Z
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Parks released a draft PWP and a draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") to the
2 public and the CCC. The PWP, draft EIR and supporting exhibits totaled some 3,000
3 pages of dense and complex plans for reworking land uses at Oceano Dunes SVRA. State
4 Parks asked the public to provide comments by March 2, 2021. The public and Friends
5 began preparing extensive written comments on the PWP.

6 3. At the end of the day on February 17, 2021, without any consultation or
7 discussion with State Parks, the CCC staff issued a staff report announcing the CCC's

8 intention to unilaterally modify CDP 4-82-300 to eliminate all OHV recreation, beach
9 driving and camping at Oceano Dunes SVRA. The CCC set a hearing on its "out-of-the
10 blue" proposal for less than a month later, on March 18, 2021. The CCC did not include
11 on the agenda the PWP, but nonetheless, the CCC staff report purported to analyze and
12 reject the draft PWP, and devoted many, many pages to analyzing the draft PWP released
13 the last few days of December 2020.
14 4. The CCC's "bait and switch" created great confusion among the public,
15 other governmental entities and agencies, elected officials, and several of the Coastal
16 Commissioners themselves. State Parks, caught totally off guard, reacted like a deer in
17 the headlights.

18 5. This massive switch in the "project," at the last minute after a multi-year a

19 PWP process violates CEQA's stable project description requirement. The CCC also
20 violated CEQA by failing to study the environmental impacts, inter alia, eliminating
21 coastal recreational opportunities that had existed for 40 years, including OHV
22 recreation, beach driving and camping, and closing a key access to the park (and shifting
23 all park traffic to the City of Grover Beach).

24 6. Accordingly, Petitioner Friends brings this CEQA action to set aside the
25 CCC's unlawful CDP amendment.

26 7. Friends also brings Count 4 against State Parks because the CCC's thrusting
27 of the CDP amendment prematurely committed Parks to the special conditions and
28 closure of the SVRA when Parks had no opportunity to perform any CEQA review at all.

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F THE PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 8. Petitioner Friends is, and at all times referenced in this Petition and

3 Complaint, a California not-for-profît corporation and watchdog association, with its
4 principal place of business in San Luis Obispo County, California.

5 9. Friends was expressly created to preserve and create recreational uses,
6 including off-highway vehicle recreation, at Oceano Dunes, which is located within the
7 coastal zone. Friends is a voluntary organization which represents approximately 28,000
8 members and users of Oceano Dunes SVRA, who routinely engage, have engaged and
9 plan to continue to engage in motorized OHV recreation, beach driving and camping at
10 Oceano Dunes, as well as hiking and enjoyment of coastal resources, habitat and species.
11 No less than hundreds of members engage, have engaged and plan to continue to engage
12 in coastal access, motorized OHV recreation, beach driving, beach camping and
13 enjoyment of coastal resources at Oceano Dunes SVRA multiple times each year.

14 10. Friends was formed in 2001 for the express purpose of "preserving and
15 developing recreational uses" at Oceano Dunes in San Luis Obispo County.

16 11. Friends' members live near, use, recreate, visit and personally enjoy the
17 aesthetic, environmental, wildlife and recreational resources of Oceano Dunes SVRA,
18 including but not limited to hiking, walking on the beach, exploring, camping, swimming,
19 horseback riding, motorized and non-motorized recreation, bird watching, surf fishing,
20 surfing, photography of the scenic environment and observing wildlife along the coast.
21 12. Friends' members are taxpayers in California and many pay taxes in San Luis
22 Obispo County. Respondent and Defendant CCC has expended, is expending, and is
23 proposing to expend, substantial public funds to unlawfully close Oceano Dunes SVRA to
24 OHV recreation, beach driving and camping without full compliance with CEQA. The
25 expenditure is illegal and wasteful. Respondent and Defendant State Parks has
26 expended, is expending, and is proposing to expend, substantial public funds to
27 unlawfully close Oceano Dunes SVRA to OHV recreation, beach driving and camping
28 without full compliance with CEQA. The expenditure is illegal and wasteful.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

13. Friends maintains the instant lawsuit for itself and as a representative of its
2 injured members, whom it is duly authorized to represent.

3 14. Friends and its members are adversely affected by the cessation of all OHV
4 recreation, beach driving and camping at Oceano Dunes SVRA.

5 15. Respondent and Defendant CCC is a state commission housed in the

6 California Natural Resources Agency, established pursuant to the provisions of the
7 California Coastal Act (Pub. Res. Code SS 30000 et seq.). In 1982, the CCC approved and
8 issued CDP 4-82-300 that authorized OHV recreation, beach driving and camping at
9 Oceano Dunes SVRA. The CCC has amended the CDP numerous times in the nearly 40
10 years since its initial issuance, and has never proposed to ban OHV recreation, beach

11 driving or camping. On March 18, 2021, the CCC unilaterally amended the CDP to ban
12 OHV, and to ban or severely limit beach driving and beach camping. Petitioner Friends
13 challenges that action here.

14 13. Respondent and Defendant CCC State Parks is, and has been, the state
15 department responsible for managing and operating Oceano Dunes SVRA. It is also
16 housed in the California Natural Resources Agency. Specifically, State Parks has been
17 tasked by the Legislature, in Pub. Res. Code § 5090 et seq. (the "SVRA Act"), to plan,
18 acquire, develop, conserve, and restore lands within the state vehicular recreation areas,
19 including Oceano Dunes SVRA. It also has statutory authority to manage, maintain,
20 administer, and operate SVRAs, including Oceano Dunes SVRA. State Parks is the holder
21 of CDP 4-82-300, and is being ordered by the CCC to ban OHV recreation and ban or
22 limit beach driving and camping in violation of State Parks' statutory authority and
23 mandate. State Parks did not seek an amendment to CDP 4-82-300 in 2021, and was
24 blind-sided by the CCC's action. However, the CCC's action has forced a project on State
25 Parks' without any CEQA review by State Parks.

26 14. Real Party-in-Interest County of San Luis Obispo ("SLO County") is a local
27 governmental agency and subdivision of the State of California with the authority to
28 regulate and administer land use and development within its territory. SLO County is

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

named a as a Real Party-in-Interest because it owns a substantial amount of property
2 known as the "La Grande Tract" (nearly 600 acres) within Oceano Dunes SVRA that is

3 affected by this action.

4 15. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or
5 otherwise, of Does 1 through 50 are unknown to the Petitioner, who therefore sues these
6 defendants/respondents/real-parties-in-interest by fictitious names. Friends will amend
7 this Petition/Complaint to show the Doe defendants/respondents/real-parties-in-
8 interests' true names and capacities when ascertained.
9 16. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure SS 393 and 394(a), venue is proper in that
10 the cause of actions arose and State Parks and SLO County are each located in San Luis
11 Obispo County.

12 17. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to CCP §§ 1085, 1086, 1094.5, 1060,
13 526(a), 527(a), and Pub. Res. Code SS 30801, 30803, 30804, 21168, and 21168.5. This
14 action is timely since it is filed within 30 days of the CCC's illegal March 18, 2021
15 approval, and State Parks' compliance with the special conditions,

16

17 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

18 18. In June 1982, the CCC approved CDP 4-82-300 for Oceano Dunes SVRA,
19 allowing OHV recreation, beach driving and camping. Since 1982, the CDP has been
20 | amended five times prior to 2021 - each time allowing OHV recreation, beach driving
21 and camping.

22 19. Under the CDP that existed before the 2021 amendment, vehicular recreation
23 was permitted in certain areas at Oceano Dunes SVRA. The area in which visitors were
24 allowed to drive their vehicles on the beach starts at the Grand Avenue sand ramp, in
25 Pismo State Beach, and extends approximately six miles south to the southern boundary
26 of the SVRA's open riding and camping area. Marker posts are placed in half mile
27 intervals along the beach beginning approximately 2.0 miles south of Grand Avenue and
28 0.8 miles south of Pier Avenue. Historically, the markers are referred to as mile markers,

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

although they are actually half-mile markers.

2 20. The area between Grand Avenue and marker post 2 is designated as 2 a day-use
3 area and is restricted to street-legal vehicle use only by CDP 4-82-300. This area is
4 | predominately used by people who want to drive their street-legal vehicles on the beach

5 and enjoy day use beach activities such as picnicking, fishing, and wading. This area is
6 also used by visitors towing their vehicles into Oceano Dunes SVRA.

7 21. Beginning south of marker post 2, camping and OHV uses were allowed.

8 There are roughly 1,300 acres of land (out of the 3,600 acres comprising the SVRA)
9 managed for vehicular recreation at Oceano Dunes SVRA. The width of the area open to
10 OHV recreation varies from as little as approximately 400 feet in the vicinity of marker
2 11 posts 2 and 3 to as much as approximately 1.3 miles in the center of the SVRA. In general,
12 the area open to OHV recreational opportunities is bound by a perimeter fence that
13 prevents OHV access from occurring in unauthorized areas. CDP 4-82-300, as previously
14 amended, sets an interim limit on vehicle day-use of vehicles and OHVs.
15 22. Camping was permitted within Oceano Dunes SVRA. CDP 4-82-300 has
16 generally limited the amount of overnight camping units permitted within Oceano Dunes
17 SVRA. Amendment 5 to this CDP, approved in 2001, sets an interim limit of 1,000
18 overnight camping units at Oceano Dunes SVRA (defined as one street-legal vehicle that
19 enters the park under its own power), although the permit limit does not apply on
20 Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, and Thanksgiving. There are no formal, designated
21 campsites; however, on a typical day most camping activity occurs near the beach,
22 between marker posts 2 and 5. During busy periods (holidays and weekends) camping
23 activity can extend farther south and inland.

24 23. The 1,000 individual camp sites at Oceano Dunes SVRA and Pismo State
25 Beach represent approximately 7 percent of the 14,472 total individual and group camp
26 sites in the State Parks system. Of all campsites within the State Parks' system,
27 approximately 6,200 (43%) are in coastal parks. The 1,000 individual campsites at
28 Oceano Dunes SVRA represent a large proportion (approximately 16%) of the available

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

coastal camping sites in the state.

2 24. The ability to camp and drive a vehicle on the beach and sand dunes is a
3 unique recreational opportunity that attracts visitors from throughout the state and
4 country to Oceano Dunes SVRA. Between 1.5 and 2 million people visit the park each
5 year. The SVRA is a tremendous economic asset to SLO County.

6 25. The CCC's March 18, 2021 unilateral amendment to the CDP for Oceano

7 Dunes SVRA purports to ban all OHV recreation, prohibit street-legal vehicles "except

8 within the beach area between the seaward extensions of West Grand and Pier Avenues .

9 (which is not in the SVRA), limit beach camping and reduce the number of campsites
10 by 50 percent (and not allow any camping in the SVRA), close the Pier Avenue entrance
a year around 300- 11 to the park (leaving only 1 entrance to a 3,600 acre park), mandate
12 acre western snowy plover and California least tern habitat exclosure, and ban nighttime
13 vehicle driving in the park. The CCC's action, if allowed, would effectively end the park as
14 a SVRA.

15

16 CERTIFIED REGULATORY PROGRAM EXEMPTION LIMITATIONS

17 26. The CCC has what is known as a "certified regulatory program" exemption
18 under CEQA.

19 27. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.5(c) exempts certified regulatory programs from a
20 limited number of CEQA provisions, namely - Chapter 3 (SS 21100-21108), Chapter 4
21 (SS 21150-21154), and § 21167. While such programs are exempt from the EIR
22 I requirement, they still are "subject to the broad policy goals and substantive standards of
23 CEQA." An agency relying on the exemption is legally obligated to conform to all other
24 CEQA provisions. The certified regulatory program is not a "blanket exemption" from
25 CEQA.

26 28. The CCC's own regulations mandate that the agency demonstrate that a
27 project is consistent with CEQA. 14 CCR SS 13096(a); 13057(c). The CCC's regulatory
28 program also requires preparation of "responses to significant environmental points

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 raised . 14 CCR § 13057(c) (3).

2 29. All the Causes of Action and Counts herein (except Count 4 which applies to
3 State Parks) include CEQA requirements that apply to the CCC regardless of the certified
4 regulatory program exemption.

THE CCC ASSUMED LEAD AGENCY STATUS UNDER CEQA, BUT ITS 6 CEQA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS ARE NOT BINDING ON, AND MAY NOT

7 BE USED BY, STATE PARKS

8 30. Under CEQA, a lead agency is the agency that has principal responsibility for
9 carrying out or approving a project. Pub. Res. Code § 21067. It has the responsibility for
10 preparing the core environmental document under CEQA.

11 31. Public agencies other than the lead agency that have discretionary authority
12 over a project are "responsible agencies." 14 CCR § 15381.

13 32. Under CEQA, there may only be one lead agency for a project.
14 33. No agreement between the CCC and State Parks exists here assigning the lead
15 agency role for the project being challenged here.

16 34. When more than one public agency is involved in a project, the public agency
17 that shoulders primary responsibility for creating and implementing a project is the lead
18 agency, even if other agencies had a role in realizing it. Also, the agency that acts first is
19 typically deemed the lead agency.

20 35. Here, by substituting its own project 22 days before the public hearing, the
21 CCC assumed lead agency status under CEQA. State Parks never proposed the project,
22 and was blind-sided by the CCC's last minute proposal that differed greatly from the draft
23 PWP prepared by State Parks.

24 36. The CCC failed to consult with State Parks regarding the project or its
25 environmental impacts, prior to the public's review of the CCC staff report. Accordingly,
26 the conditions set forth in 14 CCR § 15253(a) were never established, and neither the staff
27 report, nor the CCC's finding under CEQA, are binding on State Parks, and the staff
28 report may not be used or relied upon by State Parks in order to comply with CEQA.

T CAUSES OF ACTION

2
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 3 (Petition for Writ of Administrative Mandate, C.C.P. § 1094.5, or, in the
4 Alternative, for Writ of Traditional Mandate, C.C.P. § 1085)

5 37. Petitioner Friends repeats, realleges and incorporates herein by reference,
the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-36, inclusive, as though fully set forth.
7 38. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5, Petitioner Friends brings this
8 action for an administrative writ on the basis that Respondent and Defendant CCC has
proceeded without, or in excess of, jurisdiction and authority; failed to provide a fair
10 hearing; and prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner
11 required by law, approving the amendment to CDP 4-82-300 without adequate findings,
12 and/or by adopting findings that are not supported by the evidence or substantial
13 evidence. Petitioner Friends also brings this action for an administrative writ on the
14 basis that Respondent and Defendant State Parks (with respect to Count 4) has
15 proceeded without, or in excess of, jurisdiction and authority; failed to provide a fair
16 hearing; and prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner
17 required by law, by committing to the amendment to CDP 4-82-300 prematurely
18 without complying with CEQA, and without adequate findings, and/or by adopting
19 findings that are not supported by the evidence or substantial evidence.
20 39. Alternatively, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1085, Petitioner
21 a Friends brings this action for a traditional writ on the basis that Respondent and
22 Defendant CCC's approval of the amendment to CDP 4-82-300 was arbitrary, capricious,
23 or entirely lacking in evidentiary support, contrary to established public policy, unlawful,
24 procedurally unfair, and on the basis that the CCC failed to follow the procedure and give
25 the notices the law requires. Also, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1085, Petitioner
26 Friends brings this action for a traditional writ on the basis that Respondent and
27 Defendant State Parks prematurely committed to the amendment to CDP 4-82-300
28 without complying with CEQA, and was arbitrary, capricious, or entirely lacking in
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

evidentiary support, contrary to established public policy, unlawful, procedurally unfair,

2 and on the basis that the CCC failed to follow the procedure and give the notices the law
3 requires.

4 40. Petitioner Friends and its members are beneficially interested in the
5 issuance of the subject writ mandating that the CCC, nullify, withdraw, set aside and/or

6 vacate the CCC March 18, 2021 approval of the amendment to CDP 4-82-300 for Oceano

7 Dunes SVRA, in whole or in part. Friends and its members are also beneficially

8 interested in having OHV recreation, beach driving and camping continue at Oceano
9 Dunes SVRA, and having impacts to recreational coastal resources caused by the CDP
10 amendment evaluated under CEQA both by the CCC and by State Parks. Petitioner
11 Friends and its members are beneficially interested in the issuance of the writ to require
12 compliance with CEQA to fully evaluate impacts of the CDP amendment on on-going and
13 future users of Oceano Dunes SVRA to use the facility for OHV recreation and other
14 recreational and environmental uses, including beach driving and beach camping, bird
15 watching, wildlife conservation and observation, photography and enjoyment of natural
16 coastal resources. Friends' purpose and Articles of Incorporation include preserving and
17 expanding recreational opportunities at Oceano Dunes. Friends' members live and work

18 near Oceano Dunes SVRA and use the SVRA for beneficial interests of enjoyment of the
19 recreational opportunities, natural resources and wildlife/plant species, aesthetic,
20 economic, recreational, and resource protection interests of Oceano Dunes. And as a
21 not-for-profit corporation specifically formed under the laws of the state of California to

22 preserve, continue and expand OHV recreation at Oceano Dunes, and whose

23 membership includes taxpayers of the State of California and payers of special OHV
24 registration fees and gas taxes paid into a special State of California budget fund
25 expressly established for the purpose of maintaining OHV and SVRA facilities within the

26 State, Petitioner Friends and its members have an interest in ensuring: (1) that laws,
27 regulations, and duties are executed and enforced uniformly, fairly, and as written; (2)
28 that neither the CCC nor State Parks abuses its respective discretion in applying CEQA at

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Oceano Dunes SVRA, or in failing to abide by CEQA; and (3) that neither the CCC nor
2 State Parks acts in a way that exceeds the law, that is arbitrary or capricious, that lacks

3 proper evidentiary support or substantial evidence, or that fails to abide by lawful,

4 proper procedures or proper notice. Friends and its members have a beneficial interest
5 in full compliance in the process for the evaluation and issuance of coastal development

6 permits and amendments, and the evaluation of environmental and recreational impacts

7 under CEQA, that include relevant specifics of Oceano Dunes SVRA, the resources

8 involved, physical changes to the SVRA and sensitive coastal resources, and the human
9 use of the land in these projects. Friends' beneficial interest, as described above and

10 including recreational interests and coastal access, has been and continues to be

11 threatened by the CCC's prejudicial abuse of discretion and violation of law in approving
12 an amendment to CDP 4-82-300 at Oceano Dunes SVRA in the ways described herein,
13 including banning all off-highway vehicle ("OHV"), prohibiting street-legal vehicles
14 "except within the beach area between the seaward extensions of West Grand and Pier

15 Avenues .. limiting beach camping and reducing the number of campsites by 50
16 percent, closing the Pier Avenue entrance to the park, mandating the year around 300-
17 acre western snowy plover and California least tern habitat exclosure, and banning
18 nighttime vehicle riding, each without appropriate CEQA study. Friends' beneficial

19 interest, as described above and including recreational interests and coastal access, has
20 been and continues to be threatened by State Parks' prejudicial abuse of discretion and
21 violation of law concerning the amendment of CDP 4-82-300 without CEQA study.
22 41. Alternatively, Petitioner Friends and its members are citizens seeking to
23 enforce public rights and the object of this mandamus action is to enforce public duty
24 of complying with CEQA, and the Coastal Act, as applicable, and as detailed herein.
25 42. Petitioner Friends has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of
26 this Petition and Complaint and otherwise exhausted all required and applicable
27 administrative remedies, or is otherwise excused under state law, including because the

28 CCC exceeded its authority, and because State Parks exceeded its authority. Friends

filed detailed written comments on State Parks' draft EIR for the proposed PWP, on the

2 CCC staff report for this challenged action, and on the related CCC staff report

3 addendum. Further, Pub. Res. Code 21177(a) authorizes an action against the CCC when
4 the grounds for a CEQA violation were presented to the CCC during the public comment

5 period by any person. Friends provided to the CCC a written Notice of Intent to file a

6 suit for violation of CEQA (or the CCC's certified regulatory program) on or about March
7 19, 2021. A copy is attached as Ex. A hereto. Friends provided to State Parks a written

8 Notice of Intent to file a suit for violation of CEQA on or about April 5, 2021. A copy is
9 attached as Ex. B hereto.

10 43. Petitioner Friends has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
11 ordinary course of law, other than the relief sought in this petition. Absent intervention
12 by this Court, the CCC will treat its March 18, 2021 approval and issuance of the
13 amendment to CDP 4-82-300 as lawful, and the public and other governmental entities,
14 including State Parks, will accept it as lawful. No additional administrative appeal or
15 other form of relief is available to prevent such an occurrence. Petitioner Friends has a
16 clear, present and beneficial right to performance of the public business in accordance
17 with CEQA, the implementing regulations and related state laws as set forth herein.

18 44. Administrative agencies such as the CCC and State Parks have only the
19 power conferred upon them by statute, and an act in excess of those powers is void.
20 45. An agency also must follow its own regulations.

21 46. The CCC has a duty to comply with CEQA. State Parks has duty to comply
22 with CEQA.

23 47. The CCC assumed lead agency status for this project, or alternatively, is a

24 responsible agency.

25 48. In its role as a lead or responsible agency, Defendant and Respondent CCC
26 violated CEQA in numerous ways here:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Count 1: the CCC's Last-Minute Rejection of the PWP, Without a

2 Hearing and Without Consulting State Parks, and Substitution of the Unilateral CDP Amendment Eliminating OHV Recreation and
3 Camping, Violates CEQA's Stable Project Description Mandate

4 49. Petitioner Friends repeats, realleges and incorporates herein by reference,

5 the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-48, inclusive, as though fully set forth.

6 50. Even where an agency relies on its certified regulatory program, the agency

7 must still comply with the broad policy goals and substantive standards of CEQA that are

8 not specifically exempted by the certified regulatory program exemption.

9 51. A "project" is an activity subject to CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a).

10 52. CEQA demands that a project description remain stable. An accurate

11 project description is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential
12 environmental effects of a proposed activity. The CEQA process must be open to the

13 public, premised upon full and meaningful disclosure of the scope, purposes, and effect

14 of a consistently described project. One of CEQA's fundamental broad policies is

15 meaningful public disclosure to the public and decision-makers. Providing stable,

16 accurate and meaningful disclosure of the extent and nature of a project, along with its

17 corresponding significant environmental impacts, is the whole point of CEQA. The CCC,

18 under a certified regulatory program, cannot base its approval on a document that

19 doesn't comport with this basic, substantive CEQA requirement.

20 53. This project started as a PWP. State Parks told the CCC nearly three years

21 ago it was preparing a PWP to replace CDP 4-82-300. State Parks worked with the CCC

22 to create that PWP, and at numerous public hearings the two agencies boasted

23 unctuously that they would cooperate with each other on that effort.

24 54. On May 9, 2018, State Parks issued a "Notice of Preparation of an

25 Environmental Impact Report Pismo State Beach and Oceano Dunes State Vehicular

26 Recreation Area Public Works Plan." That document included a detailed, multi-page

27 project description. That project description did not include any proposal to close the

28 SVRA to OHV recreation, or to end beach driving or camping, or to close the Pier Avenue

entrance.

2 55. Also in May 2018, State Parks held scoping meetings for the public. There

3 was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue

4 entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by

5 the CCC in March 2021.

6 56. In August 2018, State Parks released a scoping report for the PWP. There

7 was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue

8 other changes later pressed by entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the
9 the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comment at the scoping hearings.
10 57. In February 2019, State Parks held a PWP Project Concepts public meeting.

11 There was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue
12 entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by
13 the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.

14 58. In June 2019, State Parks issued a summary of comments on the PWP plan
15 and concepts. There was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the
16 Pier Avenue entrance, or shifting camping to the north. or any of the other changes later
17 pressed by the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.

18 59. That same summer of 2019, State Parks released FAQs regarding the PWP.

19 There was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue
20 entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by
21 the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.

22 60. At its July 11, 2019 CCC public hearing on Oceano Dunes SVRA, the CCC
23 never mentioned closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue entrance,

24 or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by the CCC in
25 March 2021. Parks also announced that it was "working in partnership with our

26 stakeholders and the [Coastal] Commission throughout this process."
27 61. State Parks held stakeholder meetings. Parks announced that CCC hearings
28 on Oceano Dunes "allows us to continue to work diligently on the PWP - for completion

by Summer 2020." There was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation,

2 closing the Pier Avenue entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other

3 changes later pressed by the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.
4 62. In December 2019, State Parks held additional public meetings on the PWP.

5 There was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue

6 entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by

7 the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.

8 63. In the Spring of 2020, State Parks released FAQs regarding the PWP. There
9 was no mention of closing the SVRA to OHV recreation, closing the Pier Avenue

10 entrance, or shifting camping to the north, or any of the other changes later pressed by

11 the CCC in March 2021. The CCC provided no comments.

12 64. In May 2020, Parks released a summary of public comments. The release
13 did not reflect any comments by the CCC.

14 65. On December 30, 2020, Parks released the Pismo State Beach and Oceano

15 Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area Draft Public Works Plan and Draft

16 Environmental Impact Report. In the alternatives section, Parks evaluated the No OHV

17 Use Alternative, where use OHV would be phased out and eliminated from the Park over
18 five years as suggested by California Coastal Commission staff. This was the first time

19 that the public was informed of the CCC's request to eliminate OHV. But Parks rejected
20 this alternative because ' the No OHV Alternative conflicts with State Park's

21 responsibility of managing state parkland in a manner consistent with governing laws
22 (PRC § 5008, § 5090.2 (b), § 5090.35(a)) while promoting accessible recreation. In
23 Oceano Dunes SVRA, this Alternative would not meet the statutory mandate of
24 managing the unit under its current classification (PRC § 5090.14.1). This Alternative

25 would ultimately require a reclassification of the SVRA to a State Recreation Area, State

26 Beach, or State Park. As outlined in greater detail below, State Parks does not have the
27 authority to phase out OHV activity in the SVRA on its own, the OHMVR Commission
28 and the State Parks and Recreation Commission, or the Legislature would need to

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a approve a change in the Park's use and classification (S 5019.50 and 5090.24)."

2 66. State Parks and the public understood that the CCC would be setting

3 hearing in March 2021 to debate and consider the PWP. But, shockingly, and without

4 telling State Parks, the CCC, at the close of business on February 17, 2021, issued a

5 critique of the PWP. but did a not set a formal hearing on the PWP for March 2021, or

6 ever. Instead, the CCC announced its intention to unilaterally amend the existing 1982

7 CDP by eliminating all OHV recreation, beach driving and camping at the SVRA. This is

8 a classic bait and switch that fundamentally changed the "project" under CEQA and
9 mislead the public, community leaders and the permit holder, State Parks.

10 67. In fact, as late as February 23, 2021, State Parks announced on its website
11 that it would extend public comment on the PWP and associated EIR "if a California

12 Coastal Commission hearing for these draft documents is scheduled after March 2, 2021

13 State Parks and the public had been led to believe that the CCC would be holding a
14 hearing on the PWP on March 18, 2021. But the CCC staff then said there would be no

15 hearing. Instead, the hearing would be on amending the existing CDP. The CCC's last
16 minute shift was confusing not only to the public and Friends, but also to State Parks,
17 the agency that manages the park and holds the permit.

18 68. For more than 33 months, the public was led to believe that the PWP would

19 allow OHV recreation, beach driving and camping (and the entrances that have existed
20 for 40 plus years would remain in place), and in the last 22 days in a 3-year process, the
21 CCC completely changed the project without any formal hearing on the PWP, and
22 substituted its preferred project of total elimination of OHV recreation, beach driving

23 and camping, which is a substantial change in the scope of the project. That violates
24 CEQA's stable project description mandate.
25 69. The CCC's failure to comply with this CEQA policy and substantive standard
26 is contrary to law, exceeds its authority, is arbitrary and capricious, constitutes a
27 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence or data, or in

28 some cases any evidence or data.

Count 2: the CCC Violated CEQA by Failing to Analyze the Impact of

2 the OHV Recreation Cessation, and Related Project Elements, on Coastal Recreational Resources
3

4 70. Petitioner Friends repeats, realleges and incorporates herein by reference,
5 the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-69, inclusive, as though fully set forth.

6 71. Even where an agency relies on its certified regulatory program, the agency
7 must still comply with the broad policy goals and substantive standards of CEQA that are
8 not specifically exempted by the certified regulatory program exemption.
9 72. A "project" is an activity subject to CEQA. Pub. Res. Code § 21080(a).
10 73. CEQA applies to discretionary projects proposed to be approved or carried
11 out by public agencies, and that will, or may, cause a direct or reasonably foreseeable
12 indirect physical environmental change. A public agency action that may not have an
13 immediate effect on the environment but that has the potential to result in a reasonably
14 foreseeable physical change in the environment indirectly is a project under CEQA. Pub.
15 Res. Code § 21065.

16 74. Here, the CCC's purported approval of the amendment to the CDP

17 eliminating OHV recreation, beach driving and camping that has existed for 40 years
18 was a project and a discretionary action eliminating uses, drastically changing existing

19 operational activities at Oceano Dunes SVRA, that will, or may, cause a direct or
20 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical environmental change at the SVRA.
21 Specifically, the CCC purported to ban all OHV, prohibit street-legal vehicles "except
22 within the beach area between the seaward extensions of West Grand and Pier Avenues .

23 (which is not in the SVRA), limit beach camping and reduce the number of
24 campsites by 50 percent (and not allow any camping in the SVRA), close the Pier Avenue
25 entrance to the park (leaving only 1 entrance to a 3,600 acre park), mandate a year
26 around 300-acre western snowy plover and California least tern habitat exclosure, and

27 ban nighttime vehicle driving in the park.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 75. Identifying a project's significant environmental effects is a core purpose of

2 CEQA.

3 76. When there is evidence that an impact may be significant, the
4 environmental analysis may not adopt a contrary finding without supporting evidence.
5 77. The environmental analysis must analyze the project's direct impacts, the
impacts of the entire project, indirect or secondary impacts, and reasonably foreseeable

7 impacts. Conclusory discussions are not sufficient to comply with CEQA.

8 78. CEQA defines "environment" to mean "the physical conditions which exist
within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water,

10 minerals, flora, fauna, noise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance." Pub. Res. Code
11 § 21060.5.

12 79. CEQA requires an analysis of project's physical impacts on "land" within

13 an area, including uses of that land. That is especially true with respect to coastal

14 recreational resources, which is deemed a sensitive land use in the coastal zone. Courts

15 characterize these recreation areas as protected "resources" under both CEQA and the

16 Coastal Act.

17 80. Here, the CCC violated CEQA by failing to adequately analyze impacts to
18 coastal recreational land uses, opportunities and activities that have been authorized,

19 provided and encouraged at Oceano Dunes SVRA for 40 years or more.
20 81. In its pre-hearing comments on or about March 17, 2021, State Parks noted
21 that the CCC staff report failed to "provide analysis of the impacts of the proposed

22 changes nor any mitigation measures to offset the impacts of the proposed major
23 operational and public access changes . including the phasing out OHV recreation in
24 the Park. Section 13096 of the Coastal Commission's administrative regulations require
25 Coastal Commission approval of coastal development permit applications and coastal

26 development permit amendments, supported by a finding showing the application, as
27 modified by any conditions of approval, to be consistent with any applicable California

28 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) provisions. The recommendations in the .. . [staff

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

report] have been submitted by the Coastal Commission staff as amendments to the

2 CDP. Therefore, the . . . [staff report] should have also provided a CEQA evaluation to

3 analyze the impacts, propose mitigation to reduce significant impacts, and additional

4 evidence to support findings that the changes would not adversely affect any physical

5 resources. These do not appear to have been provided." State Parks further alerted the

6 CCC that eliminating OHV recreation and consolidating camping into a smaller part

7 of the beach, as proposed . . ., could result in potentially significant impacts to

8 recreational opportunities, including the removal of an affordable recreation option and
9 numerous lower-cost coastal accommodation options. The [staff] . Report also does

10 not analyze potential effects on any other resource topics." Friends of Oceano Dunes

11 also advised the CCC that it failed to analyze impacts coastal recreation resources, and

12 other impacts, under CEQA.

13 82. While the CCC's action purports to eliminate OHV recreation, beach driving
14 and camping at Oceano Dunes SVRA, the CCC provided no, or at most a conclusory,
15 evaluation of the impact that action would have on coastal recreational resources. The

16 CCC's primary discussion was that OHV recreation could occur elsewhere in the state,

17 and mostly at federal facilities. The CCC's analysis failed to treat OHV recreation, beach

18 driving and camping as a coastal recreation resource at all, instead insisting that those

19 recreational opportunities only had negative impacts on coastal resources. That was

20 clear and prejudicial error.

21 83. The only other discussion by the CCC insisted that certain areas may be a
22 potential location for the CCC to consider recreation types that might be more intensive

23 than general beach use. "This .. . beach area extends from near Arroyo Grande Creek to
24 West Grand Avenue." But these areas are not even located within the SVRA. And the

25 CCC never committed to allowing OHV recreation there.

26 84. The CCC's statements were conclusory and cursory and failed to analyze
27 under CEQA the significant environmental impacts of eliminating 1,500 acres of OHV
28 coastal recreation area, beach driving and camping that has served the community and

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the state for 40 plus years. That violates CEQA.

2 85. The CCC also failed to study under CEQA the environmental impacts of its

3 CDP amendment on the host of other CDP amendment conditions set forth above.

4 Numerous members of the Coastal Commission noted at the public hearing that the CCC

5 staff had failed to conduct any study of the impacts (including traffic impacts) that will

6 result from the closure of Pier Avenue, reducing the access to the 3,600 acre park to one
7 entrance and creating public safety concerns. Similarly, the CCC failed to evaluate the

8 impact of its actions on lower cost visitor and recreational facilities.

9 86. The CCC's failure to comply with this CEQA policy and substantive standard
10 is contrary to law, exceeds its authority, is arbitrary and capricious, constitutes a
11 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence or data, or in
12 some cases any evidence or data.

13

14 Count 3: the CCC Violated CEQA by Failing to Include in its Staff Report Feasible Mitigation Measures That Would Minimize the
15 Impact of OHV Cessation on Coastal Recreational Resources

16 87. Petitioner Friends repeats, realleges and incorporates herein by reference,
17 the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-86, inclusive, as though fully set forth.
18 88. Even where an agency relies on its certified regulatory program, the agency

19 must still comply with the broad policy goals and substantive standards of CEQA that are
20 not specifically exempted by the certified regulatory program exemption.
21 89. As provided in Public Resources Code §S 21002 and 21081, CEQA contains
22 a policy goal and substantive mandate that public agencies refrain from approving
23 projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures. A decision-
24 making agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant
25 environmental effects have been identified unless it makes certain findings about
26 alternatives and mitigation measures. The requirement ensures there is evidence of the
27 public agency's actual consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures, and reveals
28 to citizens the analytical process by which the public agency arrived at its decision.

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Under CEQA, the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that,

2 notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the

3 proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation

4 measures. The record here indicates the CCC failed to meet this burden, and that failure

5 precluded informed decision-making and informed public participation. Because the

6 CCC failed to proceed as required by CEQA, it has subverted the purposes of CEQA by
7 omitting material necessary and mitigation measures necessary to informed decision-

8 making and informed public participation, and, as such is prejudicial error.
9 90. The purpose of environmental review is to identify the significant effects on
10 the environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the
11 manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided. Pub. Res. Code S
12 21002.1(a). CEQA defines "significant effect on the environment" as "a substantial, or

13 potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." Id., §S 21068, 21000, subd.

14 (d). The term "environment" refers to "the physical conditions which exist within the
15 area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals,
16 flora, fauna...." Id., § 21060.5. An environmental review must present facts and analysis,
17 not simply the bare conclusions or opinions of the agency. Thus, the environmental
18 review must set forth specific data, as needed to meaningfully assess whether the

19 proposed activities would result in significant impacts, or be adequately mitigated. It
20 also must explain why it is rejecting data, analysis or findings of a sister state agency.
21 91. The CCC's regulatory program for considering and granting coastal
22 development permits requires compliance with CEQA, including preparing "responses to

23 significant environmental points raised during the evaluation of the proposed

24 development as required by the California Environmental Quality Act.' 14 CCR § 13057
25 (c) (3). To the extent that the CCC contends that the certified regulatory program does
26 not require or mandate compliance with CEQA (other than expressly exempted by
27 CEQA), it is invalid and inconsistent with CEQA and state law. When the agency
28 approves a project, it must adopt any feasible mitigation measures that would mitigate

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

or avoid the project's significant environmental impacts. CEQA requires that the CCC

2 include in its staff report mitigation measures to minimize the project's significant

3 environmental effects.

4 92. Courts do not defer to an agency's determination that mitigation measures

5 will work when their efficacy is not apparent, and there is no evidence in the record

6 showing they will be effective. An agency may not delay a mitigation measure beyond

7 the start of the project activity that causes the impact. Deferred mitigation may be

8 allowed only when specific performance criteria are identified in the environmental

9 review document, and the agency commits to mitigation that satisfies those criteria and
10 standards.

11 93. The CCC proposed no mitigation measures to address the total elimination

12 of OHV recreation at Oceano Dunes SVRA. Feasible mitigation measures exist.

13 94. To the extent that there are any conflicts between Coastal Act resource
14 policies in proposing or implementing mitigation measures to address impacts to coastal
15 recreation resources, Pub. Res. Code § 30007.5 mandates that the CCC resolve such

16 conflicts through balancing the competing policies. Specifically, that Coastal Act policy
17 states: "The Legislature.. finds and recognizes that conflicts may occur between one or

18 more policies of the . [Coastal Act]. The Legislature therefore declares that in

19 carrying out the provisions of this division such conflicts be resolved in a manner which
20 on balance is the most protective of significant coastal resources. In this context, the
21 Legislature declares that broader policies which, for example, serve to concentrate

22 development in close proximity to urban and employment centers may be more
23 protective, overall, than specific wildlife habitat and other similar resource policies."
24 The CCC refused to employ Pub. Res. Code § 30007.5 here, which violated the Coastal

25 Act. OHV recreation, beach driving and camping are "significant coastal resources" and
26 the Coastal Act mandates that conflicts shall be resolved in favor of those uses. Further,

27 OHV recreation, beach driving and camping are "uses dependent" on environmentally

28 at Oceano Dunes SVRA, and sensitive habitat areas, and thus allowed in any such areas

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

both State Parks and the CCC have imposed and implemented control measures on those

2 uses at Oceano Dunes for 40 years that ensured that there was no significant disruption

3 of habitat values.

4 95. Alternatively, the SLO County LCP authorizes OHV recreation, beach

5 driving and camping in areas within Oceano Dunes SVRA in manner that would have

6 allowed the CCC to mitigate impacts to OHV recreation, beach driving and camping,

7 without totally eliminating those uses from the SVRA.

8 96. To the extent that the CCC sought to mitigate impacts to beach driving and

9 camping by allowing such uses to a limited extent in the adjacent state beach/park, State
10 Parks, as the agency charged with operating and administering such parks stated on the

11 record that area proposed by the CCC for limited beach driving and camping would
12 simply not fit within the area selected by the CCC, and the proposal made by the CCC
13 were not in good faith, or demonstrated the agency's lack of understanding of park
14 planning and operations.

15 97. The CCC's failure to comply with this CEQA policy and substantive standard
16 is contrary to law, exceeds its authority, is arbitrary and capricious, constitutes a
17 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is not supported by substantial evidence or data, or in

18 some cases any evidence or data.

19

20 Count 4: the CCC's Force-Feeding of the Project Has Caused State Parks to Violate CEQA By Mandating Parks' Compliance with the
21 CDP Amendment Without Any CEQA Review

22 98. Petitioner Friends repeats, realleges and incorporates herein by reference,

23 the allegations contained in paragraphs 1-97, inclusive, as though fully set forth.

24 99. CEQA review is required before an agency approves a project.

25 100. The term "approval" in the CEQA Guidelines is defined broadly so that an

26 agency's commitment to a "definite course of action" on a project is treated as an

27 "approval" under CEQA. 14 CCR § 15004(b) (4).

28 101. Pub. Res. Code § 5002.2(c) specifies that "any development [within an

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

SVRA] is subject to the requirements of [CEQA]."

2 102. On March 18, 2021, the CCC approved an amendment to the CDP for

3 Oceano Dunes SVRA, purporting to ban all OHV recreation, prohibit street-legal vehicles

4 "except within the beach area between the seaward extensions of West Grand and Pier

5 Avenues . (which is not in the SVRA), limit beach camping and reduce the number

6 of campsites by 50 percent (and not allow any camping in the SVRA), close the Pier

7 Avenue entrance to the park (leaving only 1 entrance to a 3,600 acre park), mandate a

8 year around 300-acre western snowy plover and California least tern habitat exclosure,

9 and ban nighttime vehicle driving in the park. These items were part of the special

10 conditions for the CDP, and purport to be binding on State Parks, as the permit holder.
11 The special conditions purported to impose on State Parks (and thus require Parks to
12 commit to) a "definite course of action" implementing the project.

13 103. The CCC's CDP special conditions as a practical matter purport to limit
14 State Parks' ability to reject the project and/or constrain Parks' consideration of
15 alternatives and mitigation measures that would contradict the ban on OHV recreation,

16 beach driving and camping at the SVRA. The CCC purports to eliminate State Parks'
17 ability to reject the special conditions. This effectively makes it impossible for State

18 Parks to comply with CEQA because it pre-determines the outcome before State Parks'

19 has prepared a CEQA analysis. Thus, State Parks, too, is in violation of CEQA.

20 104. Also, and separately, State Parks may not take any action that gives
21 "impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or
22 mitigation measures. 14 CCR § 15004(b). Parks has violated this requirement here to the

23 extent it has accepted the special conditions imposed by the CCC.
24 105. The CCC's failure to comply with CEQA is contrary to law, exceeds its
25 authority, is arbitrary and capricious, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is
26 not supported by substantial evidence or data, or in some cases any evidence or data.

8 3. That the Court issue a writ of mandate finding that State Parks has
9 violated CEQA, and enjoining, preliminarily and/or permanently, State
10 Parks from taking any action to implement the special conditions

11 adopted on March 18, 2021. Petitioner Friends is entitled to the relief

12 demanded, and the implementation of the special conditions would
13 produce waste, or great or irreparable injury, to Friends and the public.
14 Pecuniary compensation is not sought on this case and would not afford
15 adequate relief. Restraint also is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of
16 judicial proceedings.

17 4. That the Court order suspend, in part or in whole, all implementation of
18 the CDP special conditions that could result in an adverse change to the
19 physical environment, as authorized by Pub. Res. Code S 21168.9.
20 5. That Petitioner be awarded attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to CCP §
21 1021.5 and/or state law. On or about March 19, 2021, counsel for

22 Petitioner Friends sent by email to John (Jack) Ainsworth, the Executive

23 Director of the CCC, a settlement letter constituting a good faith effort to
24 resolve Friends' objections with the CCC CDP amendment. The CCC
25 rejected that settlement overture. On April 1, 2021, counsel for
26 Petitioner Friends sent by email to John (Jack) Ainsworth, the Executive
27 Director of the CCC, a settlement letter constituting a good faith effort to
28 resolve Friends' CEQA objections only. Friends and the CCC engaged in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

additional letter exchanges on settlement on April 6, and 7, 2021. The
2 parties were unable to make substantial progress on settlement during
3 that time. On April 5, 2021, counsel for Petitioner Friends sent by email
4 to the Director of State Parks a settlement letter constituting a good faith
5 effort to resolve Friends' objections to State Parks' CEQA violation.
6 Friends and State Parks exchanged additional settlement letters, but

7 were unable to reach settlement. Because of looming statutes of
8 limitations, Friends is legally mandated to file this CEQA action without
9 further delay. The fundamental disagreements could not be resolved
10 within the statute of limitations for filing and service. Petitioner Friends
11 has made a reasonable, good faith effort to settle the dispute short of

12 litigation, and any further attempts to resolve the dispute prior to the
13 expiration of the statutes of limitation would have been, and would be,

14 futile, or jeopardized missing the statute of limitations to great prejudice
15 to Friends and its members.

16 6. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper and just.

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code § 21167.5, FRIENDS OF OCEANO DUNES, INC., a California not-for-profit corporation, intends to file a petition for writ pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the California Department of Parks and Recreation, challenging the department's commitment to, compliance and implementation of, the special conditions to CDP 4-82-300 for Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area, as amended by the California Coastal Commission on March 18, 2021, without first
complying with CEQA. State Parks' commitment constitutes a "definite course of action," that is an approval of the project without compliance with CEQA.
The petition will seek a court order and/or writ declaring said action(s) invalid, and enjoining State Parks, in whole or in part, from complying with, or implementing in any way, the new special conditions of CDP 4-82-300 due to State Parks' failure and/or refusal to comply with CEQA prior to project approval.
