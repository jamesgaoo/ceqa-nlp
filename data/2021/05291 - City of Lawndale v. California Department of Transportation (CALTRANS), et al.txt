PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT
Petitioner City of Lawndale ("City" or "Petitioner") files this Petition for Writ of
3 Mandate pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA), Public Resources Code 2 1.

§§ 21000 et seq., against (i) Respondents Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation
Authority (*MTA"), (ii) the California Department of Transportation ("State Caltrans"),
6 (iii) Caltrans District 7 Los Angeles ("Caltrans District 7") and (iv) the South Bay Cities Council of
7 Governments ("SBCOG*) to challenge their non-compliance with CEQA for the project known as

8 "EA 35310, I-405 Auxiliary Lanes Project" ("Project"). State Caltrans and Caltrans District 7 are

9 occasionally referred to herein collectively as "Caltrans."

10 2. The Project proposes to undertake significant freeway widening with Caltrans
11 District 7, as lead agency, acting in cooperation with State Caltrans, MTA and the SBCOG. The
on both northbound and southbound MVT :v 5 2 THAONAN SHHIHSITY 12 Project proposes the construction of a series of auxiliary lanes
13 thoroughfares on the Interstate 405 ("I-405") from Artesia Boulevard to the 1-405/Interstate 105
14 ("I-105") interchange. The Project runs through the municipal boundaries of the named Real Parties
15 in Interest, the cities of Torrance, Hawthorne, Redondo Beach, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, and
E 16 Petitioner. The Project encompasses the addition of multiple new lanes on the I-405, identifies at

18 utility relocations, hazardous materials mitigation, off-ramp work, new retaining walls, vast 17 least six (6) structures to be built consisting of bridge widening and other bridge improvements, and

19 excavation and other Project improvements, all estimated to cost between $111,000,000.00 and

3. Given the significant and irreversible environmental impacts associated with this 20 $120,000,000.00.

21

22 Project, preparation of a full environmental impact report ("EIR") or other heightened
23 environmental review under CEQA would be expected, and indeed legally required. Nonetheless,
24 Respondents chose to treat the Project as "categorically exempt" from any environmental review.
25 This was a clear misapplication of the law. Indeed, Respondents, themselves, proffered
26| documentation that directly concedes, if not outright admits, the Project's potential to result in
27 significant environmental impacts.

-2- 01001.0041/667520.3 LNL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

4. This Petition seeks a writ of mandate voiding Respondents' decision(s) that the
2 Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to a "categorical exemption" from environmental review
for "Class 1(c): Existing Facilities." (Pub. Res. Code § 21084; 14 Code Cal. Res. 15300 et seq.;
14 Cal. Code Regs. 15301(c).)' Respondents' reliance upon 1 such Class 1 exemption is entirely 3

4

5 unfounded in the law. Most simply, the categorical exemption relied upon by Respondents applies
strictly to projects for existing highways "that do not create additional automobile lanes." (14 Cal.
7 Code Regs. § 15301(c).) Respondents' unlawful and unsupported reliance on the Class 1 exemption 6

8 in approving the Project deprived their own decisionmakers, Petitioner, Real Parties in Interest and
9 the public of information CEQA requires to be circulated, thereby precluding informed public
10 participation. Respondents thus prejudicially abused their discretion.

5. Further, CEQA forbids "piecemealing" projects. (E. Sacramento Partnerships for a
SAHIHSTTV MVlIv : SA 12 Livable City v. City of Sacramento, (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281, 293.) Pursuant to CEQA, the whole 11

of an entire project must be analyzed-projects cannot be broken into "sub-projects" for analysis in
14 order to understate the cumulative impacts of the whole. Rather, "the need for regional 13

15 environmental consideration [must be made] at the earliest stage of a planned development before
(Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Commission of Ventura 3 16 it gains irreversible momentum."
17 County (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 284, fn. 28.) By Respondents' own admission, the subject Project is
18  related to a host of other I-405 projects in the vicinity for auxiliary lanes, road widening, ramp work,

20 subject Project in order to accurately capture the cumulative environmental impacts threatened by 19 and major seismic retrofits. All of these projects should have been collectively evaluated with the

21 Respondents' work as a whole. Respondents' attempt to carve-out this one Project from other
22 related projects-and then unlawfully declare this Project categorically exempt from CEQA- is
23 nothing less than a blatant scheme to avoid meaningfully analyzing all potential, cumulative
24  environmental impacts as required by CEQA.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents used
2 deceptive tactics to deprive Petitioner, the Real Parties in Interest and the general public of their

4 the Project and its potential environmental impacts pursuant to CEQA. Petitioner's staff made 3 opportunity to be meaningfully involved in, receive timely information about, or comment upon,

5 repeated attempts to secure updates from Respondent MTA about the Project and the environmental
review process under which it was being evaluated. Respondent MTA did not provide Petitioner
7 with the requested environmental documents until over a month after Respondents, either 6

8 individually or jointly, had filed the "categorical exemption" from CEQA review. This deprived
9 Petitioner, the Real Parties in Interest and the general public from any opportunity to hear, comment
upon, or even consider, the environmental impacts of the Project and its relation to related I-405
11 projects. The clear implication of Respondents' actions is to "sneak the Project through" during the 10

3 HHIHSHTY MAV5 IY S MIHAINA 12 COVID pandemic and "run out the clock" on the applicable limitations period by delaying responses

14 7. This Petition thus seeks (a) a writ of mandate directing Respondents to suspend all 13 to inquiries on the Project.

15 activities with respect to the Project and stay all actions to implement the Project until full
16 compliance with CEQA is achieved, and (b) an award of attorneys' fees and costs.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code

2 of Civil Procedure§§ 526, 527, and 1085 (or, in the alternative, § 1094.5), and Public Resources
3 Code § 21168 (or, in the alternative, § 21168.5) and § 21168.9.

4 22. Venue for this action is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

6 Project is located and would be carried out.

7 23. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code $ 21167.5
8 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action by mail to Respondents

9 on September 4, 2020.

10 24. Petitioner is complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6
11 by concurrently filing request for preparation of the record of administrative proceedings related
D THTHSHTE mVi I VYNDERUP 12 | to this action.

13 25. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.7
14 and Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by furnishing the Attorney General of the State of California

17 and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible as required
18| by law.

19 27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

20 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

21 approval of the Project, and enjoins any activities in furtherance of the Project, until Respondents
22 comply with CEQA. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' actions will remain in effect in
23 violation of state law, and Petitioner, Real Parties in Interest, the environment, and residents in the
24 communities near the Project site will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy
25 could adequately compensate for that harm.

26 APPLICABLE LAW

27 28. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code
28 §§ 21000 et seq., embodies California's policy that the long-term protection of the environment is

01001.0041/667520.3 LNL -1-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to be the guiding criterion in decisions regarding public projects that affect the environment. 'The
2 overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies regulating activities that may affect the
quality of the environment give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage by
4 mitigating impacts to a level of insignificance to the extent feasible and, where such mitigation is 3

5 not feasible, to justify proceeding with the project. (See, e.g., Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey

6 Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 687; Citizens Against Airport

7 Pollution v. City of San Jose (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 788, 795.)

29. CEQA is designed to ensure that long-term protection of the environment is the
9 guiding criterion in discretionary public decisions. CEQA accomplishes its purposes by requiring 8

10 public agencies to determine, and generally to disclose to the public through an Environmental
11 Impact Report ("EIR") detailed information about the effect that a proposed project is likely to have
3 SEATHSITY M51 LY ITIHAONAN 12 on the environment, to list ways in which the effects of the project might be avoided or minimized,
13 and to develop and compare alternatives to the project. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency
14 adopt feasible and enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's
15 significant environmental impacts. Separately, identifying and analyzing mitigation measures

E 16 ensures that environmental impacts are reduced to the greatest extent possible as a result of informed
17 decision-making. (Lotus v. Dept. of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 645, 658.)

18 30. Where a project will not have a significant impact on the environment an
19 environmental statement that is less intense than an EIR may be appropriate. A "negative
20 declaration" is a written statement by the lead agency briefly describing the reasons why a proposed
21 project, that is not exempt from CEQA, will not have significant effect on the environment and,
22 therefore, does not require the preparation of an EIR. (14 Cal. Code of Regs. § 15371.) A "mitigated
23 negative declaration" is a form of negative declaration prepared for projects presenting potentially
24 significant effects on the environment, but (i) revisions in the project plans or proposals would avoid
25 the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment
26 would occur. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15369.5 and 15071.) Even these mechanisms are subject to
27 an initial environmental study and released for public review.
28 1///

-&- 01001.0041/667520.3 LNL
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

31. Finally, CEQA does categorically exempt several narrow categories of projects from
2 environmental review. Categorical exemptions allow agencies to forgo CEQA review for projects

3 that the state, exercising authority delegated by the Legislature, has determined are not the kinds of
4 projects that have significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Res. Code § 21084.) Categorical
exemptions must be construed narrowly to afford the fullest possible environmental protection.

6 (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th
677, 697.) If an agency determines in its preliminary assessment of a project that it does not fit

8 within a categorical exemption, it must then identify and consider appropriate mitigation measures

9 during the subsequent environmental review process. (Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San
10 Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 1165, 1199-1200.) However, an agency cannot

Z MHIONAA 11 determine that a project is categorically exempt from CEQA by imposing mitigation measures.
CHIHSTT 12 (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal. App. 4th 1098, 1102.)

13 32. With respect to the Project subject to this Petition, Respondents relied upon the
14 CEQA categorical exemption for "Class 1(c): Existing Facilities" under Public Resources Code
15 § 21084 and 14 Cal. Code Regs. 15301(c). In relevant part, Regulation 15301 reads as follows:
E 16 1 Class 1 consists of the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, 17 facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving
18 negligible or no expansion of existing or former use. The types of "existing facilities" itemized below are not intended to be all-inclusive of the types of
19 projects which might fall within Class 1. The key consideration is whether the project involves negligible or no expansion of use. 20 Examples include but are not limited to:
(c) Existing highways and streets, sidewalks, gutters, bicycle and 21 pedestrian trails, and similar facilities (this includes road grading for the
22 purpose of public safety, and other alterations such as the addition of bicycle facilities, including but not limited to bicycle parking, bicycle-share
23 facilities and bicycle lanes, transit improvements such as bus lanes, pedestrian crossings, street trees, and other similar alterations that do not
24 create additional automobile lanes). (emphasis added)

FACTS

2 33. The I-405 is a major north-south Interstate Highway in Southern California, running
3 along the southern and western parts of the Greater Los Angeles urban area from Irvine in the south
4 to near San Fernando in the north. The municipal boundaries of Petitioner City are bisected by the
5 I-405, with such thoroughfare running nearly directly through the midst of City bounds.

6 34. Given the significant presence and impacts of the I-405 as it runs through City
7 boundaries, the City has long and actively participated in discussions with Respondents relating to
8 any developments proposed for the I-405. City staffhas monitored all proposed I-405 improvements
9 for potential environmental concerns.

10 35. The Project that is the subject of this Petition has been under Respondents'
11  consideration for years. At the outset, Petitioner promptly engaged Respondents, particularly
S THIHSIT YNDERLLP 12 Respondent MTA, in discussions about the Project. To this end, Petitioner's Community
13 Dcvelopment Dircctor continuously requested that MTA keep the City informed of the status and
14 progress of any technical studies or environmental documents to be issued for the Project.

15 36. On or about December 5, 2019, Petitioner's staff asked MTA for a project description
16 and all technical and environmental studies associated with the Project in order to meaningfully

17 comment upon the proposed Project under CEQA. MTA particularly assured City staff that
18 environmental documents pursuant to CEQA would be forthcoming.

19 37. As of July 16, 2020, City staff still had not received the requested Project
20 environmental studies from MTA or any other Respondent.

21 38. On July 17, 2020, MTA submitted to Petitioner City an "EA 35310 I-405 Auxiliary
22 Lanes Final Project Report" dated June 17, 2020 (the "Report"), which Report included some traffic
23 analyses, some noise studies, and some alternative project considerations, among other general
24 matters. Nonetheless, the Report woefully lacks the level of environmental analysis CEQA requires
25 of an EIR, and did not even satisfy the less intense analytical and procedural prerequisites applicable

26 to a negative declaration. And, the Report was issued after a notice of categorical exemption
27 (described further below in Paragraph 40) was issued.
28 ///

01001.0041/667520.3 LNL -10-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

39. After Respondents' submission of the Report to Petitioner, Respondent MTA
continued to assure Petitioner City (repeatedly) that the City would have time to submit
environmental commentary on the Project. Such assurances include an email from MTA to City to
4 that effect dated July 28, 2020.

40. Notwithstanding the assurances from MTA, on approximately July 29, 2020, MTA

6 informed Petitioner that Respondents had already filed a CEQA "notice of exemption" (the "NOE")

7 with the State Clearinghouse ("SCH"), California's agency that coordinates the state-level review

8 of environmental documents that are prepared pursuant to CEQA. A true and correct copy of the
9 NOE, as posted by SCH, is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

10 41. Respondents' NOE, naming Caltrans as the lead agency, was dated June 2, 2020 and
11 posted by SCH on June 10, 2020. Hence, Respondents had issued a CEQA environmental
2 SAdIHSHTY YNDERLP 12 determination on the Project approximately 45 days before they provided any environmental

13 documentation to Petitioner. In short, Respondents prepared and provided their environmental
14 documentation to Petitioner after they had already finalized a CEQA determination. And, by the
15 time Petitioner was finally provided a copy of the Project Report, it was already too late for
16 Petitioner, Real Parties, or members of the public to provide effective Project comments.

17 42. Respondents' withholding and delay in providing environmental information and the
18 Report until after issuance of the NOE was a deliberate attempt to deprive Petitioner, Real Parties
19 in Interest, and the public from meaningful consideration of, and comment upon, Project
20 environmental impacts. Indeed, the Report delivered to Petitioner was signed and stamped on the
21 date of June 17, 2020-more than two weeks after issuance of the NOE. On that basis, Petitioner

22 alleges that the Report and environmental review for the Project was prepared after Respondents
23| determined to invoke a "categorical exemption" for the Project.

24 43. Moreover, the Project Report and the NOE both demonstrate how legally misplaced
25 a CEQA "categorical exemption" is for this Project. According to the Report, the proposed Project
26 includes massive improvements to the I-405 from Artesia Boulevard to El Segundo Boulevard.
27 Proposed improvements include the addition of new auxiliary lanes within the Caltrans right of way
28 ("ROW") and a lane extension along southbound I-405 between the I-105 connector and the off-

ramp to eastbound Rosecrans Avenue. The Project further identifies at least six (6) structures to be
2 built consisting of bridge widening and other bridge improvements and utility relocations, hazardous
materials mitigation, off-ramp work, new retaining walls, vast excavation and other Project
improvements all estimated to cost between $111,000,000.00 and $120,000,000.00.

44. Further Project details are outlined in the NOE attached hereto at Exhibit A.

45. Notwithstanding Respondents' determination to issue a categorical exemption for
7 the Project, their after-the-fact Report details significant conditions (which can only be characterized
8 as "mitigation measures") to address the Project's adverse environmental impacts. For example,

9 the Report identifies "Hazardous Materials" and abandoned oil wells in the Project vicinity and
10 states mitigation measures for such impacts:

11 66

3 ALESHIRE YNDERLP MV7 Iv 4 12 Hazardous liquid (petroleum) and (natural) gas transmission pipelines run through the proposed project area. It is unknown at this time if the

13 proposed project would impact these pipelines and/or if relocation of any of these pipelines would be required as part of the proposed project. The

14 presence of the petroleum pipelines is considered to represent a REC ["Recognized Environmental Condition"] to the proposed project. If the

15 pipelines are to be exposed and/or relocated, impacts to the subsurface may

16 be encountered. Impacts to the subsurface discovered from these pipelines and any repairs to the pipelines would be the responsibility of the pipeline
owner.

17

18 Five plugged and abandoned oil/gas wells are located within the area of potential effect of the proposed project, and are considered to represent a

19 REC to the proposed project. If the plugged and abandoned oil/gas wells

20 within the northern portion of the proposed project are encountered during the proposed project they would need to be re-abandoned in accordance

21 with current State of California, Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) regulations. In addition, as

22 a result of the informal agreement between DOGGR and Los Angeles County Department of Public Works (LACDPW), Environmental Programs

23 Division (EPD), gas mitigation plan would need to be obtained and submitted to DOGGR." (Italics original.)

24 46. The NOE itself (Exhibit A) also contains a long list of mitigation measures to address
25 evident, projected environmental impacts attributable to the Project: Air Quality measures,
26 Biological Resources measures, Cultural Resources measures, Hazardous Waste/Materials
27 measures, Noise mitigation, Paleontological Resources measures, and Visual Resources measures.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 The language of the NOE itself thus demonstrates that Respondents, through the invocation of

3 mitigation measures, "backed into" the claimed categorical exemption stated in the NOE.

47. TIMELY FILING OF THIS PETITION

5 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 36 through 46,
inclusive, as set forth in full herein.

6 48. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents
7 deliberately (i) delayed providing the environmental Report to Petitioner until after the NOE was
8 already filed with the SCH, (ii) prepared such Report after the NOE was already filed in an attempt

9 to retroactively justify said NOE, and (iii) otherwise misled Petitioner in order to thwart Petitioner's

INDERLLP 10 rights to meaningfully comment upon and challenge Respondents' environmental determination(s).

11
3 49.

ALESHIRE Even a late-filed CEQA challenge is judicially permissible where a lead agency
12 misleads the public so as to prevent an interested party from timely filing CEQA challenge.
13 (Citizens for a Responsible Caltrans Decision v. Department of Transportation (2020)
14 46 Cal.App.5th 103.)

15 50. Furthermore, California Judicial Council Emergency Rule 9, effective April 6, 2020,
16 tolled all statutes of limitations for civil actions until 90 days after Governor lifts the still-pending
17 COVID-19 state of emergency. On May 29, 2020 the Judicial Council amended Emergency Rule 9
18 to state that for civil actions subject to a statute of limitations of 180 days or less, including those
19 arising pursuant to CEQA, the tolling period expires on August 3, 2020. Accordingly, the 35-day
20 deadline to file the instant action expires on September 8, 2020.

21

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.-

24 51. Unlawful Application of Class Categorical Exemption)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs
25 inclusive, as set forth in full herein. through 50,

26 52. For a Project of this size and scope that poses potentially significant environmental
27 effects as admitted in Respondents' own documentation, Respondents should have prepared an EIR

28 or other appropriate environmental review process (e.g., negative declaration or mitigated negative

01001.0041/667520.3 LNL -13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 declaration) with respect to the Project. The Project does not qualify for a CEQA categorical

2 exemption.

3 53. A categorical exemption under CEQA is only appropriate for "projects that have
4 been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21084(a);

5 see also, Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal. 4th 1086, 1105 [use of a

6 categorical exemption is improper where a project will cause significant adverse impacts.J.) No

7 categorical exemption may be used where there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will have
8 a significant environmental effect due to unusual circumstances. (Cal. Code Regs. § 15300.2(c).)
9 Here, the record is replete with evidence that the Project will have significant adverse environmental
10 impacts. 'The extensive number of potential environmental impacts identified in the NOE and the

5 SHHIHSHTV WYNDER LIP 11 Report alone belie the legality of Respondents' use of a categorical exemption for this Project. Use
12| of a CEQA exemption is in direct violation of the CEQA Regulations based on the size and scope
13 of the Project.

14 54. Even more blatant, the categorical exemptions set forth in 14 Cal. Code Regs.
15 § 15301 (the exemption basis specifically cited in the NOE) only apply to projects for existing
16 highways "that do not create additional automobile lanes." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 156301(c).) The
17 Report and NOE, however, make clear that Project improvements include the addition of new
18 auxiliary lanes and a lane extension along a southbound I-405 between the I-105 connector and the
19 off-ramp to eastbound Rosecrans Avenue.

20 55. Respondents' determination that the Project qualifies for a Class categorical
21 exemption was also not supported by substantial evidence in the record. For example, without
22| limitation, Respondents' exemption finding was based largely on a very a narrow interpretation of the
23 Project's footprint being within Caltrans' right-of-way. However, it ignored evidence that the
24 Project would have impacts extending beyond the boundaries of Caltrans' right-of-way. The Report
25 and NOE do not even raise, much less consider, several categories of impacts on the environment,
26| including but limited to failing to identify direct, indirect, long-term, and unavoidable environmental
27 impacts upon noise and vibrations, land use, hazards, air quality, traffic and transportation. CEQA
28 requires the decision-making agency to balance environmental benefits of a proposed project against

01001.0041/667520.3 LNL -14-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

its unavoidable environmental risks when determining whether to approve the project. Respondents

2 failed to satisfy such mandate.

56. Respondents further violated CEQA by relying on mitigation measures to find the

4 Project categorically exempt. Respondents conditioned the Project approval and issuance of the
NOE on modifications to various other Project features, which themselves are listed in the NOE.

6 These conditions were intended to reduce the environmental impacts of this specific Project.
7 However, mitigation measures cannot be used to support a finding that a categorical exemption

8 applies, but rather must be proposed and adopted through the normal CEQA process. Respondents'

9 reliance on the exemption cited in the NOE rests on an unreasonable and impermissible construction
10 of CEQA as a matter of law and qualifies as a prejudicial and irreparable abuse of discretion.

11 57. Respondents' errors were prejudicial in that they precluded informed decision-
Y TuHsaTV MVT :Y VYNDERUP 12 making and informed public participation, deprived both the public and decisionmakers of
13 substantial relevant information about the Project's environmental effects, and precluded informed
14 consideration of other feasible mitigation measures and alternatives that might have reduced or

15 avoided those effects.

16 58. In view of the foregoing violations of CEQA, Respondents' actions, and each of
17 them, in adopting the NOE, approving the Project, and finding, determining and certifying that the
18 Project is categorically or otherwise exempt from CEQA, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of
19 discretion in that Respondents, and each of them, have failed to proceed in the manner required by
20 law and the decisions in connection therewith are not supported by substantial evidence taken from
21 the record as a whole. Respondents' prejudicial abuse of their discretion must suspend all activities
22 with respect to the Project and stay all actions to implement the Project until full compliance with
23 CEQA is achieved.

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.- §

26 Unlawful "Piecemealing" of Project)

27 59. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 50, inclusive,
28 as set forth in full herein.

01001.0041/667520.3 LNL -15-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

60. The impacts of an entire project, not just individual segments, should be
2 programmatically analyzed. CEQA forbids "piecemealing" projects. (E. Sacramento Partnerships

3 for a Livable City V. City of Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281, 293.) Pursuant to CEQA, the
4 whole of an entire project must be analyzed, and an environmental determination predicated upon
5 breaking-down one larger project into smaller "sub-projects" (thus reducing or understating
6 potential impacts to the environment through "piecemeal") is prohibited.

7 61. Respondents' own Report expressly reveals that there are seven (7) I-405 projects
8 similar to the subject Project being undertaken by Respondents within the Project area:

9 "Additionally, other projects in the vicinity of the I-405 auxiliary lanes
project include the following: 10
Active Traffic Management and Corridor Management Systems (EA 11 No.35070) - Improvements include upgrading Transportation Management 2 MICNAN 12 System elements at various locations along I-405 including the Los Angeles daIHSaTY Airport (LAX) Hub on I-105 (PM 19.2/26).
13 Widening of Southbound La Cienega Boulevard Off-ramp (EA No.
14 34070) - Improvements include widening of the southbound La Cienega Boulevard off-ramp, improvements to the on-ramp and intersection 15 modification (PM 22.5).
16 Northbound I-405 Auxiliary Lane Improvement (EA No. 36750)
17 Improvements include the addition of auxiliary lanes from El Segundo Boulevard to Imperial Highway (Route 105), and the widening of the
18 northbound off-ramp to two lanes with modifications to the termini. (PM
20.2/21.2).

- 19
Seismic Retrofit for Route 405/105 Separation (EA No. 35390) 20 Improvements include bridge seismic restoration of 405/105 Separation
21 (53-1231) and upgrade to American Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. (PM
17.6).
22 Roadside Safety Improvements along the I-405 (EA No. 33870) -
23 Improvements include construction of Maintenance Vehicle Pullout (MVP), access road, rock blanket at islands and between ramps and upgrade 24 irrigation-systems. (PM 12.9/R21.5)
25 I-405 Crenshaw Boulevard Ramp Improvements (EA No. 29360)
26 Improvements include constructing a new southbound on-ramp from northbound Crenshaw Blvd and increasing storage space for vehicles on the
27 I-405 on-and-off ramps and local streets by widening the roadway. (PM
14.4/15.6)
28

-16- 01001.0041/667520.3 LNL PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Auxiliary Lanes along the I-405 at the I-110 Interchange Improvement (EA No. 35710) - Improvements include the addition of auxiliary to I-405 2 to I-110) in the northbound and southbound direction and the widening of connector ramps. (PM 12.4/14.6). 3

These projects have been coordinated with the I-405 project, where 4 applicable."
5

62. This statement makes clear that there is more to the Project than is being revealed in
7 the Project description in the NOE, that in fact there is a larger project that is being analyzed in a 6

8 piecemeal fashion in order to make impacts appear less significant. All related I-405 projects should

9 have been evaluated under CEQA collectively with the subject Project. To cure this piecemealing
10 problem, Respondents must rescind the NOE and perform a full and fair CEQA analysis of the
11 Project's environmental impacts in a non-piecemeal fashion that includes consideration of all related
THIHSHTY M VT IV LONN 12 I-405 projects administered by Respondents.

63. In view of the foregoing violations of CEQA, Respondents' actions, and each of
14 them, in "piecemealing" the Project's environmental evaluation from related I-405 projects to 13

15 understate environmental impacts constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondents,
16 and each of them, have failed to proceed in the manner required by law and the decisions in
17 connection therewith are not supported by substantial evidence taken from the record as a whole. In
18 light of Respondents' prejudicial abuse of their discretion the Court must order Respondents to
19 suspend all activities with respect to the Project and stay all actions to implement the Project until
20 full compliance with CEQA is achieved.

PRAYER 21

22 WHEREFORE, the City prays for judgment as follows on both the First and Second Causes
23 of Action:

24 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside their
25 approval of the Project;

2. For a writ of mandate directing Respondents to rescind the NOE and perform a full
27 and fair analysis of the Project's environmental impacts in accordance with CEQA; 26

3. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply with the

3 Resources Code § 21168.9;

4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
5 injunctions restraining Respondents and their agents, servants, employees, officers, and
6 representatives from undertaking any action to implement the Project pending full compliance with

7 the requirements of CEQA;
