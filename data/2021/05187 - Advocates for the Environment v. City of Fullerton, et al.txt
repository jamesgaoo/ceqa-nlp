VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 Introduction

3 1. This action challenges the November 2, 2020 certification by the City of
4 Fullerton (City or Respondent) of environmental impact report No. SCH
5 202031172 (EIR) for the Goodman Logistics Center Fullerton Project (PRJ2019-
6 00173) (the Project). Entitlements approved under the EIR include Major Site
7 Plan, a Water Supply Assessment, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
8 Program, Tentative Parcel Map, a Zone Change, a Zoning Variance, and a
9 Development Agreement.
10 2. The Project will construct over 1.5 million square feet of warehouse space, with
11 about half to be used for cold storage. It will indirectly generate significant
12 amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) through its use of electricity, and through
13 increased vehicle miles travelled. These GHG emissions will have a small adverse
14 impact on every one of the seven billion persons on earth. The City has allowed
15 the EIR to use a sleight of hand-it includes past cogeneration emissions in the
16 baseline-that results in an incorrect determination that the Project's GHG
17 impacts will not be significant, in violation of CEQA.
18 3.
19 In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality

20 Act, Public Resources Code $$ 21000-21189.3 (CEQA) and the CEQA

21 Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, $$ 15000-15387 plus

22 appendices (CEQA Guidelines).

23 4. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related

24 environmental documentation, as described below.

25 Parties
26 5. Plaintiff and Petitioner Advocates for the Environment (Advocates) is a Los
27

28 Angeles, California nonproft public benefit corporation that litigates in the

29 public interest to protect the environment, with a strong focus on climate
change.
30
31 6. Defendant and Respondent City of Fullerton is a California city located in the

32 County of Orange, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional limits of

33 the City.

34 7. Petitioner is informed, believes, and on that basis alleges that Real Party in

35 Interest GLC Fullerton LLC (Applicant), is a Delaware LLC that is the owner of

2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I the Project Site and is the applicant to the City for the Project entitlements.
2 8. Real Parties in Interest Does 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
3

4 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said

5 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names. Does 1-10 are agents of Applicant

6 who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this petition,

or
7 other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interèst in the

8 subject matter of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true

9 names and capacities of Does 1-10 when ascertained.

10 Jurisdiction and Venue
11 9. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) $$ 1094.5 and 1085 and Public
12 Resources Code §S 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to
13 issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and
14 purported approval of the Project.
15 10.
16 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County

17 of Orange and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in

18 this County. The cause alleged in this petition, or some part of that cause, arise in

19 this 'county. (CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150

20 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to CCP $$ 394
21 (actions against a city, county, or local agency), and 395 (actions generally), since
22 the City of Fullerton is in the County of Orange.
23 11. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after the filing of a Notice of
24 Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code $ 21167.

25 12. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within

26 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as

27 limited civil cases in CCP §$ 86, 86.1, or 87.

28 13. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to
29 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code $ 21167.5.
30 14. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record
31 of administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public
32 Resources Code § 21 167.6 or other applicable laws.
33 15. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
34 action and has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law

3 under Public Resources Code $ 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and

4 individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or

5 16. in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

6 The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial

7 interests of Petitioner and the public at large. The relief sought by way of this

8 Petition will redress this beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury

9 17. and interference with Petitioner's interests, and those of the public.

10 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

11 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to

12 set aside its certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. In the absence of

13 such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state
law and injurious to Petitioner.

14

15 General Allegations

16 Background on Climate Change

17

18 18. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases

19 from human activity have caused climate change, and that climate change will

20 worsen in the future unless atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations are
controlled and reduced.
21 22 & 19. In its Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on

24 Climate Change has said that "continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause
further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate

25 system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive, and irreversible impacts for

26 people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require substantial and

27 sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, which, together with

28 adaptation, can limit climate change risk."

29
30 20. The effects of climate change are pervasive. It has resulted in rising temperatures,
disruptions of weather systems, changes in wind patterns, disturbance of

31
32 historical hydrological cycles, shifts in ocean currents and ocean acidification, and
a myriad of other harmful changes to global climate regimes.

33

34 21. Effects of climate change extend far beyond meteorological systems. It threatens

35 ecosystems and is causing extinctions of many species. It disrupts systems that
provide food and water to human communities. It threatens human health,

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

RNM T1ODN CO security, and livelihoods.
22. Climate change increases both short- and long-term weather phenomena that
lead to more extreme wildfires. Climate change is responsible for an increased
frequency of fires, and changes fire behavior, making them burn hotter and more
intensely, and spread faster.
23. The effects of climate change are being felt very strongly in California. According
to California's Fourth Climate Change Assessment, published in 2018 by the
9 Governor's Office of Planning and Research, the California Energy Commission,
10 and the California Natural Resources Agency (Fourth Assessment), California is
11 one of the most climate-challenged regions of North America. Average'

12 temperatures are increasing, and climatic conditions are hotter and drier,

13 contributing to recent extended, severe drought.

14 24. In the face of the threats posed by climate change, California has taken a leading
15 role in efforts to slow and stop greenhouse-gas emissions. AB 32 mandated a
return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. SB 32 called for reduction 40 percent 16

17 below 1990 levels by 2030. SB 100 required that 60 percent of California's
18 electricity portfolio come from renewable sources by 2030, and that the electric
19 grid be powered entirely by clean energy by 2045. Executive Order B-55-18
20 established a statewide goal to achieve carbon neutrality "as soon as possible, and
21 no later than 2045."

22 25. The transportation sector is California's largest source of greenhouse-gas
23 emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions from transportation are rising in spite of
24 the state's efforts to control them, impeding the state's ability to meet its goals to
25 reduce greenhouse gases and climate effects.
26 26. Significant California policy initiatives seeking to reduce greenhouse-gas (GHG)
27 emissions from mobile sources (transportation, especially cars and light trucks)
28 include:
29 a. California's 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan, issued by the California 30 Air Resources Board in November 2017. It calls for supporting and 31 accelerating progress on transitioning to a zero-carbon transportation 32 system, while ensuring vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions are still
33 achieved.
34 b. SB 743, which required the Governor's Office of Planning and Research to 35

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 amend the CEQA Guidelines to change the criteria used to evaluate the
2 significance of transportation impacts. The result was Guidelines section
3 15064.3, which changes the focus for eyaluating transportation impacts
4 from Level of Service (LOS) to VMT.
5 27. Land-use decisions that increase VMT are a significant contributing factor in
6 transportation-sector emissions. New developments can also cause significant 7 emissions by burning natural gas, by consuming electricity that was generated by 8 burning fossil fuels, and in many other ways. 9

10 The Project
11 28. The Project would redevelop the 65.4-acre former Kimberly-Clark manufacturing
12 site at 2001 Orangethorpe Avenue in Fullerton (the Project Site).
atE5 8805 29. The Project would involve the demolition of the existing manufacturing facility
on the Project Site and the construction of an industrial logistics center with four
buildings with 1,561,522 square feet of industrial space and 105,000 square feet of
office space.

EIR and Project Approval Process
30. On March 30, 2020, the City distributed a Notice of Preparation of the Draft EIR
for this Project (NOP). The City held a scoping meeting on April 20, 2020.
22 31. The City completed the DEIR, and issued a Notice of Completion of the Draft EIR

23 (DEIR) on August 4, 2020, starting a 45-day comment period, which ended on

24 September 17, 2020.

25 32. In October 2020 the City issued the Final EIR for the Project (FEIR).

26 33. The Fullerton Planning Commission, on October 14, 2020, held a public hearing,
27 and recommended that the Fullerton City Council approve the FEIR and the
28 following entitlements (the Project Entitlements):
29 a. Water Supply Assessment;
30 b. Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program;
31 c. Zoning Amendment LRP-2019-0085 to change the zoning designation for 32 3.7 acres on the southeastern portion of the Project Site from M-G-ES 33 (Manufacturing, General) to M-P-200-ES (Manufacturing Park); 34

35 d. Major Site Plan review LRP-2019-0085 of site, architectural landscape

plans;
2
e. Zoning variance ZON-2019-0153 to allow the proposed buildings to exceed 3 the maximum height permitted in the M-P-200-ES zone; 4

5 f. Tentative Parcel Map SUB-2019-0025 to subdivide the Project Site into

6 four parcels;

7 g. Development Agreement LRP-2019-0084 between the City and Applicant.
8 34. On November 2, 2020, the Fullerton City Council, after a public hearing,
9 approved the EIR and the Project Entitlements.
10 35. The City filed a Notice of Determination for the Project with the Orange County
11 Clerk on November 5, 2020.
12
First Cause of Action 13
(Violations of CEQA) 14

15 36. Petitioner realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-35 as if fully set forth here.
16 37. The City violated CEQA by certifying a Final EIR that fails to adequately
17 disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts, some of
18 which are alleged in the following paragraphs.
483 Greenhouse Gas Impacts

38. 22 The EIR uses the wrong baseline for analyzing the Project's greenhouse-gas
(GHG) emissions. The baseline violates CEQA by including emissions from
23 Kimberly-Clark's cogeneration facility, which amount to 13,550.63 MTCO2e.
24 The Notice of Preparation was issued on March 27, 2020, but the cogeneration
25 facility was shut down and removed in February, 2020. The baseline should
26 represent the physical conditions at the time the NOP was issued; so inclusion of
27 the emissions from the cogeneration facility in the baseline was improper under
28 CEQA.
29 39. The EIR's conclusion that the Project's GHG emissions would not be significant
30 is based on the improper baseline. Once the correct baseline is used in the
31 analysis, the EIR demonstrates that the Project's GHG emissions would be
32 significant. CEQA requires that significant impacts must be mitigated to the
33 extent feasible, and the City's failure to require mitigation of the Project's GHG
34 impacts violates CEQA,
35

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L 40.
2 The EIR's failure to even mention Executive Order B-55-18, which requires the

3 state to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, violates CEQA, because that executive

4 order is an important standard against which GHG emissions should be
evaluated.
5
6 41. The EIR also fails to analyze the GHG emissions that will result from removal of

7 the orange orchard on the Project Site. This omission of a proper analysis is a

8 failure to proceed in the manner required by law, and another CEQA violation.

9

10 Air Quality Impacts

11 42. The EIR uses the wrong baseline for air-quality emissions. The analysis

12 improperly includes emissions from the cogeneration facility in its baseline for

13 air-quality analysis.

14 43. The EIR also violates CEQA by failing to contain a health risk analysis

15

16 connecting the increase in criteria air pollutant emissions that will be caused by
the Project to the effects of that increase on human health.

17

18 Alternatives

19 44.

20 CEQA requires an EIR to include an analysis of alternatives to the proposed

21 project, but the EIR violates CEQA because it does not contain such an analysis.

22 Conclusion

23 45.

24 As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondent

25 prejudicially abused its discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with

26 CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance on it. Accordingly, Respondent's

27 certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.

28 Prayer for Relief

29 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment in its favor and for relief as follows:

30 A. For a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate the certification of the

31 EIR and all Project Entitlements for the Project; requiring Respondents to

32 comply with CEQA; and ordering Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to

33 cease any and all activity related to the Project that may result in a physical

34 change to the environment unless and until the Project is re-approved following

35 the certification of a legally sufficient EIR for the Project;
