7 approval of a Collection Services Agreement for the Provision of Residential and Commercial Solid

8 Waste, Recyclable Materials and Organic Waste Collection Services executed between the City and
9 Athens (the "Exclusive Franchise Agreement" or "Project"), and the adoption of a Notice of Exemption
10 ("NOE") for the Project in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). (Pub.
11 Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines").)

12 2. The City's approval of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement granted Athens the exclusive
13 right to collect and haul municipal solid waste ("MSW"), recyclable materials, and organic waste from
14 commercial businesses and residential uses within the City of Thousand Oaks for 15-years with the
15 potential for two five-year extensions. If allowed to remain in place despite the City's CEQA and Ralph
16 M. Brown Act (Gov. § Code, § 54950 et seq.) violations, the Exclusive Franchise Agreement becomes
17 effective January 1, 2022.

18 3. Residential waste services are currently provided to the City through two exclusive
19 franchise agreements with USA Waste of California ("Waste Management") and Newbury Disposal
20 Company, Inc., who serve two distinct geographic areas of Thousand Oaks. Commercial service is

21

22 provided by Waste Management.

In the October 15, 2020, response to the City's Request for Proposals ("RFP"), however,
26 Mr. Gary Clifford, Athens' Executive Vice President, stated that "we are currently in negotiations to

28 fueling station." The site referred to by Mr. Clifford is located off Corporation Street and Calpipe Road CASE #:56-2021-00553340-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1210419D53972 DATE PAID : 04/19/21 10:31 1d3: 3dAl 00 9CP : IVLOL WY

1 in the City of Santa Paula. The site address is 905 Corporation Street (the "Corporation Street Site" or,

2 as referred to by Athens, the "Santa Paula Hauling Yard").

3 6. Residential homes are located approximately 400 feet south of the Corporation Street
4 Site, on the east side of the street. Additional residences are located on the other side of Peck Road.

5 7. The approved RFP response from Athens details the demolition and new construction at
6 the Corporation Street Site required to service the Exclusive Franchise Agreement (see D2 Operations
% 7 Plan), including, the construction of new:
Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted tL:69:L01B IZOZ-9L-+0 8 23,500 square foot ("sf') Processing/Transfer Facility;
10,240 sf maintenance building;

10 4,000 sf Office/Parts/Dispatch Building;
Collection Truck Parking Area with 81-parking spaces;
11 Secure yard/bin storage area;
12 Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG") re-fueling station to be used by Athens' trucks as
13 well as the public; and

14 Demolition of 48,360 sf of existing buildings.

15 (See Athens' RFP Response, at pp. 106-107 [Exhibit A1.1].)

16 8. None of Athens' proposed improvements to the Corporation Street/Santa Paula Hauling
17 Yard site have been approved by the City of Santa Paula or subject to environmental review under
18 CEQA.

19 9. Athens' RFP response states that it leased the "hauling facility" and that "the property
a 20 has a conditional use permit ("CUP") (PROJECT NO. 2012-CUP-03) to develop a transfer station at

21 the location." It does not.

22 10. Although the Corporation Street site was granted a CUP in 2012 by the City of Santa
23 Paula (Project No. 2012-CUP-03) (Resolution No. 3701), the mitigated negative declaration ("MND")
24 prepared and adopted for the "Crown Disposal Vehicle Storage and Maintenance Facility Project"
25 stated that: no new construction would occur; 10-12 personnel would be onsite; the project would
26 generate only up to 68 average daily trips; and a limited number of pieces of equipment would be
27 stored and maintained onsite (including 5 side loaders, 3 front loaders, 2 roll-offs and several delivery Ld3 : 3dAl 00 9St : 7VIOI WY LE:OL IU6WTO : CIVd ELVO ZL6ESC6LTOLZI # LJIEO3H VLA-WM-NO-O+S8G9OO-LZOZ-99:# ISV0

11. At the March 9th 2021 City Council hearing for the Exclusive Franchise Agreement at
3| issue, Mr. Cesar Torres nevertheless stated that: "we [Athens] have the option to expand immediately
4 in Santa Paula, and we will be doing that after this contract is awarded."

11 111.) This Petition refers to the parcel as the "Ojai Street" site. Residential homes surround the Ojai

13. Under the Exclusive Franchise Agreement, different facilities from those being used by
12 the City's existing service providers will be used to process MSW, divert recyclables and treat/process

13 organic waste to compost, among other activities. Rather than use the Simi Valley Landfill and
14 Recycling Center (SVLRC) in Ventura County to process MSW and recyclables, as is currently done,
15 for example, the Exclusive Franchise Agreement will result in Athens hauling material to its own Sun
16 Valley Transfer Station/Material Recovery Facility ("TS/MRF"), located at 11121 Pendleton Street, in
17 the City of Los Angeles roughly forty (40) miles from the Thousand Oaks City Center. By contrast, the
18 SVLRC is located at 2801 Madera Road, Simi Valley, approximately eleven (11) miles from the City
19| of Thousand Oaks City Center.

20 14. The use of new processing and disposal facilities under the Exclusive Franchise
21 Agreement to service the City's future needs will result in collection and transfer trucks using new haul
22| routes not previously used or analyzed under CEQA.

23 15. None of the potential environmental effects of the Corporation Street improvements, use
24 of the Ojai Street parcel, or use of the new (versus existing) disposal and processing facilities were
25 considered by the City prior to adoption of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement, or as part of the NOE.
26 The City therefore failed to consider the "whole of the project" under CEQA, and the resulting direet
27 and indirect environmental effects of the Project to noise, air quality emissions (NOx, ROG, CO, PM),
28 related health risks, greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, and increased vehicle miles traveled (*VMT"), CASE #:56-2021-00553340-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1210419D53972 DATE L3 : 3dAl 00 9Et : 7V1OL WV LE:OL LZ/6L/+0 : GIVd

2 16. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion under CEQA by failing to consider
3 the "whole of the project." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a).) This longstanding principle is
4 designed to ensure "that environmental considerations do not become submerged by chopping a large

& 5 project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the environment-which

Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 04-16-2021 at 01:59:14 6 cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13
Cal.3d 263, 283-284.)

8 17. The City also violated the Brown Act by failing to include any notice to the public in its
9 March 9th 2021 City Council Agenda of the City's intent to adopt a NOE under CEQA to at the hearing.
10 The City Council Agenda was silent as to CEQA. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of

20 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, §
21 21168.5.)

and City of Santa Paula, will be directly affected by the Project as the Project will cause potentially
significant adverse impacts, including cumulative impacts, on traffic/VMT, air quality, health risks,

& 6 GHIG and noise, that remain unidentified. The health and safety of WM employees will therefore be

bL:69:L0 7 impacted by the effects of the Project. As members of the public, moreover, WM employees possess an
8 interest in protecting public resources present in the area, including air quality. By nature of using the

11 environmental review and mitigating any significant adverse environmental impacts of the Project,
12| including from noise, air quality/GHG, health risks and VMT. The interests of WM will therefore be
13 directly impacted by the Project. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, and on behalf of others who will be
14 affected within the City of Thousand Oaks and the City of Santa Paula, as well as for all citizens more
15| broadly, including those who seek to maintain the integrity and fairness of the environmental review
16 and land use entitlement process.

41.

Ventura Superior Court g Accepted through eDelivery submitted 04-16-2021 at 01:59:14 The grounds for noncompliance with CEQA alleged in the Petition are consistent with
8 the objections to the Project raised by Petitioner or by other members of the public and interested
9 public agencies prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project and before the City filed the NOE.
10 42. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA alleged in this Petition were, for some
11 reason, not raised, or were broadly raised, prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project, it was
12 because the City failed to give adequate public notice as required by law and, therefore, there was no
13 meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise objections orally or in writing prior to the
14 approval of the Project.

16 Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies.

17 44. STATEMENT OF FACTS
The City of Thousand Oaks utilizes exclusive franchise agreements for the regularly
18 scheduled collection and processing of trash, recyclables, and organic waste and street sweeping
19 services. The City's existing franchise agreements with WM, E.J. Harrison and Sons, Inc., and others

20 were originally scheduled to expire on June 30, 2021. The City began negotiations in 2018 for new
21 service agreements.

22 45.

24 ("MOU"). On May 31, 2019, the City extended the hauler agreement expiration dates to December
23 31, 2021, to allow time to continue the negotiation process and prepare a Memoranda of Understanding

25 46. On January 28, 2020, the City rejected the terms of the MOUs negotiated with WM and
26 E.J. Harrison and Sons, Inc., authorized staff to issue notices of non-extension of the existing
27 agreements, and to begin the RFP process.

1 47. The October 15, 2020, RFP proposal from Athens to the City identified numerous
2  infrastructure improvements planned for the Corporation Street site to serve the City under the
3 Exclusive Franchise Agreement, including those specifically set-forth in paragraph 7 of this Petition

4 and incorporated by reference herein. The RFP proposal also included use of the Ojai Street parcel as a
5 vehicle or storage yard, use of the Calabasas Landfill for disposal (9.9 miles away from the City

9 Council hearing omitted any reference to CEQA for the Project. Agenda item 9A merely described the ‡

10 Solid Waste Franchise Agreement Award and staff recommendation to approve the Agreement with
11 Athens. There was no mention of the NOE or the categorical exemptions the City proposed to rely on
12 for the approval.

13 49. On or about March 5, 2021, WM submitted a comment letter to the City raising, among
14 other issues, WM's concern that the City had not considered the new potential environmental effects
15 that would result to the physical environment under CEQA if the Exclusive Franchise Agreement and
16 change in service providers were approved. Numerous other comments were received by the City.

17 50. At 3:30 p.m. on the day of the City Council hearing, City staff released a "Supplemental
18 Information Packet" containing a conclusory two-page analysis recommending that the Council adopt a
19 NOE relying on the Class "Existing Facilities" exemption (CEQA Guidelines, § 15301), the Class 8
20 "Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment" (CEQA Guidelines, § 15308)
21 exemption, and the rarely invoked "common sense" exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section
22 15061, subdivision (b)(3).

23 51. WM, the public and other interested stakeholders were deprived of public notice and an
24 adequate opportunity to exhaust their administrative remedies because the categorical exemptions that
25 the City relied on in approving the Exclusive Franchise Agreement were not revealed until 2 ½ hours
26 before the City Council hearing started. The specific categorical exemptions were also not disclosed

Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted LZOZ-9L-10 at 01:59:14 6 review process to the extent practicable and based on the limited information that was made publicly
7 available.

8 53. At various points during the March 9, 2021, City Council hearing Athens representatives
9 stated that its vehicle and hauling yard might be located in Santa Paula, Sun Valley, or even "other
10 options." Alternatively, representatives of Athens stated they would use its existing TS/MRF yard in
11 Sun Valley if needed. None of the potential effects from the referenced alternative sites, or Sun Valley,

12

13 were considered in the staff report or the NOE as part of the Project.
54. At its March 9, 2021, hearing, over the objections of Petitioner and numerous others, the
14 City Council approved the Exclusive Solid Waste Franchise Agreement with Athens for a 15-year term
15 (January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2036).

21 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

22 57. Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq)

23 Petition, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this

24 58. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law. Courts have interpreted CEQA to
25 afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope of the statute. CEQA
26 applies to all discretionary approvals of "projects" proposed to be conducted or approved by a public
27 agency, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. (See Pub. Resources
28 Code, §§ 21000 21178; Guidelines, §§ 753, 15000-15387.) CASE #:56-2021-00553340-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1210419D53972 DATE PAID LE:OL LZ/6L/+0 Ld3 : 3dAL 00'SE: 7VLOL WV

59. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
2 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
3 environment, and . . . that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or

4 other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' The statutory definition is augmented by the
[CEQA] Guidelines ... , which define a 'project' as the whole of an action, which has a potential for

9 60. "'Project' is given a broad interpretation in order to maximize protection of the =

10 environment." (McQueen v. Board of Directors of the Mid-peninsula Regional Open Space Dist. (1988)
11 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) In general, a lead agency must analyze fully each "project" in a single
12 environmental analysis. Thus, in performing its analysis, the agency should not perform "piecemeal"
13 review by splitting a project into two or more segments. "The prohibition against piecemeal review is
14 the flip side of the requirement that the whole of a project be reviewed under CEQA. (See [CEQA]
15 Guidelines, § 15378, subd. (a).)" (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131
16 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1208.) This principle is designed to ensure "that environmental considerations do

17 not become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential
18| impact on the environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Bozung, supra,

19 13 Cal.3d at pp. 283-284.)
20 61. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by not considering the potential
21 direct, indirect and cumulative environmental effects from increased noise, air quality/GHG, health
22 risks, traffic safety hazards and VMT that would occur under the Project from use of the Ojai Street site
23 as a vehicle storage or yard under the Project, including impacts to surrounding residents as well as the
24 public traveling along the same streets. No prior environmental review has been conducted by the City
25 of Santa Paula for the use(s) proposed by Athens and approved by the City for this parcel.

The City also failed to consider the incremental difference in air quality (ROG, NOx,
12 PM, CO) emissions, GHG emissions, health risks, VMT and noise impacts that would result from the
13 use of different and, as admitted by Athens' legal counsel, yet unidentified haul and collection routes,
14 that will result under the Project from use of new facilities, including, for example, a new primary
15 landfill for disposal (Calabasas or Toland v. SVLRC), a different recycling facility (Athens' Sun Valley
16 TS/MRF v. SVLRC, the Azusa TS/MRF & Gold Coast RC), and different organics facility (American

21 As explained below, not only did the City abuse its discretion and fail to proceed in the

22 manner required by law, it also erroneously concluded that the Project (as narrowly defined) was

Of CEQA Guidelines section 15301 Supports the City's

The Class 1 categorical exemption is reserved for the "operation, repair, maintenance,
24 permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration" of existing structures or facilities, among others,
25 "involving negligible or no expansion of existing or former use." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15301.) None
26 of the examples provided in the regulation even remotely reflect the whole of the Project approved by

67. Athens Services will need to undertake new construction beyond the "negligible or no
2 expansion of use" allowed by the Class exemption in order to accommodate its needs. In fact, by
3 Athens' own admission at the City Council hearing, it could expand the site "up to seven acres."

4 68. The Project as approved conflicts with the plain language of CEQA Guidelines section
5 15301. No substantial evidence exists to support the City's reliance on the Class I categorical
6 exemption. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result in significant adverse environmental
ã 7 impacts, due to several exceptions to the exemption, as alleged herein.

Guidelines section 15308 Supports the City's Reliance on the Class 8 Exemption

10 69. The Class 8 categorical exemption is reserved for "actions taken by regulatory agencies,
11  as authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or
12 protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the
13 environment. Construction activities and relaxation of standards allowing environmental degradation
14 are not included in this exemption." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15308.)

15 70. The Class 8 categorical exemption, by its own plain language, does not apply to
16 construction activities as contemplated by the City for the Project on the Corporation Street site.
17 Moreover, the City, in adopting the Exclusive Franchise Agreement, did not act as a "regulatory
18 agency" "authorized by state or local ordinance" for purposes of ensuring the protection of the
19 environment as contemplated by this exemption.

20 71. The City's claim that Senate Bill 1383 requires it to enter an Exclusive Franchise
21 Agreement to divert organic waste from landfills and exempts the Project from CEQA review stretches

22 the plain meaning and intent of the regulation beyond recognition. SB 1383 requires all local

23 governments to divert organic waste from landfills in order to reduce GHG emissions. It does not
24 explicitly or implicitly permit a local government to bypass CEQA review.

25 72. The Project as approved conflicts with the plain language of CEQA Guidelines section
26 15308. No substantial evidence exists to support the City's reliance on the Class 8 categorical
27 exemption. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result in significant adverse environmental 1d3: 3dAl 00°9ET : 7V101 WV LE:OL -Z/6W/10: OIVd ELLVO Z268G06L0IZL # 1dl3038 V.1A-WM-NO-0tE89G0O-LZOZ-9g# ASVO

1 No Substantial Evidence Supports the City's Reliance on the "Common Sense" Exemption

2 73. Under the "common sense" exemption, projects are not subject to CEQA "[w]here it can
3 be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant

4 effect on the environment . . . ."(CEQA Guidelines, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).)

74. As alleged in paragraphs 6-7, 14-15, 64 and 79, herein and incorporated by reference,

& 6 the City's adoption of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement will have a potentially significant adverse
7 effect on the environment.
Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 04-16-2021 at 01:59:14 75. The Project as approved conflicts with the plain language of CEQA Guidelines section H3: 3dAl 00'9Et : 7V101

12

13 Exceptions to the Class 1 and Class 8 Categorical Exemptions Applied to the City's Approval

76. Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (b), all categorical exemptions
14 and the "common sense" exemption are subject to exceptions, several of which apply to the City's
15 approval of the Project and NOE at issue.

16 77. The City committed : prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to consider the
17 applicability of the exceptions to the reliance on the Class 1 and Class 8 categorical exemptions, as well

18 as the "common sense" exemption.

19 78. The Cumulative Impact exception in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (b),
20 provides that: "All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of
21 successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant."

22 79. The construction of the Corporation Street improvements and operation of the Project
23 will cause significant cumulative adverse impacts to: noise, air quality/GHG, health risks, traffic safety

24 hazards and VMT to the surrounding residents, some of whom live only 400 feet away, as well as the
25 public traveling along the same streets that Athens will use in its collection routes. As a result of the a
26 reasonably foreseeable cumulative impacts of the Project, the categorical exemptions, and the
27 "common sense" exemption that the City relied on in its NOE are unsupportable. CASE #:56-2021-00553340-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1210419D53972 DATE PAID : 04/19/21 10:3°

80. The Significant Effect exception in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c),
2 also provides that: "A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a
3 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual 1:3 : 3dAL 4 Il circumstances."

5 81. The construction and implementation of the Project would cause a significant effect on
6 the environment, including from significant air quality, safety and related health risks to residents and
& 7 members of the public who live or frequent the Project area, including in and around the Corporation
+L:69:L0: 8 Street and N. Ojai Street sites. The Project would result in new transfer and processing of MSW, green
9 waste and organics near residences. Due to these unusual circumstances and the ambiguity of the scope
* 10 of the "whole of the project" approved by the City, there is a reasonable possibility that the Project will
Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 04-16-2021 11 have a significant effect on the environment from increased noise, air quality/GHG, health risks, traffic
12 safety hazards and VMT. Therefore, the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by not
13 considering the significant effects of the Project due to unusual circumstances.
14 82. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion
15 and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to consider the applicability of the
upon exemptions, and by failing to conduct the required additional 16 exceptions to the relied
17 environmental analysis under CEQA before approving the Project.
