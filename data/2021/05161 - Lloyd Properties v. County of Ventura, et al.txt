VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 l. Local oil and gas production in Ventura County has been a vital part of the local

3 economy since the late 1860s. The industry supports more than 2,000 jobs and provides tens of

4 millions of dollars in state and local tax revenues to fund schools, fire protection, police, and public
5 health services. Simply put, oil and gas production fuels the Ventura County local economy.

6 2. For over a hundred years, the Lloyd family has played an integral role in developing
7 Ventura County's most lucrative oil fields and transforming the County into a prosperous and
8 vibrant community.

9 3. Petitioner and Plaintiff LLOYD PROPERTIES, A CALIFORNIA LIMITED
10 PARTNERSHIP ("Lloyd" or "Petitioner"), which was founded by the Lloyd family, owns mineral

11 rights covering thousands of acres of property in Ventura County. For decades, Lloyd or its lessees,
12 have operated oil production facilities, pursuant to long-standing permits and approvals issued by

13 the County, consistent with all applicable regulations. Petitioner has donated significant sums of

14 money to dozens of charitable organizations in Ventura. The primary source for these charitable
15 efforts is income derived from oil and gas royalties produced from Petitioner's mineral properties.

16 4. But Ventura County has turned a blind eye to the enormous economic value the oil
17 and gas industry brings to the County and its residents.

18 5. On September 15, 2020, the County Board of Supervisors certified an
19 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update ("GPU")
20 and approved the GPU. The GPU imposes unduly restrictive and unlawful policies that would
21 | unilaterally alter the terms of long-standing permits governing oil production in the County,
22 abrogate longstanding vested rights, and render oil and gas production impossible.

23 6. The County's adoption of the GPU will result in the loss of thousands of good-
24 paying jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenue that have supported the Ventura County economy
25 for decades. To make matters worse. the County took these actions in the midst of a global
26 pandemic that has already placed California in an economic crisis.
27 While the GPU purportedly "reflects the County's vision for the future," that future will be plagued
28 with fewer jobs, less tax revenue, and underfunded public services as a result of the GPU's unlawful

- ]-

1 policies and the County's reckless decision-making process. There is no evidence that these drastic
2 measures are required to stop immediate threats to public health or safety, and no justification for
3 the abrogation of vested property rights.

4 7. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors adopted amendments to the Non-
5 Coastal Zoning Ordinance and the Coastal Zoning Ordinance (*Zoning Amendments") modifying
6 permitting requirements for oil and gas exploration and production operations.

7 8. Accordingly, Petitioner brings this Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus
8 challenging the decisions of Respondents and Defendants COUNTY OF VENTURA and
9 VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (collectively, "Respondents" or the

10 "County") to certify the EIR for the GPU, adopt findings under the California Environmental

11 Quality Act ("CEQA"), approve the GPU, and adopt the Zoning Amendments.

12 9. Petitioner's vested rights may not be abridged absent due process a and a finding of
13 nuisance or payment of adequate compensation. "The owner of a property right to drill for and
14 extract oil a in a proven field acquired under permit, may not constitutionally be deprived thereof

15 without payment of just compensation except upon a showing that its exercise constitutes a
16 nuisance." (Trans-Oceanic Oil Corp V. Santa Barbara (1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 776, 789.) The
17 County has not found that any of the oil and gas production activities on Petitioner's properties
18 constitute a nuisance, which is a necessary prerequisite before such a taking can occur by post hoc
19 regulation. To the contrary, at all times relevant herein, the continued operations and drilling at
20 Petitioner's properties have occurred lawfully, in compliance with its permits, and in a manner that
21 does not create harm or a nuisance to local communities. Alternatively, the diminishing-asset
22 doctrine contemplates that Petitioner must be allowed to continue drilling operations throughout

23 the entirety of a mineral lease where it had intended to use the entire lease for the extraction of oil
24 and gas.

25 10. In the Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages, Petitioner seeks declaratory

26 relief and damages on the grounds that:

27 a. Petitioner has a vested right to allow the continued extraction of its mineral
28 rights within the County as authorized under existing permits.

- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

b. The adoption of the GPU a is a temporary and permanent taking of
2 Petitioner's property rights for public use without prior compensation in violation of Article I,
3 section 19 of the California Constitution and the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the
4 United States Constitution, and incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.

C. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments violates Petitioner's
6 substantive due process under Article I, section 7 of the California Constitution and the

7 Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The GPU and Zoning Amendments

8 infringes on Petitioner's property rights in an arbitrary, irrational, and discretionary manner,
9 which is not related to any legitimate governmental purpose.

10 11. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors adopted the Zoning Amendments

11 modifying permitting requirements for oil and gas exploration and production operations and
12 broadening the scope of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

13 12. The Zoning Amendments amend Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County
14 Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Ventura County Coastal
15 Zoning Ordinance.

16 13. The Zoning Amendments modify requirements for discretionary permitting for
17 certain new oil and gas cxploration and production operations. The Zoning Amendments will
18 require new discretionary permitting approval for all new wells or other oil and gas exploration and
19 production operations, even if they are currently authorized under the terms of existing permits,
20 and expand the application of the current development design guidelines and operational standards.

21 14. Lloyd has lawfully conducted oil and gas operations pursuant two permits for

22 decades, without any demonstrated adverse impacts.

23 15. To remedy these injuries, Petitioner also seeks a Writ of Mandamus compelling the
24 County to vacate the GPU and oning Amendments as preempted by state and federal law, in
25 cxcess of the County's authority, and in violation of the California Constitution.

26 16. In pursving this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting
27 the public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial bencfit on the general public, citizens of
28 Ventura County, and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees and

• 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

costs pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. In addition, Petitioner will be entitled to
2 l recover attorneys' fees and costs as part of their claim for inverse condemnation pursuant to Code
3l of Civil Procedure section 1036.

4 PARTIES

5 17. Petitioner LLOYD PROPERTIES, A CALIFORNIA LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,

6 is a citizen of California that owns property and mineral rights covering thousands of acres in
7 Ventura County. Petitioner has several legally cognizable interests in the GPU and will be

8 negatively affected by the GPU, including but not limited to the GPU's adverse environmental

9 impacts, impairment of Petitioner's vested rights and constitutional rights to due process, and
10 unlawful taking of Petitioner's properties without just compensation.

11 18. Respondent COUNTY OF VENTURA, a political subdivision of the State of

12 California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in its territory, including
13 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA. The County is the "lead agency" for
14 purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting
15 environmental review of the proposed actions and complying with CEQA and other state laws.

16 19. Respondent VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is the elected
17 decision-making body of the County. As the decision-making body, the Board is charged with the
18 responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the GPU's environmental impacts
19 and granting the various approvals necessary for the GPU.

20 20. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacitics, whether individual,
21 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Defendants and Respondents DOES through 20, inclusive,

22 and therefore sue said parties under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition and
23 Complaint to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 21. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
26 Procedure sections 1085 (alternatively section 1094.5) and 526; and Public Resources Code section
27 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168).

28 22. Venue is proper in Ventura County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil

- 4 .
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Procedure sections 393(b), 394(a) and 395 because Respondents in this action are the County of

2 Ventura and its Board of Supervisors, a local agency, and all the acts and omission occurred in

3 Ventura County.

4 23. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by serving a

5 notice upon the County indicating its intent to file this Petition. Petitioner served the notice on

6 October 13, 2020, and served a supplemental notice on December 17, 2020. Proof of Service of

7 this supplemental notification, with the supplemental notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

8 24. Petitioner has previously elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-
captioned proceeding or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public
10 Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2).

11 25. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

12 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of this Petition to the California
13 Attorney General on October 15, 2020, and served a supplemental notice on December 17, 2020.
14 A copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General with Proof of Service is

15 attached as Exhibit B.

16 26. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action
17 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including, but

18 not limited to, submitting extensive written comments objecting to the certification of the EIR,
19 approval of the GPU and adoption of the Zoning Amendments. All issues raised in the petition for

20 a writ of mandamus were raised before the County by Petitioner, other members of the public, or
21 | public agencies prior to approval of the GPU and the Zoning Amendments.

22 27. This Petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' decision to issue a
23 Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167(c), and the

24 Amended Petition is filed within 35 days of the Respondents' positing of Notices of Exemption for

25 the Zoning Amendments.

26 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the court of ordinary law
27 because Petitioner and its members will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing damage caused by

28 implementation of the GPU, Zoning Amendments, and Respondents' violations of CEQA, as well

- 5 -

1 as other aspects of state law. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain

2 in effect in violation of state law.

3 STATEMENT OF FACTS

4 Lloyd Properties

5 29. The Lloyd family has owned property in Ventura for more than a hundred years and

6 has been an active participant in the community during that time.

7 30. Petitioner and Plaintiff LLOYD PROPERTIES, A CALIFORNIA LIMITED
8 PARTNERSHIP ("Lloyd" or "Petitioner), which was founded by the Lloyd family, was an integral

9 part of establishing the Arroyo Verde Park and the Poinsettia Pavilion in the City of Ventura. More
10 recently, in 2016, Petitioner donated 860 acres of undeveloped land in Ventura County to the

11 Rancho Ventura Conservation Trust. This land will be preserved as open space in perpetuity for
12 the enjoyment of the Ventura community.

13 31. In addition, Petitioner has donated significant sums of money to dozens of charitable
14 organizations in Ventura County that support underprivileged families, education, and the medical
15 | community and the arts. The primary source of funds for these charitable efforts is income derived
16 from oil and gas royalties produced from the Ventura oilfield.

17 32. Petitioner and its predecessor affiliated companies have either extracted oil and gas

18 or leased their rights to other operators who have extracted oil and gas, for more than a hundred
19 years.

20 33. Since 1947, oil and gas exploration and production projects were identified as a

21 "special use" requiring discretionary approval that could only be authorized by the Board of

22 Supervisors following the consideration and advisory recommendation of the Planning
23 | Commission.

24 34. The first discrctionary special use permits' issued for oil and gas operations
25 typically authorized the continuation or expansion of operations which existed before the County

26 adopted its first zoning ordinance and a imposed a permit requirement in 1947. Approximately 60
27

28 Special use permits are the predecessors to the County's CUPs and are sometimes hereinafter referred to as CUPs.

- 6 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

percent of the wells in Ventura County are operated under permits that were first issued between

2 1948 and the end of 1950.

3

4 35. Petitioner is the holder of two so-called "antiquated" special use or conditional use

5 permits ("CUPs"), one issued in 1948 and the other in 1949. CUPs are required to operate an oil

6 and gas exploration and production facility in the unincorporated areas of Ventura County.

7 36. Petitioner's CUPs broadly authorize extraction activities, allowing Petitioner or its

8 lessees to drill and extract oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons in perpetuity on its mineral properties.
9 Petitioner and its predecessor affiliated companies have continuously used its CUPs for more than

10 70 years.

11 37. Petitioner's oil and gas production activities long pre-date issuance of the CUPs, but
12 subsequent to issuance of the CUPs, all operations have been conducted in accordance with their
13 terms and all other applicable regulations.

14 CEQA and General Plans

15 38. California law requires that each county and city in the state develop and adopt a
16 general plan. (Gov. § Code § 65300.) The general plan consists of a statement of development

17 policies and includes : diagram or diagrams and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards,
18 and plan proposals. lt is a comprehensive long-term plan for the physical development of the
19 county or city. In this sense, it is "blueprint" for development.

20 39. By statutc, the general plan is required to be updated "periodically." (Gov. Code

21 § 65103(a).) While there is no requirement for how often to update the general plan, the planning
22 period has traditionally been 15-20 years.

23 40. General plans must include seven elements: land use, transportation, conservation,
24 noise, open space, safety, and housing.

25 41. Because general plans govern the type and location of new development, new or
26 amended general plans may lead to significant changes in the environment. CEQA requires cities

27 and counties to study these potential environmental impacts as part of the adoption or update
28 | process. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378.) Where those impacts may be significant, the city or county

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR"). The primary purpose of an EIR is to inform
2 decision-makers and the public of the potential significant environmental effects of a proposal and
3 possible ways to reduce or avoid any significant environmental effects. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

4 § 15002(a)(1); Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 ["Its
5 purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of
6 their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also
7 informed self-government.'"] emphasis in original, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.

8 Regents of U.C. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) This information is intended to enable environmental
considerations to influence policy development, thereby ensuring that the general plan's policies

10 will address potential environmental impacts and the means to avoid them.

11 County Prepares the Draft EIR and GPU

12 42. The last time the County had updated its General Plan was in 2005. Accordingly,

13 in 2015, the County began the process for updating its General Plan. When originally announced,
14 the update to the General Plan was intended to include an update to the General Plan's Housing

15 Element. However, the County subsequently decided to treat the Housing Element update as a

16 separate, unrelated project, which has procecded concurrently.

17 43. On January 14, 2019, acting as CEQA lead agency, the County of Ventura, Resource
18 Management Agency, Planning Division prepared and distributed a Notice a of Preparation. The

19 purpose of the Notice of Preparation was 1O request that interested persons assist the County by
20| identifying significant environmental issues, mitigation measures, and the range of reasonable
21 alternatives that should be addressed in the EIR.

22 44. a Comments were received at a scoping meeting held at the County Government
23 Center on January 30, 2019, and additional comments were submitted directly to the County.

24 45. The County published a Notice of Availability ("NOA") of the Draft EIR on January

25 9, 2020 announcing that the Draft EIR would be available for public review on January 13, 2020.
26 The purpose of an NOA is to call attention to an EIR and invite interested persons to review and

27 provide comments on significant environmental issues, mitigation measures, and range of

28 reasonable alternatives addressed in the EIR.

8 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 46. On January 13, 2020, the County made the GPU and the Draft EIR available to the
2 public.

3 47. The GPU is comprised of two primary documents: one containing the goals,
4 policies, and implementation programs (sometimes referred to as the "Policy Document"), and a

5 Background Report, which summarizes the County's existing environmental and regulatory setting
6 and describes a wide range of topics including demographics, public facilities, resources, etc.2 The

7 Background Report is also used as the "environmental setting" section for the Draft EIR. (14 Cal.
8 Code Regs. § 15125 [an EIR must describe existing environmental conditions in the vicinity of the
9 proposed project, which is referred to as the "environmental setting" for the project].) The
10 Background Report is over 1,000 pages long.

11 48. There were over 400 new goals, policies, and programs that were added to the GPU.

12 In addition, more than half of the prior 2005 General Plan goals, policies, and programs were carried
13 over into the GPU.

14 49. The GPU contained a set of Oil and Gas Policies that were purportedly included to
15 "effectively and safely manage the exploration, production, and drilling of oil and gas resources in
16 Ventura County" (referred to herein as the "Oil and Gas Policies"). These Oil and Gas Policies
17 include, but are not limited to, the following:

18 COS-7.2 - The County shall require new discretionary oil wells to be located a

19 minimum of 1,500 feet from residential dwellings and 2,500 from any school.

20 COS-7.4 - The County shall require discretionary development for oil and gas

21 exploration and production to use electrically-powered equipment from 100 percent

22 renewable sources and cogeneration, where feasible, to reduce air pollution and

23 greenhouse gas emissions from internal combustion engines and equipment.

24 COS-7.6 - The County shall evaluate discretionary development to identify any

25

26 The County previously published prior draft versions of the Background Report in March 2017, October 2017, and January 2018. The County re-published the Background Report on January 13, 27 2020 with an errata shect that provided details of revisions that were made to the document. Some of the revisions included updates to the Wildfires History Map to reflect wildfires in the County 28 through 2018.

abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site.

2 COS-7.7 - The County shall require new discretionary oil wells to use pipelines to

3 convey oil and produced water; oil and produced water shall not be trucked.

4 COS-7.8 - The County shall require that gases emitted from all new discretionary oil

5 and gas wells shall be collected and used or removed for sale or proper disposal. Flaring

6 or venting shall only be allowed in cases of emergency or for testing purposes.

7 50. However, as alleged herein, the Oil and Gas Policies would have the effect of
8 eliminating oil and gas exploration and production in Ventura through the adoption of these unduly

9 restrictive and unlawful policies.

10 The County Receives Comments on the Draft EIR

11 51. The Draft EIR and GPU were available for public review from January 13, 2020 to
12 February 27, 2020. During the 45-day comment period, letters and email correspondence were

13 received from numerous public agencies, organizations, and individuals. Approximately 314
14 commenters submitted comments during this period. Several of the commenters were companies

15 in the oil and gas industry. The California Department of Conservation, Geologic Energy

16 Management Division ("CalGEM") also submitted comments. These commenters raised numerous
17 concerns with the Draft EIR, including that:

18 a. Several of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies are infeasible or regulate areas

19 preempted by federal or state law. For instance, the greenhouse gas emission analysis relies upon
20 several policics that are preempted by state or federal law, violate existing private property rights,
21 and are simply infeasible.

22 b. For example, Oil and Gas Policies COS-7.7 and 7.8 are preempted, as a local
23| agency cannot eliminate the use of trucking of oil or limit flaring to County-defined instances of

24 "testing" or "emergency." Those activities are governed by state and federal law. Taking credit

25 for such policies that are unlawful or that are infeasible results in an erroneous analysis, not based
26 upon substantial evidence. (See, e.g., Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns. V. City of L.A. (2000)
27 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261 [mitigation measures must be enforceable].) The Draft EIR further
28 failed to adequately consider whether the GPU's individual impacts, when considered in the context

10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

of other projects proposed within the County, the region, and the individual incorporated cities

2 within the County, results in cumulatively considerable environmental impacts. Finally, the Draft
3 EIR ignored the foreseeable adverse impacts associated with large scale installation of oil and gas

4 pipelines, which include soils/geology, hydrology and water quality, cultural and hazards impacts.

5 (See Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 396 [EIR

6 must analyze any action if "it is a reasonable, foreseeable consequence of the [ ] project"].) None
7 of the proposed mitigation measures reduce these potentially significant impacts to less than
8 significant levels.

9 C. The County impermissibly buried the EIR's description of the environmental
10 setting in a 1,000+ page appendix (the Background Report). This impeded the public's ability to

11 fully assess the GPU's significant environmental impacts in contravention of CEQA.

12 d. The Draft EIR further failed to analyze the potentially significant
13  environmental effects that will result from the GPU's unlawful barriers to oil and gas operations.
14 For example, shutting down or severely restricting oil and gas production in Ventura County will
15 increase the state's reliance on foreign oil, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and
16 impact air quality. These impacts will unquestionably occur within the County.

17 e. Finally, the County improperly prepared an EIR before the Housing
18 Element' was completed, which resulted in improper piecemealing and project segmentation.
19 CEQA mandates lead agencies to analyze the "whole of an action" that may result in a direct or
20 rcasonably foreseeable indirect impact. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(a); Tuolumne County Citizens
21 for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222.)

22 52. On February 28, 2020, CalGEM also submitted comments on the Draft EIR.
23 CalGEM commented that the agency already regulates many of the areas that the GPU seeks to
24 regulate. For instance, CalGEM commented that General Plan 6.10 Implementation Program L
25 requires ongoing County evaluation of potential effects from well stimulation treatment and thermal

26
3 Since 1969, the state has mandated that all California cities, towns and counties plan for the 27| housing needs of residents, regardless of income. This state mandate is called the Housing Element and Regional Housing Needs Allocation, or RHNA. (Gov. Code § 65584.) California's local 28 governments meet this requirement by adopting housing plans as part of their general plan.

- 11 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

enhanced recovery, but that CalGEM already oversees well stimulation treatment and underground
2 injection control. CalGEM informed the County that "under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S.

3 Environmental Protection Agency has delegated primacy authority over oil and gas injection wells

4 to the CalGEM [underground injection control] Program." CalGEM further commented that Oil

5 and Gas Policy COS-7.8 requires "gases emitted from all new discretionary oil and gas wells shall

6 be collected and used or removed for sale or proper disposal," but that Public Resources Code

7 section 3300 already declares that "unreasonable waste of natural gas" is unlawful. Finally,

8 CalGEM commented that Oil and Gas Policy COS-7.6 indicates that the County "shall evaluate
9 discretionary development to identify any abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site," but that
10 Public Resources Code section 3208.1 already "establishes well re-abandonment responsibility.
11 when a previously plugged and abandoned well will be impacted by planned property development

12 or construction activities.»

13 53. CalGEM's comments are persuasive given that it has state and federal authority to
14 regulate oil and gas production in the state and is the agency most equipped to implement those
15 regulations.
16 County Publishes the Final EIR

17 54. On July 2, 2020, the County published a Final EIR for public review. The Final EIR

18 identified significant and unavoidable environmental impacts in the following resource areas:
19 Agriculture and Forestry Resources; Air Quality; Biological Resources; Cultural, Tribal, and
20 Paleontological Resources; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and

21 Wildfire; Mineral and Petroleum Resources; Noise and Vibration; Public Services and Recreation;
22 Transportation and Traffic; and Utilities.

23 55. In July 2020, the South Coast Association of Governments adopted the County's
24 Regional Housing Needs Assessment (*RHNA"), which allocates a given portion of California's
25 housing need to the County. The County is obligated to revise its General Plan and Zoning
26 Ordinances to accommodate that growth to the extent that it exceeds the General Plan's
27 assumptions. The County has failed to account for the RHNA in the Project-level or cumulative
28 impact analysis in the EIR.

Planning Commission Holds Public Hearings to Consider Certification of the Final EIR and

2 Adoption of the GPU

3 56. On July 16, 2020, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider and
4 make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding adoption and approval of the GPU

5 and GPU Background Report and certification of the Final EIR. (Planning Division Case Number

6 PL17-0141). In contravention of its obligation to independently review and make a

7 recommendation to the Board of Supervisors regarding the General Plan, the Planning Commission

8 ignored conclusions in the Final EIR recommending additional mitigation measures to reduce

9 impacts to mineral and petroleum resources. Instead, the Planning Commission approved the
10 General Plan policies previously proposed by the Board of Supervisors. The Planning Commission

11 ultimately made these recommendations to the Board of Supervisors in advance of their public
12 hearing scheduled for September 1, 2020.

13 57. On September 1, 2020, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to consider
14 the County's recommendation. Throughout the process, the County failed to conduct meaningful

15 public outreach, by providing newly published documents shortly before hearings, failing to
16 identify changes that were made, spreading necessary information among numerous appendices,
17 and failing to provide documents that were translated into Spanish. During the hearing, the Board

18 of Supervisors introduced new policies that substantially modified the General Plan, and that were
19 not previously considered by the Planning Commission. The Board of Supervisors subsequently
20 continued the public hearing to September 15, 2020. The Board of Supervisors did not accept

21 public comment during the September 15 public hearing.

22 58. During the September 15, 2020 public hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted to
23 certify the Final EIR and adopt the GPU, as modified by the Board. The Board of Supervisors

24 signed the Notice of Determination on September 15, 2020 and filed it with the Governor's Office
25 of Planning & Research, State Clearinghouse on September 16, 2020.

26 59. The GPU takes effect 30 days after the Board of Supervisors adoption.

27 Accordingly, the GPU will take effect on or about October 15, 2020.

28 The Adoption of the NCZO and CZO Zoning Amendments

- 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 60. Zoning amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County Non-
2 Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Ventura County

3 Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("CZO") were adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 10,

4 2020.

5 61. The County's recent adoption of the Zoning Amendments began with allegations of
6 a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyon area purportedly caused by oil and gas
7 exploration and production operations. According to the County Resource Management Agency,

8 on February 25, 2019, the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) reported that it had allegedly
9 found indications that petroleum-related gases were migrating into the Fox Çanyon aquifer system

10 in the vicinity of existing oil wells utilizing cyclic steam injection.

11 62. Accordingly, the Resource Management Agency recommended that the Board of

12 Supervisors direct the Planning Division to return to the Board with a proposed interim ordinance

13 pursuant to Government Code section 65858 to temporarily prohibit the County's approval of new

14 oil and gas wells, and re-drilling of existing oil and gas wells, for oil production that will utilize
15 steam injection in the vicinity of potable groundwater aquifers while the County studies potential

16 regulations for this land use. The Resource Management Agency further recommended that the
17 Board of Supervisors direct the Planning Division to also study potential amendments to the
18 County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new development under long-term
19 oil and gas permits. These recommendations were placed on the Board of Supervisors' agenda as

20 Agenda Itcm 46 for the Board's April 9, 2019 regular public meeting.

21 63. At the conclusion of the April 9, 2019 regular public meeting, the Board approved
22 both recommendations.

23 64. On April 23, June 4, and November 5, 2019, the Board approved and then extended
24 the proposed interim urgency ordinance prohibiting County approval of new oil wells, and the re-
25 drilling of existing wells, that would utilize steam injection on a portion of the Oxnard Plan
26 overlying the Fox Canyon aquifer that was the subject of the USGS study. The interim urgency
27 ordinance was intended to remain in effect until December 7, 2020, unless terminated sooner by

28 the Board.

- 14 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 65. The Board took these actions even though the purported concerns regarding

2 allegations of a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyoner area were conclusively proven
3 false by the County itself. In a Technical Memorandum, dated May 16, 2019, and revised October

4 29, 2019, Dan Tormey, of Catalyst Environmental Solutions, the County's expert consultant for oil

5 and gas issues, stated that the USGS groundwater monitoring results "do not indicate that oil and

6 gas operations have impacted groundwater quality." And, furthermore, Catalyst "did not identify
7 ongoing threats to the groundwater quality" from oil and gas activities.

8 66. Nevertheless, in response to the Board's direction to study potential amendments to
9 the County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new development under long-
10 term oil and gas permits, County Counsel, in consultation with the Planning Division, provided the

11 Board with a written report that was the subject of Item 3 of the Board's September 10, 2019 regular
12 public meeting. The report states, among other things, that the County can legally require
13 discretionary approval and environmental review of proposed new oil and gas production facilities

14 on land covered by long-term permits, and that the County can, in general, apply its oil development

15 standards to all existing oil and gas production facilities.

16 67. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors directed staff to study potential
17 amendments to the NCZO on April 9, 2019. (July 2020 Staff Report for PL20-0052.)

18 68. A potential draft amendment to the NCZO with this language was attached to the
19 September 10, 2019 staff report. At the conclusion of the September 10, 2019 item, the Board
20 directed "the Planning Division to prepare draft amendments to the County's zoning ordinances

21 that are consistent with the potential draft amendment attached to the County Counsel report to be

22 processed through the standard land use public hearing process." (July 2020 Staff Report for PL20-
23 0052.)

24 69. The draft EIR regarding the GPU was published in January 2020; the Planning

25 Commission held a public meeting considering the GPU on July 16, 2020. This meeting was just

26 two weeks before the Planning Commission held a public meeting considering the Zoning
27 Amendments on July 30, 2020.

28 70. On July 30, 2020, the County Planning Commission considered the Zoning

- 15 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Amendments at a public hearing. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the

2 Planning Commission should recommend that the Board: (1) adopt, not adopt, or adopt with
3 modification the Zoning Amendments; (2) find that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from

4 CEQA; and (3) find that the Zoning Amendments are consistent with the goals, policies, and

5 programs of the Ventura County General Plan, the Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the

6 Coastal Act.

7 71. The Zoning Amendments modify requirements for discretionary permitting for

8 certain new oil and gas exploration and production operations. The Zoning Amendments will
9 require discretionary permitting approval for all new oil and gas exploration and production

10 operations, or for new wells, structures that are currently subject to the terms of existing permits.

11 72. The Zoning Amendments included three major substantive changes to the NCZO

12 and CZO. They amend NCZO section 8107-5.2 and CZO section 8175-5.7.2, to require the
13 issuance of a new discretionary CUP, or approval of a discretionary permit adjustment or
14 modification, to authorize all new oil and gas development, including activities previously allowed
15 under existing permits, unless the proposed development is specifically described under an existing
16 discretionary permit. New development triggering the need for discretionary approval includes,
17 but is not limited to, the installation of new wells, tanks and other oil field facilities, and the re-

18 drilling or deepening of existing wells. Because these approvals would require a discretionary
19 permit the County would subject the projects to environmental review under CEQA.

20 73. In addition, the Zoning Amendments amend NCZO 8107-5.2 and CZO 8175-5.7.2,
21 to state that the County's current oil development design guidelines and operational standards
22 uniformly apply to all oil and gas exploration and production operations to the extent: (1) such
23 guidelines and standards would impose more stringent requirements than those set forth in existing
24 permit conditions, laws, or regulations applicable to the operation; and (2) application of such
25 guidelines and standards would not impair any vested right of an operator under California law.

26 74. The Zoning Amendments also amend NCZO section 8107-5.4 and CZO section
27 8175-5.7.5, to state that improvements that are the subject of a zoning clearance must be developed

28 within 180 days of permit issuance.

- 16 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 75. As a result, the Zoning Amendments drastically alter the requirements for oil and
2 gas development in Ventura County.

3 76. In addition, by altering the activities that would require a CUP, the Zoning
4 Amendments fundamentally expand the operations subject to the GPU.

5 77. A Planning Commission Staff Report drafted by County Counsel in advance of the
6 July 30, 2020 Planning Commission hearing determined that the NCZO amendment was exempt
7 from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 (the 8 Class 8 Exemption) as an action

8 taken by a regulatory agency, as authorized by state or local ordinance, "to assure the maintenance,
restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves

10 procedures for protection of the environment." The Planning Division staff further determined that

11 no "unusual circumstances" or other exceptions set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2

12 prelude use of this categorical exemption.

13 78. In addition, Planning Commission Staff Report stated that the CZO amendment was

14 exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9, which exempts local

15 governments from preparing an EIR or other CEQA document in connection with an amendment
16 to a Local Coastal Program ("LCP"). Instead, the LCP amendment must be certified by the
17 California Coastal Commission and is subject to Coastal Commission review for compliance with

18 the Coastal Act of 1972.

19 79. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors held a public meeting to consider
20 adopting the Planning Commission's recommendations on the Zoning Amendments.

21 80. An agenda for the Board of Supervisors' meeting was posted on the County's
22 website in advance of the meeting. The proposed actions regarding the Zoning Amendments
23 appeared as Agenda Item 47 on the Board's Agenda.

24 81. Agenda Item 47 contained several supporting materials, including a "Board Letter"
25 from the County Resource Management Agency, which contained certain recommended actions,
26 including that the Board: (1) find that the NCZO is exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines
27 section 15308 and no unusual circumstances or any other exception set forth in CEQA Guidelines
28 section 15300.2 applies; (2) find that the CZO is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources

- 17 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Code section 21080.9 as an amendment to the County's LCP; (3) find that the Zoning Amendments

2 are consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the Ventura County General Plan, the
3 Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the Coastal Act; (4) adopt the NCZO amendments; and (5)

4 adopt the CZO amendments subject to Coastal Commission certification.

5 82. During this November 10, 2020 meeting, the Supervisors discussed an updated

6 Board Letter which asserted "it is appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of those

7 policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for
8 the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments. Notably, a summary of this updated
recommendation was not included in the Agenda posted on the County's website in advance of the
10 November 10 Board meeting. The Agenda did not cite or refer to the EIR for the GPU or CEQA

11 Guidelines section 15162. In addition, as the clerk had conceded, the County had not circulated
12 the revised Board Letter to the public prior to or during the November 10 meeting. The revised
13 Board Letter was subsequently uploaded to the County's website embedded in a hyperlink to

14 Agenda Item 47 after the November 10 meeting had already concluded. The County therefore
15 failed to notify the public of this proposed finding in advance of the November 10 meeting.

16 83. The Supervisors voted 3-2 to approve Agenda Item 47 regarding the adoption of the
17 Zoning Amendments.

18 84. The Notices of Exemption for the NCZO and CZO were filed on November 13,
19 2020.

20 Respondents Have Impaired Petitioner's Vested Rights Without Finding Any Nuisance

21 85. The doctrine of vested rights seeks to protect property owners and developers who
22 | have substantially relied on past permits and proceeded accordingly with the government's
23 acknowledgement. The doctrine protects permit holder's right not only to construct, but also to

24 use the premises as authorized by the permit. (County of San Diego v. McClurken (1951) 37 Cal.2d

25 683, 691.)

26 86. Ventura County has historically recognized producers' existing permits as creating

27

28 Ventura County Resource Management Agency, revised letter to Board of Supervisors, Nov. 10, 2020, p 3.

18 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

vested rights to continue the production of oil and gas. (County Counsel's 2014 Office
2 Memorandum regarding Legal Analysis of Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits.)

3 87. Petitioner has a fully vested right in the continuation of oil and gas production in
4 Ventura County, including a vested right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced
5 from its leased mineral properties. These vested rights are consistent with long-established plans,
6| including Petitioner's vested rights in its CUPs, which Petitioner has relied on for decades and
7 broadly authorize extraction activities on its mineral properties in perpetuity.

8 88. Petitioner's vested rights may not be abridged absent due process and a finding of
9 nuisance or payment of adequate compensation. (See Trans-Oceanic Oil Corp. v. Santa Barbara

10 (1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 776, 789.)

11 89. The County has not found that any of the oil and gas operations on Petitioner's

12 properties constitute a nuisance. To the contrary, at all times relevant herein, the continued
13 operations and drilling at Petitioner's properties have occurred lawfully, in compliance with its
14 CUPs, and in a manner that does not create harm or a nuisance to Jocal communities. As these
15 operations are not a nuisance, there can be no impairment of Petitioner's vested rights.

16 90. Accordingly, Petitioner's longstanding and fully vested rights prevent the County
17 from prohibiting activities already authorized by Petitioner's CUPs on the basis of the policies set
18 forth in the GPU and Zoning Amendments. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies would have the effect
19 not only of shutting down business that has mutually benefitted the County for over a century and
20 helped transform the County into a prosperous and vibrant place to live and work, but also of
21  terminating the right to produce oil - an extraordinarily valuable resource that reduces the need for
22 California to rely on foreign oil resources, which are much more carbon-intensive. The Zoning
23 Amendments, which implement the GPU Oil and Gas Policies, compound the effects of the GPU

24 by altering the definition of discretionary permits and widening the range of activities requiring a

25 CUP.

26 91. As just one example, one of the GPU policies prohibits trucks from transporting oil
27 produced from new wells (even when a CUP is in place). This will prevent Petitioner's lessees
28 from transporting oil to market when pipelines malfunction or need repairs, and would therefore

- 19 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

prevent Petitioner from collecting its royalties. No other industry has been singled out for such a

2 requirement of alternative transport.

3 92. Petitioner is a named permittee or leases its properties' mineral rights pursuant to
4 | long-term permits, which generally authorize operators to use specifically-described parcels of land

5 for "drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and installing, and
6 using, buildings, equipment and other appurtenances accessory thereto...." Unless subsequently
7 modified, these permits did not contain expiration dates or specifically identify the location or

8 number of wells that could be drilled on the permitted permit. Thus, once vested, these permits
9 authorize the continued drilling of new wells and installation of accessory facilities, and cannot be
10 unilaterally modified or cancelled without a showing of nuisance. These permits provide Petitioner
11 a with a vested right to pursue oil and gas development in the County.

. 12 93. The Zoning Amendments require that new oil and gas development must be
13 specifically identified or authorized by discretionary CUP, regardless of whether an existing CUP
14 broadly authorizes oil and gas development activities.

15 94. According to the Zoning Amendments, a new oil and gas exploration and production
16 operation, or component thereof, triggering the need for a new discretionary approval would
17 | include, but is not limited to, the installation of any permanent structure, the drilling of new wells,
18 and the re-drilling or deepening of existing wells, which are all currently subject to ministerial
19 rather than discretionary approvals under the long-term permits.

20 95. The Zoning Amendments also provide that the County's current oil development

21 design guidelines and operational standards uniformly apply to all oil and gas exploration and

22 production operations. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the County

23 intends to apply these new standards to existing wells and operations.

24 96. All of these amendments violate the established law of vested rights.

25 97. Subjecting long-term permits to discretionary approval for any new operation will

26 unlawfully impair the constitutionally protected vested property rights of the holders of such

27 permits. Indeed, the Zoning Amendments contradict the County Counsel's own legal
28 memorandum, in which it concluded that the County's "ability to impose new conditions on

• 20 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 antiquated oilfield permits is very limited. Because of the vested rights doctrine and constitutional

2 protections afforded to these permits, the County can impose new, narrowly tailored conditions on
3 these permits only when a compelling public necessity, such as danger, harm or public nuisance,

4 07 significant violations exist, and not through an ordinary exercise of the police power for the

5 general welfare.": (County Counsel's 2014 Office Memorandum regarding Legal Analysis of
6 Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits, emphasis added.) The County also previously

7 recognized that "when a conditional use permit has been issued and relied upon by the permittee,

8 giving rise to a vested right, the permit becomes immunized from impairment and revocation by
9 subsequent government action." (Id., emphasis added.)

10 98. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that, given the County's

11 history of delaying action on or rejecting new permit approvals, the requirement to obtain a new a
12 discretionary permit from the County prior to any new oil and gas exploration or production
13 operation is fundamentally equivalent to precluding Petitioner from conducting these operations.

14 99. Petitioner has performed substantial work and incurred substantial liabilities in

15 operating under its existing permits, investing in and installing infrastructure and equipment for the
16 oil-producing properties at issue with the expectation that additional wells could be drilled.

17 100. In the alternative, the "diminishing asset doctrine" applies, which permits oil and

18 gas operators and others in extractive industries to exhaust the mineral value of their property. This
19 doctrine was approved by the California Supreme Court in Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v.
20 Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 557-558.

21 101. Petitioner's reasonable, investment-based expectation was that its lessees would
22 continue to produce and develop oil and gas until Petitioner's oil and gas producing properties were
23 no longer capable of producing oil and gas in commercial quantities. There has been no delay in
24 utilizing Petitioner's CUPs - in fact, they have been continuously used for more than 70 years
25 and there are many years of oil and minerals yet to be extracted from Petitioner's properties. Yet
26 the County intends to prohibit the oil and gas operations on Petitioner's properties by way of the
27 GPU and Zoning Amendments. Respondents' actions will have the direct result of substantially
28 diminishing Petitioner's reasonable investment-backed expectations.

- 21 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

102. Petitioner has clearly exhibited an intent to continue leasing its properties for the
2 development and production of its oil and gas resources throughout the extent of its properties. The

3 continued development of these resources is progression of the extractive activity into all areas

4 of Petitioner's mineral estates as authorized by its CUPS.

103. Principles of vested rights require that the County eliminate the policies that
6 abrogate Petitioner's longstanding and established rights under its CUPs.

7 Inverse Condemnation

8 104. Petitioner is the owner of several mineral estates where its interest in certain parcels
of land is mineral rights or overriding royalty interests. Petitioner's CUPs allow Petitioner or its

10 lessee to drill and extract oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons in perpetuity on its mineral properties.

I1 These oil and gas fields have substantial value, which will be substantially lost as a result of the
12 GPU and Zoning Amendments.

13 105. By purporting to (1) eliminate Petitioner's and its lessees' vested rights to continue

14 and to complete the development and production of their oil and gas resources within the County,
15 (2) eliminate Petitioner's vested right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from

16 its mineral properties, and (3) prevent all future oil and gas operations in the County, the GPU and
17 the Zoning Amendments, both separately and combined, effect a per se taking of and/or damage to

18 Petitioner's and its lessees' property, without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth

19 Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, section 19 of the California
20 Constitution.

21 106. The vested rights rule is grounded upon the constitutional principle that a vested
22 right is a property right which may not be taken without due process of law or just compensation.
23 (Urban Renewal Agency v. Cal. Coasta Zone Conservation Com. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 577, 583-84.)

24 107. In the alternative, application of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and the Zoning
25 Amendments effect a taking of Petitioner's property under the principles of Penn Central

26 Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978) 438 U.S. 104. (ld. at p. 138 n. 6.) The adoption of the
27 GPU Oil and Gas Policies eliminates substantially all economically viable use of Petitioner's
28 mineral rights within the County for the benefit of the public without prior compensation to

22 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- Petitioner. Furthermore, the County eliminated the vested rights contained in Petitioner's long-term
2 permits which previously allowed for the drilling, re-drilling or deepening of new wells and related
3 operations. This action prevents Petitioner from utilizing the resources that it is currently legally

4 permitted to pursue. The adoption of the Zoning Amendments will eliminate substantially all
5 economically viable operations under Petitioner's existing permits. (See, e.g., Lucas v. S.C. Coastal
6 Council (1992) 505 U.S. 1003.)

7 108. Petitioner's interests in its oil and gas fields within the County have substantial
8 value, which will be substantially lost as a result of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning
9 Il Amendments.

10 109.

11 The County disputes Petitioner's contention and intends to prohibit oil and gas

12 operations by way of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies or the Zoning Amendments.

110. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies is
13 necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that will

14 result from applying the GPU Policies to oil and gas production operations by Petitioner and the
15 resulting damages.

16 111. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the Zoning Amendments is also
17 necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that will
18 result from applying the Zoning Amendments to oil and gas production operations by Petitioner
19 and the resulting damages.

20 112. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments will force Petitioner to bear
21 public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23

24 Violations of CEQA - Inadequate EIR

25 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

113.

26 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
though fully set forth herein.

27 114. CEQA is a comprehensive statute designed to provide for long-term protection of
28 the environment. It accomplishes this in two ways. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision-

• 23 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

makers and the public about the potential significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal.

2 Code Regs. § 15002(a)(1).) Such disclosure ensures that "long term protection of the environment
shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code § 21001(d).)

115. Second, CEQA directs public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage
5 whenever feasible by requiring chang in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation
6 measures. (See 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15002(a)(2) and (3); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
7 Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of
8 the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 400.) Consequently, an EIR must identify
9 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives in order to substantially lessen or avoid otherwise

10 significant environmental effects. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a); 14 Cal. Code Regs.

11 § 15126.4(a).)

12 116. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
13 manner required by law by certifying and relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of

14 CEQA.

15 117. Inadequate Project Description. CEQA requires that the EIR include an accurate
16 project description, and that the nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly
17 evaluated in the EIR. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

18 informative and legally sufficient EIR.' However, "[a] curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project
19 description draws a red herring across the path of public input.™ (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Ctr.
20 County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 655 [quoting County of Inyo v. City of L.A. (1977)

21 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 199, 197-98].)

22 118. The EIR fails to provide a legally a adequate project description. For example, the
23 EIR's project description is impermissibly vague; fails to identify where new land use designations

24 will be applied; fails to identify and describe the policies adopted by the GPU in adequate levels of
25 detail; fails to describe what each new GPU element will actually accomplish; fails to identify what

26 buildout of the plan area would be; and excludes any meaningful description of the implementation

27 measures, actions, and programs necessary to carry out the GPU.

28 119. Failure to Properly Describe the Environmental Setting. CEQA and its

- 24 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

implementing guidelines require that an EIR "include a description of the physical environmental
2 l conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is

3 published.. from both a local and regional perspective. This environmental setting will normally

4 constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact

5 is significant." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(a).)

6 120. The baseline is the starting point from which to measure whether an impact may be
7 environmentally significant. The baseline must thus accurately depict "real conditions on the

8 ground," not hypothetical or merely allowable conditions. (Communities for a Better Env't v. South

9 Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 321 [quoting Save Our Peninsula
10 Committee v. Monterey County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 121].)

11 121. The EIR's description of the environmental setting and baseline is inadequate and
12 inaccurate, including its description of existing environmental conditions concerning air quality,
13 aesthetics, biological resources, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, geologic hazards, hazards and
14 hazardous materials, land use, mineral and petroleum resources, and population and housing,

15 122. The EIR impermissibly buries description of the existing environmental and
16 regulatory setting in the 1,000+ page Background Report appendix, in direct contravention of
17 CEQA's mandate. "[I]nformation 'scattered here and there in EIR appendices,' or a report 'buried

18 in an appendix,' is not a substitute for a 'good faith, reasoned analysis . . '" (California Oak
19 Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1239, quoting Santa Clarita

20 Organization for Planning V. County of L.A., 106 Cal.App.4th 715, 722, 723.) Even the

21 Background Report appended to the Draft EIR fails to adequately describe existing environmental

22 and regulatory conditions.

23 123. Moreover, the EIR's description of the environmental setting cannot be any longer
24 than necessary to provide an understanding of the significant effects of the project and the
25 alternatives analyzed in the EIR. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(a).) The description of the
26 environmental setting is over 1,000 pages long and far exceeds what is necessary to understand the

27 project's significant effects.

28 124. Failure to Adequately Analyze and Disclose the GPU's Significant

- 25 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 Environmental Impacts and Support Conclusions Regarding Environmental Impacts with
2 Substantial Evidence. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

3 environmental effects; each such effect must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Res.

4 Code § 21002.1, 21100(b); 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.2(s).) Significant effect on the environment

5 refers to substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse changes in physical conditions. (Pub. Res.
6 Code §§ 21060.6, 21068, 21100(d).) The CEQA Guidelines further require that in discussing the
7 environmental effects of a project, an EIR should contain "a sufficient degree of analysis to provide
8 decisionmakers with information which enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes
9 account of environmental consequences." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15151.) CEQA requires that
10 substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of the EIR's conclusions.

11 125. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately analyze

12 and disclose the GPU's environmental impacts and fails to support conclusions regarding
13 environmental impacts with substantial evidence, this includes but is not limited to:

14 a. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose air quality impacts, especially
15 impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies. In addition, the EIR
16 fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted by state or federal law, violate existing
17 private property rights, and are infeasible. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the

18 GPU's air quality impacts associated with favoring imported oil over oil produced in Ventura
19 County, which will deteriorate air quality in the region.

20 b. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose impacts on biological resources,
21 including impacts related to wildlife nursery sites, habitat conservation plans, and natural
22 community conservation plans.

23 C. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose impacts on energy, including
24 failure to qualitatively cvaluate whether the GPU will result in inefficient and wasteful energy
25 consumption, and whether the GPU will conflict with state or local plans.

26 d. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts on
27 greenhouse gas emissions, especially impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil
28 and Gas Policies. In addition, the EIR fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted

26 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

by state or federal law, violate existing private property rights, and are infeasible. The EIR fails to
2 acknowledge, calculate, and disclose the increased greenhouse gas emissions that would result from
3 the loss of Ventura County crude development opportunities. The EIR also incorrectly analyzes

4 and calculates greenhouse gas emissions generated by the oil and gas industry, while failing to

5 properly analyze and disclose greenhouse emissions from stationary sources in non-oil and gas

6 industrial sectors, including emissions from paper mills.

7 e. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's hazards and
8 hazardous materials impacts. The EIR fails to support with substantial evidence the conclusion

9 that Policies HAZ-5.2, HAZ 5.5, HAZ-5.8, and HAZ 7.1 and County Implementation Programs K
10  and L will reduce impacts to less than significant levels.

11 f. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts on hydrology

12 and water quality, including failure to support its conclusions regarding water quality and
13  overdraft with substantial evidence.

14 g. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts on land use,
15 including the Housing Element. The EIR fails to account for the actual growth for which the
16 County must plan. The EIR also failed to consider the Housing Element in its cumulative impact
17 analysis, despite its concurrent development and foresceable content.

18 h. Failure to adequately disclose and analyze the GPU's impacts to mineral
19 and petroleum resources, especially impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil
20 and Gas Policies. In addition, the EIR fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted

21 by state or federal law, violate existing private property rights, impair vested rights (including
22 Petitioner's vested rights to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its properties),
23 and are infeasible.

24 i. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts associated

25 with noise and vibration, including failure to support with substantial evidence the conclusion that

26 oil supply facilities are major industrial sources of noise. The EIR's assessment of operational
27 noise fails to analyze or disclose the potential significant increases in traffic associated with the

28 new RHNA allocation in the region and state housing legislation and policies.

- 27 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

j. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts associated
2 with population and housing, including by improperly splitting off the Housing Element Update
3 (causing piecemealing of the CEQA analysis) and failing to consider the RHNA housing allocation
4 announced by SCAG. The EIR also fails to analyze the housing impacts that will result from the

5 setback requirements under Policy COS-7.2.

6 k. Failure to adequately analyze or disclose the GPU's cumulative impacts
7 related to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, traffic, aesthetics, mineral and petroleum
8 resources, and biological impacts among others. The County also failed to analyze or disclose the

9 GPU's cumulative impacts by impermissibly piecemealing its analysis in the EIR. The purpose

10 of the cumulative impacts analysis is to avoid considering projects in a vacuum, because failure to

11 consider cumulative harm may risk environmental disaster. (Whitman v. Bd. of Supervisors (1979)
12 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 408.) Without this cumulative analysis, piecemeal approval of several projects
13 with related impacts will lead to severe environmental harm. (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue
14 Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 720.) In addition to the Housing Element
15 Update, the County has impermissibly piecemealed and segmented the GPU from its concurrent
16 Zoning Code text amendments to Article 7. Section 8107-5 of the Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance,

17 and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Coastal Zoning Ordinance. Those amendments modify
18 permitting requirements for new oil and gas exploration and production operations and will require
19 discretionary approvals for new oil and gas activities undertaken in reliance on so-called
20 "antiquated permits." The EIR expressly anticipates those amendments to the Zoning Code, yet
21 the County has made no effort to analyze the foreseeable impacts of implementing the zoning
22 amendments, including cumulative impacts, which will severely curtail oil and gas production in
23 the County and impair Petitioner's vested rights. The County's improper piecemealing has further

24 deprived the public of its right to informed review of the EIR and GPU.

25 126. Failure to Adopt Feasible Mitigation Measures. An EIR must propose and
26 describe mitigation measures to minimize the significant environmental effects identified in the

27 EIR. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002.1(a), 21100(b)(3); 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.4.) The requirement
28 that EIRs identify mitigation measures implements CEQA's policy that agencies adopt feasible

- 28 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 measures when approving a project to reduce or avoid its significant environmental effects. (Pub.
2 Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a).) "Feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in a successful
3 manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal,

4 social, and technological factors."* (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15364.)

5 127. Respondents failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce potentially
6 significant environmental effects.

7 128. The EIR fails to adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to mineral
8 and petroleum resources, including but not limited to the loss of availability of known petroleum
9 resources that are of value to the region, County, and residents of the state and precluding access

10 to those resources. Respondents admit that impacts to mineral and petroleum resources, including

11 impacts caused by the Oil and Gas Policies, will be significant but fail to adopt feasible mitigation
12 measures to reduce those impacts to less than significant levels.

13 129. Respondents conclude that proposed mitigation measures to reduce impacts to
14 mineral and petroleum resources are infeasible but fail to support those conclusions with substantial
15 evidence.

16 130. The EIR further fails to adopt feasible measures to mitigate greenhouse gas

17 emissions and air quality impacts, including impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's
18 Oil and Gas Policies.

19 131. Adoption of Inadequate and Infeasible Mitigation Measures. An EIR must
20 describe feasible mitigation measures that could minimize the project's significant adverse impacts.

21 (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.4(a)(L).) Lead agencies must avoid remote, ineffective, and
22 speculative mitigation measures. (Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns., supra, 83 Cal.App.4th

23 at p. 1260.) Moreover, it is ordinarily inappropriate to defer formulation of a mitigation measure
24  to the future. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.4(a)(1)(b).) Respondents have adopted inadequate and
25 infeasible mitigation measures.

26 132. The EIR fails to disclose and consider that several mitigation measures are infeasible
27 because they are preempted by federal, state, and/or local law and/or cannot be carried out without
28 unlawfully impairing vested property rights and cannot be enforced. (See, e.g., Federation of

29 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 Hillside & Canyon Assns., supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 1261 [mitigation measures must be
2 enforceable].)

3 133. Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments. A CEQA lead agency must
4  evaluate comments on environmental issues received from persons who reviewed and commented

5 on the EIR during the public comment period, and the CEQA lead agency must prepare written

6 responses to such comments. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088(a).) The written response must describe
7 the disposition of significant environmental issues raised. (Id., § 15088(c).) When the CEQA lead

8 agency's position is at variance with recommendations and objections raised in the comments, the
9 responses to comments must address such recommendations and objections in detail, and the

10 responses must explain why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. (Id.)

11 Conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will not suffice. (Id.)

12 134. The public, including Petitioner, submitted numerous comments to the County

13 throughout the environmental review process. Yet, the County either ignored these comments or
14 glossed over their substance with conclusory responses. For example, the County failed to
15  adequately address comments regarding issues of preemption related to the Oil and Gas Policies,
16  impairment of vested rights, and the infeasibility of various policies, alternatives, mitigation
17 measures, and goals.

18 135. Failure to Recirculate the EIR. CEQA requires that if significant new information

19 is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended
20 EIR must be recirculated for public review and comment. (Pub. Res. Code § 21092.1; 14 Cal. Code

21 Regs. § 15088.5; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007)

22 40 Cal..4th 412, 414.)

23 136. Respondents failed to recirculate the Draft EIR despite inclusion of significant new
24 information in the Final EIR. For example, the County included new oil and gas information, data,

25 calculations, and analyses. The County also included significant new information regarding the

26 greenhouse gas inventory and forecast.

27 137. Recirculation is further required because the EIR omitted key information necessary

28 to determine what the GPU's potentially significant impacts would be. (Mountain Lion Coalition

- 30 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

F v. Fish & Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043, 1046-47.)

2 138. Respondents have also failed to revise the EIR to add missing required information,

3 address legal deficiencies, and correct false and unsupported impact analyses. Accordingly, the

4 EIR is fundamentally flawed and must be recirculated. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088.5.)

5 139. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, the EJR is legally
6 defective and Respondents have failed to comply with CEQA's procedural requirements. By

7 certifying an EIR that failed to comply with CEQA's mandates, Respondents committed a

8 prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and acted without
9 substantial evidentiary support. Accordingly, the Court should issue a writ of mandamus directing
10 Respondents to set aside certification of the EIR and approval of the GPU.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Violations of CEQA - Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings

13 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

14 140. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
15 though fully set forth herein.

16 141. CEQA requires that alead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
17 supported by substantial evidence in the record. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15091.) CEQA further
18 requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the
19 conclusions it has reached. As a result of the inadequacies in the environmental analysis identified
20 above, the findings adopted by Respondents are not supported by substantial evidence as required

21 by CEQA.

22 142. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
23  law as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the
24 following:

25 a. Findings supporting the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

26 b. Findings that recirculation of the Draft EIR was not required.

27 C. Findings that proposed mitigation measures and alternatives to the GPU that

28 would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the GPU were

- 31 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 infeasible.

2 d. Findings that certain environmental impacts would be less than significant

3 or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the GPU'S

4 significant effects on the environment.

5 143. Respondents' findings fail to reflect the independent judgment of Respondents.

6 144. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents
7 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and
8 acted without substantial evidentiary support by making determinations or adopting findings that
9 do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the GPU in reliance thereon.
10 Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final EIR and approval of the GPU must be set

11 aside.

12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Violation of CEQA - Improper Use of Categorical Exemption

14 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

15 145. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
16 though fully set forth herein.

17 146. Respondents a committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

18 the manner required by law in filing a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the NCZO amendments

19 and failing to prepare an initial study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze,
20 disclose, and mitigate significant environmental impacts from the NCZO amendments prior to

21 approving them.

22 147. The NCZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code
23 § 21065; Guidelines § 15378(a).)

24 148. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the NCZO amendments are
25 categorically cxempt from environmental review under CEQA based on the Class 8 Exemption.

26 which applies to "actions taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance,

27 to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the
28 regulatory process involves procedures for the protection of the environment."

32 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

149. The Class 8 exemption does not apply to the NCZO amendments because the Board

2 of Supervisors is a legislative body, not a regulatory agency.

3 150. The Class 8 exemption is also inapplicable because the NCZO amendments will

4 have significant effects on the environment, including impacts to mineral resources and greenhouse

5 gas emissions. The NCZO amendments will broaden the applicability of the GPU Oil and Gas

6 Policies, which the Final EIR for the GPU found will have significant and unavoidable effects on

7 the environment. Thus, the Final EIR for the GPU itself provides substantial evidence that the
8 INCZO amendments will have significant effects on the environment.
9 151. At all times relevant herein, Respondents knew or should have known that
10 substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the Class 8 Exemption is inapplicable to the

11 NCZO amendments for the reasons stated herein.

12 152. Under Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used
13 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect
14 on the environment due to unusual circumstances." The Class 8 Exemption claimed by

15 Respondents for the NCZO amendments cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section

16 15300.2(c), because the NCZO amendments present unusual circumstances, and there is a
17 reasonable possibility that a significant environmental impact will result from those unusual
18 circumstances, including impacts to greenhouse gas emissions and mineral resources.

19 153. Further, the Class 8 Exemption claimed by Respondents for the NCZO amendments
20 cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) because NCZO amendments in

21 conjunction with the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will have a cumulatively significant impact on the
22 environment, including on mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.

23 154. Moreover, since the County has not produced any evidence that the NCZO

24 amendments will have no adverse effect on the environment, the County "cannot say with certainty
25  'there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the
26 environment.'" (California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality Management

27 Dist., (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1245-1246, citing Dunn-Edwards Corp, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th

28 at p. 658.)

- 33 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

155. For the foregoing reasons, the exception provided in CEQA Guidelines sections
2 15300.2(b) and 15300.2(c) applies.

3 156. Respondents have failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA

4 Guidelines prior to approving the NCZO amendments.

5 157. Respondents' actions in adopting the NCZO amendments without full compliance
6 with the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of

7 discretion. Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the NCZO
8 amendments further constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner

9 required by law. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.)

10 158. Petitioner performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and
11 has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

12 159. As the NCZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines
13 section 15308, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare an initial
14 study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines § 15063(a); San
15 Lorenzo, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1373.) Respondents failed to comply with these legal
16 requirements because the County did not prepare an initial study in connection with its approval of

17 the NCZO amendments or otherwise conduct any environmental review under CEQA prior to its
18 approval of the NCZO amendments.

19 160. For the foregoing reasons, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding
20 Respondents to rescind their action approving the NCZO amendments, until such time as

21 Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Violation of CEQA - Improper Use of Statutory Exemption

24 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

25 161. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
26 though fully sct forth herein.

27 162. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

28 the manner required by law in filing a NOE for the CZO amendments and failing to prepare an

- 34 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

initial study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze, disclose, and mitigate
2 significant environmental impacts from the CZO amendments prior to approving them.

3 163. The CZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code §
4 21065; Guidelines § 15378(a).)

5 164. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the CZO amendments are

6 statutorily exempt from environmental review pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9

7 as an amendment to an LCP.

8 165. The statutory exemption under Public Resources Code section 21080.9 does not

9 apply because the CZO amendments do not constitute amendments to an LCP.

10 166. Respondents' actions in adopting the CZO amendments without full compliance

1I with the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of

12 discretion. Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the CZO
13 amendments further constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner
14| required by law. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.)

15 167. Petitioner performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and
16 has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

17 168. As the CZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under Public Resources Code

18 section 21080.9, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare an
19 initial study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines § 15063(a);
20 San Lorenzo Valley, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at 1373.) Respondents failed to comply with these

21 legal requirements because the County did not prepare an initial study in connection with its

22 approval of the CZO amendments or otherwise conduct any environmental review under CEQA
23 prior to its approval of the CZO amendments.

24 169. For the foregoing reasons, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding
25 Respondents to rescind their action approving the CZO amendments, until such time as

26 Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

3 Violation of CEQA - Improper Reliance on Prior EIR

4 170. (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)
Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
5 though fully set forth herein.

6 171. Public Resources Code section 21166, and its implementing Guidelines section
7 15162, mandate that once a public agency has prepared an EIR for a project, no further EIR is

8 required unless either (1) substantial changes are proposed in the project that will require major
9  revisions of the EIR, or (2) substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which
10 the project will be undertaken that will require major revisions in the EIR, or (3) new information,
11 which was not known and could not have been known when the EIR was certified, becomes

12 available.

13 172. On September 15, 2020, the Board of Supervisors certified an EIR for the GPU and
14 approved the GPU. The Draft EIR for the GPU acknowledged that the County was "considering
15 amending its zoning ordinances.»*5 But the EIR failed to analyze the significant cumulative effects
16 the Zoning Amendments and GPU Oil and Gas Policies would have on the environment. The EIR
17 failed to conduct this analysis even though the Zoning Amendments were a "probable future
18 project." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083(b)(2); Guidelines §§ 15064(h)(1), 15065(a)(3).)

19 173. The County must prepare a further EIR for the GPU because substantial changes
20 have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the GPU will be undertaken that will

21

22 require major revisions to the EIR. This includes substantial changes to the CZO and NCZO vis a

23 vis the Zoning Amendments, which broaden the scope of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies and will

24 result in new and more severe significant impacts on the environment that were not considered in

the EIR.

25 174.

26 The County must also prepare a further EIR because new information, which was
not known and could not have been known when the EIR was certified, has become available. The
27 significant individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments were not

28 See, e.g., Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update Draft EIR, p. 4.12-22.

• 36
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

fully known at the time the County certified the EIR for the GPU because the Zoning Amendments

2 had not yet been adopted at that time. The new information regarding the significant individual
3 and cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments shows that (1) the GPU will have

4 significant effects not evaluated in the EIR for the GPU and (2) significant effects previously
5examined in the EIR for the GPU, including significant and unavoidable impacts to mineral

6 resources and greenhouse gas emissions, will be substantially more severe than shown in the EIR.

7 175. The County violated CEQA by unlawfully adopting the Zoning Amendments
8 without first preparing a further EJR for the GPU that adequately addressed the additional
environmental effects caused by the Zoning Amendments.

10 176. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the above-

11 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial
12 evidence.

13 177. Because CEQA requires a further EIR when (1) substantial changes occur with

14 respect to the circumstances under which the project will be undertaken that will require major
15 revisions in the EIR or (2) new information, which was not known and could not have been known
16 when the EIR was certified, becomes available, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding
17 Respondents to rescind their action approving the Zoning Amendments, until such time as
18 Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

19 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of CEQA - Improper Piecemcaling

21 (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.)

22 178. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
23 though fully set forth herein.

24 179. Under CEQA, an agency is generally prohibited from "segmenting" or
25 "piecemealing" a project into separate parts to avoid full disclosure of environmental impacts.

26 180. The Zoning Amendments constitute "projects" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code

27 21065; Guidelines § 15378(a).)

28 181. The GPU constitutes a "project" under CEQA. The County analyzed the GPU in an

- 37 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

EIR and determined that the GPU would have significant and unavoidable impacts on the
2l environment.

3 182. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and violated CEQA by unlawfully
4 segmenting the Zoning Amendments from the GPU to avoid CEQA review.

5 183. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results
6 from 'chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the
7 environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences.'» (Environmental
8 Protection Information Center v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459,
9 503, quoting Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4Uh 351, 370.)

10 184. Rather, when a lead agency undertakes the environmental review process, the lead

11 agency must review and consider the "whole of the action," (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378), and
12 consider "the effects, both individual and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub.
13 Resources Code, § 21002.1(d).)

14 185. Respondents failed to conduct : full environmental review and consideration of the
15 Zoning Amendments and GPU together before adopting the Zoning Amendments.

16 186. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the above-

17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial
18 evidence.

19 187. Because CEQA prohibits a disjointed, piecemeal process, a writ of mandate should
20 issue, commanding Respondents to rescind their action approving the Zoning Amendments, until

21 such time as Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Section 1085, or alternatively Section 1094.5. The adoption of the GPU and the Zoning
2 I Amendments are preempted because the County is preempted from intruding upon the state's
3 exclusive jurisdiction over certain parts of oil and gas regulations.

4 190. California has adopted numerous statutes and regulations that comprehensively

5 regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. Oil and gas operations are specifically
6 governed by Division 3 of the Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. Code § 3000, et seq.) and its
7 implementing regulations (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 1712, et seq.) By and through this all-
8 | encompassing statutory and regulatory scheme, the State of California, through CalGEM, has

9 exclusive jurisdiction over the field of oil and gas operations, methods, and procedures to the
10 exclusion of local legislation.

11 191. The GPU and Zoning Amendments impermissibly attempt to indirectly prohibit or
12 impair oil and gas subsurface operations by imposing restrictive regulations. This includes, but is

13 not limited to, the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and General Plan 6.10 Implementation Program L
14 ("Program L").

15 192. The Attorney General has concluded that a conflict arises whenever local
16 government attempts to "exercise control over subsurface activities," whether "directly or

17 indirectly." (59 Ops.Cal.Atty. Gen 461, 478; Desert Turf Club v. Bd. of Supervisors (1956) 141

18 Cal.App.2d 446, 452.)

19 193. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal
20 and state law, providing that CalGEM has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the drilling, operation,

21 maintenance, and abandonment of oil, gas, and gcothermal wells, and attendant facilities. CalGEM

22 further has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the use of pipelines and the flaring of gas. The GPU
23 Oil and Gas Policies and Program L attempt to indirectly prohibit or impair subsurface operations
24 by imposing restrictive regulations, in direct contravention of applicable law.

25 194. Program L requires ongoing County evaluation of potential effects from well

26 stimulation treatment and thermal enhanced oil recovery. Program L is preempted by federal and
27 state law, providing that CalGEM has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate well stimulation treatment
28 and underground injection control. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S.

39 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Environmental Protection Agency has delegated primacy authority over oil and gas injection wells
2 | to the CalGEM Underground Injection Control Program.
195. GPU Policy COS-7.2 requires setbacks from well heads to address air toxics
4| produced at the well head. This Policy is preempted, including by AB 2588, which requires a
facility-specific evaluation of air toxic risk posed to nearby residents and businesses. AB 2588
6 ensures appropriate distances and control measures to minimize air toxic risks to nearby residents

7 and businesses.

8 196. GPU Policy COS-7.4 attempts to require evaluations of well stimulation treatment
9 and enhanced oil recovery projects for seismic, groundwater, greenhouse gas emission, and other

10 impacts. This Policy is preempted, including by Senate Bill 4, codified in Pub. Res. Code. § 3150,

11 et seq. Senate Bill 4 explicitly directs CalGEM to promulgate extensive regulations governing well
12 stimulation treatments in California.

13 197. GPU Policy COS-7.5 requires restoration for oil and gas sites. GPU Policy COS-

14 7.5 is preempted, including by 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 1776, which § requires well sites to be returned
15 to as near a natural state as practicable within 60-days of plugging and abandonment of any oil and

16 gas well. Section 1776 also requires oilfield lease restoration to include the removal of all tanks,
17 above-ground pipelines, debris, and other facilities equipment.

18 198. GPU Policy COS-7.6 indicates that the County "shall evaluate discretionary

19 development to identify any abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site." This Policy is

20 preempted, including by Public Resources Code section 3208.1, which establishes well re-
21 abandonment responsibility when a previously plugged and abandoned well will be impacted by
22 planned property development or construction activities. Section 3208.1 gives CalGEM the
23 authority to order or permit the re-abandonment of any well where it has reason to question the
24 integrity of the previous abandonment, or if the well is not accessible or visible.

25 199. GPU Policy COS-7.8 attempts to restrict flaring of natural gas on new wells except
26 | for emergencies and testing. Policy COS-7.8 is preempted, including by state law that expressly
27 provides for flaring of natural gas (Pub. Res. Code §§ 3300, 3500-3503; 17 Cal. Code Regs.
28 §§ 95665-95677). This Policy is also preempted by 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A General

40 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Provisions, which regulates flares, including those at oil and gas facilities. Policy COS-7.8 is
2 further preempted by state regulations that cover measurement and reporting of flare emissions.
3 (See, e.g., 40 CFR Part 98 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting; 17 Cal. Code Regs., Mandatory

4 Greenhouse Gas Reporting).

5 200. By adopting the GPU Oil and Gas Policies, the County has acted unlawfully and

6 beyond the scope of its statutory and regulatory authority as set forth in California and federal law.

7 201. In adopting the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Program L, the Planning Commission

8 and Board of Supervisors also failed to comply with its legal obligations under the Government
9 Code. The Planning Commission failed to conduct an independent review and recommendation of

10 the General Plan, as required by Government Code section 65354. The Board of Supervisors
11 substantially modified the General Plan by adding and modifying policies and mitigation measures

12 that were not previously considered by the Planning Commission, in violation of Government Code

13 section 65356.

14 202. The County has acted arbitrarily and capriciously and has abused its discretion.

15 203. Petitioner has a beneficial interest in ensuring that the County does not enforce the
16 GPU Oil and Gas Policies or Zoning Amendments, which exceed its authority and are preempted
17 by state and federal statutes. Petitioner owns thousands of acres in the County and has an interest
18 in ensuring its right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its properties,
19 which are impacted by the preempted Oil and Gas Policies.

20 204. Petitioner is irreparably harmed by the County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas
21 Policies and Zoning Amendments.

22 205. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law to challenge the GPU
23 Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments other than the relief sought herein. Without the
24 resolution of these challenges, Petitioner will be permanently and irreparably harmed by
25 implementation of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies.

26 206. Because the adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments is

27 quasi-legislative in nature and nol adjudicatory, Petitioner bring this action under Code of Civil
28 Procedure section 1085. In the alternative, however, Petitioner also seek a writ of mandamus under

- 41 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to the extent, if any, that the Court concludes section 1094.5

2 is applicable here.

3 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Declaratory Relief - Preemption)

5 207. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
6 though fully set forth herein.

7 208. The GPU impermissibly attempts to indirectly prohibit or impair oil and gas
8 subsurface operations by imposing restrictive regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, the
9 GPU Oil and Gas Policies and General Plan 6.10 Implementation Program L ("Program L").

10 209. Pursuant to federal and state law, the power and authority to regulate oil and gas

11 operations, methods, and procedures in California lies exclusively in the State of California,
12 including with CalGEM. The provisions of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies, Program L, and Zoning
13 Amendments purport to regulate, restrict, prohibit, and/or impair subsurface operations in the
14 County, and are in direct conflict with superior California law, including, without limitation, the

15 sections of the California Public Resources Code relating to oil and gas production, Senate Bill 4,
16 CalGEM regulations, and permits lawfully issued by CalGEM.

17 210. Respondents lack the power, authority, and jurisdiction to indirectly prohibit or
18 impair subsurface operations by imposing restrictive policies, as that power is exclusively a
19 function of the State of California. Moreover, the laws of the State of California preempt and fully
20 | occupy regulation of the fields of drilling of oil and gas wells, well stimulation treatment.

21 underground injection control, enhanced oil recovery, well abandonment and re-abandonment,

22 flaring, and restoration of oil and gas sites. The provisions of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies,

23 Program L, and Zoning Amendments purporting to regulate, restrict, prohibit, and/or impair
24 subsurface operations are preempted, in whole or in party, by federal and state law, and, as such,

25 are invalid and without effect.

26 211. The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors failed to comply with their

27 legal obligations under the Government Code. The Planning Commission failed to conduct an

28 independent review and recommendation of the General Plan, as required by Government Code

• 42 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- section 65354. The Board of Supervisors substantially modified the General Plan by adding

2 policies that were not previously considered by the Planning Commission, in violation of

3 Government Code section 65356.

4 212. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute

5 the contentions set forth above.

6 213. Judicial intervention in these disputes, and a declaration a by the Court, is necessary

7 to resolve whether the adoption of the GPU is invalid under the Government Code and whether its
8 Oil and Gas Policies are preempted, in whole or in part, by federal and state law.

9 214. Judicial intervention in these disputes, and a declaration a by the Court, is necessary

10 to resolve whether the adoption of the Zoning Amendments is invalid under the Government Code

11 and whether its Oil and Gas Policies are preempted, in whole or in part, by federal and state law.

12 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Declaratory Relief - Impairment of Vested Rights - Adoption of the GPU)
14 215. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
15 though fully set forth herein.

16 216. Petitioner seeks a declaration from this Court that Petitioner has a vested right in the
17 continuation of oil and gas production in Ventura County, including a vested right to receive its
18 royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its mineral properties.

19 217. The doctrine of vested rights seeks to protect property owners and developers who
20 have substantially relied on past permits and proceeded accordingly with the government's
21 acknowledgement. The doctrine protects a permit holder's right not only to construct, but also to

22 use the premises as authorized by the permit. (County of San Diego v. McClurken (1951) 37 Cal.2d
23 683, 691.)

24 218. Petitioner and its predecessor entities have either extracted oil and gas or leased their
25 rights to other operators who have extracted oil and gas, for more than a hundred years. Petitioner

26 is the holder of two CUPs issued in 1948 and the other 1949. The CUPs have been continuously
27 used for more than 70-years. They broadly authorize Petitioner to engage in extraction activities

28 within the County.

43
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

219. Petitioner's oil and gas production activities long pre-date issuance of the CUPs, but
2 subsequent to issuance of the CUPs, all operations have been conducted in accordance with their
3  terms and all other applicable regulations.

4 220. Petitioner and its lessees have vested rights under the CUPs to the continued
5 development and production of oil and gas in the fields in which they have interests, consistent
6 with long-established plans and Petitioner's vested rights in the CUPs. Such vested rights prohibit
7 the County from prohibiting activities authorized by the CUPs by adopting the GPU.

8 221. Petitioner, its predecessors, or its lessees have drilled wells and installed equipment
9 with the expectation that additional wells would be drilled under applicable permits. "The very
10  nature and use of an extractive business contemplates the continuance of such use of the entire

11 parcel of land as a whole, without limitation or restriction to the immediate area excavated at the
12 time the ordinance was passed.3 (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Bd. of Supervisors (1996)

13 12 Cal.4th 533, 557-558.)

14 222. Petitioner has a vested right to continue its operations in its Ventura County
15 oilfields, which may not be abridged absent due a process and a finding of nuisance or payment of
16 adequate compensation. "The owner of a property right to drill for and extract oil in a proven

17 field acquired under permit, may not constitutionally be deprived thereof without payment of
18 just compensation except upon a showing that its exercise constitutes a nuisance." (Trans-
19 Oceanic Oil Corp., supra, 85 Cal.App.2d at p. 789.) The County has not found that any of the oil

20 and gas production activities on Petitioner's properties constitute a nuisance. To the contrary, at

21 all times relevant herein, the continued operations and drilling at Petitioner's properties have
22 occurred lawfully, in compliance with its CUPs, and in a manner that does not create harm or a
23 nuisance to local communities.

24 223. In the alternative, the "diminishing asset doctrine" applies, which permits oil and
25 gas operators and others in extractive industries to exhaust the mineral value of their property. This
26 doctrine was approved by the California Supreme Court in Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v.

27 Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 557-558. There are many years of oil and minerals yet

28 to be extracted from Petitioner's properties. Petitioner's reasonable, investment-based expectation

• 44 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

was that its lessees would continue to produce and develop oil and gas until Petitioner's oil and gas
2 producing properties were no longer capable of producing oil and gas in commercial quantities.
3 Respondents' actions will have the direct result of substantially diminishing Petitioner's reasonable
4 investment-backed expectations.

224. Petitioner's vested rights prevent Respondents from prohibiting activities authorized

6 by Petitioner's permits on the basis of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

7 225. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondents dispute
8 Petitioner's contention set forth above, and intend to unlawfully prohibit and/or restrict Petitioner's
oil and gas operations by way of the GPU.

10 226. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by a the Court, is necessary to

11 resolve whether Petitioner has a vested right in the continuation of oil and gas production in Ventura
12|| County, including a vested right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its

13 mineral properties.

14 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Declaratory Relief - Impairment of Vested Rights - Adoption of the Zoning Amendments)

16 227. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as

17 though fully set forth herein.

18 228. Petitioner seeks a declaration from this Court that Petitioner has a vested right in the
19 continuation of oil and gas production in Ventura County. Petitioner further seeks a declaration
20 that, as a result of this vested right, Ventura County may not prohibit the activities authorized by

21 existing use permits through the Zoning Amendments.

22 229. Petitioner has performed substantial work and incurred substantial liabilities in
23 operating under its existing permits, investing in and installing infrastructure and equipment for the
24 oil-producing properties at issue with the expectation that additional wells could be drilled.

25 230. Petitioner has also clearly exhibited an intent to continue and to complete the
26 development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County. The continued
27 development of these resources is a progression of the extractive activity into all areas of
28 Petitioner's oil and gas fields as authorized by its permits. (See Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc.

• 45 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- v. Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 557-558 ['"[t]he very nature and use of an extractive
2 business contemplates the continuance of such use of the entire parcel of land as a whole, without
3 limitation or restriction to the immediate area excavated at the time the ordinance was passed"].)

4 231. As a result of Petitioner's operations in implementing the permitted use of drilling
5 for and extraction of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon substances, Petitioner has acquired a vested
6 right under these permits to continue the construction authorized by these permits.

7 232.

8 The Zoning Amendments effectively eliminate anticipated future development
activities. By altering the definition of what constitutes a discretionary permit, the Board a has
9  eliminated the vested rights contained in Petitioner's long-term CUPs.

10 233. The County is forcing operators to seek additional CUPs where previously the
11 County has recognized the vested rights of existing permits.

12 234. Given the County's historic practice of delaying and rejecting CUPs for new wells,
13 Petitioner is informed and believe and thereon alleges that the County's actions will have the effect
14 of permanently banning future development previously allowed under existing CUPs held by

15 Petitioner.

16 235.

17 The County has not shown that continued production and extraction operations
under Petitioners' mineral rights constitute a nuisance.

18 236.

19 The County disputes Petitioner's contention and intends to prohibit Petitioner's oil
and gas operations by way of the Zoning Amendments.

20

21 237. Petitioner seeks a judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the respective

parties.

22 238. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to
23 resolve whether Petitioner has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and

24 production of its oil and gas resources within the County.

25 239.

26 The County's adoption of the Zoning Amendments irreparably harms and will

27 continue to irreparably harm Petitioner based on the substantial economic harm and operational

28 harm that will flow from application of the Zoning Amendments.

l ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief - Violation of Article 1, § 19 of the California Constitution (Inverse

3 Condemnation) and Violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth

4 Amendments to the United States Constitution)

5 240. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as

6 though fully set forth herein.

7 241. The GPU and Zoning Amendments constitute a taking of Petitioner's property, as

8 well as the property of any oil and gas operators to whom they may have leased, for public use
9 without prior compensation in violation of Article 1, section 19 of the California Constitution and

10 the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

11 242. "Under the law of this state the landowner has a property right in oil and gas beneath
12 the surface, not in the nature of an absolute title to the oil and gas in place, but as an exclusive right

13 to drill upon his property for these substances." (Bernstein v. Bush (1947) 29 Cal.2d 773, 778.)
14 | "This is a right which is *as much entitled to protection as the property itself, and the undue
15 restriction of the use thereof is as much a taking a "for constitutional purposes as appropriating or
16 destroying it.M (Ibid., citation omitted.)

17 243. Respondents' adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments are part of a concerted

18 effort to stop oil and gas production in the County, directly attacking ongoing business interests.

19 244. By purporting to (I) eliminate Petitioner's and its lessees' vested rights to continue
20 and to complete the development and production of their oil and gas resources within the County,

21 (2) eliminate Petitioner's vested right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from

22 its mineral properties, and (3) to prevent all future oil and gas operations in the County, the GPU

23 effects a per sC taking of and/or damage to Petitioner's and its lessees' property, without just

24 compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,
25 section 19 of the California Constitution. The vested rights rule is grounded upon the constitutional

26 principle that a vested right is a property right which may not be taken without due process of law

27 or just compensation. (Urban Renewal Agency v. Cal. Coastal. Zone Conservation Comm'n, supra,

28 15 Cal.3d at pp. 583-84.

1 245. In the alternative, application of the GPU and Zoning Amendments effect a taking
2| of Petitioner's property under the principles of Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City

3 | (1978) 438 U.S. 104.

4 246. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments eliminate substantially all
5 economically viable use ofoil and gas fields within the County in which Petitioner owns an interest.
6 These restrictions are imposed for the purported benefit of the public without prior compensation
7 to Petitioner.

8 247. Petitioner's CUPs allow Petitioner or its lessee to drill and extract oil, gas, and other
9 hydrocarbons in perpetuity on its mineral properties. These oil and gas fields have substantial
10 value, which will be substantially lost as a result of the GPU and Zoning Amendment. The GPU

11 and Zoning Amendments make Petitioner's vested rights under its CUPs valueless.

12 248. Petitioner is the owner of several mineral interests whose interest in certain parcels
13 is of land is minerals or overriding royalty interests. Even taking into account the existing production
14 occurring at Petitioner's and its lessees' oilfields within the County, available oil reserves within
15 the field (and thus its economic value) will be lost as a result of the GPU and Zoning Amendments.
16 Thus, the GPU and Zoning Amendments substantially eliminates Petitioner's property interest.

17 249. The GPU and Zoning Amendments will cause a significant interreference with
18 Petitioner's distinct, investment-backed expectations in these fields.

19 250. Respondents' adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments also substantially
20 || impair Petitioner's and its lessees' property rights within the County for the benefit of the public

21 without prior compensation to Petitioner. (Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (2005) 544 U.S. 528,

22 540.)

23 251. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the GPU and Zoning Amendments is
24  necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that will
25 result from applying the GPU and Zoning Amendments to oil and gas production operations by

26 Petitioner's lessees and the resulting damages to Petitioner.

6 252. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
7 though fully set forth therein.

8 253. At the time Respondents adopted the GPU and Zoning Amendments, Petitioner was
9 the owner of surface rights and mineral rights in land within the County.

10 254. For decades prior to Respondent's actions in drafting, reviewing, and adopting the

11 a GPU, Petitioner and its lessees had a vested right to continue drilling operations within the County
12 under its CUPs, which allow Petitioner to drill and extract oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons in
13 perpetuity on its mineral properties. Such a vested right prevents Respondents from prohibiting
14 activities authorized by the CUPs by adopting the GPU and Zoning Amendments. Petitioner also

15 has a vested right to receive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its mineral properties.

16 255. The GPU and Zoning Amendments impose an unconstitutional taking as it
17 eliminates Petitioner's vested right to continue and to complete the development and production of
18 its oil and gas resources in the County, including its vested right to receive its royalty share of the
19  oil and gas produced from its mineral properties, all pursuant to existing CUPs that allow Petitioner
20 to drill and extract oil, gas, and other hydrocarbons in perpetuity on its mineral properties.

21 256. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments will virtually eliminate the
22 I economically viable use of Petitioner's mineral rights within the County for the benefit of the public

23 without prior compensation to Petitioner. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments also
24 substantially impairs the property rights of Petitioner in its oil and gas fields within the County for
25 the benefit of the public without prior compensation to Petitioner. Even if the GPU Oil and Gas
26 Policies are subsequently invalidated as against Petitioner, Petitioner will suffer damages to its

27 property rights as a result of the current implementation of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and
28 Zoning Amendments.

1 257. In taking such action, Respondents violated Article 1, section 19 of the California
2 Constitution, which prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public use without

3 prior, just compensation. Further, Respondents violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth
4 l Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, which

5 prohibits the taking of private property for public use without prior, just compensation.

6 258. As a direct result of Respondents' actions as alleged herein, the adoption of the GPU
7 will interfere with the reasonable investment-backed expectations of Petitioner.

8 259. To date, Petitioner has not received any compensation from Respondents on account

9 of the above alleged taking of, or damage to, its property rights. Respondents failed to ascertain
10 the just compensation due to Petitioner prior to adoption of the GPU and the Zoning Amendments.

11 260. As a direct and proximate result of Respondents' violation of Article 1, section 19

12 of the California Constitution and the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S.
13 Constitution, as alleged above, Petitioner has been and will be damaged from the interference with
14  its reasonable investment-backed expectations in its mineral properties within the County, and will
15 suffer further damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

16 261. Petitioner is entitled to damages and attorneys'* fees for the County's constitutional
17 due process violations under Section 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871. (See, Monell v.

23 262. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as
24 though fully set forth herein.

25 263. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments were arbitrary and
26 discriminatory, and not reasonably related lo any legitimate governmental purpose. One of the
27 purposes of the GPU and Zoning Amendment in conjunction is to prohibit oil and gas operations

28 in the County, despite successful operation there for decades. For these reasons, the adoption of

50 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

the GPU and Zoning Amendments violate Petitioner's due process rights under Article 1, section

2 7 of the California Constitution as well as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

3 to the United States Constitution.

4 264. The U.S. and California Constitutions guarantee persons equal protection of the law
5 and adequate due process - rights which also apply in the land use context. (Cal. Const., Art. 1, §
6 7(a); U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV; College Area Renters & Landlord Ass'n v. City of San Diego

7 (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 677, 686.)

8 265. Courts have held that where a land use regulation does not legitimately advance a
9 I state interest and instead is arbitrary and capricious, substantive due process claims can be upheld.

10 (See, e.g., Shaw v. County of Santa Cruz (2008) 170 Cal.App.4th 229.)

11 266. While one of stated purposes of the GPU is "[t]o effectively and safely manage the
12 exploration, production, and drilling of oil and gas resources in Ventura County," the GPU actually
13 has the effect of imposing requirements and restrictions that indirectly prohibit oil and gas
14 operations in the County, including by rendering them infeasible or impossible, rather than "safely
15 manag[ing]" those operations.

16 267. There is no legitimate interest in prohibiting oil and gas operations in the County.
17 There is no legitimate interest in eliminating an industry that is already highly regulated and
18 permitted by various government entities.

19 268. The GPU and Zoning Rights also interfere with Petitioner's vested rights to continue
20 and to complete the development and production of its oil and gas resources in the County,

21 including its vested right to reccive its royalty share of the oil and gas produced from its mineral

22 properties.

23 269. There are substantive due process requirements that vested rights cannot be
24 terminated or impaired by ordinary police power regulations, and can be revoked or impaired only

25 to serve a "compelling state interest," such as harm, danger or menace to public health and safety
26 or public nuisance, and that the government's interference with the vested right be narrowly tailored

27 to address the compelling interest and its magnitude. (Sce Washingion v. Glucksberg (1997) 521
28 U.S. 702, 721; Davidson v. County of San Diego (1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 639.) The County has not

- 51 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

F identified any compelling state interest to justify terminating or impairing Petitioner's vested rights.
2 Nor is there any. At all times relevant herein, the continued operations and drilling at Petitioner's
3 properties have occurred lawfully, in compliance with its CUPs, and a in a manner that does not

4 create harm or a nuisance to local communities.

5 270. Moreover, the GPU and Zoning Amendments impose impermissible and arbitrary

6 restrictions on Petitioner and its lessees that are not imposed on similarly situated persons or
7 businesses, including use of public roads. This is precisely the type of unequal treatment that has
8 been found to be in violation of the Constitution's equal protection clause. (See, e.g., Parks v.

9 Watson (9th Cir. 1983) 716 F.2d 646, 652; Frost & Frost Trucking Co. v. Railroad Com. (1926)
10 271 U.S. 583, 591.)

11 271. A bona fide actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents in that
12 Petitioner alleges, and Respondents deny, that the adoption of the GPU and the Zoning
13 Amendments violated Article 1, section 7 ofthe California Constitution and the Due Process Clause

14 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

15 272. Petitioner desires a judicial determination of the validity of the GPU to save itself
16 from the harm caused by the GPU and Zoning Amendments, which prohibits oil and gas operations

17 in the County. The adoption of the GPU results in substantial hardship to Petitioner.

18 273. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the GPU and Zoning Amendments is
19 necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that
20 results from applying the GPU to Petitioner.

21 274. Petitioner is entitled to damages and attorneys' fees for the County's constitutional
22 due process violations under Section 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871. (See, Monell v.
23 Dept. of Social Services (1978) 436 U.S. 658.)

24 JURY TRIAL DEMAND

25 Petitioner requests a jury trial as to all causes of action for which one is permitted.

26 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

27 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgement and further relief as follows:

28 A. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandamus, commanding Respondents:

• 52 -

2040 General Plan Update, including claims for violations of the California Environmental Quality
Act ("CEQA"). The amended pleading states additional claims and allegations regarding the County's failure to observe the requirements of CEQA in the administrative process that
culminated in the County's November 10, 2020 decision to adopt amendments to the Ventura
County CoastalZoning Ordinance ("CZO") and Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO")
(collectively, "Zoning Amendments") without first complying with CEQA.

The relief that Lloyd Properties intends to seek with the amended Petition for Writ of
Mandate and Complaint includes, but is not limited to, the following:

For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding the County:

o To vacate and set aside approval of the Zoning Amendments;
