VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, SAVE OUR SLOPES ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for

2 Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 3

1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Monterey Park ("City"
5 or "Respondent") of an Environmental Impact Report, the related discretionary
6 approvals/ordinances and resolutions declaring an emergency and authorizing contracting

7 without formal bidding (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed development located

8 at 1688 West Garvey Avenue, Monterey Park, CA (the "Project"). As noted below, the City

9 failed to follow the required procedures required by the California Environmental Quality Act

10 ("CEQA") when it certified the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. The

Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the 'SIlIH AueAeg 15 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
with construction because the City failed to conduct an adequate environmental review. The
17 Monterey Park City Council certified the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project 16

18 on or about June 16, 2021. The City also approved a Zone Change, a Vesting Tentative Map and

19 approved a Development Agreement for the Project. The City also adopted a resolution declaring

21 environmental clearance document for that action. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the 20 an emergency and authorizing contracting without formal bidding and utilized the EIR as the

22 Project Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
23 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et scq. ("CEQA"),
24 and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
25 3. Petitioner secks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project

1 Approvals and the EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.
2 PARTIES

3 4. Petitioner Save Our Slopes is an unincorporated association dedicated to the
4 protection of both the residents and the environment in the City of Monterey Park. Petitioner and

5 its respective members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that
6 Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective
7 members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the
8 Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and
its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

10 Respondent's' approval of the Project.

11 5. Respondent, City of Monterey Park, is city incorporated under the laws of the
[euueyo Law Group, d77 90211 OL 1  6VPIS H  B IP I ES EO 'SIllH Áuereg 12 State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality Act

14 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in
15 Interest Center International Investments, Inc. has a direct interest in the development of the
16 project. The City named the entity in the Notice of Determination filed with the County
17 Recorder.

18 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein

19 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
20 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
2 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code
3 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

10. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

5 Code of Civil Procedure.

6 11. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
7 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County.
8 PROJECT
9 12. The Project is located at 1688 West Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park, California.
10 The proposed Project includes the development of 16 single-family residences on a 6.22-acre site
11
8 located at 1688 West Garvey Avenue in the City of Monterey Park. The Project would involve Channel Law Group, d77 euns "pAe eJlys!M €8E8 90211 and installation of retaining walls and geotechnical improvements (overexcavations and 12  grading
13
8 soil removals, recompaction, soil anchors and installation of engincered stabilization products) to
SIlH Áuereg 14 stabilize the onsite slopes to facilitate construction of 16 new single-family residences, a private
15 access road, and an open space lot. Two new retaining walls would be installed on the Project
16 site to help stabilize the regraded slopes and would consist of a Lower Site Retaining Wall below
17 the houses along West Garvey Avenue and an Upper Site retaining wall along the west side of

18 the private access road. The proposed vesting tentative map shows that Lots 1 through 16 are the
19 residential lots; Lot A, the private access road; and Lot B would be preserved as open space. The
20 residential lots would range in size from 7,515 square feet to 15,369 square fcet in size.
21 13. The proposed 1688 West Garvey Avenuc Specific Plan consists of a master
22 landscape plan and design and development standards and guidelines for the proposed retaining
23 walls and new residences. Project processing and review procedures are also included in the
24 Specific Plan
25 14. The project parcel common spaces and improvements will be included in a
26 Geologic Hazard Abatement District (GHAD) that will assess and collect fees, maintain and

1 improve the parcel as necessary and determined by the GHAD Board.

2 15. The General Plan Land Use designation for the site is High Density Residential.

3 The zoning designation of the Site is High-Density Residential (R-3). The High-Density

4 Residential land use and zoning designations allow a broad range of dwelling unit types, which
5 may be attached or detached at a density of up to 25 units per acre.

6 16. The Project Site is bordered by West Garvey Avenue on the north and east and
7 Abajo Drive to the east. St. Steven's Serbian Orthodox Church is located north of the Site and
8 Garvey Avenue, with single-family residences located north of the church. The Abajo del Sol
9 senior apartment complex is located east of the Project Site between Abajo Drive and S. Fremont
10 Ave. Auto repair uses are located between South Fremont Avenue, Garvey Avenue, and

2 11 Monterey Pass Road. Single-family residences are located west of the Project Site. Channel Law sdnoms d77 LLZ06 17. The applicant for the Project sought the following three entitlements: (1) Zone

13 Change from R-3 to Specific Plan ZC-21-01, (2) Vesting Tentative Map No. 21-01, (3)
'SIl!H Áuereg 14 Development Agreement DA-21-01. In addition to the entitlements, the City adopted the 1688
15 West Garvey Avenue Specific Plan (SP-21-01) in order to facilitate the Project.
16 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

17 18. The Project site was originally approved for development in 1978 and 1979 for 31
18 residential dwelling unit. That original project was developed by the Good Views Land
19 Development Company ("Good Views").
20 19. The property is historically unstable. In 1983, Garvey Avenue was damaged, and
21 blocked, by a slope failure resulting in the City taking emergency action to construct various soil
22 stabilization and drainage infrastructure. In 1986, the City entered into an agreement with the
23 Good Views developer to construct permanent structures intended to stabilize the hillside that
24 was to be completed by December 5, 1986.
25 20. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, a number of City consultants advised the City regarding
26 what measures were required to stabilize the hillside. The Good Views property owner failed to
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 implement any of those recommendations. As a result, the City in 1991 issued a notice of
2 violation to Good Views that the Project site constituted a public nuisance requiring abatement.
3 In 1997, the City Council declared the property to be a public nuisance and commenced abating
4 the property. Among other things, it installed a gate on the abandoned private road. The City
5 took additional abatement action in 2000 and 2002.

6 21. Starting in 2013, the City again undertook various code enforcement actions
7 against the new property owner of 1600-1688 West Garvey Avenue.

8 22. Concerned that the El Niño storms in 2015 would result in significant slope
9 failure at the property, the City filed a civil lawsuit against the property owners to abate the
10 nuisances on the property. That lawsuit allowed the City to immediately take action to
11
09Z eUNS "PALE BILYSIM E8E8 temporarily stabilize the hillside. Those efforts, however, did not constitute a permanent solution Channel Law Group, LLP 90211 12 to the overall issue of hillside stability.

8 13 23. On April 25, 2017, the City entered into a settlement agreement with the property
'SIH Kueneg 14 owner which includes plan for a long-term solution to the hillside. In short, the Settlement
15 Agreement requires the property owner to stabilize the hillside through a series of retaining walls
16 and other geotechnical solutions. This can be accomplished in one of two ways. "Plan A" is for
17 the hillside stabilization to occur via developing the site with residential homes. Under Plan A,
18 the hillside stabilization would be incorporated into the overall design and construction of that
19 residential development. Any such development, however, requires the discretionary approval of
20 the City Council.
21 24. "Plan B" is the hillside stabilization project without the residential development.
22 This must be accomplished regardless of whether the City Council approves the Plan A
23 residential project and must be completed in 2022. If the property owner fails to complete Plan B
24 voluntarily, then the City will complete that project at the property owner's cost.
25 25. Real Party in Interest opted to pursue "Plan A" and applications for the requested
26 entitlements were filed on or about July 2, 2020.

1 26. A draft environmental impact report (DEIR) was prepared pursuant to CEQA
2 Guidelines §15151. On July 22, 2020, the City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) with an
3 Initial Study for review and comment by the public, responsible agencies, and reviewing
4 agencies. The 30-day review period for the NOP ended on August 22, 2020. The City released
5 the Draft EIR for a 45-day period for review and comment from March 11, 2021 to April 26,
6 2021. A number of agency and public comments were received during public review.
7 27. The FEIR includes a discussion and analysis of the following project alternatives:

8 Alternative 1: No Project Alternative
9 Alternative 2: Multi-Family Development Alternative

10 Alternative 3: Alternative Retaining Wall Design

11 Alternative 4: Reduced Density Alternative 8 d17 'dnojo LLZ06 28. On June 16, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, certified the Final
13 8 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 12

Environmental Impact Report, approved all of the requested entitlements and adopted the 1688
MET jauueyo 'SILH Aueneg 14 West Garvey Avenue Specific Plan. The City waived the first reading of the ordinances for the
15 Zone Change and Specific Plan. The City also used the FEIR as an environmental clearance to
16 approve a resolution declaring an emergency and authorizing the City Manager to Contract
17  without the necd for bidding pursuant to § Public Contracts Code $ 22050 to construct hillside
18 stabilization at 1688 West Garvey Avenue. This resolution was adopted in the event that the City
19 had to pursue Plan B in the settlement agreement with Real Party. The City also asserted that the
20 waiver of bidding procedures was exempt from additional CEQA review because such actions
21 were being made to "protect public and private property and necessary to maintain services
22 essential to the public, health and welfare."
23 29. The City filed a Notice of Determination with the County Recorder on June 24,
24 | 2021.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

2 30. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

3 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

4 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
5 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
7 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
8 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

10 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
11 31. CEQA is California's broadest environmental Jaw and helps to guide public 8 d77 'dnoJg meT |auueyc LLZ06 208 VPINS LHASID A A CE SIl!H Kuereg agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
13 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope 12

14| of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved

16 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and 15 by City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California

17 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.

18 32. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
19 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as is the "fair
20 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

22| environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St. 21 in the record supports fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

23 V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

24 33. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
25 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
26 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
27

1 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
2 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
3 points of no return. 33 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
4 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
34. "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as "a substantial or
6 potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal Code Regs
7 $15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a "reasonable
probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974)
13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 309. This
10 standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an EIR. Pocket Protectors v. City of

11 Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App. 4th 903, 928; Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2004) 122 8 d77 'dnoJ5 MET jouueuO 90211 12 eynS "PALa EJJuSIUM €8€8 Cal.App.4th 572, 580; Citizen Action to Serve All Students v. Thornley (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d

'SIl!H Auereg 14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)
16 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
17 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
18 36. The City's Initial Study screened out the following environmental resource
19 categorics as less than significant: (1) Biological Resources,, (2) Hydrology/Water Quality, (3)
20 Recreation, (4) Utilities/Service Systems, (5) Agriculture and Forestry, (6) Cultural Resources,
21 (7) Greenhouse Gas Emissions, (8) Population/Housing, (9) Wildfire, (10) Energy, (11) Hazards
22 & Hazardous Materials, (12) Mineral Resources, and (13) Public Services. The City also
23 determined that all of the remaining categories would be mitigated and did not adopt a
24 Statement of Overriding Considerations. However, the City received public comments on the
25 Draft Environmental Impact Report indicating that the Project would result in significant
26 environmental impacts to environmental resources categories screened out and that the
27

9 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 mitigation measures proposed were inadequate.
2 37. For example, the City received two comment letters from the California
3 Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") dated March 12-13, 2021 and April 15, 2021.
CDFW is a trustee agency under CEQA. A "trustee agency" is defined in Public Resources Code
as "a state agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by a project, that
are held in trust for the people of the State of California." Public Resources Code § 21070. The
7 CEQA Guidelines state that a a trustee agency "means a state agency having jurisdiction by law
over natural resources affected by project which are held in trust for the people of the State of
California. Trustee agencies include: (a) The California Department of Fish and Game with

10 regard to the fish and wildlife of the state, to designated rare or endangered native plants, and to

11 game refuges, ecological reserves, and other areas administered by the department." California
Channel Law Group, LLP 0gZ eNS 'PAIE eJIUSIIM €8€8 90211 12 Code of Regulations § 15386.

13
8 38. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, formerly known as the California
'SIlH Auereg 14| Department of Fish and Game, is a state agency under the California Natural Resources Agency.
15 The Department has been tasked with a key role in reviewing environmental documents to assess
16 biological impacts to fish and wildlife resources. Fish & Game Code § 1802 states as follows:

17

18 The Department has "jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations
19 of those species. The department, as trustee for fish and wildlife resources, shall consult

20 with lead and responsible agencies and shall provide, as available, the requisite biological expertise to review and comment upon environmental documents and impacts arising
21 from project activities, as those terms are used in the California Environmental Protection
Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
22

23 39. In its letters to the City, CDFW outlined potentially significant environmental

24 impacts to biological resources and suggested the addition of five mitigation measurcs. However,

25 the City responded and stated as follows: "As there are no biological resource impacts beyond

26 potential impacts to nesting birds during construction, no additional mitigation measures or

27 conditions of approval are required to mitigate potential biological impacts." CDFW, a trustce

28 10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

agency, provided substantial evidence in its letter that the Project will cause biological impacts
2 beyond the mere potential impacts to nesting birds. Additionally, the City erred when it 1

concluded that there could be no biological impacts associated with the removal of non-native
species simply because the "Monterey Park General Plan and Municipal Code do not include
protection for biological resources, including trees, on private property." The fact that the City

6 does not have regulations in place is irrelevant as to the potential for impacts under CEQA.
Inadequate Findings 7

8 40. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead

10 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has

11 reached. 0SL euns pALa eUlus!!M €8g8 d77 'dnoJ5 MBT |euueuo 12 41. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as matter LIZ06 13
8 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not
'SIIH ApeAeS 14 limited to, the following.
15 d. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted
16 mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the
17

b. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures that environment;

18

19 would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were unnecessary;
20 c. All determinations which relied on the inadequate EIR and other legally defective
21 documents or analyses.
Inadequate Response to Comments 22

23 42. Petitioner's members submitted comments which questioned the adequacy of the
24 Projects' environmental analyses. However, many of the City's responses were evasive. By
25 failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed alternatives, Respondent
26 failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Morcover, Respondent's finding that adequate
I 27

11 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 responses to comments were provided is not supported by substantial evidence.
2 43. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
3 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
4 an adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's EIR must be set

5 aside.

6 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEQA PROCEEDING

7 44. On July 20, 2021, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel,

8 served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of this letter
10 providing such notice are attached to this Petition as Exhibit A and is incorporated herein by this

11 reference. This letter satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
Channel Law Group, d77 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 750 41Z06 12 45. On July 21, 2021, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California Attorney
13 General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy
