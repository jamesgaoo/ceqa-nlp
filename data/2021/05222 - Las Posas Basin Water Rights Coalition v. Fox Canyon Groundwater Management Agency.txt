- Damages (*Petitioner") pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060 and 1085,
2 Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, and Water Code section 10728.6 and alleges

3 as follows:

4 I. INTRODUCTION

5 1. The Las Posas Valley Groundwater Basin ("Basin") is currently the subject of a
6 comprehensive groundwater adjudication pending in Santa Barbara County Superior Court.
7 Despite the fact that the groundwater rights of landowners in the Basin will be fully adjudicated in
8 a matter of months, Respondent and Defendant Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency
9 (the "GMA") adopted an ordinance entitled "An Ordinance to Establish an Extraction Allocation
10 System for the Las Posas Groundwater Basin" (the "Allocation Ordinance") for the Basin on
11 December 14, 2020. In adopting the Allocation Ordinance, the GMA is attempting to impose its

d'TI UNVIE AHNMOC 12 own allocation scheme on the Basin, without regard for the pending litigation or the landowners'

13 existing rights. The Allocation Ordinance deprives landowners of groundwater without regard to
14 common law groundwater rights and without just compensation. Moreover, the Allocation
15 Ordinance violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The Allocation

16 Ordinance must be invalidated under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 because the GMA

17 a proceeded in a manner contrary to law and based on findings not supported by evidence in the

18 administrative record.

19 2. Petitioner further seeks declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
20 1060 to determine that the Allocation Ordinance violates (i) Petitioners' common law overlying

21 rights to groundwater; (ii) Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution; and (iii) Article I,
22 sections 3(b)(4), 7(a), and 19 of the California Constitution by taking Petitioners' private property

23 for public use without due process and payment of just compensation.

24 3. Finally, Petitioner requests that this Court immediately enjoin implementation of
25 the Allocation Ordinance, as adopted by the GMA on December 14, 2019, pending completion of
26 this litigation and compliance with CEQA.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2 A. Physical Description of the Basin

3 4. The Las Posas Valley Groundwater Basin is located entirely within Ventura

4 County, and is bordered by the Springville Fault and Las Posas Hills to the south, by South
5 Mountain and Oak Ridge to the north, by Big Mountain to the east, and by the Oxnard Subbasin of
6 the Santa Clara River Valley Groundwater Basin, to the west.

7 5. Several distinct hydrogeological features exist within the Basin. These features

8 include an upper confined aquifer and two lower, confined aquifer systems that extend throughout
9 the Basin. Three different water-bearing formations lie within the Basin, one of which consists of
10 alluvial deposits. The other two water-bearing formations are known as the San Pedro Formation

11 and the Santa Barbara Formation. The dominant water-bearing deposit of the San Pedro Formation

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 is known as the Fox Canyon Aquifer. The dominant water-bearing deposit in the Santa Barbara
13 Formation is known as the Grimes Canyon Aquifer, which underlies and is independent from the
14 Fox Canyon Aquifer. Additionally, the Epworth Gravels Aquifer occurs in an area limited to
15 approximately 1,600 acres located two to three miles north-northwest of the City of Moorpark.

16 6. The Basin has experienced overall stable or rising groundwater levels for two or

17 more decades. Although water levels in the Basin can and have dropped during periods of drought,
18 sufficient water is available to meet demands and maintain stable water levels over the long term.

19 B. The Related Comprehensive Groundwater Adjudication

20 7. On March 27, 2018, Petitioner filed its original Verified Complaint to

21 comprehensively adjudicate all rights in and to the Basin's groundwater. Petitioner subsequently
22 filed its First Amended Complaint on July 5, 2018. The Court determined that the action as pled

23 in the First Amended Complaint constitutes a comprehensive groundwater adjudication within the
24 meaning of Code of Civil Procedure sections 832 and 833, and disqualified every judge of the
25 Ventura County Superior Court from hearing any of the First Amended Complaint's causes of
26 action. The Chairperson of the Judicial Council then assigned the case to the Honorable Thomas
27 P. Anderle of the Santa Barbara County Superior Court, where the operative Second Amended
28 Complaint is currently pending. (Las Posas Valley Water Rights Coalition v. Fox Canyon

1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 Groundwater Management Agency, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Case No.
2 VENCI00509700, hereinafter referred to as the "Adjudication Action.")

3 8. In the Adjudication Action, the Court elected to phase the case pursuant to its
4 authority under Code of Civil Procedure section 840 subd. (b)(5). Phase addressed the Basin's
5 initial total safe and the division of the yield between landowner pumpers and Ventura County
6 Waterworks Districts Nos. 1 and 19. (Final Phase 1 Ruling (Sept. 17, 2020).) Phase 2, which is
7 currently scheduled for trial commencing January 19, 2022, will address individual allocations of
8 Basin groundwater. Phase 3 will address remaining issues as determined by the Court including

9 but not limited to the adoption of a physical solution and the manner in which any physical
10 solution will be implemented and adaptively managed.

11 9. Through the Adjudication Action, the Court will determine establish all

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 groundwater rights in and to the Basin.
13 C. Overview of the GSP Adopted for the Basin

14 10. In 2014, the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR") designated the
15 Basin as a high-priority groundwater basin. The GMA elected to become the groundwater
16 sustainability agency ("GSA") for the Basin in 2015, and formally notified DWR of its intent to
17 develop a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (GSP) for the Basin on or about February 24, 2017.

18 11. Petitioner began participating in the GMA's process of developing a GSP for the

19 Basin beginning in the summer of 2017, and continuing through the GMA's adoption of the Final

20 GSP on December 13, 2019. The GMA's adoption of the Final GSP occurred nearly fourteen

21 months before SGMA's January 31, 2022 deadline for adoption of GSPs. Despite Petitioner's
22 extensive comments and criticisms of the Draft GSP, the GMA adopted a Final GSP that was
23 substantively unchanged from the Draft GSP.

24 12. Petitioner filed its original Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
25 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief in this Court on June 9, 2020, seeking, among other things, to
26 invalidate the GSP because its estimate of the sustainable yield of the Basin is arbitrarily and
27 capriciously low. (Las Posas Basin Water Rights Coalition v. Fox Canyon Groundwater
28 Management Agency, et al., Santa Barbara County Superior Court Case No. 20CV02036,

4 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 hereinafter referred to as the "Writ Action.") On August 6, 2020, Petitioner filed the currently-
2 operative First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and
3 Injunctive Relief in the Writ Action. On July 2, 2020, the Court issued an order relating the Writ

4 Action and the Adjudication Action.

5 D. Additional Adjudication Actions

6 13. On June 15, 2021, a coalition of landowners overlying the Oxnard Subbasin and the
7 Pleasant Valley Basin commenced an action in the Ventura County Superior Court. (OPV
8 Coalition, et al. V. Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, et al., Ventura County

9 Superior Court Case No. 56-2021-00555357-CU-PT-VTA, hereinafter referred to as the "OPV
10 Adjudication.") The GMA asserts jurisdiction over substantial portions of the Oxnard Subbasin
11 and the Pleasant Valley Basins, and both basins border the Las Posas Basin. The plaintiffs in the

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 OPV Adjudication have filed a "Notice of Related Case" requesting that the Ventura County
13 Superior Court transfer the OPV Adjudication to Santa Barbara Superior Court, related to the
14 Adjudication Action, and assigned to Judge Thomas Anderle. That request is pending.
15 E. The GMA's Allocation Ordinance Development Process

16 14. Notwithstanding these pending cases, on December 14, 2020, the GMA's Board of
17 Directors adopted the Allocation Ordinance. The Allocation Ordinance takes effect on October 1,
18 2021. The Allocation Ordinance is an action by the GMA to implement the GSP by setting forth
19 its own groundwater extraction allocation system for the Basin.

20 15. The Allocation Ordinance was developed by the GMA's Board of Directors

21 ("Board"), which is not a publicly elected body. The Board established the Las Posas Users

22 Group ("LPUG") to develop and adopt what the Board referred to as the LPUG White Paper (or

23 "White Paper") The make-up of the LPUG was not representative groundwater users throughout
24 the Basin. The White Paper is the principal basis for the Allocation Ordinance.

25 16. In the months leading up to GMA's adoption of the Allocation Ordinance, the
26 GMA received comments from numerous stakeholders who collectively urged the Board to delay
27 adopting the Allocation Ordinance. Comment letters from Petitioner and others reminded the
28 GMA that, while SGMA requires the GMA to adopt a GSP by January 31, 2022, it does not set an

1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 imminent deadline for implementation of a groundwater allocation program. SGMA allows the

2 GMA time to adopt a complete, scientifically backed, equitable allocation program following a
3 fair and open public process. As one public comment explained, a request for delayed adoption is

4 not "kicking the can down the road," but rather a request that the GMA take the time needed to get
5 the Allocation Ordinance right.

6 17. Petitioner submitted comment letters to the GMA dated October 28, 2020 and

7 December 11, 2020. In its comment letters, Petitioner informed the GMA of several problems
8 with the draft Allocation Ordinance. The problems identified by Petitioner included, among other
9 things, the Allocation Ordinance's flawed assumptions, inequitable framework for extraction
10 allocations, and violations of California groundwater law.

11 18. Despite these comments and concerns, the Allocation Ordinance adopted by the

d'TI UNVIE AHNMOC 12 GMA contained all the fundamental errors that Petitioner and other stakeholders pointed out in
13 public comments.

14 19. On December 14, 2020, the GMA adopted the Allocation Ordinance. A true and
15 correct copy of the Allocation Ordinance is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
16 F. The Allocation Ordinance

17 20. The Allocation Ordinance establishes an extraction allocation system for the Basin
18 that becomes effective on October 1, 2021. It replaces the GMA's current groundwater extraction

19 allocation system for the Basin and purports to establish a comprehensive extraction allocation

20 system that includes, without limitation, allocation pools, allocation transfers, and variances.

21 21. Article 6 of the Allocation Ordinance establishes an operator's initial extraction
22 allocation as the greater of (a) average annual extractions from 2009 through 2013; (b) total
23 extractions in 2015, unless in excess of the extraction allocation for that year; or (c) the minimum
24 allocation as defined in a separate section of the Allocation Ordinance.

25 22. 8 Article 8 of the Allocation Ordinance expressly defines minimum allocations for
26 agricultural operators and domestic operators. However, the Allocation Ordinance provides that
27| "other operators," including industrial operators, shall have a minimum allocation that is the
28 Temporary Extraction Allocation established for that operator under the GMA's Emergency

6 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 Ordinance E, "including all scheduled reductions and any variance granted by the Executive

2 Officer."

3 23. 4 9 Articles 4 and 9 of the Allocation Ordinance tie water allocations to the extraction

4 facility, rather than the land. This is in stark opposition to the GMA's repeated statements that it

5 wishes to "move to a land based system" and Petitioner's comments that tying water allocations to
6 the extraction facility violates California groundwater law.

7 24. Article 9 of the Allocation Ordinance addresses reporting requirements and does
8 not require mutual water companies to report water on parcel-by-parcel basis.

9 25. Article 14 of the Allocation Ordinance sets forth a process to request a variance to
10 an allocation where five criteria are met: (1) "there are special circumstances or exceptional
11 characteristics applicable to the owner or operator which do not apply generally" to comparable

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 water users; (2) "granting a variance will not confer a special privilege inconsistent with the

13 limitations upon other owners and operators in the Basin"; (3) the application will experience
14 "practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose" of the
15 Allocation Ordinance if a variance is not granted; (4) granting the requested variance will be
16 consistent "with the groundwater sustainability plan or the provisions of SGMA or with other
17 regulations or ordinances of the Agency or detrimental to the Agency's ability to improve and
18 protect the quantity or quality of groundwater supplies within the Basin"; and (5) granting the
19 requested variance "will not substantially impede the Agency's ability to achieve sustainable
20 groundwater management or the actual sustainability of groundwater in the Basin." The variance

21 process places the burden on a landowner to establish a claim for a variance, and the criteria for
22 granting such a variance are not consistent with California law, including the common law of
23 groundwater rights.

24 26. The process for making variance claim is not set forth in the Allocation
25 Ordinance except the statement that applications for variances for the water year beginning
26 October 1, 2021 must be filed by June 30, 2021. Applications for variances for subsequent water
27 years must be submitted by September 30 for use in the following water year. Based on
28 information and belief, Petitioner alleges that the GMA has not provided any further public
7 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

- guidance on how to submit a variance claim, nor has the GMA taken any action to date on pending
2 variance applications for the water year that will commence on October 1, 2021.

3 27. Despite several comment letters stating that the Allocation Ordinance is not exempt

4 from CEQA, Article 1 of the Allocation Ordinance states that it is exempt from CEQA under

5 Water Code section 10728.6 and CEQA Guidelines sections 15061(b)(3), 15307, and 15308. The
6 GMA filed a Notice of Exemption on February 24, 2021 (the "NOE"). The NOE is attached

7 hereto as Exhibit B. Petitioners and the GMA executed an agreement to toll the deadline to file a

8 challenge to the NOE from February 21, 2021 until August 15, 2021.

9 28. Petitioner brings this action to protect the rights of the public. The GMA's
10 arbitrary and capricious actions, which have no basis in fact or law, must be invalidated. Further,
11 the GMA must comply with CEQA and the requirements of the California Constitution.

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOG 12 III. PARTIES

13 29. Petitioner and Plaintiff Las Posas Basin Water Rights Coalition is a California
14 unincorporated association formed to represent the interests of its membership, which consists of
15 numerous landowners with overlying rights to pump and use groundwater in the Basin and other
16 parties. The Coalition has standing to bring this action on behalf of its entire membership pursuant

17 to Code of Civil Procedure section 382.

18 30. Respondent and Defendant Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency is an
19 independent special district created by the California Legislature to manage groundwater resources
20 within its territory for the common benefit of water users. (Stats. 1982, c. 1023, p. 3734, § 1, Art.

21 1, Sec. 102.) The GMA has elected to become the groundwater sustainability agency ("GSA") for
22 the Basin pursuant to SGMA, and so is required to prepare a GSP for the Basin by January 31,
23 2022.

24 31. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
25 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest DOE 1 through DOE 100, inclusive,
26 and therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictional names. Petitioner alleges, upon
27 information and belief, that each fictionally named Real Party in Interest is responsible in some
28 manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based or has material interests affected

1748930v5 8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

- by the GSP or Respondents' actions in connection with the GSP. Petitioner will amend this
2 Petition to show the true names and capacities of DOES 1-100 if and when the same have been

3 ascertained.

4 IV. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 32. This Court has jurisdiction to review the GMA's findings, approvals, and actions as
6 described herein and to issue a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to
7 Water Code section 10726.6, subdivision (e), Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5,
8 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 382, 525 et seq., 1060 and 1085.

9 33. Venue in this Court is proper under Water Code section 10726.6 subdivision (b)
10 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 404.1, 838, subdivision (d), and 838, subdivision (e).

11 34. This action is related to the litigation matters (a) Las Posas Valley Water Rights

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 Coalition v. Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, Santa Barbara County Superior
13 Court, Case No. VENCI00509700, and (b) Las Posas Basin Water Rights Coalition v. Fox
14 Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, et al., Santa Barbara County Superior Court, Case
15 No. 20CV02036, that are currently pending in this Court. Because this action is fundamentally
16 dependent upon the disposition of the other actions as to the particulars relevant to the GMA's
17 management responsibilities, including respective groundwater rights and implementation of the
18 GSP, and because this action shares common questions of fact or law with the above-described
19 litigation matters, it is appropriate for this action to be heard by this Court pursuant to Code of
20 Civil Procedure sections 404.1, 838, subdivision (d) and other applicable law.

21 V. STANDING

22 35. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding because
23 implementation of the Allocation Ordinance will interfere with and infringe upon Petitioner's

24 members' exercise of their overlying rights to the waters of the Basin. Petitioner's members hold
25 overlying rights in the Basin and thus will be subject to the Allocation Ordinance upon its

26 operative date on October 1, 2021. Petitioner's members will therefore be directly injured by the
27 adoption and implementation of the Allocation Ordinance.

28 36. Petitioner also has standing because this case involves the public interest, public

1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 rights and the enforcement of public duties. The GMA has a mandatory duty to comply with the
2 procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA. Petitioner is not seeking relief greater than or
3 different from relief sought for the general public. If successful, this action would enforce the
4 mandates of CEQA, and so benefit the public interest.

5 37. For the reasons stated above, Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised
6 herein and has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. (Code

7 Civ. Proc., §1086).

8 VI. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 38. Petitioner, on behalf of its members, has performed all conditions precedent to
10 filing this action and has exhausted its available administrative remedies to the extent required by
11 law. Petitioner, on behalf of its members, presented specific objections to the draft Allocation

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 Ordinance through detailed written and oral comments submitted to the GMA on October 28,
13 2021, December 11, 2021, and December 14, 2021 in response to the draft Allocation Ordinance
14 and prior to the approval of the final Allocation Ordinance on December 14, 2021. In these ways
15 and others, Petitioner participated in the administrative process that preceded the adoption of the
16 Allocation Ordinance, to the full extent that the GMA allowed such participation. Additional
17 requests by Petitioner that the GMA delay or defer adoption of the Allocation Ordinance would be

18 futile.

19 39. Although Article 14 of the Allocation Ordinance sets forth the criteria for a
20 landowner to seek a variance to the GMA's allocation, Petitioner is informed and believes that the

21 GMA has not established a process for applying for or processing variances. Nevertheless, a
22 number of Petitioner's members submitted variance claims to the GMA on or before June 30,
23 2021 for the water years beginning October 1, 2021. Based on information and belief, Petitioner
24 alleges that the GMA has not acted on these variance claims. Because the GMA has not
25 established a process a for applying for a variance and the GMA has not taken any action on the
26 variance applications made to date, the variance provision of Article 14 is not an administrative
27 remedy available to Petitioner's members. Further efforts by Petitioner's members to seek

28 variances under Article 14 of the Allocation Ordinance would be futile.

10 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

40. Petitioner has fully exhausted all administrative remedies in that the determination
2 by the GMA is final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by law.

3 41. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing

4 the GMA with notice of intent to commence this action. The notice is attached hereto as Exhibit

5 C.

6 42. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Petitioner has

7 concurrently provided a copy of this a Petition to the California Attorney General. The notice is

8 attached hereto as Exhibit D.

9 43. Service of this Petition on the GMA satisfies any applicable service requirements
10 under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, subdivisions (a), (b), and (c).

11 44. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2),

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 Petitioner has attached and is hereby filing a notice of its election to prepare the administrative
13 record as Exhibit E.

14 VII. ATTORNEYS' FEES

15 45. In seeking to compel the GMA to lawfully discharge its mandatory public duty,
16 Petitioner is acting in its capacity as a private attorney general in the interest and for the benefit of

17 the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other appropriate legal
18 theory to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.

19 46. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant public
20 benefit by requiring the GMA to carry out its duties under SGMA in compliance with that law and

21 the implementing regulations promulgated by the California Department of Water Resources
22 ("DWR"). Issuance of the relief requests in this Petition will also confer a significant public
23 benefit by enforcing the environmentally protective mandates of CEQA. Further, issuance of the
24 relief requested in this Petition will further confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons
25 by virtue of the Allocation Ordinance's widespread applicability within the entire Basin and by
26 requiring the GMA, as a public a agency, to proceed in the manner required by law.

27 47. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, inter alia, that the GMA's actions in
28 approving the Allocation Ordinance were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious, without
11 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

- basis in law or fact, and thus constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Pursuant to Government
2 Code section 800, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and other applicable law, Petitioner is
3 entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs for bringing this action to redress the

4 GMA's arbitrary and capricious actions in connection with the GMA's approval of the Allocation

5 Ordinance.

6 48. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
7 attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioners, the Allocation

8 Ordinance might otherwise be deemed valid despite violating environmentally protective statutes

9 and other applicable law, a described in this Petition.

10 49. Petitioner has incurred and will continue to incur attorneys' and experts' fees, and
11 other costs and expenses due to this proceeding in amounts not yet ascertained, which amounts are

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOG 12 recoverable in this action under all applicable provisions of law, including Code of Civil
13 Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1036 and Government Code section 800.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - CCP § 1085

16 Failure to Comply with CEQA, Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.

17 50. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein as if set forth in full, each and every
18 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 49, inclusive, of this Petition.

19 51. In adopting the Allocation Ordinance, the GMA engaged in a prejudicial abuse of
20 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law under CEQA by wrongly determining

21 that the Allocation Ordinance is exempt from environmental review.

22 52. The Allocation Ordinance is not exempt from CEQA under Water Code section
23 10728.6 because it is not a GSP nor is it part of the preparation or adoption of a GSP. The
24 Allocation Ordinance is an implementation action taken pursuant to a GSP, which is not exempt

25 under Water Code section 10728.6.

26 53. The Allocation Ordinance is not exempt from CEQA under California Code of
27 Regulations, title 14, section 15061(b)(3) because the GMA failed to show there is no possibility
28 that the Allocation Ordinance could have a significant effect a on the environment. For instance, the
12 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

- GMA failed to show that, where landowners are granted an inadequate allocation as a result of the
2 ordinance, certain land use changes or heightened reliance on surface water supplies could not

3 have a significant impact on the environment.

4 54. Finally, the Allocation Ordinance is not exempt from CEQA under California Code

5 of Regulations, title 14, sections 15307 and 15308 because the GMA failed to show the Allocation
6 Ordinance would "assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement" of natural resources or
7 the environment by reducing environmental harm. Further, the GMA failed altogether to make a
8 showing in the record that the Allocation Ordinance would not result in a significant adverse
9 impact to the environment.

10 55. Implementation of the Allocation Ordinance will have significant adverse impacts
11 to the environment as described in the written and oral comments of Petitioner and other parties

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOG 12 contained in the administrative record.

13 56. The GMA's administrative record does not contain facts supporting any other
14 exemption from CEQA under the Water Code, California Code of Regulations, or other applicable

15 law.

16 57. By failing entirely to engage in any meaningful review under CEQA, the GMA
17 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
18 Consequently, the GMA's adoption of the Allocation Ordinance is invalid and must be set aside.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE - CCP § 1085

21 Agency Action Lacking Substantial Evidence/Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion

22 58. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein as if set forth in full, each and every
23 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 57, inclusive, of this Petition.

24 59. The GMA's adoption of the Allocation Ordinance was arbitrary, capricious, and

25 entirely lacking in evidentiary support, and so constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion, as
26 follows:

27 a. The Board relied solely on the flawed LPUG White Paper as the basis for
28 its decision to adopt the Allocation Ordinance;

1748930v5 13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

b. The analysis of irrigated and non-irrigated acreage contained in the LPUG
2 White Paper was conducted by certain individuals within the LPUG, not scientifically verified,

3 and thus incomplete;

4 C. The analysis contained in the LPUG White Paper failed to include certain
5 categories of water uses and water rights, including rights to industrial use and right to conserved
6 water, and was thus incomplete.

7 60. Article 4, section 4.28 of the Allocation Ordinance defines "undeveloped lands" to

8 mean lands which, as of December 31, 2015, had not made beneficial use of underlying

9 groundwater. Articles 7.2 relegates otherwise-superior dormant overlying rights to a "Reserve
10 Allocation Pool." Article 7.3.3 provides that the Reserve Allocation Pool for the East Las Posas

11 Management Area is limited to a total of 670 acre-feet per year. Article 7.3.6 of the Allocation

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 Ordinance provides that the Reserve Allocation Pool for the East Las Posas Management Area is
13 limited to only 320 acre-feet per year. These paltry allocations result in a significant diminution of
14 overlying groundwater rights without regard to the rights of the owners of land overlying the
15 Basin, including the priority of such rights, as established under California groundwater law. More
16 specifically, the GMA lacks authority to allocate groundwater in and to the Basin without
17 recognizing and protecting water right priorities established under California groundwater law.
18 Accordingly, Article 7.3.6 is arbitrary, capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

19 61. Article 6 of the Allocation Ordinance provides that initial allocations shall be the
20 greater of: (a) average annual extractions during 2009-2013, excluding any extractions that
21 incurred surcharges; (b) extractions in 2015 unless in excess of the extraction allocation for that
22 year; or (c) the minimum allocation as provided in Article 8 of the Allocation Ordinance. This
23 allocation formula diminishes groundwater rights in a manner that is contrary to California
24 groundwater law, which the GMA lacks authority to do. Accordingly, this provision is arbitrary,
25 capricious, and entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

26 62. The Allocation Ordinance does not include industrial operators as a distinct
27 category of water users in Article 8, and its conclusion that industrial users, as "other operators,"
28 shall be subject to a minimum allocation that is the Temporary Extraction Allocation "including
14 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

- all scheduled reductions and any variance granted." This provision is arbitrary, capricious, and is
2 entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

3 63. There is no evidence in the administrative record that the allocation system
4 contained in the Allocation Ordinance will facilitate or achieve sustainability. The GMA's
5 adoption of the Allocation Ordinance without any evidence that the allocation scheme contained
6 therein will facilitate or achieve Basin sustainability is arbitrary, capricious and entirely lacking in
7 evidentiary support, and so constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

8 64. For the foregoing reasons, the GMA abused its discretion in adopting the

9 Allocation Ordinance. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy available in the
10 ordinary course of law, and is thus entitled to a writ of mandate invalidating the Allocation

11 Ordinance.

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 DECLARATORY RELIEF - CCP § 1060

14 65. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein as if set forth in full, each and every
15 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 64, inclusive, of this Petition.

16 66. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060, "[a]ny person ..may ask for a
17 declaration of rights or duties, either alone or with other relief; and the court may make a binding
18 declaration of these rights or duties, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed at this
19 time." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060.)

20 67. An actual and present controversy has arisen and now exists between the Petitioner

21 and its members and the GMA relating to the validity of the Allocation Ordinance, for all the
22 reasons set forth above, including the GMA's interference with Petitioner's members' water

23 rights.

24 68. Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution requires in relevant part that "the
25 water resources of the State be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are
26 capable[.]"

27 69. The Allocation Ordinance will reduce allocations without a showing that the Basin

28 is in overdraft and without respect for water rights and water right priorities in violation of

1748930v5 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 California groundwater law, which have not been abrogated by SGMA.

2 70. The Allocation Ordinance ties water allocation to the entities that pump

3 groundwater, not to landowners that puts the groundwater to a reasonable and beneficial use.

4 Because many landowners rely on mutual water companies to pump water to which the landowner
5 retains overlying rights to, the Allocation Ordinance effectively re-allocate rights to groundwater
6 from landowners to mutual water companies. Accordingly, the Allocation Ordinance eliminates
7 or impermissibly curtails overlying landowners' -including Petitioner's members'- -rights to

8 extract groundwater from the Basin in violation of California groundwater law and Article X,
9 section 2 of the California Constitution.

10 71. The Allocation Ordinance is inequitable and arbitrarily eliminates or impermissibly
11 curtails preexisting water rights, including but not limited to overlying rights, as follows:

12 a. The Allocation Ordinance establishes initial allocations based upon the d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 13 greater of (1) average extractions from 2009-2013; or (2) extractions in 2015, unless in excess of
14 the extraction allocation for that year, without any determination that these years are representative
15 of hydrologic and water use conditions in the Basin;

16 b. The Allocation Ordinance ignores the fact that, for many years, the GMA
17 has prohibited new wells in the Basin;

18 C. The Allocation Ordinance ties water allocations to the pump, rather than the
19 land, benefiting mutual water companies and eliminating or impermissibly curtailing preexisting

20 water rights;

21 d. The Allocation Ordinance does not require mutual water companies to
22 report water on a parcel-by-parcel basis, allowing mutual water companies to effectively control

23 the water and where it is used;

24 e. The Allocation Ordinance arbitrarily defines "Available Yield" by reference

25 to cumulative extractions from the Basin during 2018;

26 f. The Allocation Ordinance provides that industrial allocations shall be the
27 applicable Temporary Extraction Allocation under Emergency Ordinance E, "including all
28 scheduled reductions and any variance granted," which requires industrial users to face a double
16 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 allocation reduction, while other users only face a single reduction. a

2 72. A declaratory judgment is necessary because the Petitioner is informed and
3 believes and thereupon alleges that the GMA is intending to proceed in implementing and
4 enforcing the Allocation Ordinance.

5 73. The Petitioner contends that the Allocation Ordinance fails to comply with
6 California law and is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that the GMA disputes these
7 contentions by the Petitioner.

8 74. For the foregoing reasons, the Coalition seeks a judicial determination that the

9 Allocation Ordinance is legally deficient, invalid, and inapplicable as adopted and/or has been
10 interpreted in a manner contrary to the requirements of California law.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 INVERSE CONDEMNATION d'TI ONVHE AHNMOG 13 75. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein as if set forth in full, each and every
14 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 74, inclusive, of this Petition.

15 76. The United States and California Constitutions require that whenever private
16 property is taken for public use, just compensation must be paid. (U.S. Const., Amend. 5; Cal.
17 Const., Art. 1, § 19.)

18 77. Groundwater rights are private property rights for which just compensation must be
19 paid when such rights are taken or damaged for public use.

20 78. The government may only impose a condition requiring an individual to give up a
21 constitutionally-protected private property right when the government demonstrates that there is

22 an "essential nexus" and "rough proportionality" between the required dedication and the
23 projected impact of the proposed activity. (See e.g., Nollan v. California Coastal Commission
24 (1987) 483 U.S. 825; Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) 512 U.S. 374 : Koontz v. St. Johns River
25 Water Management Dist. (2013) 570 U.S. 595, 604 (describing the unconstitutional conditions
26 doctrine as "an overarching principle…that vindicates the constitution's enumerated rights by
27 preventing the government from coercing people into giving them up").)

28 79. The Allocation Ordinance seeks to achieve sustainable groundwater management,
17 1748930v5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF,
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND DAMAGES

1 which is a public purpose.

2 80. The Allocation Ordinance will reduce groundwater extraction allocations without
3 respect to water rights and water right priorities and without : showing that the Basin is in

4 overdraft, in violation of California groundwater law.

5 81. The Allocation Ordinance is a physical taking because it will deprive Petitioner's
6 members of the reasonable and beneficial use of groundwater in the amounts, and subject to the
7 water right priorities, established under California groundwater law.

8 82. The Allocation Ordinance is regulatory taking because it will deprive Petitioner's

9 members of the use and enjoyment of their land, and effectively condemns a portion of such land
10 for the enjoyment and benefit of Respondent, mutual water companies, and the public at large

11 without due process or payment of just compensation. Petitioner's members reasonably expected

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 to be able to exercise their groundwater rights, and invested substantial sums consistent with that
13 expectation. The GMA's adoption of the Allocation Ordinance thus injures or diminishes the

14 value in Petitioner's members' interests in their land.

15 83. The Allocation Ordinance is an unconstitutional condition because the GMA has

16 dedicated a portion of Petitioner's members' groundwater rights to public use without being paid
17| just compensation. The conditions imposed by the GMA do not bear a reasonable relationship to

18 the impacts the GMA seeks to avoid by adopting the Allocation Ordinance, and the GMA has not
19 demonstrated that there is an essential nexus between the impacts of continued pumping without
20 the Allocation Ordinance in effect and the conditions imposed by the Allocation Ordinance.

21 84. The Allocation Ordinance thereby results a deprivation of property without due
22 process required by Article 1, sections 3(b)(4) and 7(a) of the California Constitution, and a taking

23 for public use without the payment of the just compensation required by Article 1, section 19 of

24 the California Constitution.

25 85. The GMA's taking of Petitioner's members' private property has damaged
26 Petitioner's members in an amount not yet fully ascertained, but which shall be determined
27 according to proof at trial.

2 VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ARTICLE X, SECTION 2

3 86. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein as if set forth in full, each and every

4 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 85, inclusive, of this Petition.

5 87. The California Constitution and the Water Code require that "water resources of the
6 State be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or
7 unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented." (Cal. Const., Art. X, vop 2;

8 Water Code, § 100.) The California Constitution and the Water Code further prohibit "waste or

9 unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use or unreasonable method of diversion of water."

10 (Id.)

11 88. The GSP's estimated sustainable yield for the Basin is arbitrarily and capriciously

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOC 12 low, and is the subject of pending litigation. The Allocation Ordinance attempts to manage the
13 Basin pursuant to the GSP's incorrectly low sustainable yield estimate. Enforcement of the
14 Allocation Ordinance will diminish Petitioners' members' water rights under California
15 groundwater law to extract groundwater from the Basin for reasonable and beneficial use.

16 89. If the Basin is managed pursuant to the GSP's estimated safe yield, the Basin's
17 groundwater resources will not be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are

18 capable, in violation of Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution.

19 90. The Allocation Ordinance will reduce allocations without respect for water right
20 priorities and without a showing that the Basin is in overdraft in violation of Article X, section 2

21 of the California Constitution.

Exhibit A

AN ORDINANCE TO ESTABLISH AN EXTRACTION ALLOCATION SYSTEM
FOR THE LAS POSAS VALLEY GROUNDWATER BASIN

ARTICLE 1. FINDINGS

1.1 The Las Posas Valley Groundwater Basin ("Basin") is located within Fox Canyon Groundwater
Management Agency ("Agency") and has been categorized by the California Department of
Water Resources as a high priority groundwater basin.

1.2 On December 13, 2019, the Agency adopted a groundwater sustainability plan for the Basin in
accordance with provisions of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act ("SGMA") and
regulations adopted by the California Department of Water Resources.

1.3 The groundwater sustainability plan identifies different management areas within the Basin
based on hydrogeologic differences.

1.4 The groundwater sustainability plan includes estimates of sustainable yield for each of the
management areas of the Basin which are less than the total average annual groundwater extractions from the management areas.

1.5 A comprehensive adjudication of the Basin is currently pending in the Superior Court of the State
of California for the County of Santa Barbara.

1.6 A stipulated agreement has been reached in the adjudication which provides a percentage of the
Basin allocation to the Ventura County Waterworks Districts.

1.7 SGMA and the Agency's enabling legislation authorize the Agency to eliminate excess pumping
by establishing an extraction allocation for all extraction facilities within the Basin.

1.8 The measures set forth in this ordinance are necessary to improve and protect the quantity and
quality of groundwater supplies within the Basin.

1.9 This ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to
Water Code section 10728.6 and CEQA Guidelines sections 15061(b)(3), 15307 and 15308.

1.10 The extraction allocations established under this ordinance are consistent with the land use
elements of the applicable general plans to the extent that there is sufficient sustainable yield in
the Basin to serve the land use designations therein.

ARTICLE 2. PURPOSE
The purpose of this ordinance is to facilitate the transition from the Agency's current groundwater
management programs to sustainable groundwater management under SGMA. It is not the purpose of
this ordinance to determine or alter water right entitlements, including those which may be asserted
pursuant to California Water Code sections 1005.1, 1005.2 or 1005.4. In the event the superior court
comprehensively determines groundwater rights to the Basin, it is the intent of the Board to amend this
ordinance in a manner consistent with water right priorities in any final judgment entered in the
adjudication.

Page 1 of 11

ARTICLE 3. PERIODIC REVIEW PROCEDURE

The Board will periodically review the effectiveness of this ordinance toward meeting its purpose. This
review shall occur at least once every five years. If necessary, this ordinance will be amended to ensure
that the sustainability goals of the groundwater sustainability plan are met.

ARTICLE 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS

5.1 Notwithstanding any other Agency ordinance provision to the contrary, including article 2 of
Emergency Ordinance E, the Executive Officer shall establish an operator's extraction allocation
for each extraction facility located within the Basin as set forth herein. The alternative extraction
allocations authorized under section 5.6 of the Agency Ordinance Code shall not be available to
an operator for extracting groundwater from the Basin. Except as expressly provided herein, the
provisions governing extraction allocations set forth in section 5.2 of the Agency Ordinance Code
shall apply to groundwater extractions from the Basin.

5.2 An extraction allocation established under this ordinance is assigned to an extraction facility. An operator with more than one extraction facility in a management area may combine the extraction allocations for the individual facilities. An operator seeking to combine extraction allocations assigned to extraction facilities in different management areas shall apply for a
variance under article 14.

5.3 Except as provided in section 5.6, all extractions during a water year in excess of the allocations
established by this ordinance shall be subject to extraction surcharges as provided in the Agency
Ordinance Code for extractions that exceed the historical and/or baseline allocation.

5.4 Extraction allocations may be transferred or adjusted as provided in article 11 of this ordinance.

5.5 In the event of a local, State, or Federal declaration of emergency with the potential to affect
water supplies within the Agency, at the next regularly scheduled meeting, the Board will
consider whether to allow an operator to request an adjustment of the extraction allocation as a
result of the emergency. The information required in support of the request will be set forth in a
Resolution adopted by the Board.

5.6 For the period beginning with the operative date of this ordinance of October 1, 2021, and ending
at the end of the water year on September 30, 2022, extraction surcharges shall be imposed on
extractions that exceed the greater of: (a) the allocation established by this ordinance; or (b) 80%
of an operator's reported extractions which did not incur surcharges in calendar year 2018 for
M&I and domestic operators, and crop year 2017/18 for agricultural operators.

ARTICLE 6. INITIAL ALLOCATION

Until such time as the reductions in article 13 are implemented and except as otherwise provided, an
operator's extraction allocation shall be the greater of: (a) average annual extractions during the Base
Period, excluding any extractions that incurred surcharges; (b) extractions in 2015 unless in excess of the
extraction allocation for that year; or (c) the minimum allocation as provided in article 8 of this
ordinance. In the event cumulative allocations established under this article 6 exceed the available yield
for a management area, extraction allocations for each operator within an allocation pool established
under article 7, other than minimum allocations, shall be reduced on pro rata basis to bring cumulative
allocations in line with available yield for the management area.

company, special district, or municipality.

9.4 Domestic and municipal and industrial well operators shall report the following:

9.4.1 Each assessor's parcel number being supplied with groundwater produced by the
operator's extraction facility.

ARTICLE 10. ALLOCATION CARRYOVER
Except as otherwise provided and subject to the provisions of this article, an unused extraction allocation
may be carried over for use in a subsequent water year. A maximum of fifty percent of an extraction
allocation shall be available for carry over. The first water extracted during any water year shall be
deemed to be an exercise of the carryover authorized by this article. The cumulative allocation carryover
shall not exceed one hundred percent of an extraction allocation. An unused carryover extraction
allocation is not transferable between operators, except in an Agency-approved water market, and shall expire five (5) years after it was accrued. Annual allocation carryover for extraction facilities combined
under a single operator in accordance with section 5.2 shall be evenly divided among the combined
extraction facilities. The Board may limit the use of carry over allocations consistent with the provisions

Page 7 of 11

of the groundwater sustainability plan, provided that any such limitation shall be imposed on all
operators on an equal basis.

ARTICLE 11. ALLOCATION TRANSFERS

11.1 Allocation transfers may be necessary to provide flexibility during and after the transition from
the Agency's current groundwater management program to sustainable groundwater
management under SGMA. Notwithstanding section 5.3 of the Agency Ordinance Code, transfers
of allocation established under this ordinance shall comply with the provisions of this article or
be allowed under an Agency-approved water market.

11.2 Groundwater extracted from the Basin may not be transferred for use outside of the Basin or
from one management area within the Basin to another. Operators with extraction facilities in
more than one management area may transfer allocation between commonly operated
extraction facilities, provided that any extractions in excess of the operator's allocation during
the water year in which the transfer occurs shall balance within a running five-year period.

11.3 Except as otherwise provided, transfers or temporary assignments of an extraction allocation are
authorized provided the Agency finds that it does not impede achievement of the sustainability
goals of the groundwater sustainability plan and would not be detrimental to an Agency-
approved water market. In making this determination, the Agency shall, at a minimum, consider
the location of the extraction facilities, the total quantity of groundwater extracted in any water
year, groundwater quality impacts of the transfer and whether the proposed transfer or temporary assignment could be approved under an Agency-approved water market. Requests for the transfer or temporary assignment of extraction allocations shall be submitted jointly by
the operators and owners involved and shall include the specific details of their proposal. To
ensure consistency with the sustainability goals of the groundwater sustainability plan, transfers
or temporary assignments of an extraction allocation shall be subject to conditions as determined
by the Executive Officer. A temporary assignment of allocation shall not exceed one year.

11.4 Where there is a sale a or transfer of : part of the acreage served by any extraction facility, the
extraction allocation for that facility shall be equitably apportioned between the real property retained and the real property transferred by the owner of the extraction facility. This
apportionment shall be approved by the Executive Officer who may modify the apportionment
to assure equity.

11.5 When irrigated acreage changes to M&I use, the extraction allocation used to irrigate the acreage
shall be transferred from the agricultural operator to the M&I operator on a one-to-one basis.

ARTICLE 12. RESERVE ALLOCATIONS

12.1 A reserve allocation may be established by the Executive Officer for lands which are developed
within the Basin after calendar year 2015. Allocations established under this article shall be
limited to availability of water from the Reserve Pool for the management area in which the
undeveloped land is located. The Agency may amend this ordinance to provide additional reserve
allocations consistent with any final judgment entered in the adjudication. The allocation
established under this article shall be set at an amount equal to the minimum allocation as

Page 8 of 11

established in article 8 and shall be subject to reduction in the same manner as a minimum allocation. Reserve allocations shall be established in the following order of priority:
12.1.1 Allocations for a new or increased water use served by a well that did not exist prior to
2016.

12.1.2 Allocations for well permits approved after 2015 for a new or increased water use. a
12.1.3 Allocations for well permits approved after 2015 a for a water use that existed during the
Base Period.

12.1.4 Allocations for a new or increased water use served by a well with an existing allocation.

12.2 An application for a reserve allocation shall be submitted by a land owner or authorized
representative no less than 90 days prior to the beginning of the water year in which it is to be
used and shall establish eligibility under one of the priority categories and include a description
of any prior extractions, type and amount of proposed water use, crop type and acreage involved
and such other information as required by the Executive Officer to carry out the purpose of this
ordinance. Agricultural operators applying for a reserve allocation a within a management area in
which the operator has an existing allocation shall demonstrate that the operator's existing water
use is less than the fiftieth percentile of all agricultural use within the management area on a per-
acre basis.

12.3 A reserve allocation shall expire and be made available for use on other lands unless the operator
demonstrates that groundwater extractions have been put to beneficial use on a continuous
basis for a period of 10 years.

ARTICLE 13. REDUCTION OF ALLOCATIONS
Extraction allocations, adjusted or otherwise, shall be subject to reduction according to a schedule and
method to be determined by the Board in order to bring the Basin to sustainable yield by the year 2040.
No reductions will occur until such time as a fixed minimum allocation for agricultural operators has
been established in accordance with article 8.

ARTICLE 14. VARIANCES

The Executive Officer may, on written request from a land owner or operator, grant a variance from the
requirements of this ordinance based on the standards set forth in this article.

14.1 Variance Purpose and Standards The sole purpose of any variance shall be to enable an owner
or operator to make reasonable use of groundwater in the same manner as other users of
groundwater in the Basin. Before any variance may be granted, the owner or operator must
establish and the Agency must determine that all of the following standards are met:
14.1.1 That there are special circumstances or exceptional characteristics applicable to the owner or operator which do not apply generally to comparable owners or operators in
the Basin; and

Page 9 of 11

14.1.2 That granting a variance will not confer a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations
upon other owners and operators in the Basin; and

14.1.3 That denial of a variance will result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships
inconsistent with the general purpose of this ordinance; and

14.1.4 That the granting of a variance will not be inconsistent with the groundwater
sustainability plan or the provisions of SGMA or with other regulations or ordinances of
the Agency or detrimental to the Agency's ability to improve and protect the quantity or
quality of groundwater supplies within the Basin; and
14.1.5 That the granting of a variance will not substantially impede the Agency's ability to
achieve sustainable groundwater management or the actual sustainability of
groundwater in the Basin.

14.2 Burden of Proof - A person seeking a variance shall have the burden of proving to the satisfaction
of the Executive Officer that the above standards can be met.

14.3 The Agency may recognize and consider other mitigating factors demonstrated or proposed by
the applicant. The Agency at its discretion may include and impose those or other factors as
conditions of granting the variance request.

14.4 The Executive Officer may consider any prior requests, permits, other Agency decisions, or enforcement actions associated with the owner or operator.

14.5 Any new or increased extraction allocation granted by the Agency pursuant to a variance request
may not be transferred without prior Agency approval.

14.6 Variance Procedures - All requests for a variance shall be filed in writing with the Agency.
