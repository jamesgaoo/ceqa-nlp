FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner and Plaintiff PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES NOW hereby alleges as follows:

2 Respondents and Defendants POWAY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, the POWAY

3 UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION, and MARIAN KIM PHELPS, acting

4 in her capacity as PUSD's Superintendent (collectively, "PUSD"), have acted unlawfully by failing

5 to comply with the State's mandates for the disposition of public school property. It is well settled

6 that school districts like PUSD hold public school property in trust for the State. As articulated by
our Supreme Court: "The beneficial ownership of property of the public schools is in the state."

8 (Hall v. City of Taft (1956) 47 Cal.2d 177.) Thus, it follows that school districts are deliberately
constrained by law to dispose of "surplus" property-land truly not and never needed for public
10 school useonly in an open and public manner such that community interests are fulfilled. PUSD

11 has acted deliberately to avoid public knowledge and scrutiny of its secret effort to convey by long

12 term lease and option agreement, property dedicated to public middle school use, to a specific private

13 business interest: Costco. This a lawsuit seeks a writ of mandate to set aside PUSD's unlawful acts

14 and to compel it to act in the open and public manner required by law, and to enjoin any further
15 wasteful conduct by PUSD with regard to the school property at issue.

16 THE PARTIES

17 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES NOW (*Petitioner") is a
18 California non-profit public benefit corporation with its principal place of business in the County of

23 | applicable state, federal and other laws.
24 2. Petitioner's members are residents within the City of San Diego and within the
25 boundaries of the Poway Unified School District. Petitioner's members are residents and taxpayers
26 within the geographical area of the Poway Unified School District and have been assessed for and
27 are liable to pay, or have paid within one year before the commencement of this action, property
28 taxes that fund the Poway Unified School District.

18 sections 1085 and 1094.5, sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code, and pursuant

19 to the California Constitution because the acts and omissions alleged herein occurred within the State
20 of California and because the causes of action alleged herein are not given by statute to other trial

21 courts.

22 8. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law and has exhausted all
23 available administrative remedies.

24 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the San Diego Superior Court because
25 Respondent and the subject property at issue are located in San Diego County.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 A. The Black Mountain Ranch Communitv

3 11. The community of Black Mountain Ranch encompasses 5,100 acres approximately

4 20 miles north of downtown San Diego, seven miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, most of which
5 abuts Black Mountain Ranch.

6 12. Black Mountain Ranch is comprised by Santaluz, a 3,690 acre development that was
7 approved by the City of San Diego for low residential density of one dwelling unit per four acres of

8 land - and - Del Sur which encompasses 1,410 acres. The number of residential units for the entire

9 Black Mountain Ranch subarea was limited to no more than 5,400 dwelling units.

10 13. In 1979, the City of San Diego adopted a tiered growth management system of its
11 lands and classified the entire City as Urbanized, Planned Urbanizing or Future Urbanizing. The

12 latter designation includes a 12,000 acre area stretching from Interstate 5 on the west to the Rancho
13 Penasquitos Community on the east. The Black Mountain Ranch subarea is part of this designation,
14  and its Subarea Plan (or Community Plan) sets forth land use patterns and policies which are intended
15 to guide the long term use and development of the area. The a Subarea Plan is a part of the City of
16 San Diego's General Plan and has the same force and effect as Municipal Code.

17 14. The Black Mountain Ranch Subarea Plan describes Black Mountain Ranch in terms

18 of its "regionally significant open space system" and community design which is a "traditional
19 community with distinct, yet complementary, neighborhoods emphasizing mixed uses and pedestrian
20 friendliness," which would promote a "rural character" and limit impacts to wildlife. Indeed, the
21 vast majority of the community was designated for parks and open space (67%) as opposed to 29
22 percent for residential development, 2 percent for schools and 2 percent for commercial and
23 employment uses.

24 15. The Subarea Plan further explains that the land use for Black Mountain Ranch is

25 focused on two villages surrounded by significant open space, recreational amenities, and low
26 density development. "Overall, it is e plan designed to work with the natural environment, to create
27 pleasing neighborhoods and exceptional recreational facilities."
28  ///
4
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

16. A unique and important characteristic of Black Mountain Ranch is its vast open

2 spaces which the City designated for preservation in order to promote regional resource protection.
3 The Subarea Plan explains that the goals of the open space elements in this area are to "maintain

4 natural resources ..., provide a critical corridor for the regional MSCP open space system that serves

5 as a wildlife linkage between regional parks and preserves, as well as a multi-resource habitat
6 preservation area," and to "link open space areas with interconnected trails to provide opportunities
for recreation, education and visual relief."

8 17. In furtherance of the community character outlined in the Subarea Plan, the Plan
9 restricts exterior lighting for both private and public facilities. The intensity of exterior lighting is
10 required to be "kept to a minimum to promote a rural character and limit impacts to wildlife which

11 occupy the extensive open space at Black Mountain Ranch" and exterior lights are required to be

12 directed downward.

13| B. The Poway Unified School District Middle School Site

14 18. The Black Mountain Ranch (Subarea Plan I) is located entirely within the Poway
15 Unified School District.

16 19. As of the time the Subarea Plan was adopted, and under the terms of the already-
17| approved development within the Black Mountain Ranch Vested Tentative Map and Development
18 Agreement, an agreement was entered into with the District to provide additional funding to it to
19| accommodate the increase in students in the Black Mountain Ranch area. The agreement also
20 provided for new school sites within the Black Mountain Ranch Vested Tentative Map and fair share
21 participation in the future development of new schools.

22 20. The new school sites are designated in the Subarea Plan and include five school sites

23 for future schools, including: portion of a middle school site along the south boundary of the Subarea
24 (the "BMR PUSD Middle School Site").

25 21. Given that the BMR PUSD Middle School Site is sited near a regional wildlife
26 corridor, the Subarea Plan explains that "fencing/barrier plantings would be required along the site
27 in the south" which would also redirect public access and restrict pet access. "Informational signage
28 and environmental education programs (including monitoring and restoration projects) are required
5
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 to heighten the awareness of the City's Multiple Species Conservation Program (MSCP) goals,

2 purpose and needs of Subarea I."

3 22. The Plan provides that "in the event any of the designated school sites in Subarea I

4 are not ultimately utilized for school purposes, they may be converted to other uses compatible with

5 adjacent areas." "In the case of the .., south middle school sites, uses consistent with the Low
6 Density resid ential designation are appropriate."(Emphasis added.) In other words, if the BMR
7 PUSD Middle School Site is not ultimately developed for a middle school, its alternative use

8 must be limited to a use akin to low density residential.

23. The BMR PUSD Middle School Site adjoins additional acreage that lies in the Torrey
10 Highlands Subarea Plan to the south of Black Mountain Ranch, which is also a designated middle
11 school site in the Torrey Highlands Subarea Plan (*TH PUSD Middle School Site"). Together with
12 the BMR PUSD Middle School Site and the TH PUSD Middle School Site, PUSD owns 27.22 acres
13 a of area designated for a middle school (the "PUSD Middle School Site").

14 24. 26.71 acres of the PUSD Middle School site is zoned for Agricultural use and .51
15 acres, residential.

16 25. Similar to Black Mountain Ranch, open space in Torrey Highlands is deemed by the
17| City to be integral to the North City Future Urbanizing Area open space network. The Torrey
18 Highlands Subarea Plan Preserve incorporates MSCP lands which provide large contiguous area
19 of natural open space to support native plants, animals and linkages between large areas of off-site
20 natural open space.

21 26. Torrey Highlands was designed around a functional open space and the implementing
22 principles of the area a include, inter alia, providing a critical corridor for the regional MSCP open
23 space system and creating a neighborhood focus through the use of pedestrian oriented design

24 principles and emphasizing bicycle, equestrian and pedestrian trails as the focal point of the
25| community.

26 27. Black Mountain Ranch (Santaluz and Del Sur) property owners are assessed a 1%
27 Proposition 13 Mello-Roos tax based on the purchase price of property in Black Mountain Ranch.

28 The homes in Torrey Highlands are also subject to Mello-Roos. These taxes are used to fund, in part,
6
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

PUSD schools.

2 C. PUSD Declares the PUSD Middle School Site "Surplus Property"

28. In 2012, PUSD formed a Real Property Advisory Committee or 7/11 Committee
("RPAC") to advise the PUSD Board on the use or disposition of PUSD real property not needed for
school purposes. The Committee was formed under the requirements set forth in Education Code
Sections 17387-17391.

29. On May 21, 2012, PUSD declared the PUSD Middie School Site as "surplus
8 property" not needed by the District for school classroom buildings, thus authorizing it to sell the
Site or to lease it for a term not exceeding 99 years.
10 D. PUSD Board of Education Unlawfully Conducts "Real Property Negotiations" in Non-

11 Public Closed Sessions Without a Waiver from the Statutory Competitive Bid Process.

12 30. By declaring the PUSD Middle School Site as "surplus property", any offer to sell or

13 lease the property was required to be done through an open and public competitive bidding process
14 absent a waiver from the State Board of Education ("SBE"). (See Ed. Code, § 17466 et seq.) As

15 PUSD admits, the "[b]id process does not allow negotiations with interested parties, but instead
16 Districts must establish the terms of lease or sale and assess bids based on total price."

17 31. As of today's date, PUSD maintains a website listing activities of the RPAC,
18 including its meetings in connection with the surplus property. Upon information and belief, PUSD
19 engaged in a number of closed sessions with "Real Property Negotiators"in violation of the Brown
20 Act open meeting law by omitting material information, including the negotiating parties and

21 whether instruction to the negotiator would concern price, terms of payment or both. By omitting

22 this material information and referring to the PUSD Middle School Site by APNs, the agendas not

23 only violated the Brown Act open meeting law, but undoubtedly suppressed public interest or
24 inquiry.

25 32. Upon information and belief, PUSD had entered into negotiations with an interested
26 party or parties in closed session in violation of not only the Brown Act, but also Education Code
27 section 17466 et seq. since PUSD had not procured a waiver from the competitive bidding process
28 from the State Board of Education as of the dates of the confidential closed sessions.
7
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

33. A mere two months after the final closed session with "Real Property Negotiators,"
the RPAC called a meeting wherein it discussed for the first time a SBE waiver from the competitive
bidding process.

34. The SBE has special authority by statute to grant conditional waivers of state law to

5 school districts under specified circumstances, upon application by a school district. This authority

6 is intended to ensure that if a school district cannot technically comply with certain requirements
such as number of teaching minutes in a day, or provide a specific program certification, the waiver

8 would allow uninterrupted continuity of the public schools, and avoid what might be an impossible
compliance situation (e.g., meeting a deadline that has now passed.) Waivers are not meant to skirt
10 public process or transparency.

11 35. If the SBE grants a waiver of state law, the applicant is bound to comply with all
12 conditions or limitations to that waiver. If the conditions are not complied with, the waiver is invalid

13 as are any actions taken under authority of such waiver.

14 36. In June 2019, PUSD posted a notice of public hearing in the San Diego Tribune solely
15 | with respect to its proposed SBE waiver of the Education Code establishing a competitive bid process
16 related to the potential sale or lease of surplus property at the PUSD Middle School Site. The notice
17 made no mention of Costco or any prospective buyer or lessee of the PUSD Middle School Site.

18 37. On June 27, 2019, the PUSD Board approved Resolution No. 112-2019 "Approving
19 Poway Unified School District's Request for State Board of Education Waiver" to provisions of the
20 Education Code establishing a competitive bid process related to the potential sale or lease of the

21 PUSD Middle School Site. PUSD noted that the "state process" would be "public process." Here

22 too, PUSD did not mention Costco or any prospective buyer or lessee of the PUSD Middle School

23 Site.

24 38. On November 6, 2019, the SBE approved PUSD's waiver from the competitive
25 bidding process with conditions. However, the SBE conditioned the approval and made clear that
26 the District was required to maximize the return on the sale or lease of the PUSD Middle School Site

27 (and other PUSD surplus properties) "in a manner that best serves its schools and community

28 through the RFP process..." which the District requested SBE find in connection with its waiver.
8
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1| (Emphasis added.) This "community interest" condition built into the SBE waiver is the law
2 applicable to PUSD's actions with respect to the PUSD Middle School Site (and other surplus
3 properties).

4 39. This requirement is also memorialized at Educ. Code 17387 which states:

5 It is the intent of the Legislature that leases entered into pursuant to this chapter
provide for community involvement by attendance area at the district level. This
6 community involvement should facilitate making the best possible judgments about
7 using the use of excess school facilities in each individual situation. It is the intent of the Legislature to have the community involved before decisions are made about
8 school closure or the use of surplus space, thus avoiding community conflict and
assuring building use that is compatible with the community's needs and desires.
0 [Emphasis added.]

10 40. The foregoing statute, section 17387, was not waived by SBE. The Black Mountain
11| Ranch and Torrey Highlands community needs and desires are fundamentally reflected in the
12| community plans (or Subarea Plans) referred to herein.

13 41. As a consequence of PUSD's waiver from the otherwise statutory competitive bidding
14| process, PUSD was subsequently (but not before) entitled to pursue requests for proposal for the sale

15 or lease of the PUSD Middle School Site or the exchange of property.

16 42. Following receipt of the SBE Waiver, PUSD wasted no time. The following week,

17 on November 14, 2019, the PUSD Board approved the issuance of a Request for Proposal for the
18 lease, sale or exchange of the PUSD Middle School Site (*RFP"), and on November 19, 2019, the
19| RFP issued with a response deadline of February 3, 2020.

20 E. PUSD Approves the Costco Deal in Secret without Considering the Other Responses to

21 the RFP in Violation of the Education Code and SBE Waiver.

22 43. Following expiry of the RFP deadline, on August 13, 2020, in closed session, the
23 PUSD Board approved a Letter of Intent with Costco Wholesale Companies which outlined the terms
24| of a lease with a right of first refusal. The minutes from the closed session state in pertinent part:

25 In connection with the District's previously issued Request for Proposal for the
Property, the Board took action, by unanimous vote to approve an updated Letter
26 of Intent from Costco Wholesale for the proposed Ground Lease of the Property,

27 and has directed the negotiation of an appropriate Option Agreement and
Ground Lease for such transaction. At a future date Board Meeting open

28 session, the Board will be presented a summary of each received final Request

9
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

for Proposal response, and action may be taken to formally approve the proposal
2 which is most beneficial to the District. [Emphasis added.]

3 44. The foregoing minutes are nothing short of remarkable. Education Code section
17472 (as amended by the SBE waiver) required PUSD to make public each proposal in response to
the RFP and to examine them in a public session. Moreover, the waiver and Education Code section
17387 required PUSD to consider the community's best interests in connection with the Costco deal,
and separately, to assure that the proposed use of the site was compatible with the community's needs

8 and desires as set forth in the Black Mountain Ranch Subarea Plan.

45. Contrary to PUSD's foregoing obligations, it not only concealed from the public
10 Costco's response to the RFP and its examination of it, but went further to approve the LOI and

11 negotiations regarding the option agreement and ground lease with Costco without any public
12 participation. Adding insult to injury, the minutes reflect that PUSD elected to move forward with
13 the Costco deal without even considering the other responses to the RFP. Lastly, the minutes make
14| no mention of the community or its interests, much less how the Costco deal was in the community's
15 best interests and how the Costco use of the site was compatible with the community's needs and
16 desires. Moreover, PUSD made no effort whatsoever to ascertain what those interests might be, and
17 made no mention of the Black Mountain Ranch Subarea Plan the baseline community "interest"
18 document.

19 46. On September 10, 2020, the PUSD Board held yet another closed session, the minutes
20| of which unlawfully state "conference with real property negotiator" without more. The agenda for
21 the closed session states the same in violation of the express requirements of the Brown Act.
22 47. On the same date, the PUSD Board held a sham public hearing where it presented the
23 three responses to the RFP (despite its earlier secret approval of the Costco LOI on August 13, 2020).
24 Notably, this is the first time "Costco" was mentioned by PUSD to the public. Unsurprisingly, the
25 PUSD Board concluded the meeting with its approval to enter into an option agreement and ground
26 lease with Costco. Here too, PUSD failed to explain how the Costco deal was in the best interests of
27 the community or how the Costco use was compatible with the community's needs and desires.
28 Given that the Black Mountain Ranch Subarea Plan makes clear that any alternative use a to a school
10
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 at the PUSD Middle School Site required low density residential use, which a Costco is patently
2 not, it is evident that PUSD could not make the required findings set forth in its SBE waiver and
3 Education Code section 17387. In addition, the PUSD presented demonstrably bogus apples-to-

4 oranges financial benefit information, grossly and misleadingly overstating the economic benefit of

5 the Costco proposal. PUSD could not have meaningfully evaluated the benefit of the Costco proposal

6 against the other proposals without first performing basic value normalizing functions, such as
7 addressing present value of the various proposals. PUSD failed to do any of that.

8 48. Following the September 10, 2020 meeting, PUSD failed to make any of the

9 responses to the RFP public until Plaintiff's Counsel sent public records act request to the PUSD
10 | after which it finally posted the responses to its website. However, notably, PUSD failed to provide
11 all information upon which it relied in making its decision to approve the Costco deal which was the
12 singular request of the public records act request.

13 49. Following the filing of the original lawsuit, in apparent recognition of PUSD's
14 defective RFP process and action approving the Costco deal, PUSD hosted what it called a "town
15 hall meeting" - a Zoom meeting controlled by PUSD public relations staff, which was not a public
16 meeting of any kind (it was not noticed nor agendized, nor did the PUSD Board attend). At that
17 meeting, PUSD apprised the community that it had selected Costco, and notified the community that
18 it would be Costco's job to deal with the Community Plan and its use restrictions for the PUSD
19 Middle School Site (despite this squarely being PUSD's obligation prior to disposing the Site).
20 Subsequent to the "town hall meeting,' PUSD then attempted to characterize the after-the-fact "town

21 hall meeting" as satisfying its public participation requirements set forth above, when clearly it did

22 not.

23 50. On or about December 17, 2020 Petitioners sent PUSD a letter outlining its objections

24 to the disposition of the Site on the basis of reputable financial analysis that showed the selection of
25 Costco was not in the best interests of PUSD, that PUSD did not comply with its community
26 participation requirements and its approval violated CEQA. Notably, in response to Petitioner's
27 public records act requests, PUSD has not produced any financial data to either rebut Petitioner's

28 /1/
11
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

financial data or to support its approval of the Costco deal. As a consequence, it is presumed that
2| PUSD has no financial data to support its approval.
3 F. PUSD Violated Ed. Code $ 17464 and Gov. Code 8 54220 by Entering into a Lease with

4 an Option to Purchase Without First Offering the PUSD Middle School Site to

Designated Entities for Park and Recreational Purposes.

51. To this date, PUSD has failed to disclose the terms of its "option agreement" and
"ground lease" with Costco to the public. However, it admits on multiple occasions that it authorized

8 entry into an option agreement with Costco. In other documents, PUSD couches the option as a
9 "qualified right of first refusal" which would allow Costco to ultimately purchase the property.

10 52. Education Code section 17464 makes clear that where a school district intends to lease

11 surplus property with an option to purchase, it must first offer the property to a group of designated

12 entities for park and recreational purposes. The entities must be allowed sixty days after receiving
13 notice to respond and are entitled to a negotiation period of ninety days after notice. The foregoing
14 notice was required to be sent prior to the disposal of the property and also prior to participating in
15 negotiations to dispose of the PUSD Middle School Site. See Govt. Code § 54222(b)(1)-(4). PUSD
16 failed to do this.

17 53. Further, prior to participating in negotiations to dispose of the PUSD Middle School
18 Site, the District was required to send written notice of availability for the purpose of developing low
19 and moderate-income housing to any local public entity, within whose jurisdiction the surplus land

20 .2 located. See Govt. Code § 54222(a)(1). Here too, PUSD failed to comply with the lawinstead
21 committing to a LOI and "option agreement" and ground lease vis-à-vis its foregoing approvals
22| without noticing the designated agencies.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Writ of Mandamus [Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085 and 1094.5J)

25 54. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained above and
26 below as though the same were set forth in full herein.

27 55. Respondent unlawfully identified Costco as the most beneficial proposal for the
28 disposition of the Surplus Real Property known as the Black Mountain Ranch Southern Site in
12
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

response to its Request for Proposals, and approved entering into an Option Agreement and Ground
2 Lease with Costco for the lease of the Black Mountain Ranch Southern Site without following the
3 procedures mandated by law as follows:

4 Respondent failed, inter alia, to obtain community input and make a decision based on

5 the best interests of the community and assure that the proposed use of the property was

6 compatible with the community's needs and desires as required by state law and the
7 explicit approval condition to do so in the SBE waiver upon which Respondent relies.

8- Upon information and belief, on multiple occasions Respondent engaged in real property
9 negotiations with an interested party or persons without adhering to the competitive

10 bidding process in the absence of a SBE waiver in violation of Ed. Code § 17466 et seq.
11 Further, Respondent failed to comply with Ed. Code § 17472 (as amended by the SBE

12 waiver) which required PUSD to make public each proposal in response to the RFP and
13 a to examine them in a public session. Instead, Respondent secretly conducted its review

14 of the Costco proposal and entered into a LOI with it, approving the negotiations of a

15 ground lease and option agreement and without first considering the other responses to

16 the RFP.

17 Further, Respondent failed to first offer the property to a group of designated entities for

18 park and recreational purposes depriving them of an opportunity to negotiate for the
19 purchase of the site in violation of Ed. Code § 17464.
20 56. For each of the foregoing reasons, Respondent failed to proceed in the manner

21 required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that its decisions are not supported
22 by the findings and the findings are not supported by the law. As a consequence, each of the
23 foregoing reasons independently compels setting aside the District's August 13, 2020 and September

24 10, 2020 approvals set forth above.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Taxpayer Waste [Code Civ. Proc., § 526a])

27 57. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained above and
28 below as though the same were set forth in full herein.
13
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 58. Respondent is prohibited from engaging in any "illegal expenditure of, waste of, or

2 injury to, the estate, funds, or other property of' Respondent pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

3 section 526a.

4 59. Respondent engaged in taxpayer waste by, inter alia, agreeing to enter into an Option

5 Agreement and Ground Lease with Costco for the disposition of the Black Mountain Ranch Southern
6 Site without complying with the statutorily mandated requirements and without fulfilling the
7| obligations set forth by the California Department of Education.

8 60. Respondent's actions as described herein constitute waste and are in violation of Code
9 of Civil Procedure section 526a thereby entitling Petitioner to an injunction preventing Respondent

11 applicable laws and regulations.
12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Declaratory Relief)

14 61. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained above and
15 below as though the same were set forth in full herein.
16 62. An actual and substantial controversy has arisen between Plaintiff and Respondent
17 with respect to the validity of the actions taken by PUSD.

18 63. Plaintiff desires a judicial determination with respect to the legal force and effect of
19 | the actions taken by PUSD. Such declaration is necessary at this time so that Plaintiff and PUSD can
20 ascertain the legal force and effect of the actions taken by PUSD, and is appropriate because it will

21 obviate the need for future legal action between the parties regarding the same subject matter.
22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of CEQA)

24 64. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained above and

25 below as though the same were set forth in full herein.

26 65. "CEQA applies to activities proposed to be carried out by a public agency that both

14
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT,

Cal.5th 1171, 1191.)

2 66. Public Resources Code section 21065 defines project as "[a]n activity that involves

3 the issuance to a person of a lease ..

4 67. PUSD's discretionary decision to approve the Letter of Intent to enter into an Option
5 Agreement and Ground Lease with Costco constitutes a project under CEQA for which PUSD must
6 conduct meaningful environmental review before taking action.

7 68. PUSD has failed to engage in any environmental review under CEQA prior to its

8 approval of the Option Agreement and Ground Lease and even so following Petitioner's demand that
9 it comply with the statute.
10 69. As a result of the foregoing defects, PUSD prejudicially abused its discretion by, inter
11 alia, approving the Letter of Intent to enter into an Option Agreement and Ground Lease with Costco.
12 Accordingly, PUSD's determination must be set aside.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

15

notification that Protect Our Community Now intends to amend its Verified Petition and Complaint
against the Poway Unified School District ("PUSD") for its approval of the Letter of Intent to enter into

A public interest would be served if PUSD were to voluntarily comply with its statutory duties in

contact my office immediately.
