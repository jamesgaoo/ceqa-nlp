NOTICE TO ATTORNBY GENERAL

L The Petition

2 challenges the actions of the Respondent CITY OF
in approving the construction/maintenance LOS ANGELES ("City")

3 four dwelling units and other of a 70,310 square foot, 78 guest rooms hotel with
uses ("Project") located at 1011
4 Electric Avenue and 1021-1051 S.

5 Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, California ("Site") in the City. The Petitioners allege, among

6 other things, that the City approved the Project based upon an erroneous interpretation that this nearly 100 percent commercial hotel Project was entitled to a mixed-use exemption from lot consolidation restrictions, stricter density restrictions, and other development controls. In doing

9 so, the Project conflicts with fundamental land use policies and controls intended to increase

10 housing and avoid impacts by co-locating residents to nearby services. However, the Project's Environmental Impact Report failed to disclose,
11 analyze, or mitigate these glaring land use

12 consistency impacts when approving the Project. The City's actions here result in less housing

13 and greater environmental impacts, which serve as a dangerous precedent for future projects

14 seeking increased development rights based on providing a scintilla of housing (here four units v.

15 78 hotel rooms). The Petitioners seek to have the land use entitlements and CEQA environmental

16 approvals set aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper.

17 Petitioners urge the Attorney General to review the Petition.

28 (collectively, "Respondents") and hereby allege as follows:
-]-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. By this Action, Petitioners challenge the City's authorization of the demolition of

3 roughly 6,214 square feet ("SF") of existing uses (e.g., restaurant, private school, office space,

4 surface parking lot) and the construction/maintenance of a 70,310-SF, 78 guest rooms hotel with

5 four dwelling units and other uses (e.g., three restaurants, office space, spa, and retail

6 components) ("Project") located on eight-consolidated lots at 1011 Electric Avenue and 1021-

7 1051 S. Abbot Kinney Boulevard in Venice, California ("Site") in the City.

8 2. In furtherance of the Project, Real Party requested under Case No. ZA-2012-3354-

9 CUB-CUB-CDP-MEL-WDI-SPP-SPR various local land use approvals including Conditional
10 Use Permits, Coastal Development Permit ("CDP"), ' Site Plan Review, Project Permit
11 Compliance Review, Mello Act Compliance Review, Waiver of Dedication and/or
12 Improvements) (collectively "Entitlements"). So too, under Case No. ENV-2016-4321-EIR, the
13 Project included the certification of an Environmental Impact Report (i.e., State Clearinghouse
14 No. 2016061033) ("EIR"), Mitigation Monitoring Reporting Program, Statement of Overriding
15 Considerations, and other associated findings (collectively "CEQA Approval").
16 3. Petitioners maintain that the City's granting of the Entitlements and CEQA
17 Approval (collectively "Project Approvals") violated zoning provisions within the Los Angeles
18 Municipal Code ("LAMC" or "Code"), applicable land use plans, the California Environmental

19 Quality Act (Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA"), and "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal.

20 Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.).

21 4. Specifically, as alleged in the First Cause of Action, the City abused its discretion

22 when granting the Entitlements based on an erroneous interpretation that this nearly 100 percent
23 commercial hotel Project was entitled to a mixed-use exemption from lot consolidation

24 restrictions, stricter density restrictions, and other development controls. This action was contrary

25 Only the CDP is subject to administrative appeal to the California Coastal Commission
26 ("CCC"), which POWER and LOCAL 11 timely filed on January 15, 2021 and currently pending CCC's substantial issue determination. (See generally Pub. Res. Code § 30625; Encinitas
27 Country Day School, Inc. V. California Coastal Com. (2003), 108 Cal.App.4th 575, 585.) Out of abundance of caution due to short statute of limitation periods (discussed infra par. 6), Petitioners
28 challenge the City's approval of the CDP in that it was granted in violation of applicable zoning/CEQA requirements discussed herein.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to LAMC §§ 12.22-A.23, 13.09-B.3, 12.03 and applicable land use plans including the Venice

2 Coastal Zone Land Use Plan ("LUP"), Venice Coastal Zone Specific Plan ("Specific Plan"), and

3 Venice Community Plan ("Community Plan") that collectively limit the mixed use exemption to

4 "predominantly residential" developments that co-locate residents to nearby services. As such,

5 the City failed to disclose, analyze, or mitigate glaring land use consistency impacts in making the

6 CEQA Approval, which was also an abuse of discretion (as alleged in the Second Cause of

7 Action). The City's actions here result in less housing and serve as a dangerous precedent for

8 future projects that may seek increased development rights based on providing a scintilla of

9 housing (here four units v. 78 hotel rooms). The City's actions defining this hotel Project as

10 "predominantly residential" defy common sense and the Code. This ultimately subverts the

11 purpose of the mixed-use exemption that is designed to increase housing opportunities--not

12 hotels.

13 5. For these reasons, Petitioners seek, among other things, that this Court invalidate

14 the Project Approvals until the City satisfies all State and local zoning/CEQA requirements.

15 JURISDICTION

16 6. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 and Code

17 Civ. Proc §§ 1085 or 1094.5. The parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County.

18 The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the City's granting of the

19 Entitlements per Gov. Code § 65009, and timely brought within 30 days of Respondents' posting

20 of the Project's CEQA Notice of Determination ("NOD") pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.

21 Petitioners served a Notice of Intent to file this Action on the City by mail before filing this

22 Action pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5. (See "Exhibit A" attached hereto.) Concurrent

23 with the filing of this Action, Petitioners will timely notify the Attorney General of the State of

24 California of the filing of this Action in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

25 PARTIES

26 7. Petitioner ALBA LUZ PRIVADO is an individual and resident of the City and

27 lives roughly one-third of a mile from the Project Site. Ms. Privado visits the Project vicinity at

28 least weekly, often daily, and will be affected by the negative impacts of the Project due to the
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 City's failure to comply with zoning/CEQA requirements. Her proximity and nexus to the Project

2 Site, alone, is sufficient to establish a beneficial interest and standing to bring this Action.2

3 Furthermore, Petitioner has public interest standing given the Project involves the City's duty to

4 enforce applicable zoning laws.3

5 8. Petitioner PEOPLE ORGANIZED FOR WESTSIDE RENEWAL is a

6 membership-based California public benefit corporation located at 5617 Hollywood Boulevard,

7 90028. Founded in 1999 and incorporated in 2003, POWER's mission is to improve the quality of

8 life for low- and moderate-income people in Westside Los Angeles, particularly on affordable

9 housing, quality education, and conimunity safety issues. To this end, POWER and its members

10 have organized several buildings in the Venice area. POWER has associational standing because
11 its members would individually have standing given they reside/frequent near the Site, would be

12 impacted by the Project, the interests protected by this Action directly relate to the organization's

13 chief purposes, and the relief requested is broad-based not needing participation of individual

14 members in this lawsuit.4 Furthermore, POWER brings this Action to enforce public duty and,
15 thus, has public interest standing.3

16 9. Petitioner UNITE HERE LOCAL 11 is a labor union representing more than

17 25,000 workers employed in hotels, restaurants, airports, sports arenas, and convention centers
18 throughout Southern California and Phoenix, Arizona. Its members, including hundreds who live

19 or work in the City, join together to fight for improved living standards and working conditions.

20 Local 11's members reside/frequent near the Site and will suffer from Project impacts,

21 particularly related to inadequate housing and environmental impacts, which are core issues to the

22 function of Local 11. Hence, Local 11 has both public interest standing and associational standing

to bring this Action.3, 4 Furthermore, unions have standing to litigate land use and environmental

2 claims, particularly when they have long-standing involvement in said matters (as is the case here

3 with Local 11).5

4 10. Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES is a municipal corporation and Charter

5 City under the State Constitution with its elected City Council and Planning Department

6 responsible for enforcing State/local planning laws and serving as the lead agency under CEQA.

7 11. Real Party in Interest WYNKOOP PROPERTIES, LLC is believed to be a

8 California corporation domiciled and operating in Los Angeles County and recipients of the

9 Project Approvals, as identified in the NOD.

10 12. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate, or otherwise of Respondents

11 named herein as DOES 1 through 1 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who, therefore, sue

12 said Respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Action to show the true names

13 and capacities when they have been ascertained.

14 13. Petitioners, individually and through its members, objected to the Project

15 Approvals orally, in writing, and/or by filling speaker cards during the public comment period

16 before the close of the Project's public hearings. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative

17 remedies, the City's determinations are final, and no further City administrative appeals are

18 available under State or local law. All issues submitted for judicial review in this Action were

19 sufficiently raised and disputed with the City before the Project Approvals were finally approved.

20 The City was given notice and the opportunity to act in compliance with the LAMC, CEQA, and

21 other applicable laws but failed to do so.

22 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

23 14. Here, Petitioners are informed and believe that the Project was granted deviations

24 from normal Code requirements to allow: consolidation of eight lots encompassing an entire City-

25 block, a larger floor-area-ratio of 1.5:1, only four dwelling units comprising merely three percent

26 of the Project's total square footage, and in some places less than a five-foot setback. These

27 See e.g., Bakersfield Citizens v. Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1198; Environmental
28 Protection Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 480.
-5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project attributes deviate from standards under applicable plans, including the LUP, Specific Plan

2 and Community Plan, as well as the Code. (See e.g., LUP, p. Il-21 - II-22 [Policy I. B. 7.];

3 Specific Plan § 9.A [General Land Use and Development Regulations]; Community Plan, pp. I-2

4 I-3, III-3 -III-5, III-7 [affordable housing goals/objectives]; LAMC § 12.22-A.23 [Mini-

5 Shopping Centers and Commercial Corner Development].)

6 15. The City authorized all these deviations and ultimately the Project Approvals via a

7 mixed-use exemption designed to encourage housing (co-locating housing near commercial

8 services). The City did so based on an erroneous interpretation of three Code sections. However,

9 these sections make clear that the mixed-use exemption can be granted only when the

10 development is one with predominantly residential uses. (LAMC § 12.22-A.23.d(1).) Under the
11 Code, commercial uses explicitly include hotel guest rooms (LAMC § 13.09-B.3) and hotel guest
12 rooms are not dwelling units intended for long-term residency (LAMC § 12.03). Thus, it is

13 indisputable that the Project's 78-hotel guest rooms are defined as "hotel" "guest rooms" under
14 Section 12.03 and, thus, considered "commercial uses" under Section 13.09.B.3. With roughly 97
15 percent of the Project considered non-residential, no reasonable person could conclude that this

16 Project consists of "predominantly residential" uses as required under Section 12.22-A.23(d)(1).

17 The City's action to exempt the Project from lot-consolidation restrictions, stricter density limits,
18 and other development controls is an abuse of discretion that runs afoul of the spirit and language
19 of the Code that allows deviations from the normal Code requirements to encourage housing - not
20 hotels.

21 16. Additionally, under the Code, a *hotel' may "not include more than one dwelling

22 unit[,l" and an 'apartment hotel' includes "both two or more dwelling units and six or more guest

23 rooms ...." (LAMC § 12.03 [Definitions].) Furthermore, the City Planning precedent

24 demonstrates that guest rooms and dwelling units located in an apartment hotel are to be used for

25 long-term tenancies (i.e., longer than 30 days) and do not allow for short-term stays (i.e., 30 days
26 or less). Here, however, the Project includes four dwelling units and 78-guest rooms allowed for

27 short-term stays. Thus, the Project is considered an 'apartment hotel' that should have allowed

28 only long-term stays or sought appropriate zoning relief (e.g., variance).

1 17. Furthermore, the above inconsistencies with applicable Code and plan

2 requirements were not identified in the Project's EIR. Deviations from the zoning requirements

3 come at the expense of housing and the environmental impacts that otherwise would be avoided

4 when co-locating residents near services--the very purpose and intent of the mixed-use

5 exemption under the Code and applicable plans. Failure to identify and analyze these land use

6 inconsistencies masked Project impacts, allowed Respondents to avoid mitigation and forego

7 adequate project alternatives-such as incorporating more dwelling units and true housing into

8 the Project.

9 18. Notwithstanding the above-described deficiencies, the Project's Entitlements were

10 approved by the City's West Los Angeles Area Planning Commission (acting in its appellate

11 capacity) on or around October 29, 2020. On or around December 9, 2020, the Project's EIR was

12 approved by the City Council (acting in its appellate capacity), and Respondents filed the

13 Project's CEQA NOD with the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder on or around December

14 24, 2020.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Zoning Violations; Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5)

17 19. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-18 as if fully set forth herein.

18 20. Actions involving quasi-judicial zoning approvals, such as the case here, are

19 subject to an abuse of discretion standard, which is established when the local agency: (a) has not

20 proceeded in the manner required by law; (b) the decision is not supported by findings; and/or (c)
21 the evidence docs not support the findings. (See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5.)

22 21. Here, the City failed to require a variance or other appropriate entitlements (with

23 associated findings supported by substantial evidence) to authorize the Project's deviations from

24 the Code and applicable land use plans. No reasonable person could read the plain language of

25 LAMC §§ 12.22-A.23.d(1), 13.09-B.3, 12.03 and find the Project qualified for a mixed-use

26 exemption from the lot-consolidation restrictions, stricter density limits, and other development

27 controls. (See Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural etc. County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62

28 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1338 [citing No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1987) 196 Cal. App. 3d 223,
-7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 243].) The exemption granted the Project are only allowed under Code § 12.22-A.23.d(1) for

3 predominantly residential useswhich this Project is not. This determination by the City, which

4 was the basis for the Code exemptions and Project Entitlements was clearly erroneous. (See

5 Horwitz v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.) The City's actions defining

6 this hotel Project as "predominantly residential" defies common sense and the Code. Also, due to

7 the Project's glaring inconsistency with applicable plans, the City's Code required findings for

8 the Entitlements are not supported by substantial evidence. (See e.g., LAMC §§ 11.5.7-C.2,
12.20.2-G.1, 12.24-E, 16.05-F.)

9 22.

10 Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

11 sought in this Action. Petitioners, individually and through its members, have a beneficial interest

12 in the City's compliance with the zoning requirements, which requires greater housing on the Site

13 in order to qualify for a mixed-use exemption from lot-consolidation restrictions, stricter density

14 limits, and other development controls and to be consistent with applicable plans. The City's

15 actions here result in less housing and serve as a dangerous precedent for future projects that may

16 seek increased development rights based on a scintilla of housing. This ultimately subverts the

17 purpose of the mixed-use exemption to increase housing opportunities--not hotels. All

18 Petitioners have public interest standing to enforce the City's public duty to follow its zoning

19 laws and preserve the integrity of the Code and applicable plans, which serve significant policy

20 benefits to all persons within the Venice community. (See La Mirada Avenue Neighborhood

21 Assn. of Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158-1159 [Supreme

22 Court has consistently recognized the importance of preserving the integrity of a locality's

23 governing general plan for zoning, which vindicates "significant policy benefits" to persons living|

24 near the project, persons living within the planning area, and "all residents of the City who benefit

25 from the trial court's ruling that holds the City Council's zoning decisions to the letter and spirit

26 of the municipal code.".) Furthermore, because housing is a chief purpose of both POWER and

27 Local 11, Petitioners have associational standing to vindicate these rights.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (CEQA Violations; Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5)

3 23. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-22 as if fully set forth herein.

24. CEQA actions challenging an EIR, such as the case here, are subject to an abuse of

5 discretion standard that is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by

6 law or if the determinations or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. (See Pub. Res.

7 Code § 21168.5; see also Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553,

8 564.)

9 25. The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the

10 act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment. (See Cmtys, for a

11 Better Env't v. Cal. Res. Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.) A chief purpose of CEQA is to

12 inform decision makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a

13 project. (See e.g., CEQA § Guidelines § 15002(a)(1); see also Lincoln Place Tenants Ass'n. v. City

14 of Los Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 443-44.) Another chief purpose is to avoid or reduce

15 environmental damage by requiring implementation of "environmentally superior" alternatives

16 and all feasible mitigation measures. (Id., subds. (a)(2) & (3); see also Citizens of Goleta Valley,

17 supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564-565.) To these ends, if a project has a significant effect on the

18 environment, the agency may approve the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or

19 substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where feasible" and that any

20 significant unavoidable effects on the environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns."

21 (Pub. Res. Code § 21081; see also CEQA Guidelines 15092(b)(2), subds. (A) & (B).)

22 26. Here, the Project's EIR did not identify, analyze, mitigate, or seek an alternative

23 that addresses the land use inconsistencies between the Project and the Code and applicable plans

24 (e.g., LUP, Specific Plan, Community Plan) (discussed supra). This land use inconsistency

25 analysis was required under CEQA. (See e.g., CEQA Guidelines § 15125(d); Pfeiffer v. City of

26 Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1566; Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma

27 County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859, 881.) There does not need to be a direct

28 conflict to trigger this requirement; even if a project is "incompatible" with the "goals and
-9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

policies" of a land use plan, the EIR must assess the divergence between the project and the plan,

2 and mitigate any adverse effects of the inconsistencies. (See Napa Citizens for Honest

3 Government v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 378-79; see also

4 Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903 [holding under CEQA that a

5 significant impact exists where project conflicts with local land use policies].) This did not occur

6 here.

7 27. By not identifying said land use inconsistencies, the City failed to serve CEQA's

8 chief purpose of informed decision making. So too, this failure infects the City's findings on the
9 adequacy of the mitigation measures, alternative analysis, and Statement of Overriding
10 Considerations. (See e.g., CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15093; Sierra Club v. Contra Costa
11 County (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1223-1224 [assertions set forth in the statement of
12 overriding considerations must be supported by the final EIR or information in the record]; City
13 of Marina v. Board of Trustees of California State University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368 [where
14 feasibility of mitigation lacks substantial evidence, "statement of overriding circumstances is
15 invalid necessarily follows."]; accord County of San Diego v. Grossmont-Cuyamaca Community
16 College Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 86, 108, fn. 18.)

17 28. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief
18 sought in this Action. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals and allow
19 the development of the Project, Petitioners, its members, and the public will suffer irreparable
20 harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project will be built, operations
21 commence, and significant adverse impacts on land use consistency and the environmental

22 impacts avoided when co-locating residents to services. So too, all Petitioners have public interest
23 standing to enforce the City's duty to follow the State's vital environmental laws, which have
24 routinely been recognized by the courts as important public rights

RE: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION; VENICE PLACE PROJECT (DCP CASE NOS. CPC-2012- 3354 AND ENV-2016-4321; STATE CLEARINGHOUSE # 2016061033)
Dear City Clerk:

This office serves as counsel to Alba Luz Privado, People Organized For Westside Renewal, and UNITE HERE Local 11 (collectively "Petitioners"). This letter is provided to the City of Los Angeles ("City") in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5.

Please take notice that pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167, Petitioners will file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") challenging the City's approval of the above-referenced hotel development ("Project"), including various land use entitlements (e.g., Conditional Use Permits, Coastal Development Permit, Site Plan Review, Project Permit Compliance Review, Mello Act Compliance Review, and Waiver of Dedication and/or Improvements) finally approved on or around October 29, 2020; and its California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") certification of Environmental Impact Report (State Clearinghous No. 2016061033) ("EIR") finally approved on or
around December 9, 2020.

The Petition will allege, among other things, that the City did not comply with CEQA due to land use inconsistency neither identified nor mitigated in the EIR, nor accounted for in the EIR's project alterantive analysis, which ultimately infected the adequacy of the City's Statement of Overriding Considerations.

Petitioners will seek to have the land use entitlements and CEQA environmental approval enjoined and set aside, along with such other relief as the Court deems proper.

Sincerely,

LAW OFFICE OF GIDEON KRACOV

Jordan R. Sisson
