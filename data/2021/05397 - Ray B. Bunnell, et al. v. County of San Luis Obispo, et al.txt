22 INTRODUCTION
23 1. The County of San Luis Obispo ("County") by and through the Board of
24 Supervisors (collectively "Respondents") intends to condemn, through eminent domain, an 25 easement through private property owned by Petitioners Ray B. Bunnell ("Bunnell"), Robert
26 Kruse ("Kruse"), Edward Pollard ("Pollard"), and James Warren ("'Warren") (collectively
.27

28 "Petitioners") and undertake an extensive construction project on the condemned property and
adjacent property for construction of the Bob Jones Pathway Recreational Bicycle Trail (the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 1

"Project").

2 2. Respondents have already prepared and publicly displayed the alignment and

3 plans for the Bob Jones Pathway Recreational Bicycle Trail (the "Trail").

4 3. Respondents approved the Project by adopting Resolution No. 2015-55,

5 Resolution Authorizing: 1) Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Bob

6 Jones Pathway, and 2) Approval of the Bob Jones Pathway Project Between the Octagon Barn

7 and the Ontario Road Staging Area, on February 24, 2015 (the "Resolution").

8 4. In the Resolution approving the Project, Respondents also a certified a Final EIR
9 for the Project.

10 5. Both the Resolution and the Final EIR provide that the Project will not be

11 constructed over Petitioners' properties unless Petitioners are willing to sell or donate an
12 easement for the Project.

13 6. Petitioners are unwilling to sell or donate a Trail easement for the Project.

14 7. Both the County Resolution approving the Project and the certified Final EIR
15 provide that in the event that Petitioners are not willing to sell or donate an easement for the

16 Trail over their property, then the County shall leave a gap in the Trail over Petitioners'
17 properties and construct only those portions of the Trail that have secured easements from

18 willing property owners.
19 8. On or about May 5, 2021, the County Board of Supervisors met in closed session
20 and authorized the filing of an eminent domain petition for order permitting entry on Bunnell's
21 property for the purpose of deciding whether to acquire, by condemnation, an interest in
22 Bunnell's property to construct the Project (the "Petition for Entry").
23 9. The Petition for Entry was filed in the San Luis Obispo County Superior Court as
24 County of San Luis Obispo V, Ray B. Bunnell, Case Number 21CV-0323, and was served on
25 Bunnell on June 18, 2021.
26 10. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action
27 and have exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
28 11. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm and the San Luis Obispo Creek riparian

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 2

1 corridor will suffer irreparable harm if the condemnation and construction Project is allowed to

2 proceed, because property will be taken from Petitioners and be permanently physically altered.

3 12. The San Luis Obispo Creek riparian corridor on Bunnell's property will suffer

4 serious impacts to its biological resources, hazards, noise pollution, dust pollution, homeless
5 encampments, garbage, fire danger, and other environmental impacts resulting from a major

6 construction Project being undertaken in an ecologically sensitive riparian corridor.

7 13. The Kruse, Pollard, and Warren properties will suffer serious, irreparable

8 damage, in that construction of the Trail will result in loss of the legal right of access to some or
9 all of the agriculture properties over the existing "Cattle Trail Easement."
10 14. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary
11 law unless this Court grants the requested Writ of Mandate and injunction to require

12 Respondents to comply with the County General Plan and the Final EIR and stop the process of
13 condemning Trail easements over Petitioners' properties and stop the construction of the Trail

14 on Petitioners' properties.
15 II

16 PARTIES

17 15. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully
18 set forth herein.

19 16. Petitioner Ray B. Bunnell is an individual dedicated to the protection of the
20  environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and land
21 use policy decision making. Bunnell is the owner of the real property identified in the Petition
22 for Entry, APN 076-121-030.

23 17. Petitioner Robert Kruse is an individual dedicated to the protection of the
24 environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and land
25 use policy decision making, Kruse is the owner of the real property identified as APN 076-251-
26 017.

27 18. Petitioner Edward Pollard is an individual dedicated to the protection of the
28 environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and land

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 3

1 use policy decision making. Pollard is the owner of the real property identified as APN 076-

2 251-027.

3 19. Petitioner James Warren is an individual dedicated to the protection of the

4 environment in the County of San Luis Obispo by participating in local environmental and land

5 use policy decision making. Warren is the owner of the real property identified as APN 076-

6 251-021.

7 20. Respondent County of San Luis Obispo, through Respondent Board of

8 Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo, is a political subdivision of the State of

0 California.

10 21. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise of

11 1 DOES 1 through 25 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said parties by such fictitious
12 names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when their identities have been ascertained.

13 22. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis, allege that Respondents

14 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and
15 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency

16 and employment.

17 III

18 STANDING

19 23. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 22 as if fully
20 set forth herein.

21 24. Respondents' construction of the Project in violation of the County General Plan,
22 violation of the Resolution approving the Project, and violation of the certified Final EIR will
23 adversely affect the interests of Petitioners. Petitioners have a strong interest in the preservation
24 of the environment.

25 25. Petitioners have exhausted their administrative remedies and have standing
26 pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21177. Petitioners are "aggrieved persons" within
27 the meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21177.
28 26. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 4

1 Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5; the California Public Resources Code; the California
2 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") Guidelines; the Constitution of the State of California;

3 the Constitution of the United States; and other applicable laws and regulations.

4 27. This proceeding is being commenced not more than 180 days after Petitioners

5 first received notice from the County that eminent domain would be used to condemn Trail

6 easements, that Trail easements would be acquired by the County substantially different from

7 the way described in the Environmental Impact Report and the Project being constructed is
substantially different from the Project described in the Environmental Impact Report.

9 28. There was no notice to the public that the Project easements would be acquired
10 substantially different from that described in the Environmental Impact Report and there was no

11 later Environmental Impact Report circulated and certified.

12 IV

13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

14 29. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully

15 set forth herein.

16 30. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

17 in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21177, Code of Civil Procedure Sections
18 1085 and 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

19 31. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code Section

20 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on November 19, 2021. (True and correct copies of the letter

21 and Proof of Service are attached hereto as Exhibit A.)

22 V

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violation of CEQA Against Respondents and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive)
25 32. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully
26 set forth herein.

27 33. CEQA, Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq., prohibits Respondents
28 from approving a public project that may have adverse environmental effects without first

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 5

undergoing environmental review and avoiding or reducing the significant environmental

2 effects of the Project wherever feasible.

3 34. CEQA applies to the Project and Respondents certified a Final EIR on February
4 24, 2015.

5 35. Noncompliance with the requirements of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse

6 of discretion regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if Respondents had

7 complied with the CEQA requirements in the first instance.

8 36. Abuse of discretion is established if Respondents have not proceeded in a

9 manner required by law or if Respondents' determination or decision is not supported by
10 substantial evidence.

11 37. The Land Use and Planning section of the EIR is found in Section 2.5 and

12 addresses land use designations, local and regional planning issues, compliance with the San
13 Luis Obispo County General Plan, including but not limited to the Land Use and Circulation|
14 Elements, Parks and Recreation Element, Conservation and Open Space Element, General Plan

15 Area Plans, San Luis Obispo Inland Arca Plan.
16 38. Section 2.5-2 of the Land Use and Planning section of the Final EIR provides
17 that the County will comply with its General Plan and not use eminent domain to secure

18 easements for the Trail. The General Plan only allows obtaining easements for the Trail "from a
19 willing seller or donor."

20 39. The Final EIR provides in Section 2.5-2 of the Land Use and Planning section
21 that in the event Petitioners are not willing to sell or donate an easement, the Trail will not be
22 constructed on Petitioners' properties until they either change their minds or property ownership
23 changes.

24 40. The County's eminent domain Petition for Entry proves that the Project has
25 substantially changed from the Project approved in the Final EIR. The Project the County now
26 intends to construct involves entry onto private property to plan, engineer, and construct a bike
27 Trail over easements acquired by eminent domain on the property of unwilling property
28 owners.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 6

1 41. The is Project the County intends to build is substantially different from the Project
2 described in the Final EIR.

3 42. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that in June 2021,

4 after Respondents filed the Petition for Entry eminent domain proceeding, Respondents

5 purported to amend the Final EIR, without notice to the public or parties-in-interest, to provide

6 for a large tunnel under Clover Ridge Lane and the construction of a 600 foot long, 12 foot high

7 retaining wall within the San Luis Obispo Creek riparian corridor constituting a substantial

8 change to the Project with significant environmental impacts.
9 43. Respondents provided absolutely no public notice that the Project to be
10 constructed is substantially different from the Project described in the Final EIR and therefore,

11 the public has had no participation in the final environmental review process.
12 44. Respondents have failed to prepare a supplemental or subsequent EIR
13 authorizing the use of eminent domain to acquire Trail easements and construct the bike Trail
14 on property of unwilling property owners including through the environmentally sensitive San
15 Luis Obispo Creek riparian corridor.
16 45. The commencement of the Project under these circumstances is even more
17 misleading than if Respondents had prepared no EIR, since the public might now, justifiably but
18 erroneously, assume that the bike Trail Project being constructed is the one actually discussed
19 and approved in the Final EIR.
20 46. As a result, it is not surprising that the public has failed to challenge the
21 Respondents' non-compliance with CEQA.

22 47. Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, prepare a new EIR, or even
23 supplement or amend the existing EIR after Respondents determined to construct the Trail over
24 Petitioners' properties through the use of eminent domain effectively deprived the public of the
25 opportunity to any meaningful review and comment on the impacts resulting from this
26 substantial change in Project after certifying the Final EIR.
27 48. The Trail on Bunnell's property and the new 600 foot long, 12 foot tall retaining
28 wall are all within or directly adjacent to the San Luis Obispo Creek riparian corridor. The

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 7

impacts on the environment from this section of the Trail are substantial, including but not

2 limited to, construction of a bridge in and over San Luis Obispo Creek.

49. Petitioners made it clear during the EIR public participation process that they
4 were unwilling property owners and would not allow the Trail to be constructed over their
5 properties.

6 50. Therefore, the public was left with notice that there would be a gap in the Trail

7 over Petitioners' properties through the environmentally sensitive San Luis Obispo Creek
8 riparian corridor.

9 51. Because of Respondents' misrepresentations, the public had no reason to
10 question the analysis of the impacts on the San Luis Obispo Creek riparian corridor nor

11 Petitioners' agriculture properties.

12 52. As a result of Respondents' violations of CEQA, Petitioners have been harmed in
13 that Petitioners and the public were not fully informed about the impacts of, mitigation
14 measures for, and alternatives to the Project prior to final approval and certification of the EIR.
15 53. Petitioners reserve the right to modify, delete from, or add to the allegations of
16 CEQA violations after the administrative record of proceedings for the Project has been fully
17 and adequately prepared, certified, and analyzed.

18 VI

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Violation of the General Plan Against Respondents
21 and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive)
22 54. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 53 as if fully

23 set forth herein.

24 55. The County approved the Project with a finding by the Board of Supervisors that
25 the Project was consistent with the General Plan, including but not limited to, the Parks and
26 Recreation Element, because the Project would not involve the use of eminent domain to
27 acquire Trail easements.

28 56. The true facts are that the Project is not consistent with the General Plan because

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 8

1 Respondents intend to acquire Trail easements through the use of eminent domain.
2 57. Petitioners and the public have been harmed as a result of Respondents'

3 misrepresentations regarding compliance with the General Plan and Respondents' intent to

4 construct the Project in violation of the General Plan.

5 58. Respondents could not approve the Project absent findings that it was consistent

6 with the General Plan. Therefore, Respondents lied to the public on the record stating its

7 intention to comply with the General Plan and not use the power of eminent domain to condemn

8 Trail easements.

9 59. The County has admitted in its Petition for Entry and the supporting declarations
10° that it intends to construct a Project which is inconsistent with and violates the County's
11 General Plan.

12 60. The County has admitted in its pleadings that Bunnell's property is "needed for
13 the Project" and the County intends to construct the Project on Bunnell's property.

14 61. The County has admitted in its pleadings that it was awarded an $18.25 Million
15 Active Transportation Program grant from the State of California's California Transportation
16 Commission "for delivery of this transportation Project" and "The Project must be completed
17 and open to the public in 2025, or the funding would be in jeopardy."
18 62. Respondents intend to condemn easements over Petitioners' properties, in
19 violation of the Final EIR and County's General Plan, and construct the Trail over Petitioners'

20 properties before year-end 2025.
21 63. The County's California Transportation Commission grant of $18.25 Million
22 requires "construction of the 4.5-mile Bob Jones Trail (BJT) Gap Closure between the SLO
23 trailhead and the trailhead just north of Pismo Beach.»
24 64. The County has admitted in its pleadings that it is intending to comply with the
25 Active Transportation Program grant, complete construction of the entire 4.5 miles of the Trail,
26 close the gap between the two trailheads, condemn a Trail easement over Petitioners' properties
27 and construct the Trail over Petitioners' properties.
28 65. Section 3.12 of the Parks and Recreation Blement of the County General Plan

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF - 9

1 provides as follows:

2 $3.12 Where public lands are not available or adequate to accommodate a

3 public trail, a trail dedication in easement or fee across private property shall be considered and may be obtained only in the following instances:
4 1. From a willing seller or donor, 2. As part of a New Town or Specific Plan that would create urban uses.
5 3. As a condition of a project approval, subject also to Policy 3.13:

6 a. For land not designated Agriculture when: i. a general plan amendment would change the land use category
7 from Agriculture to another land use category; or ii. a discretionary project that would convert agricultural land to
8 useslo not related to agriculture; or

9 iii. a cluster subdivision would create eight or more residential
parcels.
10 b. For land not designated Agriculture, but in production agriculture,

11 when discretionary project including a subdivision would convert land to usesll not related to production agriculture as determined
12 by the County Agricultural Commissioner's Office.
C. For all other land not excluded under (a) and (b) above, for any
13 discretionary project (parcel map, tract map, development plan,
14 minor use permit, conditional use permit, etc.)

10
15 "These uses ate limited to: religious facilities, libraries or museums,
schools, commercial electric generating plants for the generation or
16 distribution of electrical energy for sale, manufacturing, recycling

17 facilities (excluding composting), residential care facilities, public safety facilities, commercial retail facilities (excluding restaurants and roadside
18 stands), and waste disposal sites. These are defined in Titles 22 and 23 of the San Luis Obispo County Code.
:19 11 ibid." [Parks and Recreation Element of the San Luis Obispo County

20 General Plan, Page 28.]

21 66. Section 3.11 of the County's General Plan provides that "eminent domain will
22 not be used for trail establishment."
23 67. The Project which Respondents are intending to construct and which is the
24 subject of the County's Petition for Entry violates the General Plan and therefore, is in violation
25 of California Planning and Zoning Law. Petitioners, and other members of the public, have been
26 harmed as a result of Respondents' violations of Planning and Zoning Law.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Promissory Estoppel Against Respondents and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive)
68.

5 Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 67 as if fully
set forth herein.

6 69.

7 Respondents promised the general public and Petitioners, through oral and

8 written representations, over a period of almost 20 years, that Respondents would not use

9 eminent domain to acquire Trail easements over private property for the Project.
70. The aforementioned oral and written representations were made at official
10 hearings, public participation CEQA meetings, meetings with Bunnell, and formally-noticed

11

12 Board of Supervisors hearings, including but not limited to, the February 24, 2015 hearing to
formally approve the Project and certify the Final EIR.
13 71. Respondents should have reasonably expected that Petitioners and the public
14 would rely on the aforementioned representations.

15 72. •Petitioners did in fact justifiably rely on these representations, including, but not
16 limited to, by not filing litigation to challenge the Final EIR which would have resulted in
17

18 relocating the bike Trail to one of the other alternatives identified in the EIR; along Ontario
Road.

19 73.

20 Accordingly, Respondents are estopped from taking any action that is contrary to

21 their written and oral representations made to Petitioners and the general public and are
prevented from using eminent domain to condemn Trail easements for the bike Trail over
22 private property.
23 74.

24 As a result of Respondents' false promises and misrepresentations, Petitioners

25 have and will suffer special and general damages in an amount according to proof at trial.

2 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Preliminary and Permanent Injunction Against

.4 Respondents and DOES 1 through 25, inclusive)

5 75. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 74 as if fully

6 set forth herein.

7 76. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply with

8 CEQA, failure to comply with the General Plan, and lying to the public in the CEQA process
9 and approval of the Project, as set forth above.
10 77. As a result of the above-alleged violations, Respondents have failed to conduct

11 an adequate environmental review as required by law, failed to comply with the General Plan,
12 and have failed to proceed in a manner required by law in approving and constructing the

13 Project.

14 78. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
15 CEQA, comply with the General Plan, prepare an adequate environmental review, and
16 otherwise comply with all relevant provisions of the law,

17 79. Notwithstanding such ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to
18 perform their duty to comply with CEQA, to comply with the General Plan, and all other
19 relevant provisions of law.
20 80. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
21 are threatening to proceed, and are proceeding with development of the Project now, or in the
22 very near future. Said implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and
23 irreparably harm Petitioners.

24 81. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

-Dear Honorable Members of the Board:
*
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Ray B. Bunnell, Robert Kruse, Edward Pollard, and James Warren will commence litigation against the County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connectiön with the Bob Jones Trail Project.

This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.).
The Petition also alleges that the Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required under law. by failing to comply with CEQA, the General Plan, and eminent domain law.
Very truly yours, 2ua EDWIN J. RAMBUSK
