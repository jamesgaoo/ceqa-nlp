VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner United Neighborhoods for Los Angeles (UN4LA) challenges a hotel
3 development project proposed by Real Parties in Interest Fariborz Moshfegh and Whitley
4 Apartments, LLC at 1719-1731 North Whitley Avenue, Case No. DIR-2016-4920-SPR-1A;
5 ENV-2016-4921-CE, ("the Whitley Hotel Project") that will demolish 40 rent stabilized homes

6 at a time when the City of Los Angeles faces a severe affordable housing crisis.

7 2. is This project is moving forward despite strong opposition from residents,

8 neighbors, and housing-rights and environmental groups. In circumvention of the project's
9 incompatibility with the City's general plan, the City of Los Angeles determined that the project

10 is categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) under CEQA

11 Guidelines section 15332.

12 3. Petitioner United Neighborhoods for Los Angeles, a non-profit California

13 corporation, brings this Petition to seek relief from this Court to correct Respondents' abuse of
14 discretion in approving the Whitley Hotel Project, declare that the City's approval of the Whitley

15 Hotel Project is unlawful, issue a writ of mandate ordering Respondents City of Los Angeles et
16 al., to overturn the City's unlawful approval of the Project and related CEQA determinations,

17 and issue an order enjoining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking any action to

18 construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way unless and
19 until lawful land use approvals are obtained from Respondents.

20 PARTIES

21 4. Petitioner and Plaintiff United Neighborhoods for Los Angeles (UN4LA) is a
22 non-profit California corporation formed to foster better planning and better government within

23 the County of Los Angeles, and all cities and unincorporated areas contained within the County's

24 borders. A number of UN4LA's members are residents of the Hollywood area and are directly

25 affected by the City's approval of the challenged development. UN4LA participated in the
26 project approval process as an appellant and submitted written testimony and evidence during the
27 administrative proceedings.

28 5. Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles is a is Charter Law city situated

2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

in the County of Los Angeles and is duly organized under the laws of the State of California.

2 The Proposed Project is located within the City of Los Angeles.
6. Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles Planning Department is a

4 subdivision and planning agency of the City of Los Angeles.

7. Respondent and Defendant Los Angeles City Council is a 15-member elected

6 body that represents the citizens of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles City Council was the final
7 decisionmaking body for the Proposed Project.

8 8. The true names and capacities of the Respondents and Defendants identified as

9 DOES 1-10 are unknown to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this

10 pleading in order to allege the true names and capacities as soon as they are ascertained.

11 Petitioner is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that the fictitiously named
12 Respondents and Defendants 1-10 have jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the

13 Project that is the subject of this proceeding.

14 9. Real Party in Interest Fariborz Moshfegh is an individual, and is an applicant

15 for the entitlements to develop the Whitley Hotel Project and is therefore served as a Real Party

16 in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a). Fariborz Moshfegh is a
17 resident of the City of Los Angeles, State of California.
18 10. Real Party in Interest Whitley Apartments, LLC, is a California Limited

19 Liability Company and is an applicant for the entitlements to develop the Whitley Hotel Project

20 and is therefore served as a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section

21 21167.6.5(a). Whitley Apartments, LLC is located in and does business in the City and County
22 of Los Angeles, State of California.

23 11. Real Parties in Interest Roes through 10 are or were the agents, employees,

24 contractors, and/or entitles acting under the authority of each other respondent or real party in

25 interest, and each performed acts on which this action is based within the cause and scope of

26 such agency and/or employment. Petitioner does not currently know the true names and
27 identities of Roes through 10, so Petitioner brings this action against these real parties in

28 interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition and complaint to allege their

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATOR Y RELIEF

true names and capacities when and if they are ascertained.

2 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3 12. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court. Petitioner's claims arise under

4 California state laws and the acts or omissions complained of herein occurred in the County of

5 Los Angeles.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 13. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies prior to bringing this

8 action. Petitioner, by and through its representatives, registered its objections to the proposed

9 Project to Respondents orally and in writing. All issues raised in this Petition were timely raised
10 before Respondents by Petitioner and members of the public.

11 14. Petitioner notified Respondents that they intended to file suit to enforce the
12  requirements of CEQA.

13 15. As required by Rule of Court 3.222(d), Petitioner will serve this Petition and
14 Complaint on the Attorney General.

15 16, Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested
16  relief as set forth herein.

17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 17. The Whitley Hotel Project is located at 1719-1731 North Whitley Avenue in
19| the Hollywood Plan Area of the City of Los Angeles. As approved, the project would demolish

20 six multi-family residential buildings, comprised of 40 rent-stabilized apartments, to develop a

21 10-story, 156-room hotel with 122 automobile parking spaces. The property at 1719-1731
22 Whitley, developed in 1920, not only currently serves as a vital source of affordable housing, but

23 is also of potential value to preservation of the historicity of Hollywood, given its age,
24 architecture, and location within the boundaries of a proposed Multi-Family Residential Historic
25| District.

26 18. On August 1, 2019, the City Planner issued a determination that the Whitley
27 Hotel Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines, Section 15322 and that
28 no substantial evidence demonstrates the applicability of an exception to a categorical exemption

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2. Petitioner timely appealed.

2 19. At its October 22, 2019 meeting, the Central Los Angeles Planning

3 Commission (CAPC) determined that the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to State CEQA

4 Guidelines, Section 15322 and that no substantial evidence demonstrates the applicability of an

5 exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2. The CAPC
6 also denied Petitioner's appeal and sustained the Planning Director's determination to approve a

7 Site Plan Review for the Whitley Hotel Project and adopted the Planning Director's findings,

8 thereby approving the project.

9 20. On November 9, 2019, Respondents prematurely filed a Notice of Exemption.

10 21. On November 15, 2019, Petitioner timely appealed the Area Planning

11 Commission's CEQA determination.

12 22. On October 1, 2020, the Planning and Land Use Management Committee

13 considered Petitioner's appeal, along with a separate appeal. After public comment and
14 presentations from the Real Parties in Interest and the Petitioner and other appellant, the

15 Committee recommended denial of the appeals and approval of the Categorical Exemption for

16 the Whitley Hotel Project.
17 23. On October 20, 2020, the Los Angeles City Council took action to adopt the
18 PLUM Committee Report, approve the Categorical Exemption, and approve the project.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of General Plan Policies; Failure to Act Consistently with the Housing Element; Error and Abuse of Discretion
21 (Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5)

22 24. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in
23 the preceding paragraphs.

24 25. Respondents abused their discretion in approving the Whitley Hotel Project
25 because they did not proceed in the manner required by law, their decision to approve the project

26 was not supported by the findings, and the findings were not supported by the evidence. The

27 evidence presented to Respondents undeniably demonstrates that the Whitley Hotel Project

28 failed to conform to the General Plan and its Elements.

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 26, Government Code sections 65300, et seq. requires that the City of Los

2 Angeles, and every other California City and County, prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long-

3 term general plan for the physical development of land within the governmental entity's

4 jurisdiction. The general plan governs the use of land within the city or county and is the

5 "constitution" of land use planning. As required by state law, the City of Los Angeles has a

6 General Plan that governs land use planning throughout the City.

7 27. The Framework Element is one component of the General Plan for the City of

8 Los Angeles; it is considered an "organizing element" containing policies that address and
connect the Plan's other eleven elements.

10 28. The Framework Element's Land Use chapter includes as a goal the

11 "conservation of existing residential neighborhoods" and the "assurance of environmental justice

12 and a healthful living environment."
13 29. Although the determination references the General Plan broadly, it ignores key

14 requirements of the Framework Element, including the above-stated goals, which are clearly
15 undermined by the Whitley Hotel Project's removal of 40 rent-stabilized units. The Project will
16 eradicate substantial numbers of existing housing units and displace substantial numbers of
17 people, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere.
18 30. The general plan has seven mandatory elements. The "housing element" and

19 "land use element" are two of these seven.

20 31. The City's Land Use Element is comprised of 35 Community Plans, one for

21 each of the City's Community Plan Areas. The Hollywood Community Plan applies to the area

22 in which the Whitley Hotel Project is located and is being developed.

23 32. The Hollywood Community Plan includes several policies and objectives

24 protective of affordable housing that undermine Respondents' justification for approval of the
25 project; the Plan's objective to "make provision for the housing required to satisfy the varying
26 needs and desires of all economic segments of the Community, maximizing the opportunity for
27 individual choice" is ignored in Respondents' findings. The Whitley Hotel Project weakens that

28 objective.

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 33. Government Code section 65583(b)(1) requires all housing elements to contain

2 a statement of : community's goals, quantified objectives, and policies for the preservation of its

3 existing affordable housing stock.

4 34. After a community, pursuant to Government Code section 65583(b)(1)

5 establishes their goals, quantified objectives, and policies for the preservation of its existing

6 affordable housing stock, Government Code Sections 65583(c) and (c)(4) then also require their

7 housing element to contain programs to achieve those goals and quantified objectives and

8 specifically to "[c]onserve and improve the condition of the existing affordable housing stock,

9 which may include addressing ways to mitigate the loss of dwelling units demolished by public

10 or private action."

11 35. The City of Los Angeles Housing Element sets out as its primary goal: "Goal

12 1: A City where housing production and preservation result in an adequate supply of ownership

13 and rental housing that is safe, healthy and affordable to people of all income levels, races, ages,

14 and suitable for their various needs."

15 36. These policies and objectives apply to the approval of the Whitley Hotel
16 Project because the project will result in a direct and substantial loss of affordable housing in the
17 community. Respondent's approval of the project was an abuse of discretion because it violates

18 these policies.

19 37. Each jurisdiction must act consistently with its general plan and housing

20 element. Land use decisions must also be consistent with the general plan and, therefore, the

21 housing element. (See e.g. Gov. Code §65454.) Government Code section 65867.5 provides that

22 "[a] development agreement shall not be approved unless the legislative body finds that the

23 provisions of the agreement are consistent with the general plan..." and therefore the housing

24 element.

25 38. The record before respondents contained substantial evidence demonstrating
26 that this project will have significant detrimental effects on the availability of affordable housing

27 in the area. While the City has produced well over the quota for above-market rate housing, it
28 has failed to meet the quotas for very-low, low, and middle-income housing, as indicated by the

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

City's own 2018 Housing Element Annual Progress Report. The City of Los Angeles has an

2 ongoing violation of Government Code section 65580, which requires municipalities to meet the

3 housing needs of citizens at all income levels. The Whitley Hotel Project is emblematic of the

4 City's continued practice of displacing low to moderate-income households who are at risk of

5 becoming homeless.

6 39. State law declares that the attainment of decent housing and a suitable living

7 environment for every California family is a priority of the highest order, that housing affordable

8 to low and moderate-income households requires the cooperation of all levels of government,

9 and that local and state governments are responsible for ensuring the improvement and
10 development of housing that meets the needs of all economic segments of the community. (See

11 Gov. Code §65800, et seq.)

12 40. Respondents at all times relevant to this action had the ability to perform the

13 duties set forth herein and failed and refused to perform such duties. Respondents acted
14 arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to carry out or discharge their mandatory duties as alleged
15 herein and in violating the legal prohibitions, as set forth herein.

16 41. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in this proceeding and has

17 exhausted all other available remedies.

18 42. Petitioner has beneficial right to Respondents' performance of their

19 respective duties based on Petitioner's interest in maintaining and improving the quality of the
20 environment in the City of Los Angeles as well as maintaining the integrity of the City's local

21 land use laws. Petitioner's members have an interest in maintaining and improving the quality of
22 life in their city of residence.

23 43. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, in that unless the

24 Court enjoins Real Parties in Interest, they will develop the Whitley Hotel Project in spite of its
25 inconsistencies with the policies of the General Plan as set out in its Framework Element and the
26 Hollywood Community Plan. No amount of monetary damages or other legal remedy can

27 adequately compensate Petitioner for the irreparable harm that Petitioner, its members, and the

28 residents of the City of Los Angeles will suffer from this violation of the aforementioned laws.

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

44. A judicial declaration as to the legality of Respondents' actions, as set forth

2 above, is therefore necessary and appropriate to determine the parties' respective rights and

3 duties.

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code §21168; Code of Civil Procedure $§525; 1094.5)
6 45. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in
7 the preceding paragraphs.
8 46. It was an abuse of discretion for Respondents to approve the Whitley Hotel
9 Project under a Categorical Exemption because Respondents have not proceeded in the manner

10 required by law, the approval is not supported by the findings, and the findings are not supported
11 by the evidence.
12 47. CEQA requires environmental review and analysis prior to the approval of
13 discretionary projects by local governments, such as the City of Los Angeles.
14 48. The legislature has declared that "[t]he maintenance of a quality environment
15 for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." (Pub. Res.
16 Code §21000(a).) The legislature further declares their intent "that all agencies of the state
17 government which regulate activities of private individuals, corporations, and public agencies
18 which are found to affect the quality of the environment, shall regulate such activities so that
19 major consideration is given to preventing environmental damage, while providing a decent
20 home and satisfying living environment for every Californian." (Id. at (g).)
21 49. Preparation of an Environmental Impact Report is the principal method
22 established by the legislature to accomplish its goals for California's environment.
23 50. In addition to the provisions of the Public Resources Code, the California
24 Legislature has authorized and directed the Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines
25 for the implementation of CEQA. Those Guidelines are binding on all state and local agencies,
26 including Respondents herein. (14 Cal. Code Regs. $§15000, 15020.)
27 51. Here, no EIR was prepared because Respondents found the project to qualify
28

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

for a categorical exemption; but The Whitley Hotel project does not meet the criteria under

2 CEQA Guidelines section 15332 to qualify as an In-Fill Development Project. (14 Cal. Code

3 Regs 15332.)

4 52. CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 requires that "[t]he project is consistent with

5 the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies..." As set forth

6 above in the First Cause of Action, the project fails to comport with a number of policies and

7 requirements of the General Plan, including but not limited to the Framework Element and the

8 Housing Element.

9 53. CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 requires that "[a]pproval of a project would

10 not result in any significant effects related to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality."

11 54. The Whitley Hotel Project will have significant effects on air quality. The
12 construction of the project will result in fugitive dust, diesel emissions, particulate matter and
13 toxic air contaminants.

14 55. The Whitley Hotel Project, a hotel which will host special events, will have
15 significant effects on noise. The record before respondents contained substantial evidence
16| demonstrating that this project would have significant detrimental effects on ambient noise,
17 particularly in light of the project's proximity to sensitive populations, including an adjacent
18 senior housing development.

19 56. The Whitley Hotel Project will have a significant effect on traffic.
20 57. CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 further requires that "[t]he site can be
21 adequately served by all required utilities and public services."
22 58. The site is currently underserved by utilities, including Solid Waste removal,
23 and the proposed development will exacerbate these issues.
24 59. The Whitley Hotel Project site is currently underserved by Police Protection.

25 60. The Whitley Hotel Project is not consistent with all applicable general plan
26 policies and is therefore ineligible for the granted Categorical Exemption.
27 61. The Whitley Hotel Project violates applicable general plan elements and
28 policies contained therein and is therefore ineligible for the granted Categorical Exemption.

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 62. The City of Los Angeles CEQA Thresholds Guide states that a project
2 inconsistent with the General Plan or its elements indicates further study and that a Negative

3 Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration, or EIR may be required. The Whitley Hotel Project

4 violates applicable general plan elements and policies contained therein and mandates further

5 study.

6 63, The Whitley Hotel Project meets the criteria for exceptions listed under CEQA

7 Guidelines section 15300.2.

8

9 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
10 Petitioner prays:

11 1. That this Court issue peremptory writ of mandate commanding Respondents to rescind

12 and revoke its issuance of a Notice of Exemption and to rescind and revoke all of the

13 permits and entitlements issued for the Whitley Hotel Project;

14 2. That this Court issue a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, administrative

15 stay, and permanent injunction enjoining Respondents and Real Parties from taking any

16 action to implement the Whitley Hotel Project and to further enjoin Respondents and

17 Real Parties from taking any action to construct the Whitley Hotel Project, until such
18 time as Respondents have conformed to all applicable legal requirements as ordered by

19 the Court.

20 3. That this Court issue declaratory relief, declaring that:

21 a. Respondents' finding that the Whitley Hotel Project was Categorically Exempt

22 from CEQA was in violation of the substantive and/or procedural requirements of
23 CEQA and the City's CEQA Thresholds Guide;

24 b. Respondents' issuance of a Notice of Exemption for the Whitley Hotel Project
25 was in violation of the substantive and/or procedural requirements of CEQA;
26 c. Respondents' approval of the project was in violation of the General Plan for the
27 City of Los Angeles.

28 4. That this Court award litigation expenses and costs of suit; and

11
