benefitted the County through, among other things, tax revenue, jobs, and economic development.

2 2. The County is a municipal corporation with its county seat in the City of
Ventura, California. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors is the governing body of the

4 County of Ventura.

3. ABA is unaware of the true names and/or capacities of Respondents and
Defendants DOBS through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Defendants
‡ 7 by such fictitious names. ABA will amend this Petition to insert the true names and/or capacities La3: 3dAl 00'9EP : 7V1(

Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 12-18-2020 11 relief being sought in this Petition.
d'IT AHdHNW 12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 4. In 2010, ABA became an owner of the mineral lessee's interest in, and the

14 operator of, an oil and gas lease referred to as the "Maulhardt Lease." The Maulhardt Lease is

d 15 situated in the Oxnard oilfield and since 1957, it has been subject to County-issued Special Use DAY CARTER 16 Permit #672 ("SUP #672"). ABA still operates and produces oil from the original well, which

17 was drilled pursuant to SUP #672 in 1958. In the last ten years of development and drilling

18 operations under SUP #672, ABA has discovered oil, gas and hydrocarbon resources on the

19 Maulhardt Lease that will require the drilling of additional wells in order to properly and

20 completely recover those natural resources.

21 5. SUP #672 was issued on November 5, 1957 by the County of Ventura Board of

22 Supervisors who voted in a public hearing pursuant to Ventura ordinances to accept and approve

23 a thoroughly-considered, site-specific, detailed, and fully-conditioned discretionary permit in

24 accord with the recommendation of the County of Ventura Planning Commission for the
25 following purposes:

26 Drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and 2:57 UAZIZI: aId aLVa OZLZPAIZZLOZI # 1dI3038 VI.A-WM-N0-L208+900-0ZOZ-99:# 3SVO 27 installing and using buildings, equipment, and other appurtenances accessory thereto, including pipelines, but specifically excluding processing, refining and

1 packaging, bulk storage or any other use specifically mentioned in Division 8,
2 Ventura County Ordinance Code, requiring review and Special Use Permit . . .

3 SUP #672 does not include any requirement for subsequent discretionary review or approvals
4 from the County and does not include any requirement that the wells or production facilities

5 within the permit boundaries be subject to location, spacing, or other conditions. SUP #672 also

6 does not include an expiration date or other temporal limitation. Rather, it authorizes the permit
‡ holder to drill for, and extract, any oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and to install the
Ventura Superior ußnouu padeoov unoo 09:0L:OL 1e OZOZ-8L-ZI pemugns Aienjege to infrastructure necessary to achieve that purpose. ABA, and its predecessor permittees under SUP H3: 3dAl 00°GEt : 7V1OIWd

9 #672, have engaged in drilling operations and installation of facilities continuously since 1957 3

10 without any requirement from the County that the permittee secure additional discretionary
11 approvals beyond that already provided in SUP #672 to engage in such operations.
JTI AHJäNW NALHVO AVI 12 6. The County has repeatedly acknowledged ABA's status as a permittee under a
13 SUP #672 and has repeatedly acknowledged the validity and compliance of ABA and its
14 operations with the conditions contained therein. In that regard, the County has issued numerous
d 15 ministerial Zoning Clearances to ABA over the course of the last ten years pursuant to SUP #672
16 for the drilling of new wells and construction of facilities.
17 7. In addition to the Maulhardt Lease, since approximately 2008 ABA has become
18 a lessee of other mineral rights in the vicinity of the Maulhardt Lease (the "Other ABA Leases")
19 and has taken steps toward developing production from the Other ABA Leases, although wells
20 have not been drilled to date for all of those leases. (A map depicting the Maulhardt Lease and the
21 Other ABA Leases is attached hereto as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein by reference.) In
22 accord with good oilfield practice and the recommendations of the County, ABA began
23 constructing centralized facilities that would not only accommodate current oil and gas
24 production under the Maulhardt Lease, but based on the vested rights granted it to it as a permittee
25 under SUP #672, ABA spent significant additional sums on facilities and infrastructure
26 anticipating that production from future wells drilled pursuant to SUP #672 would be produced
27 and processed using these centralized facilities. As an example, ABA's tank battery consists of an CASE #:56-2020-00548077-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1201221D42720 DATE PAID : 12/21/20

{01075812} 3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND VERIFIED COMPLAINT

I ABA's current production, however, is less than 300 barrels per day. The County was aware of

2 these upgrades and expressly authorized them through the issuance of ministerial Zoning

3 Clearances and building permits. ABA has expended in excess of $15 million in development and

4 facilities costs, including expenditures in upgrading and constructing oil and gas processing

5 facilities such as the tank battery, upgraded electrical infrastructure, BACT natural gas flare, air

6 emission offset credits and other operational expenditures, in anticipation that these additional 1d3: 3dAl 00 98t : 7V10I Because ABA's development of the petroleum reserves under its leases will take many years to E ‡ 7 resources would be available to be used in reliance on SUP#672 for additional production.

8

to 09:OLOL ozoz-8l-zi pem!ugns Nesljege ybnouu peideooy unoo Superior eunjue complete, as is the nature of oil and gas development, ABA has made this significant investment

10 in developing its oil and gas infrastructure with the logical and reasonable intent of recouping a

11 reasonable return on its investment for itself and the mineral owners/lessors on whose behalf
dIT AHdHOW 12 ABA operates.

13 8. After many years of ABA's reliance on its vested rights in SUP #672 and after

14 many years of the County acknowledging those vested rights and encouraging ABA's

8 15 construction of centralized facilities for its operations, on November 10, 2020 the County adopted HELAVO AVO 16 Ordinance No. 4568 amending Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County Non-Coastal

17 Zoning Ordinance (Case No. PL20-0052) (the "Zoning Amendment") to require ABA to obtain

18 new discretionary approvals for operations that were previously governed by SUP #672 and thus

19 not subject to discretionary review. The County not only is estopped from taking this action, but

20 the adoption of the Zoning Amendment is an unlawful deprivation of ABA's vested rights and an

21 unconstitutional taking of ABA's property rights without just compensation.

22 9. Through the Zoning Amendment, the County will now require ABA's future

23 operations to comply with new limitations set forth in the County's 2040 General Plan-

24 limitations that will prohibit ABA's continued operations. In other words, the County is

25 improperly imposing new limitations on oil and gas operations in the County's 2040 General Plan CASE #:56-2020-00548077-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1201221D42720 DATE PAID : 12/21/20 2:57| 26 on ABA's vested rights through the adoption of the Zoning Amendment. These new limitations

27 include the following oil and gas policies from the County's 2040 General Plan (the "Oil and Gas

28 Policies"):

5 require new discretionary oil wells to use pipelines to convey oil and produced

6 water; oil and produced water shall not be trucked.
COS-7.8 Gas Collection, Use, and Disposal: The County shall require ‡ 7

11 12, 6-13).
dTT AHdHNW 12 The Oil and Gas Policies purport to apply only to "new discretionary" oil wells or development,

13 but through the subsequently adopted Zoning Amendment, the County is ensuring that the Oil and

14 Gas Policies apply not only to all new oil and gas development in the County, but also to the re-
8 15 drilling or deepening of existing wells, drilling of new wells and installation of new facilities NELVO AVI 16 under SUPs, like ABA's SUP # 672. According to the County Planning Division's Board Letter,

17 the Zoning Amendments amend the County Zoning Code:

18 "to require the issuance of a new discretionary conditional use permit (CUP), or approval of a discretionary permit adjustment or modification, to authorize all new 19 oil and gas development, including that proposed under [the Special Use Permits], unless the proposed development is already specifically described as being 20 authorized under an existing CUP. New development triggering the need for discretionary approval would include, but not be limited to, the installation of new 21 wells, tanks and other oil field facilities, and the re-drilling or deepening of existing wells." (November 10, 2020 Board Letter at pg. 6). 22
10. SUP #672, like other SUPs, does not specifically describe each separate 23
development that is authorized under the SUP. SUP #672 was understood and designed to grant 24
the permit holder the right to develop fully the oil and gas resources, without specifically 25
describing each separate authorized development. This is how the County itself has interpreted 26
and applied SUP #672 for decades. The County now seeks to alter history and ABA's fully L43 : 3dAL 00GET : 7VIO1 Wd LG•Z OZ/ZITL : AIVd ILVO OZLZTAIZZiOZI # 1dIE038 V.LA-WM-NO-L208+900-0ZOZ-99:# ESVO 27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND VERIFIED COMPLAINT

1 was "specifically described" in a SUP #672. As a result, the Zoning Amendment would require

2 ABA to undergo discretionary review (and obtain a new Conditional Use Permit) prior to: (1)

3 installing any new well, tank or other facility; or (2) re-drilling or deepening any existing well.

4 11. The Oil and Gas Policies, as applied through the Zoning Amendment, would

5 prohibit new operations by ABA under SUP # 672. ABA does not have access to an oil pipeline

6 as there are no pipelines available to it within 5 miles of its SUP #672 production, not to mention
‡ 7 that there are severe access issues to try to reach that point, including crossing Highway 101. The
09:0LOL 8 only feasible means ABA has to deliver its product to the marketplace is through the use of

9 trucking, but the Oil and Gas Policies prohibit that use even if use of a pipeline is not feasible.

To 10 ABA's operations are further restricted by the setback requirements of the Oil and Gas Policies.
pajdeooy unoo Jouedns eunque through eDelivery submitted 12-18-2020 11 The bulk of ABA's currently approved pads on the Maulhardt Lease could not be utilized for new
d'TI AHdHNN 12 wells or redrilling or deepening of existing wells, even though the wells are already located on

13 those pads, because the pads are located within the setback limitations of the Oil and Gas

14 Policies. Additional agricultural acreage would need to be taken out of production in order to

d 15
NIINVO AVO create new drilling and production pads to meet the setback requirements, even though existing

16 pads are already in place within the setback area. In some instances, there is no surface available

17 on the Other ABA Leases to place a well or facility under the setback requirements. In addition,

18 flaring is the only feasible method available to ABA to dispose of associated production of

19 natural gas, but the Oil and Gas Policies prohibit flaring. The Oil and Gas Policies, as imposed on

20 ABA and other holders of SUPs through the Zoning Amendment, constitute an unconstitutional

21 taking on their face and eliminate ABA's vested right to continue the development and

22 production of its oil and gas resources, including the right to drill new wells, re-drill or deepen

23 existing wells, and install tanks, pipelines or other oilfield facilities.

24 12. In connection with its adoption of the Zoning Amendment, the County

25 unlawfully failed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources

26 Code, §§ 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA"). ABA hereby challenges those unlawful actions, including the CASE #:56-2020-00548077-CU-WM-VTA BLVa OZLZYALZZIOTI # 1dl3038 aIVd oz/LZ/Zi: 143 : 3dAl 00°9&t : 7V101 Wd L9:7 27 County's determination that the adoption of the Zoning Amendment is exempt from CEQA as

d'TI AHJANN 12 26. By purporting to eliminate ABA's fully vested rights to continue and to
13 complete the development and production of its oil, gas and hydrocarbon resources within the

14 County, the Zoning Amendment, working in connection with the Oil and Gas Policies, effect a

•d 15 taking without payment of just compensation of ABA's property rights under the Fifth NIINVO AVO 16 Amendment of the United States Constitution and a taking or damaging of ABA's property rights

17 under Article 1, §19 of the California Constitution. ABA will be unable to develop any resources
18 from some of the Other ABA Leases, amounting to a total deprivation of all economically viable

19 use. In the other instances, where ABA will be prohibited from continuing to develop oil, gas and

20 hydrocarbon resources, the economic impact will be extreme because ABA will no longer be able

21 to develop the oil, gas and hydrocarbon resources. In all instances, the Zoning Amendment,

22 working in connection with the Oil and Gas Policies, will interfere with ABA's reasonable

additional discretionary approvals for a permittee to proceed with operations under an SUP and

with the understanding that it would not be required to secure additional discretionary approvals

In 2014, County Counsel even issued a memorandum acknowledging the vested

25 rights of SUP holders like ABA and thereby created further reliance by permittees on their vested

26 rights. In that memorandum, County Counsel explained the County's position that, "vested rights

27 cannot be terminated or impaired by ordinary police power regulations, and can be revoked or
impaired (such as by new conditions imposed by a county) only a to serve a 'compelling state

interest,' such as a harm, danger or menace to public health and safety or public nuisance, and

2 that the government's interference with the vested right [must] be narrowly tailored to address the

3 compelling interest and its magnitude."

34. Based on all of the facts alleged herein, the County is estopped from enforcing 4

5 the Zoning Amendment against ABA to prohibit ABA's continued development operations under
SUP #672. ABA is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County denies that it is

Ventura Superior uinoo OZOZ-8L-zl peqwgns Kesyjege ybnouu pajdeooy 35. ABA desires judicial determination of its rights, and a declaration as to 11
d'IT AHAANN 12 whether the County is estopped from enforcing the Zoning Amendment against ABA and its

13 continued development operations under SUP #672. A judicial declaration is necessary and

14 appropriate at this time under the circumstances in order that ABA may ascertain its rights and

17 lawful activities and exercise of its property rights to the detriment of ABA, local tax authorities,

18 employees in the oil and gas industry, vendors, mineral rights holders, and the public generally.

19 36. WHEREFORE, ABA prays for injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that

20 the County is estopped from enforcing the Zoning Amendment against ABA and ABA's

21 continued development operations under SUP #672, all as set forth in the Prayer for Relief below.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR 22

23 WRIT OF MANDATE - PUB. RESOURCES CODE § 21167, VIOLATION OF CEQA

24 37. ABA incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1 OZ/WZITI: AIVd ELLVO OZLZ+AIZZLOZI # LdIHOEX V.LA-WM-N0-L2087900-0Z07-9g:# ISV0 25

CEQA requires the County as the lead agency to consider, analyze, and disclose through 36 above.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND VERIFIED COMPLAINT

its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law when it determined that its

2 adoption of the Zoning Amendment is exempt from CEOA.
The County violated CEQA because it failed to consider, analyze, and disclose 3

4 the reasonably foreseeable, direct and indirect, environmental impacts of the Zoning Amendment, 39.

5 and because it instead relied on unsupported and inapplicable exemptions from environmental

review.

40. The adoption of the Zoning Amendment does not qualify for the Class 8 1H3: 3dAl 00'9Et : 7V1OL Wd 7 ‡
8 categorical exemption because it is a legislative decision and not a regulatory action. Further, it
3 09:0LOL 9 does not "assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement or protection" of the environment as

10 required by the exemption, because it limits access to mineral resources of local, regional and to

16 possibility that an activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual

17 circumstances an agency may not find the activity to be categorically exempt. The exemption

18 also does not apply because there is a possibility that a significant impact would result. The

19 County ignored evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a

20 significant impact when making the exemption determination. The County has admitted in its

21 own documents that the Zoning Amendment will impose permit conditions on new and existing

22 gas wells, will impose more stringent requirements on the operation of such wells, will

23 "1imit the level of new [oil and gas] development that could be authorized" in the County, and, oil and oz/bzrti: aId 3LVO OZAZtALZZLOZI # 1dl3038 VLA-WM-N0-2208+900-0ZOZ-99:# ISVO 24 when considered together with the 2040 General Plan, will restrict production to a greater extent

25 than the 2040 General Plan would on its own. County documents also expressly confirm that the

26 Zoning Amendment "would slow and/or reduce the potential expansion of certain new local oil

27 and gas development." The resulting loss of access to mineral resources of local, regional, and

12 28 statewide importance constitute significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Accordingly, the

{01075812}
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND VERIFIED COMPLAINT

F County is prohibited from relying on the Class 8, or any other, categorical exemption in adopting

2 the Zoning Amendment.

42. The County further violated CEQA by claiming for the first time at its
November 10, 2020 Board meeting that any environmental impacts associated with the Zoning
Amendment were covered by the EIR for the 2040 General Plan. The County also violated

6 CEQA by making the same claim in a Board Letter presented at the November 10, 2020 Board
‡ 7 meeting that was not circulated to the public until days after the meeting. The EIR for the 2040 1a3 : 3dAl 00°9& : 7V101

13 by law and has prejudicially abused its discretion.

14 44. ABA has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy other than the issuance of a

8 15 writ of mandate ordering the County to forgo any and all steps in furtherance of the Zoning

16 Amendment until it complies with CEQA.

17 45. WHEREFORE, ABA prays that a writ of mandate issue as set forth in the

18 Prayer for Relief below.

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION FOR

20 WRIT OF MANDATE - PUB. RESOURCES CODE § 21167, VIOLATION OF CEQA

21 46. ABA incorporates by reference the allegations contained in paragraphs 1

22 through 45 above.

23 47. The County has similarly violated CEQA by failing to conduct any

24 environmental review whatsoever of the Zoning Amendment, prior to the Board adopting the

25 Zoning Amendment on November 10, 2020. CEQA requires that the County analyze and

26 disclose the environmental impacts of their actions prior to their approval and yet the County

27 failed to do so for the Zoning Amendment. CASE #:56-2020-00548077-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1201221D42720 DATE PAID : 12/21/20

- 48. The County also violated CEQA by engaging in improper and illegal

2 piecemealing and project segmentation, by separating the adoption and consideration of the 2040
General Plan from the Zoning Amendment. CEQA requires the County to analyze the "whole of

4 the project," which means that the County should have analyzed the 2040 General Plan and the
Zoning Amendment together and not in an intentionally piecemeal fashion to avoid the
