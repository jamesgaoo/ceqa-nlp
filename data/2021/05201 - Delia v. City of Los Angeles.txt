Challenge to the approval of the 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small Lot Division

Honorable Attorney General:
Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the City of Los Angeles' (City) failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving the 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small Lot Division ("Project"). The City failed to comply with CEQA by adopting a mitigated negative declaration instead of preparing an environmental impact report for the Project because there is a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that the Project may have significant biological, aesthetic, air quality, greenhouse gas, noise, traffic, land use and
other impacts.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources
Code.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Mchr Suenno

1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION
2

3 1. This action challenges the City of Los Angeles*, its Planning Commission,
4 and its City Council, (collectively, the City) failure to comply with the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving the 42 Unit Small Lot project proposed

6 at 2520 North Eastern Avenue (2532, 2608, 2668 North Eastern Avenue and 2647-2651
Lombardy in the City of Los Angeles (the Project). Petitioner challenges the decision

8 made by the City Council of the City of Los Angeles to approve the development of, and

9 to certify a Mitigated Negative declaration ("MND") for, the Vesting Tentative Tract No.
73531-SL Project. Petitioner challenges the Zone change from [Q] R1-1D and [Q] RD6-
10 1D to (T)Q) RD5-1D, and associated land-use entitlements, associated for the project.
11
2.
12 The Project, as proposed, is unsuitable for its site, which is home to over 300 trees

13 including 111 protected Southern California black walnut (Juglans californica) trees that qualify

14 under the City's native protected tree ordinance and were identified in a 2018 Tree Preservation

15 Report prepared by the applicant's consultant. The project site is also home to Southern

16 California black walnut groves and a mix of understory plants including the native California

17 Buckwheat and the City's protected Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia) and California Buckwheat.

18 The project site is a hilltop in the El Sereno Neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles which sits

19 across from the El Sereno Recreation Center and the Farmdale Elementary School. El Sereno

20 Middle School is on block North of the project. The mostly undeveloped lot is a beautiful hilltop

21 that is home to a sensitive natural community. The Project proposes to construct 42 Small Lot

22 units on the Project Site which will require a huge amount of destructive grading. The project

23 would actually chop off 30 feet, three stories off a standalone hilltop.

24 3. The project allows construction of 42 three-to-four bedroom houses with two-car

25 garages on this approximately five-acre hillside. The City granted the applicant four distinct

26 discretionary approvals: a Vesting Zone Change and Vesting Tentative Tract Map (to subdivide

27 three lots into forty-two lots with an average size of 5,200 square feet each and build houses on
all of them), a Zoning Administrator's Determination (to build one hundred seventy-eight
28

2 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.

retaining walls in a lieu of the allowed two), and a Haul Route Approval (to remove 78,000 cubic

2 yards of earth in lieu of the allowed 3,000 cubic yards).

3 4. In violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the City

4 approved the Project based on a mitigated negative declaration (*MND") instead of an

5 environmental impact report ("EIR"), even though a fair argument exists that the Project may

6 have significant adverse impacts.
5. There will be cumulative impacts such as biological, traffic, air, noise
and light pollution impacts from this project and recent, past present and probable

9 future projects.

10 6. There is substantial evidence in the record including the previous denial by the

11 City Planning Commission of a similar project that the project does not comply with the City of

12 Los Angeles' General Plan and with the North East Community Plan.

13 7. The Project would further result in potentially significant aesthetic, land use,

14 greenhouse gas, public service and traffic impacts that have not been adequately analyzed or

15 mitigated. Thus, the City reliance on a MND to approve the Project violates CEQA.
8. The MND for the Project violates CEQA by failing to adequately analyze
16 and mitigate environmental impacts, including greenhouse-gas emissions and impacts on
17 biological resources.
18 9. There is "new information of substantial importance" which shows that "significant
19 effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous

20 Mitigated Negative Declaration." CEQA Guidelines $ 15162. Moreover, there are mitigation

21 measures which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous Mitigated

22 Negative Declaration that would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the
environment.
23

24 10. The City failed to give notice to interested parties and notices as required.
Residents who requested notices were not notified of decisions. The California
25 Department of Fish and Wildlife, a trustee agency was not noticed of these
26 proceedings. Additionally, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy was not
27 provided the notice of hearing required by CEQA Guidelines §15073(e) because its
28 prior MND comments are in the record.

3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 11. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related environmental

3 documentation, as described below.

4
JURISDICTION

6 12. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of

7 Civil Procedure and Public Resources Code section 21168.

8 13. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

9 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21167, 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code and Gov.

10 Code Section 65009.
14.
11 This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within the
jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as limited civil cases in
12 CCP §§ 86, 86.1 or 87.
13 15. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP $ 3 § 94 because the Respondent City of Los
14 Angeles is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County, which is where the
15 Project's environmental effects will be felt.

16

17 PARTIES

18 16. Petitioner Delia Guerrero is a resident of El Sereno and a member Coyotl +
19 Macehualli, (C+M) a non-profit community-based organization comprised of over three hundred
20 households in the El Sereno area, as well as others who support open space and wildlife
21 preservation. The specific purpose of C+M is to promote the social welfare and environment in
22

23 the hills of El Sereno. Petitioner has attended numerous meetings and has written letters
regarding this project. Petitioner and members of C+M have a direct and substantial beneficial
24

25 interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection.

26 Petitioner and C+M's respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to

27 comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised

28 in this Petition because Petitioner is directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of

17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 History of Project and Project Site.

19 21. The current Project is to construct : 42 unit Small Lot project on a mostly

20 undeveloped hilltop in El Sereno. There is a long history of opposition to the removal of one

21 third of the top of the hillside and removal of rare California Black Walnuts (Juglans

22 Californica) and wildlife habitat on the project site. The project site also provides habitat for the

23 Hoary Bat. Both the California Black Walnut and the Hoary Bat are sensitive species. The

24 residents of this mostly Latino working-class neighborhood have substantial roots in the

25 community. Many have spent their childhoods playing pn the hillsides in El Sereno.

26 22. In 2011, a previous developer proposed a separate project which would have also

27 topped off the hillside removing a substantial number of protected California Walnuts and

28 wildlife habitat. That project also envisioned using Eastern Avenue as the major access point.

5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

That project was denied by the City Planning Commission who refused to grant the Zone change.
2 The Commission made the following findings:
3 That the General Plan Amendment was not consistent with the Northeast Los Angeles
4 Community Plan's Objectives, Policies and Programs.
5 The recommended General Plan Amendment from Low Density Residential to
6 Neighborhood did not comply with Charter Sections 556 and 558 in that the
7 recommended amendment does not reflect the land use patterns, trends and uses in the

8 immediate area and did not further the intent, purposes and objectives of the Northeast
9 Los Angeles Community Plan.
10 The site is located within a designated hillside area and was subject to the regulations
11 contained in the Northeast Hillside Ordinance (Ord.180,403 adopted 12/1 0/08), which
12 limit the scale and bulk of development through limitations in height, floor area, design,
13 the size and number of retaining walls and type of landscape permitted. The site would
14 not be subject to the limitations of the Northeast Hillside Ordinance if the requested
15 entitlements are approved and adopted.
16 The Northeast Hillside Ordinance was enacted to protect both the physical environment
17 and to preserve existing low density hillside neighborhoods. The guiding principle for
18 the land use and zoning recommendations contained in the Northeast Los Angeles
19 Community Plan is to constrain future residential development to the densities that have
20 already occurred in the neighborhoods throughout Northeast Los Angeles.
21 Eastern Avenue is a dedicated, improved Secondary Highway with two lanes of traffic in
22 both northbound and southbound directions. There is a center lane along the property
23 frontage, however, without signalized intersection at the property access point, exiting
24 from the property into the southbound traffic lanes could create traffic hazards.
25 23. Many objections to the plan were lodged due to adverse impacts on the
26 neighborhood and biological resources.
27 24. Case No. AA-2011-2668-PMEX: On January 1, 2012, the Advisory Agency
28

6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

approved a lot line adjustment in conjunction with the proposed development of the site with a
2 charter school, a café, and 20 multi-family residential dwelling units.
3 25. Case No. CPC-2008-1182-ZC and Ordinance No. 180,403: On January 16, 2009,
4 the Ordinance became effective and adopted Qualified "Q" Conditions and Development "D"
5 Limitations for parcels located within the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan area as shown
6 in the accompanying map related to the development of residential dwelling units
7 The Current Project and Administrative Process.
8 26. Consideration of the current project at this site was resurrected in 2015 when the
9 current developer proposed a similar project in that it removes the top one third of the hilltop, a
10 large number of California Black Walnuts, removes wildlife habitat and endangers the Hoary Bat
11 population in this location. Additionally, the problematic exit that was specified in the previous
12 project remain. The previous project had been rejected due to non-compliance with the Hillside
13 Ordinance and the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan and a dangerous exit.
14 27. The current MND, according to the Letter of Determination dated January 14,
15 2021, was recirculated on April 6, 2017.
16 28. Up until the pandemic, El Sereno residents had been very engaged with this project
17 circulating petitions, writing letters and attending meetings.
18 29. In Response to the original MND filed in 2015, the City's Community Forestry
19 Advisory Committee wrote a letter on July 7, 2016 stating that there would be significant
20 impacts from this project and requesting a full Environmental Impact Report and asserting that
21 under California Environmental Quality Act, (CEQA) an EIR is required where there is a FAIR
22 argument that the project may have adverse environmental impacts.
23 30. AB 52 requires the lead agency prior to the issuance of a MND notify through
24 formal notification of proposed projects in the geographic area that is traditionally and culturally
25 affiliated with the tribe. In this case the Department of City Planning notified the Gabrieleno
26 Band of Mission Indians on December 28. 2016. The Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians
27 responded in a letter dated January 10, 2017 requesting that an approved Native American
28

7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F Monitor(s) be present during future ground disturbance. The MND disregarded this request as a
2 less than significant impact and claimed, "However, the letter provided no documentation
3 regarding the potential for significant tribal resources to exist at the project site" even though the
4 MND did acknowledge that significant archaeological resources could exist on site. This
5 dismissal of the Gabrieleno Band of Mission Indians request and exclusion from the mitigation
6 measures is contrary to AB 52 which states at section | (b) 4,
7

8 Recognize that California Native American tribes may have expertise with regard to their tribal history and practices, which concern the tribal cultural resources 9 with which they are traditionally and culturally affiliated. Because the California
10 Environmental Quality Act calls for a sufficient degree of analysis, tribal knowledge about the land and tribal cultural resources at issue should be included
11 in environmental assessments for projects that may have a significant impact on
those resources.
12

13 31. The El Sereno LA-32 Neighborhood Council filed a letter on July 12, 2016

14 opposing the project expressing concerns about the impacts from the project. It specifically

15 indicated concerns about traffic indicating that the project is located in a very congested area of
EI Sereno and that Eastern Avenue is an essential artery for the community. They also expressed 16 concerns about the project not adhering to the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan.
17 32. Dr. Tom Williams submitted a comment letter on May 22, 2017 expressing
18 concern about the inadequacy of the MND and requesting that a "*complete and adequate
19 Environmental Impact Report be prepared with a full range of residential alternatives and draft
are referred to 20 mitigation monitoring and report program. Dr. Williams complained that documents

21 but not available and some were referenced as future submittals which meant that they were

22 unavailable for comment and review by the public.

23 33. Dr. Tom Williams letter describes the misery that will be faced by residents on

24 Harmony and Mallory, "Noise, vibration. light, and visual scale of the project has been transferred from the

25 westerly Eastern Av. corridor to the southerly and easterly boundaries and the existing Mallory and Harmony
residents who will be significantly and massively impacted by/during grading/hauling, concrete retaining wall
26 construction, and then unit construction and then again from the occupied units overlooking and affecting their
27 backyard uses forever.
28

8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. Dr. Williams describes in great detail the inadequacy of the mitigation measures

2 and the MND. He points out that in the Air Quality section that much of the language is not

3 enforceable as it states "Encourage" and "soon" in its measures. He points out how the MND

4 "Construction Staging and Parking Plan", will be provided "Prior to the issuance of.….permit"

5 and that is inadequate for proper review and mitigation measures.
35.
6 Melissa Kellogg and Demetria Contreras submitted a letter dated July 14, 2016
outlining her objections and concerns with the project and the deficiencies of the MND. In her
7 letter she also notes that the City confirmed that 13 California Black Walnuts were removed
8 from the project site illegally.
9 36. Jamie Hall, attorney for EI Sereno resident Melissa Kellogg and Demetria
10 Contreras submitted a letter dated May 24, 2017 explaining that under CEQA and the CEQA
11 Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and a may cause a significant effect on the environment,

12 the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC § § 21100, 21151; 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(I), (f)(I).

13 He further commented that the MND was deficient. His letter stated that the destruction of an

14 entire unspoiled hilltop in the City of Los Angeles, increased traffic, increased greenhouse gas

15 emissions, and other potential growth related impacts constitute "substantial or potentially
substantial adverse change[s] in the environment[,]" and an EIR is required. PRC § 21068, 14
16 Cal Code Regs 15382. His letter explained how the haul route estimations are obviously
17 incorrect. Four trips per hour does not equate to 87 haul trips per day. It is unclear how
18 mitigation measures, including 16-3 Schools Affected by Haul Route can be successfully
19 accomplished given an average of 87 haul trips per day over a three-month grading period. His

20 letter also addresses the unsafe access points for this project, aesthetics, geology, sensitive

21 species, wildlife, tree removal mitigation is inadequate and that feasible alternatives existed that

22 would result in fewer adverse environmental impacts. He also expressed concerns with non-

23 compliance with the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan.
37.
24 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) submitted three letters

25 opposing the project, one dated June 27, 2016 a subsequent one regarding the updated MND
dated May 22, 2017 and a letter dated May 13, 2020. The May 22, 2017, letter stated that the
26 Conservancy found that the MND "remained deficient in its analysis of visual, biological and
27 land use impacts." The letter called for the preparation of a focused Environmental Impact
28 Report. The letter also stated that the project was inconsistent with the Northeast Los Angeles

9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Community Plan Policy 4-1.1 which states, "Encourage the retention of passive and visual open

2 space which provides a balance to the urban development of the plan area."

3 38. On January 23, 2020, a hearing was held at City Hall before the Zoning

4 || Administrator/Deputy Advisory Agency. Many residents submitted comments and attended the

5 hearing and gave public testimony in opposition expressing concerns about traffic, noise,
pollution, aesthetic, construction and light impacts from the project. Concerns about the impacts 6 to trees and wildlife were also expressed.
7 39. Spanish- speaking residents are mostly shut out of City Hearings. The notice for
8 the January 23, 2020, project was sent in English to a community that is 47 percent linguistically
9 isolated which are households where no one over age 14 speaks English well. Linguistically
10 isolated households may not hear or understand important information when there is an

11 emergency like an accidental chemical release or spill according to CalEnviro Screen 3.0. A

12 Spanish speaking resident receiving the hearing document will see a document almost entirely in

13 English. When they turn the page over again the document is almost entirely in English except

14 for one small line of type in Spanish which says the individual can call this number for
information. When the number is called message which is first in English then informs the
15 caller that they can request a translator. However, the Spanish caller may not understand why a
16 translator is needed. This results in a large portion of the El Sereno community and almost all
17 Spanish speaking individuals being denied the right to participate. In fact, most Spanish speakers
18 probably will not even notice the one line of type in Spanish. This was brought up in a letter

19 submitted to the City Council by Clara Solis on May 26, 2021.

20 40. On March 3, 2020, the Advisory Agency, issued its decision approving the Vesting

21 Tentative Tract Map VTT 73531-SL. It adopted the MND and the Mitigated Monitoring

22 Program (MMP). The deadline to file an appeal was March 13, 2020.
41.
23 Resident's ability to file appeals was impacted by the pandemic from the virus that
causes Covid 19. On March 4, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom (Governor) in
24 Executive Order N-33-20 declared a state of emergency due to Covid 19. Residents were
25 informed on March 11, 2020 that the Governor was ordering emergency measures including
26 limiting gatherings unless they were social distanced. Residents were in a state of extreme fear
27 for their lives. Residents were hoarding food and toilet paper by the end of February 2020.
28 People were dying. It soon became clear that Latino and Black residents who constitute the

10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

majority of essential workers in Los Angeles were becoming ill at rates disproportionate to their

2 population numbers. The deadline for filing the appeal was March 13, 2020. On March 16,

3 2020 the County of Los Angeles issued orders closing businesses and requiring social distancing.

4 The Governor issued a stay-at-home order on March 19, 2020 that the state shut down just a few
days after the deadline. By April 17, 2020, the City of Los Angeles had issued protocols for
filing appeals online. Since this decision was issued March 3, 2020, residents did not have the
6 opportunity to use this procedure to file an appeal of the decision. Further, residents had
previously communicated with each other in person. There was no opportunity for residents in
this working-class community with a high number of Spanish speakers to organize to pool their

9 resources to hire an attorney. A comment was made regarding this by Clara Solis on June 8,

10 2021.

11 42. El Sereno residents did not have representation on the Los Angeles City Council

12 (Council) effectively from November 7. 2018 when their Council Member Jose Huizar's office

13 was raided in an FBI probe for corruption until Council Member Kevin de Leon was appointed
on October 13, 2020. On November 15, 2018, Council President Herb Wesson (Wesson)
14 removed Council Member Huizar (Huizar) from his seats on Council Committees. On May 15,
15 2020, two days after the hearing on this case before the East Los Angeles Area Planning
16 Commission Huizar announced that he would limit his participation in City matters. This was
17 prompted when moved to suspend Huizar's role as a lawmaker. On June 23, 2020, Huizar was
18 indicted in Federal Court on charges of corruption alleging "pay to play" schemes involving land

19 use cases - accepting bribes of 1.5 million from developers. Huizar for many years, chaired the

20 City's Planning and Land Use Committee. Huizar was suspended in June 23, 2020. Residents

21 from the Council District 14 wrote to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in August 2020

22 requesting a moratorium on the approval of all new projects in Council District 14. and

23 requesting that each project be reviewed by an outside, independent party or agency for all
projects initiated during Council Member Huizar's tenure as well as during the interim period
24 and until the replacement Council Member is seated and established. A comment was made
25 about this by Clara Solis on June 8. 2020.
26 43. On May 13, 2020, a hearing on this matter was held before the East Los Angeles
27 Planning Commission via Zoom. Hundreds of petitions and letters were submitted by concerned

28 residents expressing their opposition to the project and their concerns about the projects size,

II PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F non-compliance with the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan, environmental impacts to

2 trees and wildlife, traffic, dangerous exits from the project, noise. light, pollution, construction

3 impacts among other issues. Some residents also attempted to comment at the hearing but were

4 unable to do so. Additionally, several individuals claiming to live in El Sereno whom no one

5 recognized from Neighborhood Council meetings spoke in favor of the project. Residents have
complained that this is one problem with Zoom. Further, while each resident's time was limited
6 at the hearing the developers were given a substantial amount of time to present their case. The
7 Commission voted to approve the project. In general comments at this meeting a participant
8 spoke about the inadequacy of notices which contain only one line of Spanish. When speaking

9 its decision, one member of the Commission indicated that he was not concerned about the trees.

10 After, the decision was made, many in the community thought this decision was final. They did

11 not understand that there would be subsequent hearings or written decisions or that they could

12 appeal. During this time, members of the community were largely isolated due to the Covid 19
Pandemic.
13
44.
14 On May 13, 2020, Attorney Jamie Hall submitted a letter on behalf of his client
Advocates for Accessible Open Space. In the letter, Hall submitted that:
15 there is "new information of substantial importance" which shows that "significant
16 effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the
17 previous Mitigated Negative Declaration." CEQA Guidelines § 15162. Moreover,
18 there are mitigation measures which are considerably different from those analyzed

19 in the previous Mitigated Negative Declaration that would substantially reduce one

20 or more significant effects on the environment.

21 Hall elaborated:

22 The new information of substantial importance is that the Southern California Black Walnut meets the criteria to be considered a "rare" species. CEQA
23 Guidelines 15380(d) states as follows: "A species not included in any listing identified in subdivision (c) shall nevertheless be considered to be endangered,
24 rare or threatened, if the species can be shown to meet the criteria in subdivision (b)." The criteria in CEQA Guidelines 15380(b) are as follows: 25 (a) A species of animal or plant is "rare" when either:
26

27 (b) Although not presently threatened with extinction, the species is existing in
such small numbers throughout all or a significant portion of its range that 28 it may become endangered if its environment worsens; or

12 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 (c) The species is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future

3 throughout all or a significant portion of its range and may be considered *threatened" as that term is used in the Federal Endangered Species Act.

4 Hall submitted:

5 CDFW states at page three of that document that plants tracked by the California

6 Natural Diversity Database and California Native Plant Society as California Rare Plant Rank 3 or 4 meet the definition of rare or endangered under CEQA
Guidelines 15380, subdivisions (b) and (d) and warrant consideration under
CEQA on the basis of declining trends, recent taxonomic information and other
8 factors.

o 45. On May 13, 2020, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy submitted a

10 letter explaining the MND was deficient. It states:

11 The Mitigated Negative Declaration remains deficient because if fails to

12 acknowledge that the Southern California Black Walnut is a rare species under a
CEQA Guideline 15380(d). Trustee agency California Department of Fish and
13 Wildlife's position is that plant species tracked by the California Natural Diversity Database and the California Native Plant Society as California Rare
14 Plant Rank 3 or 4 meet the definition rare
under CEQA. ...The loss of a rare species and its habitat warrants far more
15 substantial mitigation than a 4:1 replacement ratio in unspecified locations and
16 uncontrolled soil conditions. replacement ratio in unspecified locations and uncontrolled soil conditions...
17 46. Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written comments on the

18 Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

19 47. On January 14. 2021. a letter of determination was issued by the East Los Angeles
20 Planning Commission finding pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15074(b) that there is no substantial

21 evidence that the project will have significant impact on the environment and adopted the

22 MND and the MMP. Approved and Recommended that the City Council pursuant to Section

23 12.32 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) adopt the zone change from [Q] R1-1D and

48.
27 The notice of the letter of determination dated January 14, 2021 was only mailed to

28 8 people. Only one member of the EI Sereno community, Melissa Kellogg received notice of the

13 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 decision. She was represented by attorney Jamie Hall. Kellogg settled her case with the

2 applicant. The terms of the agreement are unknown. Three of the other notices were distributed

3 to the applicant and two representatives, one notice was sent to former Council Member Jose

4 Huizar, and the two remaining notices were sent to City Commission staff. Members of the

5 community did not receive this notice of the letter of determination. Many residents at the
January 23, 2020 hearing filled out cards asking for notice.
6

7 49. A notice of determination (NOD) was filed on February 4, 2021. This notice of

8 determination is the substantially the same (except for signatures and dates) as the notice of
determination filed June 18. 2021. The June 18, 2021 NOD supersedes the February 4, 2021
9 NOD.
10
50.
11 Subsequently, a hearing was held on May 23, 2021 before the committee that
former council member Huizar chaired - the Planning and Land Use Committee. Members of
12 the El Sereno community were not aware of this hearing and no one attended. The Committee
13 approved the project.
14 51. On May 26. 2021, a public hearing was held before the Los Angeles City Council
15 on this item. The item was continued to June gth 2021.
16
52. On a June 8, 2021 a public hearing was held before the Los Angeles City Council
17 (Council). This project was agenda item 7. The Council allowed 30 minutes of public
18 comments for general public comments and all of the other items on the agenda items. They
19 were allowed to make a one minute comment on each agenda item and one minute on general
20 public comments for a total of 3 minutes. Many of the people who spoke used up more than a

21 minute. Only 16 members of the public were able to speak. A number of members of the

22 community reported trying to call in on item #7, but not being called on. Only two individuals

23 were able to comment on Item 7, Diana Nicole and Michael Hayden. Michael Hayden said,

24 This plan would remove over 100 threatened California black walnut

25 trees, and I just want to emphasize what the last caller would say. Which is that it's not just about the number of trees, but when you a have a

26 concentration of trees that is a much more valuable resource. And important especially for a species like this which is threatened and
27 vulnerable. And has such a narrow range. Its only in this part of the state

28 where this tree grows… We need to take into full consideration the value of protecting protected trees. And also, this plan does not have, it does not

2 would be affordable for this neighborhood. It's a terrible plan please vote no. Please protect our species and please protect our neighborhood.
3 Diana Nicole stated:

4
a am a landscape ecologist and I'm also on the board of Los Angeles Audubon. The
5 term urban forest is often used to refer to all the trees within a city. The trees that are
along our streets and sidewalks and within our yards and parks are the most visible
6 and have helped shape how we conceive of the term. However, I want you all to

7 understand there are patches in our urban area that have more in common with their
a larger wild brethren than they do with a street tree or a manicured park. The US a

8 Forest Service actually refers to these areas as urban forest patches or urban woodlands or forest in the city. In California we call these patches sensitive natural

9 communities and they're supposed to be protected, They're supposed to be mitigated by an area of 5:1 under CEQA......when you take and destroy rare plant
10 species, a sensitive natural resource or a forest patch you are just violating our environmental laws, you're destroying a natural resource that we need especially
11 during climate .Item 7. This MND is an embarrassment. First it was not circulated to CDFW for their input. Second, it makes the claim that there are no endangered or
12 rare species. That's a complete and utter lie. There are 111 mature California Walnut trees on this property. The Southern California Black Walnut is designated
13 rare, vulnerable species in the state, a has a restricted range with relatively few populations with 21 to 80 occurrences.
14

15 53. At the June 8, 2021 City Council meeting indicated above, Council
Member Kevin de Leon submitted a "technical amendment." This amendment was
16 not made available to members of the community. lt is not present on the City's
17 website, LA City Clerk Connect. The only access to the language of this amendment
18 at the time of the hearing was when the City Attorney read the amendment into the
19 record. It is now available only by listening to the council meeting via youtube. The

20 amendment reads:

21 Modify recommendation 2 as follows, Icl improve Eastern Avenue being
22 dedicated and adjoining the subdivision by the construction of a new concrete

23 curb 2 foot wide concrete gutter and full width concrete sidewalks with tree wells
including any necessary removal and reconstruction of existing improvements.

6 Add to 3 the current language for condition 3 to say construct street lighting and
7 both standalone and pole mounted pedestrian lighting on Eastern Avenue and Lombardy Avenue adjacent to the site consistent with Envision Eastern Plan 8 subject to review and approval by the Bureau of street lighting
54. The failure to provide the public with a written copy of this document prior to the

10 meeting or to allow residents to make public comments meant that the public was denied the
11 opportunity to participate. It resulted in the denial of the opportunity for the people to present
12 any evidence on this matter. It was a denial of due process. Michael Hayden protested this in
13 his comment to the City Council:
14 Even just the fact that the MND had all of these changes to it that were only read verbally
15 this morning. Means that the public and the Council has not had time to consider the
16 changes.
17 55. Further, since traffic and safety were issues that concerned residents of El Sereno
18 and were items that were investigated in the MND this addition of new curb-outs and the
19 widening of the sidewalk could result in additional traffic and safety problems that were not
20
fully investigated in the MND.
21 56. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is the trustee agency for
22 environmental review of the biology related to a rare species and habitat. The City failed to
23 notify CDFW of the project. In failing to provide this notification, the City violated CEQA.
24 CDFW advised the City of this on July 14, 2021.
25 Diana Nicole stated at the City Council Meeting. "....it was not circulated to CDFW for their
26 input."

3 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
4 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW
5

57. Petitioner objected to the Project in the administrative process by submitting
letters during the comment period and providing testimony at the public meetings and

8 hearings regarding the Project. Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each

Q of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's

10 decision-making process.

11 58. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of

12 ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

13 In the absence of such remedies, the Cities' approval of the Project would form the basis

14 for a development project that would proceed in violation of state law.

15 59. Petitioner at the June 8, 2021 City Council meeting was denied due process

16 when the so-called technical amendment was not presented in written form prior to the

17 hearing but was instead only available to the public as read by the City Attorney orally.

18 The public it was infeasible for the public to be able to file written comments to the
technical amendment that was given orally. Further the petitioner was denied the ability
19

20 to comment on the technical amendment as only 30 minutes of public comment were
allowed and most of the residents who attended the virtual meeting were not called upon
21 to comment. Further, as the technical amendment concerned possible issues studied in
22 the MND, this also resulted in the inability of the public to address the issue in the MND.

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

61. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
62. CEQA prohibits a lead agency from approving a project that may have a
6 significant impact on the environment without first preparing, considering, and certifying
7 an EIR. The City violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project, despite
8 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the project may have a significant
9 impact on the environment.
10 63. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate
11 information regarding a project to determine the appropriate environmental review
12 document and "documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative
13 declaration that project will not have a significant effect on the environment." (Ctr. for
14 Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1156,
15 1170, citations omitted.) There must be a basis within the record to support the
16 conclusions reached by the initial study. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa
17 Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1201.) "Where an agency. .. fails to gather
18 information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a
19 negative declaration is inappropriate."* (El Dorado County Taxpayers for Quality Growth
20 v. County of El Dorado (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th 1591, 1597, citations omitted.)
21 64. There will be cumulative impacts such as biological, traffic, pollution, from this
22 project and from recent, past, present and probable future projects.
23 65. There is substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument that the
24 project may have significant project level and cumulative adverse effects on the
25 environment, including, but not limited to, the following impacts:
26 a. Biological Resource Impacts

-

2 (CDFW) is charged by law to provide, as available, biological expertise during public

3 agency environmental review efforts, focusing specifically on projects and related

4 activities that have the potential to adversely affect state fish and wildlife resources.

5 The City of Los Angeles violated CEQA by ignoring CDFW and adopting an MND

6 for the Project without notifying or sending copies of the proposed MND or related

7 documents to the State Clearinghouse for distribution to the California Department of

8 Fish and Wildlife (CDFW), pursuant to Public Resources Code (CEQA Guidelines)

9 section 15073(d). At the June 8 City Council meeting, ecological landscape

10 professional, Diana Nicole, said the MND had not been circulated to CDFW for their

11 review. A letter from CDFW to Planning and CD 14 Planning Deputy confirms that

12 copies of the proposed MND were not sent to the State Clearinghouse for distribution

13 to the state agencies (exhibit A).

14 67. In its May 13, 2020 letter to the City of Los Angeles, the Santa Monica

15 Mountains Conservancy, a trustee agency, said the City of Los Angeles (City) failed to
provide the notice of the hearing on the MND to the Santa Monica Mountains

16 Conservancy as required by CEQA Guidelines §15073(e).

17 68. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy letter commented that the MND

18 is deficient because it fails to acknowledge that the Southern California Black Walnut

19 is a rare species under CEQA Guideline 15380 (d).

20 69. The Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy letter commented that the trustee

21 agency, California Department of Fish and Wildlife's position is that the Southern

22 California Black Walnut (Juglans californica) species has a rare plant rank of 3 or 4

23 which meets the definition of rare under CEQA and that the loss of a rare species and

24 its habitat warrants far more substantial mitigation than a 4:1 (tree replacement ratio).

25 70. The MND underestimates the number of trees and rare species on the

26 project site. A review of documents in the study reveals that the project site is home to

27 additional rare native tree species Southern California black walnut (Juglans

28 californica), not considered in the MND. The "moldy" 2018 Tree Preservation Report

19 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

from Arborgate for the City's protected and significant trees mentions that "the size of
2 the walnuts varies widely from seedlings up to fairly large specimens" and observed
3 that "other walnuts were found to be smaller than protected by the ordinance". Most
trees grow at a rate of 12 inches to 24 inches or more per year. For instance, the
5 Southern California black walnut tree grows at an annual rate of 24 inches per year.
6 Therefore, it is likely that the MND underestimates the number of trees on the project
7 site and also underestimates the number of trees that qualify as significant and
8 protected trees.
q 71. The MND fails to recognize a Sensitive Natural Community. The study and
10 the Tree Preservation Report provide information that shows that the Southern
11 California black walnut is the dominate species with a mixed understory that includes
12 California natives (Toyon, Buckwheat). Any mapping of this site following the
13 CDFW's protocol document mentioned in Attorney Hall's comment, titled "Protocols
14 for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to Special Status Native Plant Populations and
15 Sensitive Nature Communities, would conclude that a large portion of the site is
16 dominated by Southern California black walnut and consequently would be classified
17 as walnut woodland or portions of the site as walnut groves with a global conservation
18 status rank of G3 (Vulnerable-At moderate risk of extinction due to a restricted
19 range, relatively few populations [often 80 or fewer], recent and widespread declines,
20 or other factors"), and is recognized as a Sensitive Natural Community by CDFW.
21 Whether or not the proposed building itself would impact walnut trees is irrelevant; the
22 Southern California black walnuts that would be impacted are part of the walnut
23 woodland or groves.
24 72. Attorney Hall submitted comments that said measures the MND adopted
25 (namely, replacement trees at a 4:1 ratio) are insufficient to mitigate the impacts to a
26 rare Sensitive Natural Community, because merely replacing individual tree specimens
27
28 under the City's Protected Tree Ordinance ignores CDFW's document titled

20 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to Special Status Native Plant
2 Populations and Sensitive Nature Communities.1". which addresses Sensitive Natural
3 Communities in Environmental Review and recognizes Walnut Woodlands or Groves
such as the Project site as Sensitive Natural Communities that should be mitigated at a
ratio of no less than 5:1 (by area) for impacts to S-3 ranked communities. Moreover,
the document considers walnut woodlands distinct biological communities, consisting
of trees, shrubs, vines, and herbaceous understory vegetation. The MND only
considers the value of the trees and fails to value of these unique communities in a
9 biological setting. Because the proposed project would reduce the habitat area on the
10 site considerably (at least by 70%), it will have a resulting impact on the number of
11 wildlife species supported by the site.
12 73. The MND concludes that project impacts to the Southern California black
13 walnut woodland or groves, a sensitive natural plant community, would be less than
14 significant with application of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance. Petitioner contends
15 that requirement for replacement trees under the City's protected tree ordinance does
16 not qualify as a mitigation for special status trees nor impacts to a sensitive natural
17 community under CEQA. According to CDFW Protocols for Surveying and
18 Evaluating Impacts to Special Status Native Plant Populations and Sensitive Nature
19 Communities, impacts to sensitive natural communities are measured in terms of the
20 area affected, not the number of trees. Moreover, replacement trees are not considered
21 mitigation under the City's protected tree ordinance.
22 74. The MND identifies deferred, inadequate, and unenforceable mitigation
23 measures for rare tree species in the form of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance.
24 CEQA requires an analysis of this potentially significant impact and the consideration
25 of mitigation measures to reduce it to a less than significant level. Instead, the MND
26 relies on a mitigation provision for the removal of special status trees through the
27 City's protected tree ordinance that is deferred to an unspecified date for the required
28

2i PETITIONLEOR WRIT dE MANDATE

public hearing before the City's Board of Public Works as required by the City
2 ordinance (186873).
3 75. The MND relies on 2018 Tree Preservation Report that mis-identifies the
4 Southern California black Walnut trees in its findings that "no endangered or rare
5 species were observed" (page 4). As explained by Attorney Hall in his written
6 comment, "Southern California black walnut is designated S-3, which is considered
7 vulnerable in the state due to a restricted range with relative few populations. An S-3
8 ranking indicates there are 21 to 80 occurrences of this community in existence in
o California, S-2 has 6 to 20 occurrences. CDFW considers plant communities, alliances,
10 and associations with a statewide ranking of S-1, S-2, S-3 and S-4 as sensitive and
11 declining at the local and regional level (Sawyer et al. 2008)."
12 76. Attorney Hall says that the MND fails to recognize the project site has
13 value as habitat for a rare and sensitive tree species as evidenced by the fact that the
14 land is dominated by Southern California Black Walnut trees. Attorney Hall states that
15 the Southern California black walnut (plant community) is a sensitive and declining
16 habitat type, is difficult to restore, and takes many years before habitat functions and
17 values in restoration areas are equivalent to impacted areas.
18 77. Attorney Hall says the project fails to consider the benefit of tree clusters in
19 sensitive areas. A ribbon of 15 trees along the edge of a property has far less biological
20 value than a cluster of established trees which form the foundation of a woodland plant
21 community. Black walnut woodlands are under severe threat from urbanization and
22 considered to be one of the states rare and imperiled natural communities (Jones &
23 Stokes Associates 1987). Juglans californica is endemic to California where it exists in
24 only four counties in Southern California.
25 78. Attorney Hall says compliance with the City's Native Protected Tree
26 Ordinance is insufficient The City's Native tree protection ordinance focuses on
27 individual trees, but misses recognition of the whole community of organisms that live
28

22 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

] within an area, in this instance within the walnut woodland. Replacement of specimen
2 trees on a site that has its habitat area significantly reduced to accommodate structures
3 does not offset the impacts to this recognized rare Natural Community.
4 79. Attorney Hall proposed mitigation measures to reduce the adverse impacts
5 but those measures were not adopted.
6 80. The Community Forest Advisory Committee (CFAC), advisory committee
7 comprising representatives from each City Council office and approved by the Mayor,
8 proposed "Mitigation Banking" at an additional 2:1 by area for the loss of the walnut
9 woodland habitat but that mitigation proposal was ignored by the MND.
10 81. CFAC stated that the property is incorrectly described as urban infill
11 because the property is a rare five acres of contiguous woodland habitat that has been
12 undeveloped for generations, which does not fit the description of infill under Section
13 32 of CEQA grants MNDs where the designation is assumed to be synonymous with
14 limited environmental impact.
15 82. CFAC stated that the property is a *critical and rare functioning ecosystem
16 supporting numerous species of mammals, birds, insects, plants and microbes" and
17 determined that removing over 100 trees for the project and the over grading (85,000
18 cubic yards) for the project will have a very significant environmental impact.
19 83. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy wrote a comment affirming its
20 opposition to the Project and finding that the proposed MND was deficient in its
21 analysis of visual, biological, and land use impacts.
22 84. The MND erroneously concludes that the project will have no impact on
23 forest land or conversion of forest land to non-forest use. However, the Santa Monica
24 Mountains Conservancy referred to the project site as a one of a kind "large forested
25 knoll" in its comment letter. A commenter at the June 8 City Council hearing on the 8
26 item, said the project site has more in common with its larger wild brethren than it
27 does with a street tree or manicured park. The USDA Forest Service refers to these
28

23 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (the project site) natural wooded areas as "urban forest patches," "urban woodlands,"
2 or "forests in cities" and that they are referred to as Sensitive Natural Communities in
3 the state.

4 b. Tribal Cultural Resource Impacts
5 85. CEQA requires careful consideration of a project's impacts on cultural
6 resources. In this case the Gabrileno Band of Mission Indians requested that a monitor be
7 present whenever the ground is disturbed. The mitigation measures disregarded this
8 request even though AB34 states, "51. tribal knowledge about the land and tribal cultural
9 resources at issue should be included in environmental assessments for projects that may have a
10 significant impact on those resources."
11 86. The MND (p. IV-168) says that if archeological resources are found, the project
12 will be required to follow procedures detailed in Public Resources Code section 21083 .2, so
13 impacts will be less than significant. But section 21083 .2 does not provide for procedures to
14 protect tribal cultural resources at the time of discovery and is not an appropriate substitute for
15 mitigation measures formulated during the environmental review process.
16 C. Cultural Resources Impacts
17 77. As indicated in the letter provided by the LA - 32 Neighborhood Council the
18 hillsides of El Sereno are for the community a cultural resource and a part of its identity.
19 78. An EIR should have been prepared to analyze the significant cultural
20 resource impacts and to evaluate alternatives and mitigation measures to address those
21 impacts.
22 79. The administrative record ordinarily is very limited when there is only an initial
23 study and no EIR. Project opponents who challenge a negative declaration often have no expert
24 studies to rely on. Recognizing this. courts have held that the absence of expert studies is not
25 an obstacle because personal observations concerning nontechnical matters may constitute
26 substantial evidence under CEQA. (Arviv Enterprises. Inc. v. South Valley Area Planning Com.,
27 supra, 101 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347, 125 Cal.Rptr.2d 140: Oro Fino Gold Mining Corp. v. County
28

24 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of El Dorado (1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 872, 882-883, 274 Cal.Rptr. 720.)
2 d. Aesthetic Impacts
3 80. It is well settled that "[a] project that interferes with scenic views has an
4 adverse aesthetic effect on the environment." (Bowman v. City of Berkeley (2004) 122
5 Cal.App.4th 572, 586.)
6 81. The MND fails analyze the Project's significant impacts on views of the
7 hilltop and trees for residents in the El Sereno neighborhood. These hills and trees are a
8 valued public resource. Instead with the lopping off of the hilltop, they will be left with a
pyramid shaped monstrosity.
10 82. The LA-32 Neighborhood Council explained that the hillsides of El Sereno
11 are a cultural treasure and scenic resource for the community. It states how the "loss of
12 this hillside will be devastating to the community as it will degrade the visual character of
13 this site and will degrade the geographic identity of our community."
14 e. Land Use Impacts
15 83. CEQA requires an analysis of a project's inconsistencies with existing land
16 use plans. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(d)(5).) If substantial evidence supports a fair
17 argument that a proposed project conflicts with the policies included in existing land use
18 plans, "this constitutes grounds for requiring an EIR. Whether a fair argument can be
19 made on this point is a legal question on which [courts] do not defer to the City Council's
20 determination." (Pocket Protectors v. City Of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903,
21 930.)
22 84. As detailed by many in the community and in the 2013 decision by the City
23 Planning Commission the Project would conflict with the City's Northeast Los Angeles
24 Community Plan.
25 85. The MND fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the Northeast
26 Los Angeles Community Plan instead illogically stating it comply.
27 86. The MND also fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the City of
28

25 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Los Angeles' General Plan's policies and goals intended to protect residents, community
2 character and cultural resources.
3 87. An EIR is required to analyze all of these land use policy inconsistencies.
4 f. Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts
5
88. The MND's analysis of the Project's greenhouse-gas (GHG) impacts does not
6 comport with CEQA's requirements
7 89. The MND failed to analyze the Project's localized air quality impacts.
8 90. The MND acknowledges that the Project would increase capacity, and thus

0 increase traffic volumes. The MND fails to adequately address the impacts associated
10 with this increase in vehicle miles traveled and the associated increases in air pollution
11 and greenhouse gas emissions. It also fails to address the health impacts the surrounding
12 community would experience due to the increase in air pollution and bringing it closer to
13 residents and other sensitive receptors.
14 91. Residents in this Census tract already face PM 2.5 pollution in the 84th
15 percentile. Residents in this census tract have high risk of cardiovascular incidents
16 which is associated with air pollution.
17 92. The MND says SCAQMD provides that if an individual development project
18 generates less than significant emissions, then it won't generate a cumulatively considerable
19 increase in emissions for nonattainment pollutants. That would mean that no project with
20 individually less than significant emissions could ever contribute to a cumulatively considerable
21 net increase, calling the MND's analysis into question.
22 93. The MND acknowledges an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, but
23 instead of determining whether this impact would be significant, the MND merely
24 concludes the impact is too speculative. The analysis used violates CEQA case law,
25 including Center for Biological Diversity v. Dept. of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204
26 [Newhall]. Under this analysis no project would have significant GHG emissions, because every
27 project can benefit from the State's regulations reducing GHG emissions. CEQA requires an
28

26 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

analysis of this potentially significant impact and the consideration of mitigation
2 measures to reduce it to a less than significant level. Instead, the MND identifies
3 deferred and unenforceable mitigation measures that could potentially reduce greenhouse
4 gas emissions.
5 g. Noise and Vibration Impacts
6 94. The MND found the Project would increase noise impacts to adjacent
7 residences, resulting in noise levels ahove significance levels during construction. The
8 MND fails to provide adequate mitigation to address this significant noise impact. Many
9 residents expressed concern about noise to their quiet neighborhood during the probable
10 more than two year construction period and afterwards from the high density from 42
11 new units. The neighbors described how noise carries up the hillside. The MND
12 describes noise level increases of 18.8 and 17.6 dBA and describes how these increases
13 exceed the 5 dBA considered by LAMC to be a noise violation. The mitigation measures
14 will provide temporary sound walls which reduce the sound 10 dBA if they work. That is
15 still above the 5 dB.A considered a noise violation. MND page IV 117.
16 95. Noise impacts to Farmdale Elementary School would also be significantly
17 adverse. There would be a 6 dBA increase to 77.6 would exceed the 75 dBA noise limit
18 established by the LAMC at 50 feet.
19 h. Traffic Impacts
20 96. The Project would increase traffic capacity and levels. The MND indicates
21 increases in Volume to Capacity. In some cases the increase pushes the intersection to
22 the next worse grade. Residents are local experts on existing conditions. In their letters
23 they have expressed concerns that during peak periods and during school pick up and
24 drop off times traffic can back up on Eastern and Lombardy. The 2013 determination
25 letter by the City Planning Commission expressed concerns about vehicles exiting from
26 Eastern to go Southbound. They felt this was a dangerous intersection. If accidents do
27 occur, how that will impact traffic on this arterial was not addressed in the MND.

27 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Second Cause of Action

2 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law

3 97. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

4 98. The City's determination that the project was consistent with the Northeast Los

5 Angeles Community Plan was in error and not supported by substantial evidence.
99.
6 The approval of the Zoning Administrator Entitlements (ZAD), allowing

7 extensive retaining walls to be built on-site, one hundred eighty-seven retaining walls,
wee beyond what the LAMC would normally allow.
8 100. The ZAD Entitlements were objected to by several parties.
9 101. The Court should therefore order the ZAD Entitlements set aside.
10 Inconsistency with the Community Plan
11 102. Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan (Community Plan) is the portion of the

12 City of Los Angeles General Plan containing land-use specifics for the Project Site. The

13 Planning and Zoning Law prohibits the City from approving the Project unless it is consistent

14 with applicable general-plan and specific-plan policies and objectives.
103.
15 The Project is inconsistent with the following Community Plan Objectives and

16 Policies, so the City abused its discretion in approving the Project:

a. Policy 1-1.1: "Protect existing stable single-family and other lower density
17 residential neighborhoods from encroachment by higher density residential and other uses
18 that are incompatible as to scale and character or would otherwise diminish the quality of
19 life."

20 1. Program: The Plan map identifies areas where only single-family

21 residential development is permitted; it protects these areas from encroachment by

22 designating, where appropriate, transitional Low Medium multiple-residential and

23 mixed-use buffers and height district limitations.

24 2.Program: The Plan Map identifies most privately-owned undeveloped
areas as suitable for development as single-family or lower density multiple-
25 family residences only.
26 3.Program: The Plan Map identifies specific areas where multi-family
27 residential development is permitted within accessible areas where prevailing

28

28 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 densities would ensure compatibility with existing development and where
infrastructure and public services are adequate.

3 b. Objective 1-1: "To preserve and enhance existing residential neighborhoods.

4 Policy 1.2.2 "Locate higher residential densities near commercial and institutional

5 centers, light rail transit stations, and major bus routes to encourage pedestrian

6 activity and use of public transportation, providing that infrastructure, public

7 service facilities, utilities, and topography will fully accommodate this
development.
8

9 1.Program: The Plan Map generally retains the highest density land use

10 designations near major transportation arteries, commercial centers, and major
institutional uses.

11 d. Objective 1-3 To preserve and enhance the residential character and scale of

12 existing single and multi-family neighborhoods.

13 Policy: Protect the quality and scale of the residential environment through

14 attention to the appearance of new construction including site planning and

15 compatible building design.

16 1.Program: The Plan Map is based on the principle of maintaining

17 f. prevailing densities which will promote compatibility.

18 Policy 1-3.2 Consider factors, such as neighborhood character and aesthetics,
identity; compatibility of land uses; impacts on livability, services, public

19 facilities. and traffic levels, when changes in residential densities are proposed.

20 g.

21 h. Objective 1-5 To limit the intensity and density of development in hillside areas.

22 Policy 1-5.1 Limit development according to the adequacy of the existing and

23 assured street circulation system within the Plan Area and surrounding areas.

24 1.Program: The Plan Map significantly reduces plan designations and

25 corresponding zones in areas located at the base of hillside communities

26 previously designated Medium density residential to reduce impact on access in
hillside areas.

27 2.Program: Implementation of the Plan is. in part,

28 based on continued application

29 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of the Citywide Hillside Ordinance and the Mount Washington/Glassell Park
2 Specific Plan.
3 3.Program: Continue the implementation of the Citywide Hillside Ordinance.
Policy 1-5.3 Consider the steepness of the topography and the geologic stability

in any proposal for development within the Plan area.
1.Program: The Plan Map retains restrictive land use designations and zones in
hillside areas because of topography, geologic stability, and restricted access.
Policy 1-5.4 Require that any proposed development be designed to enhance and
9 be compatible with adjacent development.
10 k. Policy 1-5.5 Encourage clustering of residential projects in order to use the
11 natural terrain to best advantage.
12 1. Program: The Plan Map designates significant hillside areas for Low density
13 residential corresponding to the RD6 or RD5 zones that permit lot assembly and
14 concentration of units to optimize adaptation to site characteristics.
15 Third Cause of Action
16 Violation of the Subdivision Map Act

17 104. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

18 105. Gov. Code§§ 66473.5 and 66474(a) require that tract maps be consistent with
19 General Plans and Specific Plans. As alleged above, the Tract Map is inconsistent with the
20 General Plan and the Specific Plan, so the City has violated the Subdivision Map Act (SMA) by
21 approving it.
22 106. The City has made findings under Gov. Code§ 66474(c) and (d), finding that

23 "the site is physically suitable for the proposed type of development," and the site is

24 physically suitable for the proposed density of development," but the City abused its discretion in

25 making these findings, because they are not true, and are not supported by substantial evidence
in the record.
26
107.
27 The City has made findings under Gov. Code§ 66474(e) finding that "the design
of the subdivision and the proposed improvement are not likely to cause substantial
28

30 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat," but

2 the City abused its discretion in making this finding. because it is not true, and is not supported

3 by substantial evidence in the record.

4 108. Gov. Code§ 66473.1 requires that the City disapprove a tract-map application

5 unless it finds that the design of the project will provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive
or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. The City made a finding on this
6 issue in this case, but that finding is completely conclusory, just another check-off box for the
City in preparing the VTTM findings. There is no evidence in the record showing the developer
8 has made any attempt to adjust the tract-map design to maximize passive and natural heating or

Q cooling opportunities in the Project. The City's finding that the tract map will provide for future

10 passive or natural heating or cooling to the extent feasible is not supported by substantial

11 evidence in the record.

12 Inconsistency with the Community Plan
109.
13 Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan (Community Plan) is the portion of the

14 City of Los Angeles General Plan containing land-use specifics for the Project Site. The
Planning and Zoning Law prohibits the City from approving the Project unless it is consistent
15 with applicable general-plan and specific-plan policies and objectives.
16 110. The Project is inconsistent with the Community Plan Objectives and Policies, so
17 the City abused its discretion in approving the Project.

Subject: ENV-2015-1918-MND (El Sereno / 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small Lot Subdivision)'

Good morning,
In reference to the ENV-2015-1918-MND (El Sereno / 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small
Lot Subdivision) Mitigated Negative Declaration, I could not find any notice to CDFW for
review. In addition, pursuant to Public Resources Code (CEQA Guidelines) section
15073(d):

Where one or more state agencies will be a responsible agency or a trustee agency or will exercise jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by the
project, or where the project is of statewide, regional, or areawide
environmental significance, the lead agency shall send copies of the proposed
negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration to the State
Clearinghouse for distribution to the state agencies.

At a minimum, CDFW would be a trustee agency for this project since it will affect
natural resources (e.g., rare and sensitive black walnuts and walnut woodland). Therefore, as required by the Public Resources Code, this project's MND should have been sent to the State Clearinghouse for distribution. However, I could not locate your
MND or any related documentation for this project with the State Clearinghouse, which
is typically posted on https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/.

1) Could you please provide any record that this CEQA environmental document has been provided to CDFW for review?
2) Could you please direct me to where it has been posted with the State Clearinghouse?

a CDFW would like a chance to review, and if necessary, provide comments on the proposed project. Please feel free to reach out to me to coordinate on this project. Thank you.

Challenge to the approval of the 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small Lot Division

Honorable Attorney General:
Please find enclosed a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed to challenge the City of Los Angeles' (City) failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving the 2520 North Eastern Avenue Small Lot Division ("Project"). The City failed to comply with CEQA by adopting a mitigated negative
declaration instead of preparing an environmental impact report for the Project because there is a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that the Project may have significant biological, aesthetic, air quality, greenhouse gas, noise, traffic, land use and
other impacts.

This Petition is being provided pursuant to the notice provisions of the Public Resources
Code.
