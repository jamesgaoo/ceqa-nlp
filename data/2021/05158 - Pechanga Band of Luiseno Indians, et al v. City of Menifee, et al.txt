PARTIES

2 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff PECHANGA BAND OF LUISEÑO INDIANS
[*Pechanga"] is, and at all times relevant herein was, a federally recognized Indian tribe and
sovereign government. Pechanga is a "California Native American Tribe" within the meaning of
5 section 21073 of the Public Resources Code.

2. Petitioner and Plaintiff SOBOBA BAND OF LUISEÑO INDIANS ["Soboba"] is,
and at all times relevant herein was, a federally recognized Indian tribe and sovereign government.
8 Soboba is a "California Native American Tribe" within the meaning of section 21073 of the Public
9 Resources Code.

10 3. Petitioners Pechanga and Soboba [collectively, "Petitioners," or the "Tribes"] have a
11 clear, present and beneficial right to the performance of Respondent's duty to carry out its
12 obligations in conformity with all applicable state, federal and other laws.

13 4. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF MENIFEE [the "City" or "Respondent"] is a
14 local government agency and political subdivision. The City has taken the actions, as fully alleged
15 below by which Petitioners are aggrieved and of which Petitioners seeks review by this Court.

16 5. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, Defendant and Real
17 Party-in-Interest INLAND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS ['"Inland Partners" or
18 | "RPI") is, and at all times relevant herein was, a limited liability company organized and existing
19 under the laws of the State of California with its principal business within the County of Riverside.

20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 6. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085 and 1094.5 of
22 the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources

23 Code.

24 7. The Tribes have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law and has exhausted all
25 available administrative remedies.

26 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California,
27| County of Riverside, because the subject property and Inland's project are located in the County of
28 Riverside.

A GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

5 A.

6 Inland Partners Proposes Converting 98.94 Acres of Tribal Cultural Property and

Tribal Cultural Resources into a Commercial Business Park.

7 10.

8 The Tribes seek a writ of mandate against Respondent related to what RPI has
described as the "Menifee Gateway Project," a proposed commercial subdivision in the city of
9 Menifee adjacent to the west side of Interstate I-215 comprising Assessor's Parcel Numbers 360-
10 230-018 and 3460-270-001. The proposed project would convert 98.94 acres into 13 parcels

11 encompassing a large business park, office space, and other commercial uses [the "Proposed
12 Project"]. The land is currently flat agricultural land located on the boundary of Menifee Valley

13 and the Santa Ana Mountains.

14 11. The Proposed Project site lies within a Traditional Cultural Property [*TCP"]',
15 which is also a Tribal Cultural Resource ['TCR"] of high cultural and religious significance to both
16 the Pechanga and the Soboba. The Proposed Project site is also located within an archacological
17 district, which is a Historical Resource as defined by the California Environmental Quality Act
18 ['CEQA"].?

19 12. TCRs are landscapes, sacred places, and objects with cultural value to a California
20 Native American Tribe and are either on or eligible for the California Register of Historical

21 Resources ['"CHRIS"] or a local historic register, or the lead agency, at its discretion, chooses to
22 treat the resource a as a TCR. (See Pub. Res. Code, § 21074(a)(1)(A)-(B).)

23 //1

24

25 Traditional Cultural Properties are eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Preservation because of their association with cultural practices and beliefs that are: (1) rooted in the history of the community; and, (2) are

26 important to maintaining the continuity of that community's traditional beliefs and practices. National Register Bulletin 38 (TCPs), can be used to define property as a location associated with the traditional beliefs of a Native American

27 group about its origins, its cultural history, or the natural world. Although not exclusively used in the Native American community, TCPs have been used to protect the beliefs, customs, and practices of California Indian Communities.

28 2 A Historical Resource includes buildings, sites, structures, objects, or districts, each of which may have historical, prehistoric, architectural, archaeological, cultural, or scientific importance and is eligible for listing or is listed in the
California Register of Historical Resources. Pub. Resources Code, § 21084.1; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15064(a). 3

1 13. The Proposed Project site contains highly sensitive TCRs. A ceremonial and
2 prehistoric habitation site was found at the Project site and each remaining identified and inter-
3 connected archaeological site on the property (sites CA-RJV-333, -632 -633, -12916, -12917, -
4 12918, -12919 and -12920) comprises significant tribal cultural resources within the meaning of

5 CEQA.

6 14. Indeed, the Proposed Project site sits directly across the street from property that is

7 part of the Ringing Rock village complex, a widely known and important protected cultural

8 resource in Riverside County. The site is part of what was a major village, and Ringing Rock was

9 used for highly ceremonial purposes. Slabs with numerous mortars, carved boulders, petroglyphs
10 and pictographs are present and evidence the people who once congregated in this area.

11 15. Critical to this case, and as early as the 1960s, archeological studies have
12 determined that the Project site is of high cultural significance containing ceremonial sites and
13 unique artifacts, shells and ceramic figures. The studies found that over 70% of all bone recovered
14 was burned, and that artifacts were burdened as well-indicating cremation and burning
15 ceremonies.

16 16. a Specifically, Site RIV-631 is a prehistoric habitation and ceremonial site formally
17 recorded in 1973 (See California Historical Resources Information System or CHRIS). CA-RIV-
18 333 was formally recorded in 1953. (lbid.) Additional sites CA-RIV-632 and -633 were also
19 formally recorded as in 1973. (Ibid.) Indeed, Inland Partners has admitted that each of these sites

20 are "Cultural Resources" and noted that "pictographs, or rock art, were found on the property".3

21 Important tribal artifacts and evidence of subsistence were found at each of the remaining sites.
22 B. The Proposed Project Site is Subject to CEQA and the Tribal Consultation

23 Requirements Set Forth in Assembly Bill 52.

24 17. CEQA is California's most important environmental law governing the review and
25 approval process of most developments in California. The purpose of CEQA is to inform

26 governmental decision-makers and the public about the environmental effects of proposed

activities, identify ways that damage to the environment can be avoided or significantly avoided,
2 prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through

3 the use of alternatives or mitigation measures and disclose to the public the reasons why a
governmental agency approved the project in the manner chosen if significant environmental
effects are involved. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15002.)

6 18. CEQA expressly requires an evaluation of impacts to Tribal Cultural Resources

7 (TCRs).

8 19. Landscapes, sacred places, and objects with cultural value to a California Native
9 American Tribe may be listed as historical resources in the California Register if they meet any of

10 the following National Register of Historic Places criteria (1) is associated with events that have

11 a made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage;

12 (2) is associated with the lives of persons important to our past; or (3) embodies the distinctive
13 characteristics of a type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an
14 important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values. In such case, the Tribal Cultural

15 Resource is "significant" within the meaning of CEQA.

16 20. Importantly, where a lead agency has discretion to treat a resource as a significant
17 TCR, it is required to consider the significance of the resource to a California Native American
18 tribe.

19 21. Any project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a

20 TCR is considered to be a project that may have a significant effect on the environment. (Pub.

21 Resources Code, § 21084.2.) A "substantial adverse change" means demolition, destruction,
22 relocation, or alteration such that the significance of an historical resource would be impaired.4

23 22. If a substantial adverse change were to occur to a TCR, then CEQA (and the State
24 Legislature) explains that avoidance is the preferred method of mitigation. (Pub. Resources Code, §
25 21084.3(b)(1).)

26 23. In 2014, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 52 ["AB 52"] to,

27 inter alia, provide for CEQA review and Tribe consultation specific to archaeological, historical,

28 4 See e.g. Pub. Resources Code, § 5021.1(q).

1 cultural, and sacred sites which are not located within the current boundaries of California Native

2 American reservations, and are therefore not covered by the protectionist policies of tribal

3 governments. In its passage of AB 52, the Legislature recognized that "California Native

4 Americans have used, and continue to use, natural settings in the conduct of religious observances,
5 ceremonies, and cultural practices and beliefs, and these resources reflect the tribes' continuing
6 cultural ties to the land and their traditional heritages." See 2014 Cal. Stats., ch. 532, § 1(a)(4) (AB

7 52).

8 24. AB 52 recognizes that California Native American tribes "may have expertise with

9 regard to their own tribal history and practices" relevant to a tribal cultural resource and
10 "specifically requires that tribal knowledge about the land and tribal cultural resources at
11 issue should be included in environmental assessments for projects that may have a
12 significant impact on those resources." Id. at § 1(b)(4)

13 25. AB 52 confirms the Legislature's (and CEQA's) preference for historical and
14 archacological resource preservation in place (avoidance) and objective of enabling California
15 Native American tribes to manage and act as caretakers of tribal cultural resources. Id. at § 1(b)(3)

16 and (b)(8).

17 26. To these ends, Public Resources Code § 21080.3.1(b) provides that prior to the
18 release of a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration or EIR for a project, the lead
19 agency shall begin consultation with a California Native American tribe if the tribe requested to the
20 lead agency, in writing, to be informed by the lead agency through formal notification of proposed

21 projects in a geographic area that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with the tribe; and (2) the
22 tribe responds in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the formal notification, and requests the
23 consultation. Within 14 days of determining that an application for a project is complete, the lead
24 agency shall provide formal notification to the California Native American tribes that have

25 requested notice notifying it that it has 30 days to request consultation.

1 C. Inland Partners Purchases the Proposed Project Site on December 12, 2018 and

2 Conducts a Phase I Study of Cultural Resources at the Site.

3 27. Inland Partners purchased the Proposed Project site on December 12, 2018 from

4 SFU Investments Limited Partnership ["SFU"].

5 28. At some time thereafter, Petitioners are informed and believe that Inland Partners

6 submitted a "pre-application review" to the City in connection with its proposed subdivision.

29. Thereafter, Inland Partners retained archeologist, Brian F. Smith & Associates
8 ["Smith"], who then proceeded to conduct a Phase 1 Cultural Resources Assessment for the

9 Proposed Project.

10 30. On April 24, 2019, Smith released its Phase Cultural Resources Assessment

11 ["Phase 1 Study"]. The Phase I study documented nine archaeological sites within the Proposed
12 Project site, including sites CA-RIV-333, -631, -632 -633, -12916, -12917, -12918, -12919 and
13 12920.

14 31. The Study explained that RIV-631 was "CEQA-significant"' under Public
15 Resources Code § 15064.5(a) since the "resource embodies, the distinctive characteristics of a type,
16 period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of important creative individual
17| or possesses high artistic values." This site was earmarked as a ceremonial and prehistoric
18 habitation site and the Study recommended "avoidance and perseveration in perpetuity". The
19 Study also made the same recommendations for RIV-12916 after it was described as a habitation
20 site with the presence of cupules. The Study explained that subsurface testing to evaluate site

21 significance for RIV-631 and RIV-12916 was not recommended but, in self-serving fashion, went
22 onto explain that subsurface testing on the outer boundaries was needed in order to determine site

23 limits for future planning.

24 32. The Phase 1 Study noted that RIV-632 and -633 (both recorded as historical

25 resources in 1973) were inspected for surface artifacts and features and documented the collection
26 of multiple artifacts along with bedrock milling features.5 The Study concluded that RIV-632 and -

27 5 The presence of bedrock milling features is indicative of pre-contact subsistence activities on both the individual and
28 group levels, providing an anchor point for anthropological investigations into subsistence, social, and technological activities performed at or near a given site.

633 likely functioned as a single prehistoric site.

2 33. The Study found that RIV-12917 was a habitation/resource processing site which

3 included bedrock milling features and a surface scatter of 130 artifacts. RIV-12918, -12918,
12919 and -12920 were identified as limited processing sites that included bedrock milling

features.

6 34. Regardless of the presence of a ceremonial and habitation site on the property, the
7 acknowledged presence of tribal artifacts and tribal activities at each of the interconnected
archaeological sites, and the Proposed Project site's adjacent location to the widely known and
important Ringing Rock village complex, Inland Partners' archaeologist recommended Phase II
10 subsurface testing at almost all of the archaeological test sites in furtherance of Inland Partner's

11 Project, which is unnecessary to understand the importance of the site and would preclude

12 avoidance - the preferred method of mitigation under CEQA.

13 35. According to the California Native American Heritage Commission, the purpose of

14 a phase II study is "to determine whether a cultural resource is "important" (significant)" according

15 to the criteria outlined Section 15064.5 of the California Environmental Quality Act regulations

16 (Title 14 CCR 15064.5).

17 36. Section 15064.5 defines a historical resource protected by CEQA to include: a
18 resource included in a local register of historical resources, as defined in section 5020.1(k) of the

19 Public Resources Code or identified as significant in an historical resource survey meeting the
20 requirements section 5024.1(g) of the Public Resources Code, shall be presumed to be historically

21 or culturally significant. Public agencies must treat any such resource as significant unless the
22 preponderance of evidence demonstrates that it is not historically or culturally significant; [and] (3)

23 Any object, building, structure, site, area, place, record, or manuscript which a lead agency

24 determines to be historically significant or significant in the architectural, engineering, scientific,
25 economic, agricultural, educational, social, political, military, or cultural annals of California may
26 be considered to be an historical resource, provided the lead agency's determination is supported by
27 substantial evidence in light of the whole record. Generally, a resource shall be considered by the

28 lead agency to be "historically significant" if the resource meets the criteria for listing on the
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

1 California Register of Historical Resources (Pub. Resources Code, § 5024.1; § Cal. Code Regs., tit.

2 14, § 4852) including the following: (A) Is associated with events that have made a significant
3 contribution to the broad patterns of California's history and cultural heritage; (B) Is associated

4 with the lives of persons important in our past; (C) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a
5 type, period, region, or method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative
6 individual, or possesses high artistic values; or (D) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield,
7 information important in prehistory or history. (4) The fact that a resource is not listed in, or
8 determined to be eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources, not included

9 in a local register of historical resources (pursuant to section 5020.1(k) of the Public Resources
10 Code), or identified in an historical resources survey (meeting the criteria in section 5024.1(g) of
11 the Public Resources Code) does not preclude a lead agency from determining that the resource
12 may be an historical resource as defined in Public Resources Code sections 5020.1(j) or 5024.1.

13 37. Section 15064.5 further provides (b) A project with an effect that may cause a
14 substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is a project a that may have
15 a significant effect on the environment, and (1) Substantial adverse change in the significance of an
16 historical resource means physical demolition, destruction, relocation, or alteration of the
17 resource or its immediate surroundings such that the significance of an historical resource would
18 be materially impaired, and (2) The significance of an historical resource is materially impaired
19 when a project: (A) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical
20 characteristics of an historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its

21 inclusion in, or eligibility for, inclusion in the California Register of Historical Resources; or (B)

22 Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical characteristics that account for

23 its inclusion in a local register of historical resources pursuant to section 5020.1(k) of the Public

24 Resources Code or its identification in an historical resources survey meeting the requirements of
25 section 5024.1(g) of the Public Resources Code, unless the public agency reviewing the effects of
26 the project establishes by a preponderance of evidence that the resource is not historically or

27 culturally significant; or (C) Demolishes or materially alters in an adverse manner those physical
28 characteristics of a historical resource that convey its historical significance and that justify its

DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

eligibility for inclusion in the California Register of Historical Resources as determined by a lead

2 agency for purposes of CEQA

3 38. Conducting unnecessary Phase II subsurface testing on the property would
materially alter in an adverse manner those physical characteristics of the extant historical

5 resources that convey the resources' historical significance, and would diminish the resources on

6 the property.

7 39. While the City had not issued an AB 52 Notice to the Tribes, the City provided

8 Pechanga with a copy of the Phase I Study I and on June 18, 2019, Pechanga commented on the
9 Study explaining that all identified sites (CA-RIV-333, -631, -632, -633, -12916, -12917, -12918, -

10 12919 and -12920) within the Proposed Project area comprise a CEQA significant cultural resource

11 that is a cultural ceremonial complex that lies within an ancestral village. Pechanga rightly
12 explained that while the Project was in a "Pre-Application Review", avoidance was the preferred
13 method of preservation for archaeological and tribal cultural resources under CEQA. "Testing at
14 this stage may impact resources that could be preserved in whole through project alternatives

15 and/or redesign. Moving ahead prematurely with the proposed Phase II testing plan…could destroy
16 tribal cultural resources, the opposite of what CEQA requires us to consider in the first instance
17 preservation."

18 40. In adopting AB 52, the State legislature provided "[i]n recognition of California
19 Native Amcrican tribal sovereignty and the unique relationship of California local governments
20 and public agencies with California Native American tribal governments, and respecting the

21 interests and roles of project proponents, it is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to

22 accomplish all of the following: (1) Recognize that California Native American prehistoric,

23 historic, archaeological, cultural, and sacred places are essential elements in tribal cultural
24| traditions, heritages, and identities. (2) Establish a new category of resources in the California
25| Environmental Quality Act called "tribal cultural resources" that considers the tribal cultural values
26 in addition to the scientific and archaeological values when determining impacts and mitigation.

27 (3) Establish examples of mitigation measures for tribal cultural resources that uphold the existing
28 mitigation preference for historical and archaeological resources of preservation in place, if
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

feasible. (4) Recognize that California Native American tribes may have expertise with regard to

2 their tribal history and practices, which concern the tribal cultural resources with which they are

3 traditionally and culturally affiliated. Because the California Environmental Quality Act calls for a

4 sufficient degree of analysis, tribal knowledge about the land and tribal cultural resources at issue
should be included in environmental assessments for projects that may have a significant impact on

6 those resources. (5) In recognition of their governmental status, establish meaningful consultation
process between California Native American tribal governments and lead agencies, respecting the

8 interests and roles of all California Native American tribes and project proponents, and the level of
required confidentiality concerning tribal cultural resources, at the earliest possible point in the
10 California Environmental Quality Act environmental review process, so that tribal cultural

11 resources can be identified, and culturally appropriate mitigation and mitigation monitoring
12 programs can be considered by the decision-making body of the lead agency. (6) Recognize the

13 unique history of California Native American tribes and uphold existing rights of all California

14 Native American tribes to participate in, and contribute their knowledge to, the environmental

15 review process pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing

16 with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code). (7) Ensure that local and tribal governments,

17 public agencies, and project proponents have information available, early in the California
18 Environmental Quality Act environmental review process, for purposes of identifying and

19 addressing potential adverse impacts to tribal cultural resources and to reduce the potential for

20 delay and conflicts in the environmental review process. (8) Enable California Native American

21 tribes to manage and accept conveyances of, and act as caretakers of, tribal cultural resources.

22 (9) Establish that a substantial adverse change to a tribal cultural resource has a significant effect a

23 on the environment.

24 41. On March 24, 2020, the City sent formal notice to Pechanga and Soboba notifying

25 each Tribe of Inland Partners' Proposed Project and providing Pechanga and Soboba 30 days to
26 request a consultation pursuant to AB 52.

27 42. On March 25, 2020, Pechanga responded to the City's AB 52 Notice exercising its

28 right to consult with the City and explaining, once again, that the Proposed Project area was part of
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

1 a culturally sensitive area affiliated with Pechanga and that the Proposed Project is entirely within a

2 larger known Traditional Cultural Property. On March 30, 2020, Soboba responded to the City's

3 AB 52 Notice exercising its right to consult with the City and providing contact information for a
4 consultation meeting. Upon Pechanga's and Soboba's acceptance of consultation pursuant to AB

5 52, consultation is to be followed through the CEQA environmental process and considered

6 concluded when either of the following occurs: (1) The parties agree to measures to mitigate or
7 avoid a significant effect, if a significant effect exists, on a tribal cultural resource. (2) A party,

8 acting in good faith and after reasonable effort, concludes that mutual agreement cannot be reached
9 (Pub. Res. Code 21080.3.2(b)).

10 43. Following its Phase 1 Study, Smith recommended an Archeological Test Plan

11 ['ATP"] for Phase II subsurface testing or boundary delineations at each of the archeological sites,
12 despite the fact that the Phase 1 Study determined that there was a ceremonial site on property that
13 was "CEQA significant" and that preservation/avoidance was preferred at least at sites RIV-631
14 and -12916, and ignoring that all previous studies and communications from Pechanga and Soboba
15 that all of the sites are inter-connected and part of a Tribal Cultural Property and significant Tribal
16 Cultural Resources which should be avoided under CEQA, clearly indicating that a Phase II Study

17 is unnecessary and would impact the resources.

18 44. Upon information and belief, Smith's recommendations were premised solely on the
19 needs of its client, Inland Partners, without regard to the protection of the cultural and historic
20 resources or the interests of Pechanga and Soboba in their own tribal cultural resources.

21 45. Smith and Inland Partners sought approval from the City as lead agency to conduct
22 the Phase II Study, purportedly to inform the City in its role as lead agency under CEQA as to

23 a whether the proposed project was located on a property with historical resource, was part of a

24 Tribal Cultural Property or was part of significant Tribal Cultural, facts which were already in the

25 possession of City.

26 46. Regardless of what Inland Partners' archaeologist recommended, the City, as the

27 lead agency, had a duty to determine whether the cultural resources at the Project site were
28 "significant" within the meaning of CEQA before it approved a Phase II testing plan which entails
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

1 a high likelihood of alteration, demolition, destruction and the relocation of the resources on site.

2 47. Following the release of the proposed Phase II Testing Plan, the Tribes objected to

3 the City approving and allowing Inland Partners' destructive testing of the site as unnecessarily and
inappropriately impacting and diminishing the extant resources on the site.

5 D. Inland Partners Acknowledged the Presence of the Significant Tribal Cultural

6 Resources when it Sued SFU Contending that SFU Failed to Disclose the Fact that the

7 Property contained TCRs, which if Inland Partners Had Known Existed on Site, It

8 Would Never Have Purchased the Property.

48. Notably, following the release of Inland Partners' Proposed Phase II Testing Plan
10 and during the term of the comments exchanged concerning the ATP, on September 30, 2020,

11 Inland Partners sued SFU, the seller of the property, for inter alia, intentional misrepresentation,
12 failure to disclose and negligent misrepresentation. In its Complaint, Inland Partners explains that
13| its "Phase I Study concluded that there has been formal record of Native American artifacts of
14| cultural and historical significance on the Property since 1973." (See Inland Partners v. SFU

15 Compl. p. 11 1 61 (Emph. Added).) The Complaint went onto explain that "cultural resources"
16 identified as RIV-631, RIVF-632 and RIV-633 are located on the Property…Notably, pictographs,
17 or rock art, were found on the property..." (Id at p. 13 1 69 (Emph. Added).) "RIV-340 ..right
18 across the street from the Property…is part of the Ringing Rock village complex, a widely a
19 known cultural resource in the area." (Id. p. 13 1 71 (Emph. Added).)

20 49. In its Complaint, Inland Partners explains that it would never have purchased the
21 property if it had known of the significant cultural resources on the property and as a consequence,

22 purported to justify its failure to make payments due and owing to SFU on this basis.

23 50. In its lawsuit, Inland Partners attested that the project site was of "cultural and
24 historical significance" while at the same time and before the City, it continued to advocate an ATP

25 for destructive testing that would never be permitted of (and would be unnecessary for) significant
26 TCRs and a TCP under CEQA. In other words, Inland Partners said one thing when it needed to
27 justify its failure to make payments on the loan secured by the Property and said another thing to
28 the City in its attempt to develop the property. Notably, Inland Partners did not disclose its lawsuit

1 allegations to the Pechanga and/or Soboba tribes.

2 E. Days After Inland Partners Filed Its Misrepresentation Lawsuit on the Grounds that

3 the Project Site Contains Significant Cultural Resources, the City Approves Phase II

4 Subsurface Testing at the Site.

5 51. On October 8. 2020, the City mostly rubber-stamped Inland Partners' Phase II plan,
6 ignoring the extensive comments by the Tribes in violation of CEQA and AB 52 consultation
7 requirements. Pechanga and Soboba had both explained that the site is ceremonial and all artifacts

8 and sites on the property interconnected as overwhelmingly evidenced by the extensive cultural

9 resource finds at each of the test sites, the property's adjacent proximity to the Ringing Rock
10 village, the recorded sites (RIV-631,- 632 and -633) as historical resources on file with CHRIS, the
11 Christiansen/Webb study, the Walker Ranch Study and the 1988 excavations. Indeed previous
12 evaluations included the recordation of midden deposits extending as far as 34 inches in depth,
13 with collected items such as effigies, clay pipes, pendants, quartz crystals all in the vicinity of
14 ceremonial pictographs, cupules and Ringing Rock, all of which the Pechanga and Soboba
15 contended were "sites, features, places, cultural landscapes, sacred places, and objects with cultural
16 value to their tribes. All of the foregoing collectively and overwhelmingly showed that the
17 Proposed Project site is significant within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 5024.1(c) and
18 that no adverse impacts from a Phase II Study was necessary to make such a determination.

19 52. In what can only be described as a wholesale rejection of the Tribes' input
20 concerning their own tribal cultural resources in violation of CEQA and the avoidance of the

21 evidence before it, the City approved Inland Partners' Phase II Testing Plan on the specious basis
22 that subsurface (and destructive) testing was required to determine the "significance" of the
23 cultural resources. Upon information and belief, in so doing, the City sought to improve its own
24 standing and/or bent to the will of Inland Partners and its objectives to move full steam ahead with

25 the commercial development of the property despite its high cultural and religious significance to

26 the Pechanga and Soboba.

27 53. The approval was also made despite Inland Partners' own averments in the Inland
28 Partners v. SFU Complaint which represented that the Project Site was replete with "significant"
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

1 cultural resources.

2 54. Days following the City's approval, Inland Partners' filed a declaration in the Inland
3 Partners v. SFU in support of a temporary restraining order, in which Michael Hale, an
4| archaeologist with Dudek explained the significance of the archaeological test sites at the Project

5 Site, which included rock art, cupules and milling elements. Mr. Hale also noted that the site sits

6 adjacent to Ringing Rock village complex considered sacred to local Native Americans. Notably,
7 Mr. Hale - not Smith (Inland Partners' archaeologist for purposes of the entitlement process) - filed

8 a declaration in support of the Inland Partners v. SFU litigation.

9 55. Regardless of its inconsistent positions in the Inland Partners v. SFU litigation and
10 its entitlement review with the City, the obvious significance of the TCR and the inconsistencies

11 between the Phase 1 Study (calling for preservation and avoidance of Sites RIV-631 and -12916),
12| Phase II testing on all of the sites began on November 9, 2020. Thereafter, Pechanga requested an
13 appeal of the City's Phase II determination which was summarily denied by the City on November
14 23, 2020. During the Phase II testing, Pechanga and Soboba commented heavily, explaining that
15 the City continued to refuse to evaluate impacts to the environment occasioned by the Phase II
16 Testing after overwhelming evidence that the Site was a TCP within a TCR and as a consequence,
17| should be avoided entirely. Pechanga explained that it never agreed to boundary assessment shovel

18 test pits on sites RIV-12916, -12917, -631 and -12918 and that all sites within the project boundary
19 are interconnected. Pechanga also explained that the City had not clarified how the shovel test pits
20 would be carried out, nor did it address the required evaluation and recordation of surface items. As

21 a consequence Pechanga demanded cessation of Phase II Testing on November 23, 2020. Soboba

22 requested that all activity associated with the Phase II Test Plan for the project be suspended, and
23| communicated this request to the City during each consultation meeting and in numerous writings,
24 including on November 23 and 25, 2020. Ultimately the City agreed that Inland Partners could

25 proceed with its Phase II Testing.

26 56. The City's rubber-stamping of the Phase II ATP in avoidance of tribal input and the
27| evidence along with allowing unnecessary and destructive Phase II Testing to proceed at the site
28 necessitated the filing of this Petition.
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

57. Prior to approving the Phase II Study, the City has not required Inland Partners to

2 submit a land use or project application to the City, has not conducted a CEQA initial study or any
3 environmental review, nor has it even attempted any public or environmental review prior to
4 authorizing and directing the impacts created by the unnecessary Phase II Study.

5 58. Given that the City authorized and directed Inland Properties to conduct an
unnecessary Phase II Study that has and will continue to diminish and materially alter the Tribal
Cultural Resources onsite, the City and Inland Partners have conducted a Project on site that is

8 impacting significant historical resource without the benefit of environmental review under

CEQA.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violation of CEQA)

12 59. The Tribes incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in each
13 paragraph above and below as though the same were set forth in full herein.

14 60. The City is charged with the authority to regulate and administer land use activities
15 within its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state,
16 federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and the California Planning and
17| zoning law.

18 61. In connection with the Proposed Project, the City approved a Phase II testing plan
19 which entails a high likelihood of demolition and destruction, and the relocation of TCRs on the
20 Proposed Project site despite the overwhelming evidence that shows that the TCRs are

21 "significant" within the meaning of CEQA and should be avoided.

22 62. The City also approved the Phase II testing plan in derogation of AB 52 and its good

23 faith consultation requirements with the Pechanga and Soboba and in derogation of the City's
24 statutory obligations to consider tribal input concerning the significance of the TCRs.

25 63. As alleged herein, the Phase II testing program will result in a substantial adverse

26 change in the significance of the known TCRs and the TCP which are encompassed by the Project

27 site given that Phase II will invariably result in the relocation, alteration, demolition and

28 destruction of the TCRs.
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
DOCS 123462-000002/4310689.1 CASE NO.

64. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by,
2| inter alia, adopting and allowing to be carried out a Phase II testing plan which will cause a
3 substantial adverse change to the significance of the TCRs located on the Proposed Project site.
4 Accordingly, the City's determination must be set aside.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Declaratory Relief)

7 65. The Tribes incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in each
g paragraph above and below as though the same were set forth in full herein.

66. An actual and substantial controversy has arisen between the Tribes and Defendants
10 with respect to the validity of the actions taken by Defendants and the imminent destruction of
I1 historic cultural resources.

12 67. The Tribes desire a judicial determination with respect to the legal force and effect
13 of the actions taken by the City as well as a declaration that the Project site contains significant
14 cultural resources which must be preserved in place. Such declaration is necessary at this time so

15 that the Tribes and Defendants can ascertain the legal force and effect of the actions taken by the
16 City as well as the significance of the historic resources located on the Project site. Declaratory
17 relief is appropriate because it will obviate the need for future legal action between the parties
18 regarding the same subject matter.
19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 WHEREFORE. Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:

21 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate its

22 determination and approval of the Phase II Archaeological Site Assessment;

23 2. An injunction prohibiting Respondent and Defendants from engaging in any

24 destructive site work, including without limitation, activities associated with the

25 Phase II Archaeological Site Assessment;

26 3. A judicial declaration that significant TCRs are present on the property within the

27 meaning of CEQA;

28 4. For costs of suit incurred herein;
17

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue

To it Whom it May Concern:

This firm represents the interests of the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians ("Pechanga") in connection with its concerns over the Menifee Gateway Project (the "Proposed Project"). Please accept this correspondence that Pechanga intends to file suit against the City of Menifee (the "City") for its approval of the Archaeological Phase ll Test Plan for the Menifee Gateway Project (the "Phase II Test Plan") and its failure to proceed in the manner required by law under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA").
Pechanga's action will allege that the City's approval of the Phase II Test Plan violates CEQA. The Petition will also seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. This letter is intended to provide formal notice of the same pursuant to Graham v.
DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or to both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A ollections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking A the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case
is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 1 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on ail parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case
is complex. CASE TYPES AND EXAMPLES
