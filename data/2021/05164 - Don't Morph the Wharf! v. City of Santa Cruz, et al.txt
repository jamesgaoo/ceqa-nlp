Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:
Introduction
2

3 1. Don't Morph the Wharf! brings this mandamus action in the public

4 interest to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a citizen-

5 enforced statute. The association challenges approval of the Santa Cruz Wharf Master
6 Plan and projects encompassed in the Plan that would significantly alter the wharf and

8 its recognized historic character in the guise of progress.

23 Feasible mitigations and viable alternatives can accomplish the city's

25 historic features and uses that support marine and avian resources and are beloved by

26 Santa Cruz residents and visitors. Particularly important are feasible mitigation
27

28 measures called for by the federal Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 Historic Properties and including elimination of the proposed Western Walkway,

2 elimination of the proposed Landmark Building, and reduction in the height of other

3 proposed new wharf buildings.
4

5 The city has failed to acknowledge the significance of the Plan's aesthetic,

6 historic, and recreational impacts. The preservation and restoration of the wharf do not

7 mandate destruction of resources of great public benefit. CEQA disallows such short-

8 sighted actions by elected officials when, as here, significant impacts can be avoided by
9

10 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.

11 This Court's peremptory writ is sought to enforce CEQA. The city must set aside

12 its certification of the environmental impact report (EIR) and approvals of the wharf

13 Master Plan, revise the EIR, and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives. It may then
1.4

15 approve a revised project based on findings supported by substantial evidence.

16 Jurisdiction

17 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

18 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and the Santa Cruz Wharf are
19

20 located in the City and County of Santa Cruz.

21 Parties

22 3. Petitioner Don't Morph the Wharf! is an unincorporated association
23

24 formed in the public interest to protect the wharf by ensuring the application of local

25 and state environmental laws. Its members enjoy and appreciate the historic wharf and

26 seek to enforce CEQA to protect its environmental qualities. The association brings this

27 petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and too numerous to be named and
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 brought before this Court as petitioners. The association objected to the city's approval

2 of the Wharf Master Plan and exhausted administrative remedies.

3 4. Respondents City of Santa Cruz and its City Council (collectively, the city)
4

5 is the governmental body that approved the Plan and projects and certified the subject

6 Plan EIR. It is the lead agency responsible for CEQA compliance..

7 5. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

8

q General Allegations

10
6. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that
11

12 will be lodged with this court as part of the record of proceedings

13

14 Environmental Setting

15 7. The Santa Cruz Wharf was designed by noted engineer Henry John

16 Brunnier and built in 1914 in the Santa Cruz Harbor at the southern end of Pacific

17

18 Avenue at Beach Street. It is the last remaining of six piers built on the city shoreline.

19 It extends a half mile into Monterey Bay. The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Main

20 Beach lie to the east. Cowell Beach and the Dream Inn lie west.

21 8. The wharf is located in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary,

22 established in 1992, which extends from Cambria on the south to Marin County on the
23

24 north and covers more than 5,000 square miles of ocean. The Sanctuary is administered

25 by the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Sanctuary
26 promotes resource protection, research, education, and public use. It is one of the most

27 diverse marine ecosystems in the world, including the nation's largest kelp forest and
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 one of North America's most extensive underwater canyons.

2 9. The wooden wharf is supported by over 4000 Douglas fir piles. It is the
longest timber pile-supported pier structure on the Pacific Coast and is one of the
4

5 longest in the world. Called a wharf because of its early function in off-loading cargo,

6 it is a pier structure that extends into deep water and can facilitate the mooring of

7 larger vessels than those accommodated by a more typical wharf parallel to the shore.

8 10. From its initial role as a cargo handling and shipping pier, the Wharf has
9

10 adapted to commercial fishing and public recreation. About 2.5 million annual visitors

11 flock to enjoy ocean air and views from a point half a mile into the National Monterey

12 Bay Marine Sanctuary. Wharf fishing, the popular sea lion viewing portals, long-time

13 local restaurants, and kayak and small fishing boat rentals are main attractions.
14

15 Project Description

16
11. The Wharf Master Plan proposes guidelines, as recommended by the
17

18 Beach South of Laurel Area Plan (B/SOLAP) and the Santa Cruz Local Coastal Plan

19 (LCP) under the Coastal Act. While California Coastal Commission staff suggested that

20 the Plan be submitted to the Commission for approval as a Public Works Plan, that was
21 not a prerequisite for the Plan's effective approval.
22

23 12. The Plan proposes rehabilitation of existing infrastructure where needed;

24 an addition of 2.5 acres of open public space; two new handicapped-accessible boat

25 landings; pavement, drainage and waste management infrastructure; greatly-expanded

26 commercial infill; three new buildings (one of which, the Landmark building, will
27

28 result in loss of the sea lion viewing portals or require their relocation to an unspecified

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 site) almost 50% taller than existing two-story buildings and almost 200% taller than

2 existing one-story buildings; a below-deck western walkway on the weather side

3 outside the current pilings; a below-deck viewing platform to the south; a 26-30
4

5 foot-wide new Promenade on the eastern side; relocation of the current entrance from

6 land to 500 feet down the length of the wharf with a new, prominent welcome sign
above; and staffed kiosks replaced by multiple scattered pay stations.

q Administrative Process and Approval

10 13. The City Council authorized CEQA review for the proposed Plan in
11

12 October 2014. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the Plan based on

13 Mitigated Negative Declaration in 2016, but the City Council instead deferred

14 consideration of approval pending an EIR process.

15 14. The city published a Draft EIR in March 2020 and received public
16

17 comments until May 2020 from public agencies, organizations (including Don't Morph

18 the Wharf!), and individuals. The Final EIR with responses to comments was published

19 in September 2020.

20 15. The city's Parks and Recreation Commission, Historic Preservation
21

22 Commission, and Planning Commission considered the Plan and EIR in September

23 and October 2020 and made recommendations to the City Council. The Council

24 considered the Final EIR and project approvals at a public hearing on November 24,

25 2020. In response to concerns expressed by Don't Morph the Wharf! and others

26 regarding the ill-conceived Landmark Building, Mayor Cummings and
27

28 Councilmembers Beiers and Brown supported a substitute approval motion to delete

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 the sections of the Plan authorizing construction of the Landmark Building and also

2 reduced overall heights of other proposed buildings. After the substitute motion failed,

3 Councilmembers Beiers and Brown voted against the final Plan approvals. It was
4

5 approved on a split Council vote.

6 16. The city filed a Notice of Determination in Santa Cruz County on

7 November 30, 2020, and in the California State Clearinghouse on December 3, 2020.

8 17. Don't Morph the Wharf!! has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
9

10 ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate,

11 severe, and irreparable harm to Santa Cruz residents and the city's environment via

12 implementation of the Wharf Master Plan without compliance with law. The city has

13 the capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.
14

15 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
16
18.
17 Don't Morph the Wharf! incorporates all paragraphs as if fully set forth.

18 19. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process

19 before taking actions that may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The

20 point of the process is to inform the public and to provide necessary information to
21

22 allow elected officials and decisionmakers to comply with CEQA's substantive

23 mandate: to adopt feasible project mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a

24 project's significant environmental impacts.

25 20. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by
26

27 law in approving the Wharf Master Plan and related projects with significant

28 environmental impacts, inter alia, and as documented by the to-be-lodged record of

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

:

1. proceedings and including comments by Don't Morph the Wharfl: certification of an

2 inadequate EIR; application of improper standards of review in conducting EIR

3 analysis; insufficient analysis and unsupported conclusions as to significant project
4
impacts; inadequate EIR analysis of mitigations and alternatives as a matter of law to

6 adequately provide information to the decisionmakers and the public; improper
deferral of mitigation; and inadequate EIR analysis of inconsistencies with city and

8 state plans and policies including inconsistencies with the Coastal Act.
9
21.
10 The Final EIR failed to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR,

11 including comments and recommendations by the city's appointed commissions.

12 22. The city failed to adopt findings supported by substantial evidence and

13 made findings contrary to facts and analysis in the record, including but not limited to
14

15 findings as to the significance of project environmental impacts and the feasibility of

16 mitigation measures and project alternatives to the Plan and related projects.

17 23. While the EIR acknowledges "the importance of the a Wharf as a visual and

18 historic landmark," it failed to identify, study, or adopt identified project mitigation

19 measures and alternatives that could reduce or avoid various identified environmental
20

21 impacts, including but not limited to mitigations set forth in the city's plans, policies,

22 and guidelines and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic

23 Properties to substantially reduce significant impacts.

24 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays:
25
1.
26 That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ a ordering the city

27 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the Wharf Master Plan

28 and wharf projects, requiring that before further consideration of aapproval the city

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 revise and recirculate the EIR, identify and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives,

2 and make all findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;

2. That the Court enjoin the city and its employees and agents from all

5 physical actions furthering the Plan and related projects while the petition is pending

6 and after judgment pending compliance with the writ;

7 3. For petitioner's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to

8 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
9
4. For other and further relief as the Court finds
10 proper.
