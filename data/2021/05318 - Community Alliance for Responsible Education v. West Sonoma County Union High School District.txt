Respondents. CASE DESIGNATION: CEQA

I. INTRODUCTION 19

20 1. Petitioner COMMUNITY ALLIANCE FOR RESPONSIBLE EDUCATION

21 ("CARE"), on behalf of its members and the general public, respectfully requests issuance of a

22 peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the decisions of Respondent, WEST SONOMA

23 COUNTY UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT ("Respondent" or "District"): (1) approving the

24 closure of EL MOLINO HIGH SCHOOL, Forestville, CA ("El Molino"), the subsequent

25 transfer of EL MOLINO's students, faculty, and staff to ANALY HIGH SCHOOL, Sebastopol,

26 CA (*Analy") and LAGUNA HIGH SCHOOL, Sebastopol, CA ("Laguna"), and the relocation

27 of District Offices and LAGUNA to the EL MOLINO campus ("Consolidation"); (2) finding

28 the Consolidation exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)'; (3) approving the filing and recordation of a Notice of

2 Exemption ("NOE") (Resolution #10 NOV.2020-2021), which purported to finally approve the
co † Consolidation, but which was actually an interim approval; (4) all associated determinations
made on or about November 30, 2020; and (5) the final determination made on March 10, 2021
to approve the Consolidation and associated timeline for completion (the "Project").

2. The District's exemption determination was improper. The District violated the
provisions of CEQA by (a) filing it months before it issued final approval for the Project and

8 without providing adequate notice and opportunity to object; and (b) failing to support its

9 exemptions with substantial evidence; indeed, fabricating and inflating original capacity

10 numbers in order to fit the Project into the exemption.

11 3. The Project is not exempt from CEQA, and therefore the District abused its

12 discretion, because the Project is subject to two exceptions to the claimed categorical exemption:
13 14 mnamotty 2u 'NOSHEONY 'NOSNHOr 'AHY3d (1) the "cumulative impact" exception (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b)); and (2) the "significant
effect" exception (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2 (c)).

4. The segmented Project consists of the closure of El Molino, the transfer of 553
16 students to Analy and Laguna, and then the transfer of Laguna's students (currently 88), faculty,

17 and staff to the former El Molino campus. Though not mentioned in the NOE, nor considered

18 by the Board in connection therewith, the District intends to also close its administrative offices

campus. 19 and move them to the former El Molino

20 5. The District found the Project exempt pursuant to Class 14 Categorical Exemptions,

21 14 California Code of Regulations ("CEQA Guidelines") con 15314 ("Minor Additions to
School"), finding that "the Project's minor additions to the three existing schools will not
increase these schools' student capacities, and no new classrooms or support facilities are 22

23

24 needed" and concluding, without any analysis or evidentiary basis and in the face of

25 contradictory evidence, that "there is no indication of unusual circumstances that would except

26 the Class 14 Categorical Exemption." (District Resolution No. 10, dated Nov. 30, 2020.) The

27

28 References to CEQA include the regulations implementing it, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq. ("CEQA
Guidelines"),
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- District's determination and attendant filing of the NOE on December 3, 2020 violated the

2 provisions of CEQA and constituted an abuse of discretion, because:

3 (a) The District failed to follow CEQA: (i) The District improperly made an exemption

4 determination and filed an NOE prior to final approval of the Project in March 2021,
5 rendering the NOE null and void. The Board's purported "final approval" issued with the

6 exemption determination on November 30, 2020 was really a mere "placeholder" used to

7 expedite and circumvent the CEQA process in the event that parcel and transient

8 occupancy tax measures put before the voters in March of 2021 did not succeed. (District
D Resolution No. 11.NOV.2020-2021, dated Nov. 30, 2020.) (ii) The District failed to
10 provide proper notice of a hearing by which members of the public could raise objections
11 to the CEQA violations, instead approving the CEQA exemption during the same meeting
12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, and moments before the alleged "final approval," after having promised Petitioner a full
d11 ZLIMONSON 9 83T111 m2 CEQA review to resolve issues of traffic congestion, safety, and potential blight to local
14 communities. See Save Our Sch. v. Barstow Unified Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. (2015) 240
29 Cal.App.4th 128, 139.
(b) The District's exemption determination is not supported by substantial evidence, but is
17 contrary to the evidence before it at the time it made that determination. (i) The District
18 manipulated and falsely inflated student capacity in order to qualify for the exemption,

19 which requires no greater than a 25% increase in student capacity or ten classrooms,

20 whichever is less. (ii) The District ignored evidence contradicting its finding that the
21 Project is not "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds."
22 Instead, evidence indicates that the District improperly segmented the Project-currently
23 limiting its a definition of the Project to a mere transfer of students and faculty, with plans
24 to enlarge and improve the Analy campus later-with the intent of avoiding a complete
25 CEQA review by filing incremental exemptions.

26 (c) The District failed to undertake CEQA compliant analysis or put forth evidence upon

27 which to conclude that the Alleged Project would not have any cumulative and/or

28 significant environmental affects, as it was required to do (CEQA Guidelines con

Unified Sch. Dist. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 155, 164-174) ("East Peninsula")); and,
instead, ignored substantial evidence to the contrary, specifically: (i) its own plans
presented to the public in two Town Hall meetings held on October 7 and October 21, 2020
(one month before the exemption vote) of a massive $195 million expansion of the Analy
A campus that includes new classrooms and workforce housing; and (ii) information received
at these same Town Hall meetings in October of 2020, that the Analy Campus could not

8 maintain the school capacity the District assigned to it and still comply with California

9 Department of Education guidelines.

10 6. Members of CARE exhausted their administrative remedies by speaking in a

11 purposefully limited public forum at the Special Meeting on November 30 and raised CEQA

12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, objections as to the likelihood that the Project would have a significant environmental impact
ILLER & MOSKOWITZ LLF 13 and the need for a full CEQA review process.

14 7. The Project approval, if permitted to stand, will significantly affect the environment,

15 will allow the District to violate CEQA by segmenting true scope of the Project and will enable

16 the District to avoid the proper CEQA process by filing an NOE and claiming that the project

17 had "final approval" when, in fact, final approval was months away.

18 8. By this verified Petition, CARE alleges the following:

12 I. STATEMENT OF FACTS
"NOSH3ONY 'NOSNHOr'ABU3d MILLER & MOSKOWITZ LLP 13 13. El Molino High School is located at 7050 Covey Road in Forestville, California. The

14 high school consists of 52 classrooms which includes portable classrooms and auxiliary

15 buildings. The campus encompasses approximately 39.17 acres. 553 students currently attend

16 El Molino.

17 14. Analy High School is located at 6950 Analy Avenue, Sebastopol, California. The

18 high school consists of 58 classrooms including portables and encompasses approximately 27.18

19 acres. 1,154 students currently attend Analy.

20 15. Laguna High School is located at 445 Taft Street, Sebastopol, California. It consists

21 of approximately 2.96 acres in combination with the adjacent District Offices located at 462

22 Johnson Street, Sebastopol, California. 88 students currently attend Laguna High School.

23 16. The Superintendent of Schools is Toni Beal. Superintendent Beal manipulated school

24 capacity for purposes of the November 30, 2020 exemption. Resolution No. 10. Nov. 2020-2021

25 states that the "capacity" of Analy High School is 1,639 students, El Molino capacity is 1,193

26 students, and Laguna High School Capacity is 214 students.

27 17. An analysis of Analy enrollment figures show that Analy has not had 1,639 students

28 since at least before 1993, with the highest enrollment figure being 1,420 students in the 2000-

F ~ 18. According to Board Minutes dated November 14, 2018, the "Superintendent sets 2001 school year.

m capacity levels." According to these Board Minutes, the "Superintendent, Facilities Director and

4 the Principals met to come up with capacity number[s]:" At that time in 2018, Analy High

5 School capacity was 1350, El Molino High School was 1100, and Laguna High School was 110.

6 On February 13, 2019, the Board, again, was informed that Analy High School's capacity was

7 1350, EI Molino High School's capacity was 1100, and Laguna High School's capacity was 110.

8 19. For purposes of the exemption, Superintendent Beal arbitrarily increased school

9 capacity 21.41% for Analy, 8.45% for El Molino, and 94.55% for Laguna High School to

10 increase the receptor schools' capacity by 496 students for purposes of the exemption.

11 20. The Project includes the closure of El Molino High School and its facilities, the
closure of Laguna High School campus and its facilities, the transfer of students from El Molino

campus. The Project 12
dT1 ZLIMOXSON  3TIWN 'NOSHEGNY 'NOSNHOr *ABUEd 13 to Analy and Laguna, and the transfer of Laguna to the former El Molino

14 has now been enlarged to include the closure and transfer of the District's administrative offices

15 to the former El Molino campus. The latter was not incorporated into the NOE or considered by
16 the Board in issuing Resolutions 10 and 11 on November 30, 2020.
17 21. The District claims that the redistribution of students and school closure can be

18 approved without CEQA review and pursuant to a categorical exemption.

19 22. On October 7 and 21, 2020, architects hired by the Board presented reports to the

20 Board regarding the "feasibility" of the Consolidation (the "Feasibility Reports"). The

21 Feasibility Reports contained various "Site Options." One of the Site Options proposed to the

22 Board included plans to build out and modernize Analy High School with potential budget of

23 $195 million dollars. The information to the Board included briefings that the build-out of Analy

24 High School could include the construction of 563 living units for Analy's staff and faculty at

25 the former District administration offices and at the former Laguna High School campus in

26 Sebastopol, creating excess properties at the former Laguna campus and site of the

27 administrative offices.

6 28 23. Thus, the closure of the District's administrative offices sets the stage for the build-

2 out of the Project, which includes identified space for workforce housing. The closure of the
administrative offices was not identified in the Board's Resolution Nos. 10 or 11.

3

4 24. The Project did not consider the economic effect the closure of El Molino High

School would have on the town of Forestville.

5

6 25. The Project did not consider the excessive miles to be traveled by students to and

7 from the new location, in order to attend their daily classes (some in excess of five hours per

8 day) and the number of students and staff crisscrossing Western Sonoma County to attend school

o at the beginning and end of the traditional school day, as well as during the day, to attend class
offerings in different locations.

10 26. The Project did not consider the danger posed to students traveling through
uncontrolled intersections between Forestville and Sebastopol.

PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, 12
d11 ZLIMOXSOW 8 83TIN 13 27. The Project did not consider the academic/sports relationships and scholarship

14 eligibility for students who would be excluded from high school sports due to the excessive size
of the teams resulting from unmanageable student capacity.
15
16 28. The Project did not consider that El Molino High School has a larger share of socio-

17 economically underprivileged students who could not participate in any after school academic

or

18 sports programs because of the increased travel time and cost, thus undermining the
Superintendent's calculation of "student capacity" as to these students.

19

20 29. The Project did not consider the potential blight to the community of Forestville or

21 the traffic congestion that will increase in the already congested City of Sebastopol.

22 30. The Board promised a full CEQA review in its Frequently Asked Questions portion
of the October 28, 2020 Town Hall Meeting. The FAQ states:

23

24 [Question] Has a study been done to show the impact of increased traffic along
Highway 116 due to students/family commuting to whichever campus? And

25 furthermore, has anyone considered the economic impact to Forestville businesses if El Molino is the school chosen to close. These questions may not

26 be student-centric, but closing a school creates a ripple effect that will have far

27 reaching implications. [ANSWER] The District fully intends to comply with all California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requirements including but not limited to a traffic study and urban decay.

28 31. Instead, on November 30, 2020 the District considered and purportedly approved the
7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project without a traffic study consideration of urban decay or other relevant potential
environmental impacts and without meaningful opportunity to present CEQA objections,
because the vote was specifically identified as a "placcholder" until the "final" approval of the
tu O project, if necessary, in March of 2021-such "final" approval occurred on March 10, 2021 after
the property tax measures failed.
32. In approving the Project and finding the approvals exempt from CEQA, the District
7 made the following findings in the Resolution:

8 a. The District found that the Project consists of consolidating students,
o faculty, and staff of El Molino High to Analy High School and Laguna High
10 School, and the transfer of students from the former Laguna Campus to the EI
11 Molino Campus
12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, b. The District found that the redistribution of students from the closed schools
d11ZLIMOMSOM 2 SETIIM 13 will not require the District to add any new capacity to any of the existing

14 schools that will receive new students as a result of the Project.
15 C. The District claimed an available capacity of 485 students at Analy High
16 School, 640 students at El Molino High School, and 126 students at Laguna
17 High School and found that the Project will not increase original student
18 capacity of any of the District's schools by a net of 25 percent or ten classrooms.
19 d. The District claimed that no unusual circumstances exist; and

20 e. The District found that the Project would not have a significant impact on the

21 environment and qualified for the exemption.

22 33. The District did not provide, or cite to, any evidence in support of its findings. These

23 findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

24 34. Based on these findings, the District approved one Class 14, "Minor Additions to

25 Schools," Categorical Exemptions for the Project under CEQA Guidelines § 15314 and

26 approved the filing and recordation of the Notice of Exemption.

27 35. Members of CARE attended the District's meeting on November 30, 2020 and

28 expressed opposition to the Project

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

36. Members of CARE commented that the District's findings were conclusory and

2 unsupported such that a full CEQA review was necessary as promised by the District

3 37. On November 30th, 2020, during the presentation to the Board regarding the CEQA

4 exemption, the Board was told that the vote on the exemption was a "placeholder" in the event

5 the tax initiatives did not pass and then approved Board Resolution 11 modifying the vote under

6 Resolution No. 10 explaining that the vote on the Project was not final.

7 Resolution #11 which modified Resolution #10 and set forth various potential timelines that

8 might ultimately apply to the Project. Resolution #11 stated: "The District has determined that

9 school consolidation may be necessary and advisable" and, "contingent upon satisfaction of any

10 and all statutory and/or legal prerequisites, could be implemented beginning with the 2021-2022

11 school year."(emphasis added) Resolution #11's modification of Resolution #10 delayed the

12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, timeline for school consolidation in order to afford the community an opportunity to raise
d'T1 ZLIMONSON 9 X3TUA 13 additional revenues for the benefit of the District through tax measures placed on the March 2,

14 2021 ballot" Subsequent public statements by the District, as well as its actual final approval of

15 the Project on March 10, 2021, confirm that the District's November 30, 2020 resolutions did

16 not even resemble, and were not considered by the District, to be its "final approval" of the

17 Project.

18 38. The Board summarily adopted the Resolution and Exemption based on the "cost

19 analysis" presentation (Presentation: "Potential Impacts of CEQA Categorical Exemption and

20 Ballot Measure," WSCUHSD Board Meeting, Nov. 30, 2020)) instead of examining the

21 environmental parameters of the Project and then determining if the Project fits within the

22 CEQA exemption. Instead, the Board analyzed the cost of implementing the Project with or

23 without full CEQA review. The Board determined it should avoid the cost of preparing a full

24 Environmental Impact Review and then defined the Project to fit within the exemption.

25 39. The Board had several meetings just weeks prior to the November 30, 2020 meeting

26 discussing an expansive demolition and construction of a new Analy Campus.

27 40. For these reasons, Members of CARE asked the District for a full CEQA compliant

28 environmental review and not an illusory vote on an Exemption.

IV. ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES 14

15 44. CARE hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 43.

16 45. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted the California Environmental Quality Act

17 ("CEQA") (Public Resource Code 8 21000 et seq.) as a means of establishing a procedural and

18 substantive framework for the evaluation and documentation of the environmental impacts of

19 proposed projects. CEQA requires that public agencies fully inform the public and decision-

20 makers of the significant environmental impacts of proposed projects, and that agencies adopt

21 feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to lessen the significant effects of such projects.

22 Public Resource Code §§ 21000(a), 21000(g), 21002, 21002(a), and 21002.1(b).

23 46. One of the "basic purposes" of CEQA is to "inform governmental decision makers

24 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities."

25 CEQA Guidelines 8 15002(a)(1).

26 47. CEQA applies to an activity deemed to be a "project." A "project" is defined as "the

27 whole of an action, which has the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the
environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the environment." CEQA
10 28

1 Guidelines § 15378(a) (emphasis added).

2 48. Under CEQA, "[t]he term 'project' has been interpreted to mean far more than the

3 ordinary dictionary definition of the term." CEQA Guidelines 15002(d). The term "project" is

4 "given a broad interpretation ... to maximize protection of the environment." RiverWatch V.

5 Olivenhain Municipal Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1203 (citations omitted).

6 49. Where distinct actions are closely related or if success of the overall objective

7 depends on the inclusion of certain actions, the separate actions are viewed as part of a larger

8 project. Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora (2007) 155

10 the environmental analysis" of two actions. Id. at 1230.

18 (The District did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)

19 A. The District Improperly Approved Categorical Exemptions for the Project By
Voting on The Final Project When It Wasn't Final
20

21 52. CARE hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 51.

22 53. CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(2) provides that an agency may determine under the
23 appropriate circumstances that a project is categorically exempt from the provisions of CEQA,

24 except when it is barred by one of the exceptions set forth in Guidelines 15300.2.

25 54. A preliminary determination that a Project is exempt must comply with the

26 procedural and evidentiary requirements of CBQA. If the District fails to follow the procedural

27 requirements, the evidentiary analysis need not take place and the District has abused its

28 discretion. See San Lorenzo Valley Cmty. Advocs. for Responsible Educ. v. San Lorenzo Valley

59. Instead of holding a hearing by which members of CARE could object to the CEQA
exemption, District Board Members followed the lead of Superintendent Beal who explained
12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that the Board must vote on the Exemption on November 30th to save money in the event the
proposed tax measures placed before the electorate in March of 2021 failed. District
Superintendent Beal, in a Power Point presentation explained the potential impacts of "CEQA

4 Categorical Exemption and Ballot Measures." In this November 30, 2020 Power Point,
Superintendent Beal explained that the categorical exemption was a "placeholder" until the final

6 approval of the project was held after the election in March 2021. Moreover, the only thing the

7 District actually approved on November 30, 2020 was "a delayed timeline for consideration of

8 school consolidation in order to afford the community an opportunity to raise additional

9 revenues for the benefit of the District through tax measures placed on the March 2, 2021

10 ballot…." (See Resolution No. 11.) The "final" approval of the Project was March 10, 2021.

11 60. The filing of a Notice of Exemption prior to issuance of final approval rendered the

12 NOE null and void. And, thus, by approving the Project on the basis of Class 14 Exemptions,
13 14 nrmoeey Aa 'NOSHBONY 'NOSNHOr 'ABUEd the District committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion requiring that the Project approvals be
set aside. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. $§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resource Code § 21168.5; Cty. of Amador,
76 Cal. App. 4th at 946.
16 B. The District's Determination of Exemption Was Not Based On Substantial
Evidence As Required By CEQA 17

18 61. CARE hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 60.

19 62. Substantial evidence must support an agency's factual determination that project is

20 categorically exempt. Save Our Sch., 240 Cal.App.4th at 139.

21 63. Superintendent Beal's Power Point presentation of November 30, 2020 did not

22 address any CEQA related information that would allow the Board to fulfill its CEQA obligation

23 to proceed with a "considered awareness of the purposes and policy" that underlie CEQA.

24 Rather, the Board was presented with economic information about the cost of full CEQA review

25 versus the relative cost savings if an exemption were filed, as the Board awaited results of the

26 future tax measure election slated for March 2021. The Board simply followed the

27 Superintendent's lead and undertook "a mechanical application of the exemption criteria" in

28 reaching its decision. Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 843.
13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 64. A Class 14 Exemption under Guidelines JD 15314 applies to "minor additions to

3 existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original

4 student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less."

5 65. In Resolution No. 10, presented to the Board on November 30, 2020 which enabled

6 the Notice of Exemption, the District found that "the Project is minor additions to the three

7 • schools because the only additions are students, faculty, and staff." This finding is not supported

8 by substantial evidence. In fact, the record flatly contradicts it. In its October 2020 Feasibility

9 Reports the District had contemplated a variety of potential plans for consolidation. Those

10 reports concluded that: (a) in all but one circumstance, there was likely a need to add classrooms

11 (at least in the long term) and (b) contemplated the addition of "workforce housing." The one

PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, 12

MILLER & MOSKOWTZ LLF solution that purportedly did not require the addition of classrooms in the short term "Analy Site

13 Option 1" indicated that Analy currently has 58 classrooms many of which need significant work

14 to receive students and make the facility adequate. Notably, the Feasibility Reports showed that,

15 in order to comply with CDE Guidelines, moving El Molino students to Analy would require

16 "[h]eavy modernization," including "moving walls"; the demolition of the "admin building,"

17 auto shop, and "northwest classroom modular building"; and the construction of a "New

18 building: Admin with 9 new classrooms.3 Based on the information presented to the public, the

19 massive build-out could not possibly be considered a "minor addition to existing schools."

20 66. The Project also does not meet the requirements of CEQA Guidelines $ 15314 that

21 any addition would "not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms,

22 whichever is less." The Project is likely to increase the true original student capacity at one or

23 more of the remaining schools by more than 25 percent or 10 classrooms because of the

24 California Department of Education Guidelines, as well as the aged condition of Analy High

25 School and the urgent need to update the school buildings.

C.

26 The District's Determination that the Exemption
Exception was Improper because the District is Improperly Segmenting the
Project was not Barred by Any

27 67.

28 CARE hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 66.
68. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b) provides: "All exemptions for these classes are
14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same

2 place, over time is significant."

c 69. "Cumulative impacts from the closing of a school and transfer of students may

4 encompass impacts on traffic and circulation patterns, housing patterns, recreational and cultural
Un activities, as well as 'successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time' [], where

6 such impacts are significant." East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc.,210 Cal.App.3d at 172.

7 70. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.0(c) provides: "A categorical exemption shall not be used

8 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant

9 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Moreover, CEQA requires the

10 preparation of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for any project subject to its provisions

11 that "may" have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Resources Code § 2100(a).

12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, 71. In the Town Hall Meetings of October 7 and 21, 2020, the 7 District was presented
d11 ZLIMONSON g S3TIN 13 with substantial evidence of potentially significant cumulative impacts such that the approval of

14 a categorical Exemption was improper. Yet, on November 30, 2020, the District voted for the

15 exemption anyway. The Board determined that the exception to the exemption provided for in

16 CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c) did not apply because "the District is unaware of any

17 unusual circumstances that would negate the use of the Class 14 Categorical Exemption for this

18 Project." The Board failed to cite to any evidence, or to conduct any meaningful analysis in

19 connection with that determination. Moreover, the Board failed to consider whether the

20 exception provided for in CEQA Guidelines 1300.2 subsection (b)--the "cumulative impact"

21 exception-applied.

22 72. Instead, the District was presented with, and ignored, substantial evidence of a

23 reasonable possibility of significant environmental impacts as a result of the Project, including, a

24 but not limited to traffic/circulation, parking, public safety, noise, and air quality impacts. The

25 approval of categorical exemptions in light of these potential impacts was improper, and

26 exceptions to the Class 14 Exemptions apply to the Project under both Guidelines §§ 15300.2(b)

27 and 15300.0(c).

28 73. On October 7. Superintendent Toni Beal and Facilities Director Jennie Bruneman

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I presented the Feasibility Reports a series of building and facility options at the School Board

2 meeting. Option No. - is ostensibly the Project which will cost the District $200,000 to

3 implement.

4 74. Option No. 2 is the recommendation of the California Department of Educations,

5 "Minimum CDE recommendations" which requires two new significant structures and major

6 modernization to the aged central Analy campus which would cost the District $92 million

7 dollars. $73 million is available in current construction bonds implying that construction can

8 commence within 13-15 months.

75. Option No. 3 is a major modernization of well over half of the Analy campus which

10 would cost the District $195 million dollars.

11 76. In that same presentation, Architects AXIA, presented the feasibility of beginning

12
PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, this project and a timeline which included workforce housing: potentially, 21 single family
13 umoete n 14 homes, 25 single family attached units, and 44 multi-family units.
77. According to the AXIA presentation, the sample process begins with the presentation
of a Feasibility Analysis (October 7, 2020) and ends 13-14 months later to the submission of

16 "building permits."

17 78. The District was also presented with "Closure 101-Options" on how to close a

18 school approximately six weeks before the District made the interim decision, on November 30,

19 2020, to consolidate the schools. That same presentation indicated Board tasks well into

20 December 2020 before a closure decision should be made.

21 79. Members of CARE, on October 28, 2020, and at the subsequent Town Hall meeting

22 on the Project, expressed concern that the District was attempting to avoid environmental review

23 and the District should conduct a full review.

24 80. Instead, the District voted to close the schools by filing an exemption in violation of

25 the California Environmental Quality Act.

26 81. The Project as a whole, therefore, was likely to have a significant and cumulative

27 environmental impact. But the District attempted to avoid full CEQA review by segmenting the

28 Project into smaller, incremental parts. This is not allowed under CEQA. See Assoc. for a
16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Cleaner Envir. V. Yosemite Community College Dist. (2004), 116 Cal.App.4th at 637 (CEQA's
c requirements "cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,
G individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment.").

D. The District Manipulated School Capacity To Fit The Exemption
82. CARE hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 81.
o 83. With Resolution No. 10, the School Board determined the Project falls within the
n Class 14 Categorical Exemption set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15314. That section

8 exempts a project that "consists of minor additions to existing schools within existing school

9 grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten

10 classrooms, whichever is less." Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15314.

11 84. The District was eager for the cost savings of filing the Notice of Exemption, as

12 explained by Superintendent Beal, and overlooked the fact that the consolidation of 553 EI PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, !71 ZIIMOMSON 9 83T1IN 13 Molino Students to the existing 1,154 students would create a 1707 student body population in

14 a school with a stated capacity of 1,350 students, as stated in Board minutes in 2018 and 2019.

15 85. To remedy the math that the student population would not be 26% greater than the

16 stated capacity, Superintendent Beal explained to the Board that the "original capacity" of Analy

17 High School was now 1,639 students.

18 86. In fact, during Board meetings in 2018 and 2019, Beal has always maintained that

19 student capacity for Analy was 1,350 students.

20 87. To shoehorn the facts into the requirements of the Exemption, Beal explained to the

21 Board that Analy's new capacity was 1,639 students when, in 2018, she had stated, in

22 conjunction with consultation from facilities managers and principals, that the capacity was

23 1,350. She also arbitrarily increased the capacity of El Molino from 1100 students to 1,193 and

24 then doubled the stated capacity of Laguna High School from 110 in 2018 to 214 for purposes

25 of meeting the strict requirements of the Exemption.

26 88. Based on these new, unsupported capacity numbers, the Board voted prematurely for

27 the Exemption.

28 WHEREFORE, CARE prays for the following relief on all causes of action:
17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-
A 4 89. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent District to set
aside its Project approvals, including its CEQA exemption findings and related
determinations, and order that the closure of El Molino and the anticipated

NOI consolidation be stayed pending compliance with CEQA. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§
1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resource Code § 21168.9.

8 90. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent District to

o consider, prepare, and circulate a legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and

10 otherwise comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken on the Project.
91. For costs of this suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to law and Code of Civil

PERRY, JOHNSON, ANDERSON, 202 Procedure § 1021.5.

11 ZLIMONSON 9 83711/ 92. For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent injunctive

14 relief, in the event that the Respondent District intends to commence closures of the
school sites during this litigation. Cal. Code of Civ. Proc. § 526.
