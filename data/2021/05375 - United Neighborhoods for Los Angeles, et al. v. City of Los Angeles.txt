VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION
Petitioners UNITED NEIGHBORHOODS FOR LOS ANGELES and ANGELENOS FOR
2
TREES allege as follows:
3 1. Petitioners challenge the June 22, 2021 decisions of the City of Los Angeles to (i) certify
4 that the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) environmental impact report for the City's Sidewalk
5 Repair Program Project ("the Project"); (ii) adopt the Project's California Environmental Quality Act
6 ("CEQA") Findings, which included a statement of overriding considerations; (iii) approve the Project's
7 "Street Tree Policy" and "Mandatory Project Features Policy"; and (iv) adopt the ordinance dated March

8 23, 2021 adding section 62.104.1 to the Los Angeles Municipal Code, codifying the City's new

9 Sidewalk Repair Program.

10 2. Petitioners contend that the City erred in certifying the FEIR and violated provisions of

11 CEQA (Pub. Resources Code §§21000, et seq.) and the Guidelines for Implementation of CEQA. (Tit.

12 14 Cal. Code Regs, $§15000, et seq.)

13 PARTIES AND BENEFICIAL INTEREST
14 3. Plaintiff and Petitioner UNITED NEIGHBORHOODS FOR LOS ANGELES, a
15 California non-profit corporation ("UN4LA"), is a community organization composed of residents of the

16 City of Los Angeles frustrated by City Hall's unwillingness to listen to their concerns about poor

17 planning, the lack of affordable housing, green space crumbling infrastructure and inconsistent

18 enforcement of building codes. The interests UN4LA seeks to further in this action are within the

19 purposes and goals of the organization. Members of UN4LA live, work and recreate in the area subject

20 to the Sidewalk Repair Program and will be adversely affected by the Project's environmental impacts.
Accordingly, Petitioner UN4LA has standing as a beneficially interested party to this action.
21 4. Plaintiff and Petitioner ANGELENOS FOR TREES, a California Non-profit corporation
22 ("AFT" or collectively with UN4LA as "Petitioners"), is a community organization composed of
23 residents of the City who are committed to uniting Los Angeles neighborboods to preserve and
24 regenerate the City's rapidly shrinking trec canopy. Members of AFT live, work and recreate in the area

25 subject to the Sidewalk Repair Program and will be adversely affected by the Project's environmental

26 impacts. Accordingly, Petitioner AFT has standing as a beneficially interested party to this action.

27 5. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("City" or "Respondent*"') is a

28 California charter city located in the County of Los Angeles, California. The City has declared that it is
the lead agency for the project under CEQA; it authorized the Notice of Determination for the Project
-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

that was filed on June 24, 2021. The City is responsible for preparation of an initial study, environmental

2 impact report, and other documents under CEQA that must fully describe the project and its impacts
along with evaluate mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid significant environmental
3 impacts caused by the Project.
4 6. Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,
5 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sucs said Respondents by
6 fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when

7 ascertained.

8 7. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

9 corporate, associate are unknown to Petitioners at this time who, therefore, sues said Real Parties in

10 Interest by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities
when ascertained.
11
8.
12 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that at all relevant times, the City,
the City Council, and the Doe Respondents were and are the agents of each other, authorized to perform
13 the acts alleged herein, each of which was ratified by the others.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under Code of Civil Procedure section

16 1094.5.

17 10. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under Code of Civil Procedure

18 section 1085, as well as Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5

11.
19 Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of Los

20 Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause
alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. (Code Civ. Proc. 393; Cal.
21 State Parks Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826.) Venue is also proper in this Court
22 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 (actions against a city, county or local agency), and
23 395 (actions gencrally) since the City of Los Angeles is in the County of Los Angeles.
24 12. This petition is timely filed. is

25 13. Petitioners have provided written notice of their intention to file this petition to

26 Respondent in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and are including the notice as

27 Exhibit A.

14.
28 On July 26, 2021, Petitioners, through its counsel, served the California Attorney Gencral
with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy of this Petition.
-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

A copy of such notice (without the copy of this Petition attached to such notice), is attached to this

2 Petition as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this reference. Such notice satisfies Petitioner's
duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure, section
3 388.
4 15. Petitioners have concurrently filed a notice of their election to prepare the record of
5 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section

6 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and are including the notice of this election as Exhibit C.

7 16. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and have

8 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources Code section

9 21177. Petitioners and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in

10 this petition orally or in writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.
17.
11 The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

12 Petitioners and/or their supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this
beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioners' interests, and
13 those of its supporting members.
14 18. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unlessl
15 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its certification of the
16 Project and environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will

17 remain in effect in violation of CEQA and other state law and injurious to Petitioners.

18 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

19 California Environmental Quality Act
19. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant
20 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
21 20. CEQA requires that, prior to approving and implementing a project subject to CEQA, an
22 agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed actions in an EIR (except in certain
23| limited circumstances). (See, e.g., PRC § 21100, et seq. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-

24 Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'forcmost principle' in interpreting CEQA

25 is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the to

26 Ienvironment within the reasonable scopc of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal.

27 Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
21.
28 CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and
the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project prior to approval. (14 Cal.
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Code Reg. ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible

2 officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR

3 *protects not only the environment but also informed self-government.™"* (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.
Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564 [emphasis added]). The EIR has been described as "an
4 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the it public and its responsible officials to
5 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."(Berkeley Keep Jets
6 Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354 ("Berkeley Jets").)

7 22. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

8 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (14

9 CCR § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to

10 provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

11 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." (CEQA
Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).).
12 23. Finally, CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental effects of a Projcct
13 prior to approving a Project as part of a public agency's decision-making process. Section 21002.1(d) of
14 the Cal. Public Resources Code requires a public agency to "consider[] the effects, both individual and
15 collective, of all activitics involved in a project."

16 24. CEQA requires that a public agency considers approval of a Project concurrently with the 17 public agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project. Section 21003(a) of

18 the Cal. Public Resources Code specifically requires that [lJocal agencies integrate the requirements of

19 this division with planning and environmental review procedures otherwise required by law or by local
practice so that all those procedures, to the maximum feasible extent, run concurrently, rather than
20 I consecutively.
21 25. Consistent with the mandate that the CEQA process runs concurrently with a public
22 agency's decision as to whether to approve or disapprove a specific project, CEQA requires that a public
23 agency considers : project's environmental impacts when "determining whether to approve the project"
24 CEQA Guidelines § 15093(a).

25 26. A project is approved for the purposes of CEQA when a public agency commits "to a

26 definite course of action [including an] entitlement for use of the project."(CEQA Guidelines §

27 15352).

27.
28 An agency cannot adopt a CEQA determination for a Project prior to approval of a
project. (Cly. of Amador v. El Dorado Cty. Water Agency, 76 Cal. App. 4th 931, 965 (1999) (citing CEQA
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.

Guidelines § 15352(a); Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209 Cal. App. 4th 408, 423.)
28.
2 Similarly, a CEQA determination cannot be adopted after a project has been approved.
Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal. 4th 116, 127, 132 (finding that subsequent
3 "preparation and certification of an EIR" does not render a lawsuit moot and that "an agency has 10
4 discretion to define approval so as to make its commitment to a project precede the required preparation
5 of an EIR.").

6 29. CEQA requires that public agency allow the public to appeal a CEQA determination to a

7 public "agency's elected decision making body." (PRC § 21151(c)). A CEQA determination and project

8 approval is not "final" until "the final adjudicatory administrative decision." (Hensler v. City of

9 Glendale (1994) 8 Cal. 4th 1, 22).

10 30. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and procedural

11 steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA process. (Laurel Heights
Improvement Association v. Regents of the University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ("The
12 EIR process protects not only the environment but also informed self government."); Concerned
13 Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 936
14 (members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process)), "Each public agency should
15 include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent

16 with its existing activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to

17 environmental issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines§ 15201). The lead agency

18 must consider all "comments it receives on a draft environmental impact report, proposed negative

19 declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC § 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b)).
31. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been given a
20 full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.
21 32. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A lead
22 agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is "otherwise
23 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC § 21002.1(c).)

24 California Street Improvement Act of 1911, Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 62.104 and

25 Sidewalk Repair and Maintenance

26 33. The California Improvement Act of 1911, Cal. Streets and Highways Code §§ 5000, et

27 seq ("Improvements Act") imposcs responsibility on property owners in front of a public street to

28 maintain sidewalks to "not endanger persons or property" or "interfere with the public convenicnce."
(Cal. Streets and Highways Code §§5610.)
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 34. In 1974, the City adopted LAMC Section 62.104, Ordinance No. 146,040 exempting

2 property owners from responsibility for sidewalk repairs caused by street tree root growth. In 2016, the
City amended LAMC Section 62.104 to remove the exemption for street tree root growth, placing
3 responsibility for maintaining sidewalks on property owners, as well as providing a rebate and incentive
4 program incentivizing property owners to repair the sidewalks in front of their properties. (LAMC {
5 62.104, Ordinance No. 184,596.) Property owners are required to obtain a permit from the City prior to
6 attempting any sidewalk repair. (LAMC § 62.105).

7 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

8 35. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.

9 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including

10 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important

11 public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to
the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents and Real Parties in
12 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal
13 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they
14 have fully complied with these legal requirements
15 36. Petitioners are entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
16 section 1021.5 if they prevail in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these
17 public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

18 STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 37. The Sidewalk Repair Program Project will modify the manner in which the City of Los

20 Angeles undertakes sidewalk repair projects. The project consists, among other things, of procedures for
tree removal and replacement and canopy and root pruning.
21 38. The Program also provides for a "streamlined discretionary approval process under
22 CEQA" for sidewalk repair projects that fall outside the general parameters for ministerial approval.
23 39. On July 26, 2017, the City issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental
24 Impact Report for the Program as well as an Initial Study / Environmental Checklist. The City

25 conducted public scoping meetings to assist preparation of the Environmental Impact Report from the

26 Project on August 9, 14 and 24, 2017.

27 40. The Draft Environmental Impact Report was circulated for public review and comment

28 from December 26, 2019 through February 24, 2020. The comment period was extended twice, through
May 31, 2020.
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

41. The Final Environmental Impact Report was published in April 2021.
42.
2 On May 14, 2021, the Los Angeles Board of Public Works held a special meeting to
consider the Final Environmental Impact Report. Petitioner UN4LA submitted a comment letter in 3 objection to that meeting being held without proper notice to the public.
4 43. The Public Works Committee held a meeting on May 26, 2021 offering an opportunity
5 for public comment.

6 44. On May 26, 2021, the Public Works Committee ("PWC'") issued a report recommending

7 that the City Council certify that the FEIR was completed in compliance with CEQA and that potentially

8 significant environmental effects of the project had been disclosed and evaluated in conformance with

9 CEQA. The PWC further recommended that the City adopt the Project's CEQA findings, including the

10 Statement of Overriding Considerations. The PWC also advised the Council to adopt the ordinance to

11 add section 62.104.1 to the Los Angeles Municipal Code, which would codify the Sidewalk Repair
Program.
12 45. On June 22, 2021, the Los Angeles City Council met and took official action to adopt the
13 Public Works Committee Report and Ordinance. Mayor Garcetti approved that action on June 28, 2021
14 46. Ordinance number 187106, implementing Los Angeles Municipal Code section 62.104.1
15 titled "Sidewalk Repair Program Projects," was passed on June 22, 2021, approved by the mayor on
16 June 28, 2021, and published July 2, 2021 with an effective date of August 2, 2021.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act)
47.
19 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth
hercin.
20 48. As outlined below, the City abused its discretion in multiple ways. The City failed to
21 proceed in the manner required by law; the City failed to make findings supported by substantial
22 evidence and the City failed to make findings required by law. Further, the City failed comply with
23 CEQA in that they failed to provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental
24 analysis to allow both decisionmakers and the general public to adequatcly consider the environmental

25 consequences of the proposed project.

Inadequate Findings
49. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by
2 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an
3 explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

4 50. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law in

5 that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited to, the

6 following.

7 a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that "project

8 design features" would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the environment;
b. The determination that alternatives to the Project and mitigation measures that would
9 have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were unnecessary and/or infeasible;
10 c. All determinations which relied on the inadequate EIR and other legally defective
11 documents or analyses.
12 Usage of "Mandatory Project Design Features" Violated CEQA

13 51. The City erroneously concluded that no mitigation measures were necessary for the
14 Project by attempting to incorporate mitigation measures into project and characterizing them as

15 "mandatory design features. A public agency cannot simply incorporate measures into the description

16 of a project in an effort to purposely understate a project's impacts. In Lotus v. Department of

17 Transportation (2014) 223 Cal. App. 4th 645 ("Lotus"), Caltrans was found to have certified an
insufficient EIR based on its failure to properly evaluate the potential impacts of a highway project.
18 The Lotus court found that Caltrans erred by:
19 incorporating the proposed mitigation measures into its description of the project and then
20 concluding that any potential impacts from the project will be less than significant. As the trial court held, the "avoidance, minimization and/or mitigation measures," as they are characterized
21 in the EIR, are not "part of the project." They are mitigation measures designed to reduce or
22 eliminate the damage to the redwoods anticipated from disturbing the structural root zone of the trees by excavation and placement of impermeable materials over the root zones. By
23 compressing the analysis of impacts and mitigation measures into a single issue, the EIR
disregards the requirements of CEQA.
24
(Id. at 655-656, emph. added.) The court ordered Caltrans' certification of the EIR be set aside, 25 finding:
26 this shortcutting of CEQA requirements subverts the purposes of CEQA by omitting material
27 necessary to informed decision-making and informed public participation. It precludes both

28 identification of potential environmental consequences arising from the project and also thoughtful analysis of the sufficiency of measures to mitigate those consequences. The deficiency cannot be considered harmless. -d-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 Here, the City made the same mistake as Caltrans by attempting to characterize what were in reality

3 mitigation measures as "Mandatory Project Design Features."
52. Additionally, failing to acknowledge a "mitigation" measure as what it truly is robs it the
4 public from the benefits of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program. A public agency must
5 adopt a monitoring program to ensure that any mitigation measures are implemented. Pub. Resources
6 Code, § 21081.6, subd. (a). The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation
7 measures will actually be implemented as condition of development, and not merely adopted and

8 then neglected or disregarded. § 21002.1, subd. (b); Federation of Hillside & Canyon Ass'ns v. City of

9 Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1252, 1261.

10 Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Impacts
53.
11 CEQA requires the lead agency for a project, the City in this instance, to conduct an

12 adequate environmental review prior to making a formal decision on a project subject to a CEQA.
(CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs. 15004.) The lead agency must also provide for public review
13 and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide
14 sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
15 consequences when acting on proposed projects.
16 54. CEQA imposes on the City a clear, present, and mandatory duty to certify an EIR only if

17 that EIR fully discloses to the public the Project's significant environmental effects. The EIR for the

18 Sidewalk Repair Program Project lacks the required analysis.
55.
19 Further, CEQA requires that the City adopt all feasible mitigation measures that would

20 reduce adverse environmental impacts; a number of feasible mitigation measures were ignored in the
EIR. Other mitigation measures were improperly characterized as "Mandatory Project Design Featurcs."
21 56. A Project's effect on the environment is considered significant when it causes a
22 substantial or potentially substantial change in the environment. (Pub. Resources Code §§21068,
23 21100(d); 14 Cal. Code Regs §15360.) The environment is comprised of physical conditions within the
24 Project's area which will be affected by the proposed project; these include land, air, water, minerals,

25 flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance. (Pub. Resources Code §21060.5.) If

26 a project will worsen existing environmental hazards, then any impacts of the changed conditions caused

27 by the project must be analyzed. The City failed to adequately undertake this analysis
57.
28 Additionally, Respondent violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondent:
-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a. Failed to adequately analyze identified alternatives to the project and to mitigate impacts
by selecting a less impactful, feasible alternative to the Project without adopting a valid statement of
0 A 0 overriding considerations;
b. Failed to adequately analyze the environmental impacts of the Project by screening out
environmental factors related to the following: Mineral Resources, Population and Housing and
Recreation. Notably, the EIR failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the loss of the City's Tree
Canopy and failed to adequately analyze the Project's air quality impacts. The City also failed to
adequately analyze and mitigate the loss and/or destruction of historic resources. The City also failed
cg to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's effect on public health. Finally, the City failed to

9 adequately analyze the Project's cumulative impacts.

10 58. The City also failed to conduct the required alternatives analysis required by 14 Cal Codel

11 Regs §15126.6(a). An EIR must evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives identified in an EIR.
14 Cal Code Regs §15126.6(a). The range of alternatives analyzed by the City was inadequate and
12 unreasonable. Further, the City did not make an objective, good faith effort to compare the project with
13 the alternatives.
14 The City Failed To Adequately Respond to Comments Made on the Draft EIR
15 59. Petitioners, interested organizations and members of the public submitted comments
16 which questioned the adequacy of the Projects' environmental analyses CEQA requires that the lead

17 agency provide written responses to comments submitted during the EIR comment period. (Pub.

18 Resources Code §21092.5.) Those responses require good faith, reasoned analysis. (14 Cal. Code Regs

19 §15088(c).)
60. Instead of providing the required good faith responses, required by CEQA, the City's
20 responses were often reductive and non-responsive. Moreover, despite receiving hundreds of comments,
21 many of which provided alternatives and suggested mitigation measures, the FEIR was dismissive.
22 61. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed alternatives,
23 Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover, Respondent's finding that
24 adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by substantial evidence.

25 62. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion by

26 failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct an

27 adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's EIR must be set aside.
