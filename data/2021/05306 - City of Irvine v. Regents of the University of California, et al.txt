attorneys at law 2545/048170-0305 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
16101048.2 a02/ DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 Petitioner/Plaintiff City of Irvine ("Petitioner" or "City") respectfully petitions this Court
2 for issuance of a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") section 1094.5 and
3 Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21168, or in the alternative pursuant to CCP § 1085 and
4 PRC § 21168.5, and complains for the issuance of temporary, preliminary, and permanent
5 injunctive relief and for a declaration of its rights pursuant to CCP §§ 526 and 1060, as follows:

6 INTRODUCTORY ALLEGATIONS

7 1. This action challenges the decision of the Regents of the University of California

8 ("Regents") and the University of California, Irvine ("UCI," collectively, Regents and UCI are
9 referred to as "Respondents") to approve a massive new medical development, consisting of a six-
10 story, 350,000-gross square feet (gsf) acute care hospital, a six-story 225,000 gsf Ambulatory Care

11 Center, a three-story central utility plant, and a six-story parking structure with approximately 1,400
12 parking spaces (the "Project"), on approximately 14.5 acres (the "Site") within the City.
13 2. In approving the Project, the Respondents unlawfully and willfully ignored the City's
14 land use regulations, claiming that the Project is entirely exempt from local regulation. However,
15 as explained in more detail herein, UCI is exempt from the City's regulation only when acting in a
16 governmental, rather than proprietary capacity. As it is clear that the purpose of the Project is
17 primarily proprietary, Respondents' contention that the Project is not subject to the City's land use
18 regulations is incorrect as a matter of law. UCI thus may not proceed with the Project unless it first
19 seeks and obtains appropriate entitlements from the City.
20 3. Additionally, as described in more detail herein, the Respondents' approval of the
21 Project violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA," codified as Public Resources
22 Code §§ 21000 et seq.) in numerous respects. Moreover, those violations are compounded by the
23 fact that Respondents have unlawfully failed to adhere to mitigation measures previously adopted
24 in connection with the Regent's 2007 approval of a "Long Range Development Plan" ("LRDP")
25 that the Project further implements.

26 THE PARTIES

27 4. Petitioner and Plaintiff City is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a municipal
28 corporation and charter city, duly organized and existing under the Constitution and laws of the

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -2-
attorneys et law 2545/048170-0305 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
16101048.2 a02/08/21 DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 State of California and the City's Charter. The City is governed by its duly elected City Council.
2 The Project would result in a massiv development within the City's jurisdiction. The City thus has
3 the authority and duty to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizens,
4 residents, employees and visitors within its boundaries, including those who travel through or are
5 otherwise directly or indirectly affected by the operation and use of the Project. By virtue of its
6 police powers, duties and responsibilities, the City is beneficially interested in the Project and the
7  outcome of this proceeding.

8 5. Respondent and Defendant Regents is the governing body of the University of
9| California system and serves as the CEQA lead agency responsible for preparing and certifying
10 documents under CEQA, including the Subsequent Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR")
11 prepared in connection with the Project. The Regents act as lead agency for environmental review
12 of the Project and certified the SEIR in that capacity, as indicated in the Project's January 21, 2021
13 Notice of Determination ("NOD"). The Regents have a mandatory duty to comply with applicable
14 local planning documents, local ordinances, and state law requirements, including CEQA and the
15 CEQA Guidelines, when considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory actions, such
16 as the Project.

17 6. Respondent and Defendant and Real Party in Interest the University of California,
18 Irvine ("UCI"*) is a public university within the University of California system, located in the City
19 of Irvine. UCI is identified as the Project applicant on the Notice of Determination filed for the
20 Project.

21 7. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents and Defendants
22 sued herein as Does 1 through 10 and therefore sues those Respondents and Defendants by such
23 fictitious names. The City is informed and believes and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-
24 named Respondents and Defendants is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and
25 happenings referred to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Respondent and Defendant
26 caused injury and damage to City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to
27 amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Respondents
28 and Defendants when the same are ascertained.

1 8. The City is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest sued
2 herein as Does 11 through 20 and therefore sues those Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious
3 names. The City is informed and believes and alleges thereon that each of the fictitiously-named
4 Real Parties in Interest is in some manner responsible or liable for the events and happenings referred
5 to herein, and that each such fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest caused injury and damage to

6 City as alleged in this Petition. The City will seek leave of Court to amend this Petition to allege
7 the true names and capacities of such fictitiously-named Real Parties in Interest when the same are

8  ascertained.

g EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

10 9. The City has performed all conditions precedent to filing a CEQA action against
11 Respondent and has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
12 The City objected to the approval of the Project and certification of the SEIR during the
13 administrative process, including by submitting comment letters dated November 10, 2020 and
14 January 15, 2021, setting forth, inter alia, the many deficiencies in both the draft and final versions
15  of the EIR and explaining that UCI's refusal to comply with the City's land use regulations is
16 unlawful.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
19 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, 1060, 526 et seq., and CEQA, including but not limited to Public
20 Resource Code sections 21167, 21168 and 21168.5.

21 11. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, both
22 because the City is located within the County of Orange and because the Project Site is also located

23 in the County of Orange.

24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 Development of UCI's Long-Range Development Plan

26 12. Under California law, each campus of the University of California is required to
27 | periodically prepare a "Long Range Development Plan" ("LRDP") that that sets forth concepts,
28 principles, and plans to guide the future growth of that campus.

‡

- 13. In November 2007, the Regents adopted such an LRDP for the UCI campus,
2 outlining projected development levels and patterns for UCI at all of its campus sites through the
3 year 2026. In connection with the Regents' adoption of the 2007 LRDP, the Regents also certified
4 an Environmental Impact Report for the 2007 LRDP (the '2007 EIR"). As a part of its approval of
5 the 2007 LRDP and certification of the 2007 EIR, and as required by CEQA, the Regents adopted

6 enforceable mitigation measures necessary to offset the impacts from the 2007 LRDP. Among other
7 things, those mitigation measures required UCI to pay its "fair share" of the cost of infrastructure
8 improvements necessary to mitigate traffic impacts resulting from the development contemplated in
9 the 2007 LRDP.

10 14. In 2020, the Regents began considering the development of the Project, and on
11 October 2, 2020, the Regents released a "Notice of Availability" informing the public that the
12 Regents had prepared a Draft Subsequent Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR") purporting to
13 analyze the impact of Respondents' proposal to amend the 2007 LRDP to allow for Inpatient uses
14 and to develop the Project.

15 15. The City submitted written comments on the DSEIR on November 10, 2021, pointing
16 out numerous flaws in the DEIR, including, but not limited to:

17 a.

18 Contrary to Respondents' assertion, the Project is not exempt from

19 the City's land use regulation; by asserting otherwise, the DEIR failed to accurately describe
the Project or analyze its significant impacts.

20 b.

21 The DEIR's analysis of transportation impacts related to vehicle miles
traveled ("VMT") is unsupported by substantial evidence.

22 C.

23 By refusing to incorporate the 2007 EIR's traffic mitigation measures,

24 the Project will result in significant unmitigated traffic impacts.

d.

25 The noise mitigation fails to track the City's noise ordinance, and

26 thus, will not mitigate construction noise impacts to less than significant, as erroneously

asserted in the DEIR.

27 e.

28 The DSEIR failed to adequately address the potential impacts the
Project will have on the City's police and fire services.

16101048.2 a02/08/21 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 16. Despite being informed of these many glaring deficiencies, the Regents then
2 prepared a final SEIR ("FSEIR"- collectively the DSEIR and FSEIR are referred to as the "2021
3 SEIR") to be considered at the Regents' January 21, 2021 meeting. The FSEIR's responses to the

4 City's initial comments were conclusory and failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA. The
5 City accordingly submitted a second letter on January 15, 2021, reiterating its concerns about the
6 Project.

7 17. The FSEIR continued to wrongly assert the Project is entirely exempt from the City's
8 zoning and land use laws. Although a state agency is not subject to local regulation when it is
9 "clearly acting in its governmental capacity," agencies are not exempt from such regulation when
10 "acting in a proprietary capacity." (Board of Trustees v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49 Cal.App.3d
11 45, 49-50.) Notwithstanding Respondents' conclusory assertion in the FSEIR that the Project is
12 undertaken "in furtherance of the University's education purposes," the primary purpose of the
13 Project is clearly proprietary--i.e., it is intended to allow to expand UCI Health's capacity to provide
14 health services to more patients. As the 2007 SEIR itself sums up, the "Project would allow for the
15 development of an integrated medical campus providing inpatient, ambulatory, and emergency care
16 services space to meet community needs." Respondents' apparent position that merely asserting
17 that some part of a massive project has the potential for incidental educational use is enough to
18 exempt the entire Project from local regulation is unsupported by law, and would effectively prevent
19 municipalities from ever regulating any development proposed by state agencies, notwithstanding
20 decades of authority holding otherwise.

21 18. On January 20, 2021, during a very short meeting of the Regents' "Finance and
22 Capital Strategies Committee" ("Committee"), the Committee considered the Project and the
23 proposed 2021 SEIR and recommended approval of the Project. On January 21, 2021, the full Board
24  of Regents voted to approve the Project and certify the proposed 2021 SEIR. On the same date, the
25 Regents filed the NOD, indicating they had approved the Project.

26 19. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.5, Petitioner has provided written notice of the
27 commencement of this action to Respondents.

28 20. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.7 and CCP § 388, Petitioner has or will provide written

1 notice of this action to the State Attorney General.

2 21. The City elects to prepare the administrative record, and that election is filed and
3 served with this Petition.

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Writ of Mandate - Violations of CEQA in Approving the Project)

6 22. The City hereby incorporates by this reference each and every allegation contained
7 in paragraphs 1 through 21 above.

8 23. Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency a approves any discretionary project, the
g agency must first identify, assess, and publicly disclose the project's potential environmental effects.
10 An agency may not approve a project that has the potential to have significant environmental
11 impacts if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that would avoid or substantially
12 lessen the adverse environmental impacts.

13 24. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
14 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
15 limitation, the following:

16 a. The 2021 SEIR fails to provide a complete, accurate, finite, and stable

17 description of the Project. Among other defects, the SEIR fails to identify multiple

18 discretionary approvals required from the City, including, but not limited to, a General Plan

19 Amendment and a conditional use permit.

20 b. The 2021 SEIR fails to fully analyze the Project's potential impacts

21 related to land use by, inter alia, incorrectly assuming that the Project is exempt from City

22 regulation (including the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and all other standards,

23 requirements, regulations and guidelines) and failing to adequately analyze the Project's

24 consistency with the County's General Plan. The 2021 SEIR further fails to make a good-

25 faith effort at fully disclosing the Project's conflicts with applicable land use plans, policies

26 and regulations and the resulting impacts.

27 C. The 2021 SEIR fails to impose feasible mitigation relating to the

28 Project's impacts on land use, and/or adopt a feasible alternative that would reduce such

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -]-
attorneÿs et law 2545/048170-0305 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

impacts, instead relying solely on vague and uncertain future amendments of the City's

2 General Plan, Zoning Code, and other applicable land use documents and regulations, which

3 do not actually modify the Project or lessen its impacts.
v oA d. The 2021 SEIR improperly fails to require UCI to comply with all of
the existing mitigation measures that were imposed as part of the Mitigation and Monitoring
Reporting Program ("MMRP") for the 2007 EIR. To the extent the 2021 SEIR effectively
deletes such mitigation measures, it fails to demonstrate that such measures are no longer

8 necessary, or to consider the impacts of deleting such measures. Such measures include, but

9 are not limited to, traffic measures requiring UCI to pay its "fair share" of the costs
10 associated with improving the City's transportation infrastructure.

11 e. The 2021 SEIR improperly fails to use the City's General Plan,

12 Zoning Code and other standards, requirements, regulations and guidelines as thresholds of

13 significance, which results in an underestimation of the Project's impacts and incorrect

14 conclusions regarding the significance of such impacts, including but not limited to the

15 Project's impacts on air quality, aesthetics, land use, public services, population and housing,

16 greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and traffic/transportation. Accordingly, the 2021 SEIR

17 fails to properly identify, disclose and mitigate a number of significant impacts.

18 f. The 2021 SEIR improperly concludes that the Project's impacts on

19 traffic will be less than significant by asserting, without justification, that a mitigation
20 measure requiring the Project to participate in an existing program designed to reduce the

21 percentage of students and employees commuting to UCI in single-occupancy vehicles will

22 reduce total vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") associated with the Project a by a staggering

23 21%-more than 4 times the reduction the City's VMT guidance suggests may appropriate

24 for participation in such a program-despite the fact that much of the Project's VMT will
25 be generated by patients and visitors (not students and employees).

26 g, The 2021 SEIR fails to disclose all impacts, improperly defers

27 mitigation/imposes uncertain mitigation, and fails to adopt available, feasible mitigation

28 relating to the Project's impacts on noise by erroneously assuming that the Project does not

H

2 have to comply with the City's Noise Ordinance.

h.

co A aurAU The 2021 SEIR fails adequately analyze, disclose, and mitigate
potential impacts to fire and police service. The 2021 SEIR admits that the Project will
contribute to a need for a new fire station, a and but fails to require mitigation to ensure that
such station is funded, let alone constructed. Likewise, the 2021 SEIR acknowledges that
Irvine Police Department ("IPD") will have jurisdiction within the Project, but fails to
explain what impact that would have on IPD's existing level of service.
i.

9 The 2021 SEIR's analysis of the Project's impacts related to

10 aesthetics, biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous

11 materials, hydrology and water quality, light and glare, noise, population and housing, and

12 utilities and service systems is inadequate, fails to require all feasible mitigation necessary

13 to mitigate significant environmental impacts, and contains conclusions that are not
supported by substantial evidence.

14 j.

15 Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding

16 Considerations approved by Respondents are legally and factually deficient, and not

17 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. Respondents also failed to

18 adopt findings to justify the Project's unmitigated, significant impacts in a number of areas

19 because the 2021 SEIR improperly concluded that those impacts are less than significant,

20 including but not limited to impacts on land use, traffic, public services and noise.
k.

21 The 2021 SEIR's Responses to Comments are nonresponsive and/or

22 otherwise legally inadequate and/or incorrect, specifically including, but not limited to, the

23 Responses to Comments regarding land use, traffic and transportation, public services, and

24 noise, in violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines section 15088;

l.

25 The 2021 SEIR improperly segmented and/or piecemealed its

26 analysis by analyzing the Project's impacts separately from the similar pending Child

27 Health/Medical Office development north of the Site.

25. Petitioner has no plain, adequate and speedy remedy at law to redress the wrongs

28 described in this Petition. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused

their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such,
2 Respondents' certification of the 2021 SEIR and approval of the Project must be set aside and
3 rescinded, and the Court should enjoin Respondents from taking any further action with respect to
4 the Project until Respondents have complied with all requirements of CEQA.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Writ of Mandate - Violation CEQA - Failure to Implement Mitigation Measures)

7 26. The City hereby incorporates by this reference each and every allegation contained
8 in paragraphs 1 through 25 above.

9 •27. In approving the LRDP and certifying the 2007 EIR, the Regents adopted a MMRP
10 that required UCI to, among other things, monitor campus trips as student enrollment increased and
11 contribute its "fair share" of the cost of improvements to impacted intersections, once necessary.
12 The City is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges that UCI has failed to make required
13  "fair share" contributions under such measures, despite the fact that the requirement to make such
14 contributions has been triggered under the existing mitigation measures.

15 28. In failing to implement required mitigation measures, Respondents breached
16 mandatory duties, abused their discretion, and failed to act in the manner required by law, in
17 violation of CEQA. (See Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal. App.
18 4th 1491, 1508 [an agency may not "simply ignore" previously adopted mitigation measures].)

19 29. Petitioner has no plain, adequate and speedy remedy at law to redress Respondents'
20 failure to comply with the mitigation required by the 2007 MMRP.

21 30. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate
22 should issue directing Respondents to comply with the traffic mitigation measures set forth in the
23 2007 MMRP, including by making all required "fair share" payments for necessary traffic
24 improvements.

25 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Declaratory Relief)

28 in paragraphs 1 through 30 above.

I 32. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents, involving
2 substantial questions regarding Respondents' actions and approval of the Project and certification
3 of the 2021 SEIR. The controversy includes issues involving the proper interpretation and
4 application of state and local laws, as set forth above.

33. Petitioner contends that the Project is not exempt from local regulation, including,
6 but not limited to, the requirements of the City's General Plan and Zoning Code, and that UCI is
7 required to seek various approvals from the City, including a General Plan Amendment and CUP,
8 before it may proceed with the Project. Further, Petitioner contends that Respondents are required
9 to continue to implement the traffic mitigation measures imposed in connection with the certification
10 of the 2007 EIR in developing the Project. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
11 that Respondents dispute such contention, and intend to proceed with the Project without seeking
12 any such approvals from the City and without complying with some of the previously-imposed
13 mitigation measures, including traffic mitigation measures that require UCI to make "fair share"
14 contributions toward necessary traffic improvement projects. An actual controversy thus exists
15 between the City and Respondents involving substantial questions regarding Respondents'
16 implementation of the LRDP and approval of the Project. Accordingly, declaratory relief is
17 appropriate and necessary to resolve the controversy and determine the legality of Respondents'
18 actions.

19 34. To remedy Respondents' violations of law, Petitioner seeks a declaration that
20 Respondents' approval of the Project was invalid and contrary to law, including CEQA and the State
21 Planning and Zoning Law. Petitioner further seeks a judicial declaration that Respondents' Project
22 is subject to the City's General Plan, Zoning Code, and other pertinent land use regulations, and that
23 UCI is required to obtain City approvals, including a General Plan Amendment and a conditional
24 use permit before it can develop the Project.

26 implementing, or are threatening to begin development of the Project.

28 and actions described above and has exhausted all available administrative remedies. Therefore,

- PROOF OF SERVICE

2 (City of Irvine v. Regents of the University of California, OCSC Case No. 30-2021-01183322))
3 STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF ORANGE

4
I am employed by the law office of Rutan & Tucker, LLP in the County of Orange, State 5 of California. I am over the age of 18 and not a party to the within action. My business address is 18575 Jamboree Road, 9th Floor, Irvine, CA 92612. My electronic notification address is 6 kwilson@rutan.com.

8 On February 18, 2021, I served on the interested parties in said action the within:
NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL

Q as stated below:

10 California Attorney General

11 Office of the Attorney General 300 South Spring Street

12 Los Angeles, CA 90013-1230

13 X
14 (BY MAIL) by placing a true copy thereof in sealed envelope(s) addressed as shown above.

15 In the course of my employment with Rutan & Tucker, LLP, I have, through first-hand personal observation, become readily familiar with Rutan & Tucker, LLP's practice of collection 16 and processing correspondence for mailing with the United States Postal Service. Under that practice, I deposited such envelope(s) in an out-box for collection by other personnel of Rutan & 17 Tucker, LLP; and for ultimate posting and placement with the U.S. Postal Service on that same day in the ordinary course of business. If the customary business practices of Rutan & Tucker, 18 LLP with regard to collection and processing of correspondence and mailing were followed, and 1 am confident that they were, such envelope(s) were posted and placed in the United States mail at 19 Irvine, California, that same date. I am aware that on motion of party served, service is presumed invalid if postal cancellation date or postage meter date is more than one day after date of deposit 20 for mailing in affidavit.

21 Executed on February 18, 2021, at Irvine, California.

22

23 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
