INTRODUCTION

2 This Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive

3 Relief ("Petition") challenges the Alameda County Board of Supervisors ("County") approval of the
Aramis Solar Energy Generation and Storage Project to construct and operate a utility-scale solar
cnergy facility and battery energy storage system in the North Livermnore Valley (the "Project").

¡y Petitioners Save North Livermore Valley, Ohlone Audubon Society and Friends of Open Space and
Vineyards (collectively, "Petitioners") seek declaratory relief, a writ of mandate under California
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 directing Respondents Alameda County; Alameda County

1) Community Devolopment Agency Planning Department; and Alameda County Board of
10 Supervisors (collectively "Respondents") to vacate their approval of the Project. The Project
violates: 1) Measure D, a county-wide, voter-approved agricultute, opea space, and wildlife habitat
133  protection measure; 2) the Alameda County General Plan (*General Plan") and its East County
1.! Arca Plan ("ECAP"); 3) the Alameda County Code of Ordinances ("ACCO"); the California
14 Government Code; and 4) the California Environmentul Quality Act ("CEQA") and its Guidelines.

1 2. In its review and approval of the Project, the County prejudicially abused its discretion
165  under Measure D, the State of California Government Code, the County General Plan, including the
1' ECAP, and ACCO. The Project is substantially inconsistent with the Planning and Zoning Laws
it 11! because it attempts to take land that those Laws all limit to agriculture and ag-related accessory
19 uses, and open space and convert it into an industrial-scale solar energy facility connected to a

20 power substation and the state's electrical grid.

2 3. Respondents' environmental review and approval of the Project also violates CEQA and the
241 regulations implementing CEQA in title 14, California Code of Regulations, sections 15000 et seq.
2.1 (CEQA Guidelines), Respondents failed to disclose or adequately analyze the Project's significant
24. eavironmental impacts, as required under CEQA and failed to identify and adopt feasible and
2:1 enforceable mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or avoid such impacts. Respondents'

20i approval of the Project violates CEQA and must be overturned.
2" 4. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
24 As a result of Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of the EIR, Petitioners will

suffer great and irreparable harm to their interests, including the adverse environmental effects of
2 the Project. Petitioners have no adequate remedy for this irreparable harm.

} BACKGROUND

5. Twenty years ago, two ballot measures presented Alameda County voters with competing

; visions for the future of eastern Alameda County ("East County"), rural territory situated between
$ the City of Livermore, at the outer edge of the deusely developed Bay Area, and rapidly urbanizing

* sections of the Central Valley cast of Altamont Pass.

3 6. In the face of encroaching urban development, citizens led a petition drive to place Measure
4)  D on the ballot. Measure D intended to preserve East County's agricultural uses, open spaces and
10 the species that inhabited them, as well as its pastoral beauty of rolling hills and open plains. The
11 measure focused particular attention on the 13,500 acres of scenic North Livermore Valley, which
13 includes the scenic North Livermore Valley and its designated rural recrcational routes.
1: 7. Alternative Measure C, placed on the ballot by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors,
14 sought to allow East County to develop in a high-density fashion, as surrounding areas had.
1:5 Measure C would have maintained East County's then-existing zoning, including a mix of
145 industrial, and major commercial uses, and land with density of one or more units per acre.

1'r 8. The competing ballot measures reflected a regional tension, brewing since the mid-1980s,
1# that saw similar urban growth debates arise in nearby Dougherty Valley, Briones Valley and San

19 Ramon Valley, arnong others.
20 9. Voters understood from Measure D's explicit language that it redrew an East Alameda

2 County Urban Growth Boundary ("Urban Growth Boundary") to eliminate land for urban
2.1  development and commercial use and prescrve it for agriculture and open space. The measute
2:1 focused "urban-type development in and near existing cities where it will be efficiently served by
24 public facilities, thereby avoiding high costs to taxpayers and users as well as the environment."
2:i The measure also removed "County government from urban development outside the growth
2(i boundary." ECAP, p.78.
2'1 10. Measure D specifically removed North Livermore from the eligible growth area and
21l redesignated it for cultivated agriculture. Measure D ronamed this land as the North Livermore

Intensive Agricultural Area and stated that the area was designed to "permit and encourage
2 cultivated agriculture and to preclude urbanization in the North Livermore area without unduly
3 impairing the open and natural qualities...." Id.
4 11. On November 7, 2000, Alameda County voters overwhelmingly approved Measure D, with
U a vote of 56% in favor to 44% opposed. Competing Measure C lost by vote of 56% opposed to

6 44% in favor. Following Measure D's passage, a developer and landowner who controlled 2,700
7 acres in North Livermore unsuccessfully gued to overturn it.

8 12. To enact its vision, Measure D eliminated a County General Plan ("Gencral Plan") land use
9 designation allowing for urban development. More importantly, the measure modified the Large
10 Parcel Agriculture land use designation ("LPA") of the East County Area Plan (*ECAP") to
11 prohibit future industrial uses and to limit building density. The ECAP is a component of the
12 General Plan and its LPA land use designation covers the vast majority of East County land.
13 13. Measure D requires that, once approved, its provisions be changed only by a vote of the
14 electorate. In this vein, Measure D prohibits permitting new land uses under the LPA and other East
15 County land use designations absent a vote of the people. Solar clectric facilities ("SEFs") such at
16 the Project are not permitted within LPA designated Jands, or within any EÇAP land use
17  designation.. As a result, the Project and its SEF is a prohibited use within such land use
1B designations absent a prior vote of the people to allow such use.

19 14. In addition to its urban land use restrictions, Measure D added numerous findings and
2) | policies to the ECAP intended to protect agriculture, open space, wildlife habitats and the region's
21 | scenic beauty.
2:  15. In the face of unquestionable voter intent to protect East County's agriculture and natural
23 beauty, the Board of Supervisors approved the Aramis project, an SEF that would blanket 347 acres
2.1 of the LPA and North Livermore Valley with an industrial use. The County justified its decision
2:5 based on the unsupported position that SEFs are allowed in the entire LPA because they are similar
20i to windfarms and utility corridors and because two much smaller SEF projects were approved in far
2'r East County a decade ago. The Aramis project also includes land designated as Water Management
21 ("WM"), wherc SEFs have never been approved.

-
w 16. While the County's interpretation defies the voters' intent for Nosth Livermore, it has far
2 greater ramifications given the vast amount of acrenge covered by the LPA. The County's decision
3 effectively moans that SEFs may now cover nearly all of East County with golar panels.

GENTRAL ALLEGATIONS
The Proiect

/31. The Project is a proposed utility-scale solar photovoltaic energy generation facility with

6 unknown maximum energy output capacity and associated battery storage using photovoltaic panels
7 over a mostly contiguous 347 acres of privately-owned land in unincorporated Alameda County, in
8 the North Livermore area. The Project site consists of three parcels. The Project would serve Clean
9 Power San Francisco, East Bay Community Energy and/or PG&E customers by providing local

0 generation capacity under long-term contracts.
32. The Project site is in a rural agricultural area of Alameda County and is essentially
12 undeveloped land. It is currently used for oat hay cultivation and cattle grazing and has been grazed
13 by cattle for several decades. Land uses adjacent to the Project site include row crop cultivation.
14 The Project site is home to numerous wildlife species, including the California Tiger Salamander,
15 California Red-lcgged Frog, Western Pond Turtle, Golden Eagle, Burrowing Owl, San Joaquin Kit
16 Fox, Prairie Falcon, White-Tailed Kite and Notthern Harrier.
17 33. The ptiacipal components of the Project are: 1) a solar photovoltaic facility, consisting of
18 approximately 267,000 ground-mounted solar panels (although that number is subject to change); 2)
19 a 5,000 square-foot area substation; 3) a battery energy storage system, with a 5-acre portion of the
20 site designated to accommodate the storage system; 4) a 400 square-foot operations and
21 maintenance building; and 5) support facilities, including, but not limited to, underground and
22  overhead distribution lines, access and internal driveways, fencing, water storage tanks, and
23 stormwater detention basins; 6) a landscaping buffer around the perimeter of the Project; and 7) The
24 possibility that sheep will be present on the Project site for an indeterminate period each year.
25 34. Originally, IP Aramis LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power LLC ("Intersect") proposed a
20 410-acre development on land that included ECAP land use designations LPA, WM and Resource
21 Management (*RM"). However, a smaller project was approved by the East County Board of
21 Zoving Adjustments ("BZA") in the fort of the Resource Management Avoidance Altecuative,

? which would instead develop 385 acros of the Project site and avold land deslgnated as RM. The

3 BZA also imposed new conditions on the project, including that increasing setbacks. Intersect

4* estimated that the now sotback requirements reduced the Project by eight acres. Subsoquently, part

-yc of the proposed acreage, kuowa as the Stanley Ranch parcel, was also removed from the proposed

1j Project site when the Stanley Ranch property owner torminated lease negotiations with Intersect.
This further reduxed the Project site to a total of 347 acres for development. Intersect has
indicated whether the not

3 ou the Project site. acreage reductions will translate into a reduction in the numbor of solar panels

Profect and Environmental Revie
10 35. In. or about May 2018, Interseot submitted an application for a conditional use permit
1l ("CUP*) and a parcol map the Project on two of the orlginally four subject parcels. Planning Staff'
122 initial study determined that the Project could have potentially significant impacts on the
1:3 environment for which mitigation could not be assured to reduce those impacts to less than
1. signiflcant levels. Therefore, preparation of a Project-specific Environmental Impact Report (EIR)
1.3 pursuant to CEQA was required.
165 36. In or about February 2020, Intersect submitted a revised desoription for the Project which
17 included the other two parcels. In or about May 2020, the Project application was deemed
13 complete, and a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of the EIR was circulated for 30 days, between May
1) 6 and June 5,2020.

2) | 37.

21 The draft EIR was subsequently prepared and circulated for 45 days between September 18
and November 2, 2020.

23 38. On November 24, 2020, the East County Board of Zoning Adjustments ("BZA") held a
23 hearing to consider certification of the Final EIR and approval of the CUP. After deliberation on the
24 CUP and review of the Project's Final EIR, the BZA determined that the Final EIR
25 CEQA and certified the Final EIR. The BZA also approved the Project's CUP. complied with

25 39. On December 4, 2021, Petitioners filed an appeal of said BZA action to the Alameda County
21 Board of Supervisors on various grounds of non-conformance with Measure D; the General Plan;
23 zoning violations, CEQA, and related claims.

40. On March 4, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held a hearing n Petitioner's and two other
2 organizations appeals of the BZA action. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board of
U Supervisors concluded that the Project was consistent with Measure D, the General Plan, the ACCO
4 and the State of California Govemment Code and denied the appeals of its prior certification CUP
5 and EIR certification. As the BZA had done, the Board of Supervisors' CEQA approval included
6 CEQA finings a statement of overriding considerations, concluding that the Project's benefita
7 outweighed its significant and unavoidable environmental impacts.
o 41. Respondents' approval of the Project included the following: a resolution approving a
9 conditional use permit ("CUP") and certifying a final Environmental Tropact Report ("EIR*) and the
10 statement of overriding considerations.
11 The County's Renniremonts Under Mcasure D

12 42. Measure D restricts future uscs permitted within the EÇAP's LPA and WM laud use
13 designations the two designations iu which the Project proposes to locate - plainly stating that the

1-4 uses could not be "increased." ECAP, p. iil. Further, Measure D dictates that the Measure's
15 provisions enacted by ordinance, could only be changed by a "vote of the people of Alameda
15 County." ECAP, p. vii, 23. Under Mcasure D, the Board of Supervisors are precluded from adding
1'P new land uses withio the ECAP and from approving land use in conflict with Measure D. That is
13 reserved for General Plan amendments first approved by the voters of Alameda County. SEFs are
19 not a permitted land use in any ECAP land use designation, as amended by Measure D. As a result a
21) SEFs are a new land use and must first be approved by Alameda County voters.

2 43. Measure D Section 19(b) states as follows: "Exœept to the extent provided by State law, any
21!. provision of any existing or subsequently adopted area or specific plan which is not part of the
231 General Plan, and of any zoning regulation, or any other ordinance, resolution or policy of the
24 County of Alameda which is not patt of the General Plan is ineffective to the extent that provision is
24 inconsistent with this ordinance."

26i 44. Measure D Section 19(c) states as follows: Except as required by State law, no subdivision
2° map, development agreement, development plan, use permit, variance or any other discretionary
21:

administrative or quasi-administrative action which is inconsistent with this ordinance may be
2 granted, approved, or taken."
45. Mcasure: D Section 22(a) states as follows: "This ordinance does not affect existing parcels,
4 development, structures, and uses that are legal at the time it becomes effective. However,
structures may not be enlarged or altered and uses expauded or changed iuconsistent with this
6 ordimance, except as authorized by State law."
7 46. Measure D included the following four major components pertinent to the Petition as
8 follows: purposes, findings, policies, and ECAP land use designation amendments, which precluded
9 future industrial uses and high-density devclopments of the kind proposed by the Project. Measure
10 D's purposes, findings and policies are all intended to preserve and enhance agriculture and to
11 protect the natural qualitics, wildlife habitats and bcautiful open spaces of Alameda County from
12 development that is inconsistent with those goals. The measure establishes the Urban Growth
13 Bouodary which restricts urban-type development in cities and precludes such devclopment in rural
14 arcas. Particularly relevant to the Petition, Measure D specifically removed North Livermore from
15 the eligible growth area and redesignated it for cultivated agriculture. Measure D renamed this land
15 ag the North Livermore Intensive Agricultural Area and stated that the area was designed to "permit
17 and encourage cuitivated agriculture and to preclude urbanization in the North Livermore area
13 without unduly impairing the open and natural qualities...." ECAP,p.78.
12 47. Measure D Finding 2(1) states that the measure is designed to protect agricultural uses
21 defined as, "the use of land for the purposes of producing an agricultural commodity" (emphasis

2 added). Voters approved nine new policies as part of Measure D that relate to the Project and this
2. Petition. Six of the policies are mandatory, directing the County and other relevant parties to take
2.1 action. The relevant polices include, but are tot limited to the following: Policy 13, 78, 82, 108,
2. 115, 116, 155, 156, and 301.

24 48. Measure D amended general plan land use designations and removed others. Relevant to the
2t, project, Measure D removed the Urban Resorve designation, which had authorized the conversion
21 land within such designation to urban uses at any time.
28

49. As discussed below, pertinent to the Project, Measure D also amended the BCAP's LPA and
2 WM land use designations.
The County's Measure D Violations

1 50. The Project would locate an industrial nse in North Livermore, featuring approximately
1 267,000 ground-mounted solar panels that would blanket 347 acres and replace oat and hay

5 cultivation and cattle ranching. The Project would necesserily preclude cultivated agriculture at the
proposed Project site in North Livermore Valley for at least 50 years. The Project would harm the
area's natural qualitics, wildlife habitats and boautiful open spaces, the very resources Measure D is
intended to protect. Metal and glass solar panels and related infrastructure is not consistent with the

10 natural qualities of the area, which include open plans, rolling hills and numerous native species. As
11 demonstrated in the Project's BIR and letters from wildlife ageucies, the Project would significantly
12 harm the area's wildlife.

13 51. By approving the Project, the County took it upon itsolf to facilitate urban development
14 outside the Urban Growth Boundary established by Measure D. Similarly, the Project conflicts with
15 several of Measure D's findings and other provisions focused on protecting existing agricultural LISe
16 and preserving open lands.

17 52. The County violated Measure D Section 19(b) and 19(c) because the County approved a
18 resolution to approve the Project's CUP permit when the project that is inconsistent is with Measure
19 D.
:0 The Countv's Requirements Under the Goneral Plan

1!1 The ECAP

:12 53. May 5, 1994, the Board of Supervisors adopted the ECAP as a component of the General
13 Plan. In November 2000, the BCAP was sigolficantly modified by passage of Measure D. ECAP,
4 p. 3.

35 54. The goals and policies in the ECAP are intended to inform decision-makers, the general
26 public, public agencies and those doing business in the County of the County's position on Jand use-
27 rolated iasues and to provide guidance for day-to-day decision-making. Programa that follow the

28

policies identify a set of specific actions the County will undertake to achieve the goals and policies
2 of the plan. ECAP, p. 1.
3 55. The ECAP includes policies that are broadly aimed at preserving open space, agriculture,

4 ränge land and scenic beauty in eastern Alameda County and land designations that generally do the
5 same, including placing limits on. building Floor Area Ratios ("FARs").
56. The Project proposes to locate on 226 LPA acres and 21 MW acres. Neither the LPA nor the

7 WM lists industrial scale solar electric facilities ("SEFs") such as the Project and each include
FARS of.01. Yet, the County has approved the Project with a much larger FAR that .01,
concluding, without substantial evidence, that SEFs are similar to windfarms and utility corridors.
1:) In doing so, the County's Project has violated the ECAP as amended by Measure D.

1I 57. Measure D prohibits adding land uses without a vote of the electorate and Measure D
1:3 Section 22(a) does not allow uses to be cxpanded or changed inconsistent with this Measure D. By
1:3 allowing SEFs in the LPA and WM, where SEFs are not currently permitted without approval of the
1+ voters, the County is expanding uses inconsistent Measure D's prohibition on adding uses without a
1: vote and, the County's approval of the Project and its discretionary entitlements therefore violates
16 Measure D.

1' General Plan Scenic Route Element

11 58. The Scenic Route Element ("SRE") is a component of the General Plan. The SRE is
1! intended to serve as a guide for development of city and county legislation and programs that will

2(1 protect and enhance the scenic values along designated routes and in areas in the county visible

21 from scenic routes. SRE, p. vii.
21. 59. North Livermore Avenue and Manning Road, which run adjacent to the proposed Project
2: location, are two of just five Scenic Rural Recreational Routes ("SRRs") in the greater North
24 Livermore area, which according to the SRE, are major rural roads that traverse areas of outstanding
25 scenic quality or that carry traffic to major scenic and recreational areas.

2t 60. Scenic Corridors are one of three elements of the SRE. "Scenic corridors are arcas that

27 extend beyond the scenic route right-of-way…to which development contrals should be applied for
28 maintaining unobstructed distant views along the scenic route and providing a pleasant route of

travel…….Development controls should be applied to preserve and enhance scenic qualities, restrict
2 unsightly use of land, control height of structures, and provide site design and architectural
guidance along the entire scenic corridor." SRE, p. 4. North Livermore Valley, where the Project
4 proposes to locate, is Scenic Corridor. In Scenic Corridors, scenic views are to be conserved,
5 enhanced, and protected. SRE, p. 10.
6 61. Of eight General Plan Principles that apply to Scenic Route Corridors, two apply to this
7 Petition as follows: 1) Provide for normal uses of land and protect against uusightly features; and 2)
8 Use Landscaping to increase scenic qualities of scenic Route corridors. (emphasis added).
9 62. The County's Project approval violates Measure D Section 19(b) because the County's
10 resolution approving the Project inaccurately, and absent substantial evidence, states that
11 landscaping planted by the Project would shield or ameliorate views of the Project from North
12 Livermore Avenue and Manning Road. There is no evidence in the record that the Project's
13 landscaping will increase scenic qualities of scenic Route corridors. In fact, there is abundant
14  evidence to the contrary.

15 63. The Project's degradation of the Scenic Recreational Route is also inconsistent with
15 Measure D's findings, purposes, and policies, which seek to preserve the beautiful open spaces of
17 East County. As such, the County's approval of a CUP for the Project in a designated scenic
13 location is a violation of Measure D Section 19(c).

19 General Plan Open Space Element
21) 64. The Board of Supervisors adopted the General Plan Open Space Element ("OSE*) in 1973
2. and it was atuended in 1994 and 2000. The OSE identifies the Project site as "Agricultural Open
233 Space," a category of open space that is "designated for preservation." OSE, Part 1: Open Space
2;1 Policies, p.4. The OSE's Principles for Agricultural Open Space" mandate that [a]gricultural arcas
24 should be free of urban type development with dwellings permitted only for those persons involved
2 in agricultural production. Id. at 13.
20  65. The Project is inconsistent with the OSE because, if the Project is approved, the Project site
2" would no longer constitute open space and would not be preserved. In contrast, the Project site, a
21 scenic valley, would be flooded with an industrial-scale solar project, a patently industrial use.

1 The County's Requirements Under the Alameda County Code of Ordinances, Title 17-
2 Zoning

3 66. The Project proposes to locate entirely on land designated in ACCO Title 17 as "A" (for

5 Agricultural) zoning. According to ACCO § 17.06.010, the purpose of the A zoning "to promote
implementation of general plan land use proposals for agricultural and other nonurban uses, to
6 conserve and protect existing agricultural uses, and to provide space for and encourage such uses in
7 places whore more intensive development is not desirable or necessary for the geueral welfare."

DO 67. ACCO §§ 17.06.030, 17.06.035 and 17.06.040 set forth the permitted and conditionally
I permitted uses authorized within the A zoning district. SEFs are neither permitted nor conditionally
10 permitted uges in the A zoning district.

11 68. ACCO § 17.54.130 requires that a conditional use to be approved only if the County makes
12 four findings in support of issuing a CUP. ACÇO § 17.06.040 lists the conditionally permitted uses
13 that shall be permitted in an A district only if approved by the Board of Zoning Adjustments.
14 ACCO § 17.06.040 does not list SEFs.

15

16 69. The County's ACCO Title 17 Violations
The Project violates ACCO Title 17 because the Project's industrial use would replace 347
17 acres of existing oat and hay cultivation and cattle ranching as is not a permitted or conditionally
18 permitted use. The Project's industrial use would not promote agricultural and other nonurban uses,
19 but instead, eliminate existing agricultural uses, and place "intensive development" where it is not
20 "desirable or necessary for the general welfare." In an effort to distract attention away from the
21 Project's inconsistency with applicable zoning requirements, the Project proposes minimal sheep
22  grazing for landscape maintenance and other minor accessory "agricultural" activities in a ham-
23 fisted attempt to style the Project's industrial use as an apricultural use. But thesc "agricultural"
24 activitics are merely a "fig leaß' that fail to qualify the SEF as a bonafide agricultural use or a use
25 that legitimately supports agriculture.

25 70. The County also attempts to justify its approval of the industrial Project on A zoned land by
27 reference to the County's previous illegal approval of two SEFs on A zoued land. The
23 undorpinnings of the County's previous approvals of the two much smaller SEFs in far East

1 County's non-scenic Mountain House, was ACCO § 17.54.050 and 17.54.060.' Specifically, the
2 County points to the prior project determinations made under 5517.54.050 and 17.54.060 as
3 precedent for locating the Project in a zoning designation that neither permits nor conditionally
permits SEFs. The County's "prior precedent" justification, however, has no basis in law and
5 amounts to district wide rezoning that violates the exclusive zoning procedures set forth in the

6 Planning and Zoning Law, Gov. Code § 65800 et seq.
7 71. Even if SEFs were an A district conditionally permitted use listed in ACCO § 17.06.040, the
3 County could not approve the Project without first satisfying the finding requirements of ACCO !
17.54.130. The County's CUP approval for the Project purports to make the required findings, but
1) they are not adequately supported by substantial evidence in the record.

11 The County's Obligations Under CUOA

12 Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts
13 72. CEQA's primary purposes are to: "inform governmeutal decisionmakers and the public of a
1• project's potential significant environmental effects before a project is approved and those effects
1: become irreversible, identify ways that environmeutal damage can be mitigated by requiring the
11 adoption of feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures and disclose to the public a
11 governmental agency's reasous for approving a project with significant environmental impacts."
111 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a). To achieve these goals, CEQA requires an Environmental

19 Impact Report (EIR) for any project that may have a significant effect on the environment. The
20 California Supretne Court described the EIR as the "heart of CEQA" and an "environmental "alarm

21 bell' whose purpose it is to alert the publio and its responsible officials to environmental changes
2. before they have reached ccological points of no return." (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V.
2: Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 392.)
24 73. The public agency's charge in preparing an EIR is to make a reasonable, good-faith effort to
25  disclose all that it reasonably can about the project's significant enviroumental effects. Pub

2€6

27

28 Neither of these prior SEF were ever built.

Resources Code § 21061; CEQA Guidelines § 15121, subd, (a). The purpose of an EIR is "not to

LAS generate paper, but to compel government at all levels to make decisions with environmental
consequences in mind." CEQA Guidelines, § 15003, subd. (g). Therefore, "giveu the key role of
the [EIR] in carrying out CEQA's requirements, "the integrity of the process is dependent on the
adequacy of the EIR. (California Native Plant Society v. City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177 Cal. App.
5 4th 957, 977-980.)
7 74. CEQA requires an EIR to identify and analyze a project's significant environmental impacts,
3 including those impacts caused or exacerbated by "bringing development and people into the areas
2 affected." Pub. Resources Code § 21002, 21002.1 subd. (a); CEQA Guidelines §15126.2, subd.
1:) (a).
ll 75. CEQA requires the EIR to determine whether the project's incremental environmental
12 effects, combined with the effects of other projects, is cumulatively considerable. CEQA
13 Guidelines 15130(a). This requires an assessment of the project's incremental effects "viewed in
14 connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of
5 probable future projects.' CEQA Guidelines 8 15965(a)(3). Without such analysis, the pieccmeal
15 approval of several projects with related impacts could lead to severe harm, even though a single
17 project's impacts are individually limited. CEQA Guidelines § 15355(b).

13

19 76. Need for Accurate Project Deseription
The EIR must include an accurate, stable, and consistent description of the proposed project.
2) The project description must contain sufficient specific information about the project to allow a

21 complete evaluation and review of its environmental impacts. 14 Cal Code Regs § 15124. A "finite
23 description is indispensable to an informative, legally adequate EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los
23 Angeles (1977) 71 CA3d 185, 192, 199.

21

25 77. Need to Identify Project Alternatives
One of CEQA's fundamental directives is that lead agencies implement feasible alternatives
215  to reduce a project's significant environmental impacts. Pub. Resource Code § 21002. 30 As
27 recognized by the California Supreme Court, an adequate discussion of project alternatives is "the
23 core of the EIR." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 564.

I The CEQA Guidelines therefore require an EIR to describe a reasonable range of alternatives to the
2 project or its location that would feasibly attain tost of the project's objectives but would avoid or
3 substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6 (a).

4 Need for Adequate Mitigation Measures

1 78. CEQA requires that all measures undertaken to reduce a project's significant environmental
effects be enforccable. Pub. Resource Code § 221081; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4 (a)(2). This
7 requirement is designed to ensure that mitigation will be implemented as a condition of
3 devclopment, and not merely adopted and then peglected or disregarded. Federation of Hillside v.

Vi Canyon Ass'ns V. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal. App. 4th 1252, 12561. Moreover, the
1: formulation of mitigation measures shall not be deferred until some future time. CEQA Guidelines
11 § 15126.4 (a)(1)(b). Thus, mitigations measures adopted pursuant to an EIR to mitigate or avoid a
1:2  project's significant impacts on the environment must be "fully enforceable through permit
1.3 conditions, agreements, or other measures." (Pub. Resource Does, § 21081.6, subd. (b).)
14 79. The agency's act or decision must be supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole
19 record. Pub. Resources Code §5 168, 21168.5; CEQA Guidelines, § 15384. "Substantial
16j evidence" is defined as releyant, reasonable information and inferences that a fair argument can be
1' made to support a conclusion, including facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and
11 expert opinion supported by facts. CEQA Guidelines, § 15384.
19 Need for Adequate Informational Disclosures
201 80. "'When the informational requirements of CEQA are not met but the agency nevertheless

21 certifies the EIR as meeting them, the agency fails to proceed in a manner required by law and
2i abuses its discretion." Cherry Valley Pass Acres and Neighbors v. City of Beaumont (2010) 190
2: Cal. Appr. 4th 316, 327.) "The error is prejudicial 'if the failure to include relevant information
2L precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby thwarting the
25 statutory goals of the EIR process.' (Id. ,at p. 328, quoting San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue
2€ Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal. App. 4th 713, 721-722.)
27 The County's Violations of CEQA
28 Failure to Analyze Project Impacts

a. The EIR's Determination that the Project is consistent with Measure D, the
2 EÇAP, General Plan Scenic Route Element and ACCO Title 17 is not supported
3 by gubstaatial evidence.

4 81. EIR Land Use Impact LUP-1 examines whether the Project would conflict with a land use
5 plan, policy, or regulation which would result in a significant land use and planning impact.

15 However, the EIR does not analyze the Project's consistency with Measure D, which is a land use
• or plan, policy or regulation applicable to the Project. Measure D Sections 19 makes it clcar that

C County resolutions and use permits must be consistent with Measure D. But, in response to

1) comments noting the EIR's failure to examinc the Project's consistency with Measure D, the EIR
11) states that there "there is not an independent consistency requirement for Measure D."' EIR
l. Response to Comments, p.109. Measure D includes numerous purposes, findings and policies,
17 which the EIR never attempted to address. The EIR thus fails as informational document.

13 82. The EIR lists numnerous ECAP policies that apply to the Land Use, Agriculture and Forestry
14. Resources elements of the Project, but the EIR's analysis of the Project's consistency with auy of
19 these policies lacks substantial evidence. The EIR merely claims that the Project is not required to
16i| be consistent with all policics and does not distinguish between those policies that are mandatory
1 and those that are not.

18  83. SEFs are not listed as a permitted uses under the LPA ECAP land use designation. The
15 EIR's conclusion that the Project is consistent with the LPA, is inaccurate and not supported by

20 substantial evideuce. The EIR simply concludes, without any evidentiary support, that solar
21 development is comparable to other uses specifically allowed in the LPA, including windfarms,
22 utility corridors, and similar uses compatible with agriculture. The EIR attempts to fill this

23 evidentiary void by stating that in two prior instances, the County approved SEFs within the LPA.
24 This purported precedent is not evidence. In addition, internal emails from the County staff person
25 who drafted and edited the EIR's land use section - whuch includes a discussion of the Project's
26 consistency with the LPA - clearly shows he did not believe the Project was consistent with the
27 ECAP, or agriculture in general. The emails also show the staffer told other staff, including the
28 Planning Director, that the EIR should not have concluded SEFs are comparable to windfarms and

2 utility corridors because the uses are not the same in terms of land coverage, environmental impacts
and effects on agriculture.
3 84. SEFs are not listed land uses in the WM ECAP land use designation. The County's claim
A that the Project is consistent with the WM land

N substantial evidence. The Alameda County use designation is inaccurate and not supported by
Development Agency previously noted in the Notice of
6 Preparation ("NOP*) for the Project that the WM designation was not meant for large scale solar
7 facilitics. Several staff emails support the NOP statement that solar facilities are not allowed in the
CA WM designation, fatally undermining the EIR's contrary conclusion.
) 85. The EIR justifies its conclusion that the Projeot is consistent with the WM land use
1) designation on the basis of a "hydrology" study purportedly indicating that in a 100-year storm the
1t floodwater depths across the project area would be less than two feet and that the Projeot would be
1:2 set back 100 fect from the top of Cayetano Creck. However, neither Measure D nor the ECAP's
1.3 policies and development standards applicable to the WM land uge designation make any
1- exceptions that would authorize otherwise prohibited land uses on the basis that the proposed use
133 would be set back 100 feet from the top of the banks of the Cayetano Creek or would otherwise
16 avoid FEMA-designated floodways and the so-called modeled 100-year flood inundation area.

1'r 86. The Gencral Plan's SRE desiguates two roads adjacent to the Project as Scenic Rural
11 Recreational Routes, and the a Project is located in a Scenic Corridor. Among SRE principles
10 intended to protect the arca's scenic beauty are 1) Provide for normal uses of land; and 2) Use
201 landscaping to increase scenic qualities. The EIR concludes that the Project is consistent with the

21

22 SRE despite the fact that SEFs are not normal uses of land in North Livermore Valley and the
Project's will degrade the area's scenic beauty, as acknowledged in the EIR, which finds the
2: Project's impacts on the aesthetics of the area to be significant and unavoidable. The EIR rests its
24 consistency conclusion mostly on a landscaping plan that is intended to shield the SEF, but
25 admittedly will not mature for five years. If the landscaping does mature, it is expected to generally
2€ be about 15 feet high in many areas, which would completely block the views of the scenic North
2? Livermore Valley. The EIR's conclusion that the Project is consistent with the SRE is not supported
28 by substantial evidence. In fact, Alameda County Planning Department internal staff emails show

1 that staff members did not believe that the Project was consistent with the SRE before the EIR was

2 issued fatally undermining the EIR's contrary conclusion.
3 87. The OSE identifies the Project site as "Agricultural Open Space,' a category of open space
4  that is "designated for preservetion." OSE, Part 1: Open Space Policies, p.4. The OSE's Principles
5 for Agricultural Open Space" mandate that [a]gricultural areas should be free of urban type
6 development with dwellings permitted only for those persons involved in agricultural production.
7 The Project is inconsistent with the OSE, which the EIR failed to analyze entiroly.
8 88. SEFS are neither permitted nor conditionally-permitted uses listed in the A zoning. The EIR

9 states that the Project is consistent with the A zoning, but does not provide substantial evidence for
10 that conclusion. Instead, the County states that it has approved two previous solar projects and
11 | tacorrectly concludes that may rely on its own precedent with respect to prior detorminations of
12 zoning consistendy in interpreting its Zoning Ordinance, which justification has no basis in law. In
1.3 short, many of the EIR's determinations under Impact LUP-1 Jack evidentiaty support and are
1 contrary to applicable law.
1:i b. The EIR's Cumulative Impacts Analysis is Fatally Flawed.
Iti 89. The EIR's cumulative assessment completely ignotes the potential for significant utility-
11  scale solar development on LPA and WM-designated lands within any portion of the ECAP other
18  than the Project site. Despite concluding that SEF and similar facilities are authorized on all LPA
15| and WM designated land, all A zoned land, the EtR nevertheless completely fails to asses the
2€ potential for significant industrial development on such lands. As a result, the EIR's cumulative
21 impact analysis significantly understates the full exteut of potential adverse effects of projected
22 cumulative developmont.
23  90. The geographic scope of the oumulative biological impacts also results in a project list that
24 is artificially narrow. The list should not be limited to areas surrounding the proposed Project site.
25 The scope is based on an arbitrary designation and not based on biological and ecological
26 boundaries. The analysis also only gives passing attention to two other projects and fails to assess
27 the significance of the Project's biological impacts in combination with similar impacts of other
28 cumulative projects. The geographic scope of the EIR's cumulative analysis is not sufficient and is

not even discussed in a manner reasonably calculated to inform the public of the Project's potential
2 cumulative effocts in violation of CEQA. Moreover, the EIR's cumulative impact analysis
3 improperly failed to take into account the incremental effects of other projects being approved by
4 the City of Livermore and thus violates CEQA.

5 C. The EIR fails to analyze whether the Project will have a sufficient water supply.
6 191, The EIR's conclusion that the Project would have a sufficient water supply is primarily
7 based on Zonc 7's 2015 Urban Water Management Plan ("UWMP"). The UWMP only considers
B  the availability of water through 2035 even though the Project has an assumed 50-year life. The
1) EIR speculates that pumping banked groundwater and implementing unidentified conservation
10 measures will provide sufficient water supply, but speculation is not substantial evidence. The EIR
11 also claims that water demand will be lower than existing conditions without supporting evidence,
12 The EIR's speculation about future availability of banked groundwater, unspecified conservation
11 mcasures, and lower future needs is not substantial evidence that a sufficient supply will be
11 available over the lifetime of the Project. The EIR also fails to account for the water demand of all
1.5 landscaping required by the Project's conditions of approval, further understating the Project's
lü potential adverse impacts on water supplies.

1'r d. The EIR fails to explain how the Project compliance with the thresholds of

10 significance means that the Project impacts arc less than significant.
19 92. CEQA Guideline 15064(b)(2) requires that when using a threshold [of significance], the lead
201 agency should briefly explain how compliance with the threshold means that the project's impacts

21 are less than significant. The EIR fails to satisfy this requtrement for every impact category
22  analyzed in the EIR. The EIR relies on thresholds of significance, and purportedly determincs

23 whether the Project will comply with those thresholds, but the EIR never explains why compliance
24 with each such threshold means that the Project's related impacts will be less than significant. To
25 comply with the requirexents of CEQA Guideline 15064(b)(2), each chapter of the DEIR must be
26 revised to briefly explain, for cach threshold and on the basis of substantial cvidence, why Project
27 compliance with such threshold means that the Project's related impacts will be less than
28 significant.

e,

2 93.

4 The EIR fails to analyze the Project's adverse impacts on groundwater.
The EIR fails to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts on the May School Groundwater

n Basin drinking well water over the expected 50-year life of the Project. The May School
4 Groundwater Basin is already on a list of concern by both the County and its Zone 7 Water District.
The EIR underestimates the amount of water involved in

7 cleaning the solar panels as well as the
6 health risks of the chemicals that will contaminate the groundwater.

3 94. f. The EIR violates CEQA because it is misleading.
Where an EIR's discussion of an envitonmental impact is misleading or inaccurale, it fails to
9 meet CEQA's informational requirements. Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of
1D Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal. App. 4th 1184, 1217. The EIR's analysis and discussion of the Project

11

12 and the context in which it would occur ate misleading and prejudicial to informed decision-making
and informed public participation in the environmental review procesa. Examples include but are
13 not limited to the EIR's conflicting claims about the Project components, conflicting claims about
14 Project's nced and plans for landscaping irrigation; its listing of project objectives many of which

15 have been rendered unattainable given the Project's acrcage reduction - including megawatt
14 production - and claims that unenforccable plans will address concerns, ranging fromta the
1'7 elimination of agricultural uses and harm to species, to wildfire risks and ad verse aesthetic impacts.
14 Eailure to Analyze Significant Environmental Effects

19 &.

21

2j 95. The EIR violates CEQA regarding its failure to analyze the Project's impact on
biological resources.
The EIR failed to adequately investigate the potential for State and/or Fedcrally listed
22 species, including, but not limited to, birds, turtles, foxes, and badgers. As an example, the EIR.
2: failed to identify California red-legged frog (CRLF) and California Tiger Salamander (CTS) on the
24 Projcct site and failed to adequately analyze the Project's potential impact on such species, thus
24 fatally undermining the EIR's value as an informational document. The EIR's CRLF impact
2€  determinations are deficient and inadequatc in assessing the potential for CRLF and CTS to ocour

27 on the site, and not supported by substantial evidence, resulting in a significant underestimation of
28  the quality of the habitat and distribution for both species. In addition, the EIR failed to adequately

assess potential impacts on CTS, relying on results derived from survey protocol methods
2 conducted for the CRLF, even though the habitat use for the two species is very different. Indeed,

4 3 the CRLF survey protocols used in this instance were inadequate to assess CRLF impacts, much

U less CTS impacts. The same inadequatc environmental analysis pertains to all the East

7

0O 100. Alameda County Conservation Survey focal species, including golden eagles, burrowing owls
6 and other raptors that are regularly seen on the Project site.
b. The EIR fails to adequately assess numerous other potential adverse impacts of the
Project, including, but not limited to, adverse impacts on plants and vegetation communities,
) aesthetics, wildfires and other hazards, loss of agricultural lands, and cultural resources.
d 1l Eailure to Impose Adequate Mitigation Mcagures

a.

12

13 The EIR relies on the Project's implementation of several plans to

14 96. reduce or avoid environmental effects, but such plams are either unenforceable
or constitute improperly deferred mitigation (or both).
To attempt to reduce various potential adverse environmental effects of the Project, the EIR
1: relies on the Project's implementation of various plans to be developed at a future date, Such plans
1t include but are not limited to the following: agriculture management plan, grading plan, building
1" plan, hazardous material spill prevention plan, avian monitoring plan. These plans are not included
18 in the EIR. To the extent they may be mentioned in the mitigation measures, they are not described
19 in any meaningful detail or pursuant to any performance standards which must be met. In
201 cases, the plans are not even mentioned in the mitigation measures or conditions of approval and arc many

22 21 therefore wholly unenforceable, in violation of CEQA Guidelines. Where such plans are mentioned
in the mitigation measures, such measures lack adequate performance standards and/or fail to
21 describe feasible means to achieve such standards.

24

25

26 | 97. a. The EIR fails to adequately assess and mitigate the Projcct's potential impacts
related to on-site oil and gas wells and their abandonment.
The EIR fuils to adequately investigate the current environmental condition of the Project
27 site in the vicinity of oil and gas wells, fails to adequately discuss who owns an on-site well and
28 who kas legal authority to undertake formal well abandonment, and fails to adequately assess

environmental impacts associated with well abandonment. The EJR also fails to impose any
2 mitigation regarding the ongoing, long-term monitoring of the well or possible leaks, and for the

3 management and remodiation of any leaks that may occur, despite the County's duty to adequately

4 assess and mitigate the Project's potential hazardous conditions.

5 b. The EIR fails to adequately identify and mitigate the Project's potential impacts

6 on biological resources.
+5 98. The EIR fails to identify and require adequate mitigation to reduce or avoid the Project's
8 potential impacts on CTS and CRLF, numerous bird species, and other biological resources. In onc

) example, the EIR. fails to require any compensatory mitigation for CTS and CRLF despite
1) substantial evidence of the Project's potential impacts on such species. None of the CTS and CRLF
1l mitigation measures that the EIR does identify are effective in reducing the potential for take of
12 thesc specieg. The administrative record is clcar that injury aud/or mortality of CTS an CRLF are
13 virtually certain consequences of Project implementation.
1•4 99. The EIR also lack substantial evidence demonstrating that the identified mitigation for
1:5 biological impacts will reduce the Project's related impacts to a less than significant level.
1ö Failure to Identify Profect Alternatives

1'1 100. CEQA requires an environmental impact report to describe a range of reasonable
11 alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, would feasibly attain most of the basic
19 project objectives of the project but would avoid or gubstantially lessen any of the significant effects
20  of the project. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a). In addition, if the mandatory "No Project"

2 alternative is the environmentally superlor alternative, then the environmental impact report must
21 identify an "environmentally superior" alternative among the other alternatives. CEQA Guidelines f
2: 15126.6(e)(2).

24. 101. The Project's Draft EIR explains that the Project will have significant effects related to
25; aesthctic impacts regulting from the Project's adverse effects on scenic resources and land use
26 impacts related to the Project's inconsistency with the Gencral Plan as amended by Measure D.
2° 102. Comments on the Draft EIR explained that CEQA requires the EIR to identify mitigation
2{ requiring the Project to obtain a General Plan amendment in order to avoid or substantially lessen

the Project's significant land use impacts. However, in rejecting such comraents, the Final EIR
2 asserts that the Project's General Plan inconsistency does not constitute an significant effect of the
U Project and, therefore, the proposed mitigation is not required.
4 103. The EIR further explains that none of the Project alternatives analyzed in the EIR would

L avoid or substantially lessen any of the Project's significant acsthetic impacts.
O 104. Since none of the alternatives to the Project analyzed in the EIR would avoid or substantially
A lessen any of the Project's significant aesthetic impacts, and since, in the County's view, the
U Project's General Plan inconsistency does not constitute a significant effect of the Project, it
P necessarily follows that the EIR fails to describe a range of reasonable alternatives that would avoid
1) or substantially lessen any of the signifioant effects of the Project in violation of CEQA. For this

1 same reason, the EIR's determination that the "Reduced Footprint Alternative" is the
12 environmentally superior alternative is not supported by substantial evidence, as it would not avoid
1.3 or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the Project to a greater extent than any other
14 alternative analyzed in the EIR, excluding the mandatory "No Project" alternative
13 136. Morcover, ag explained in public comments, the EIR fails to adequately substantiate its
11 assertion that the alternatives analyzed in the EIR would feasibly attain most of the Project
1" objectives, and fails to adequately substantiate its rejection of an offsite distributed generation
18 alternative, in violation of subsections (a) and (c) of CEQA Guidelincs § 15126.6.
14 Cailure To Provide Proper Project Description

2(1 a. The EIR's project description violates CEQA because it is not stable and finite.

21 105. An EIR's analysis of environmental impacts is based on the project description.

22 Accordingly, an "aocurate, stable, and finite project description is the sine qua non of an
22 informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. Ciy of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App.
24 3d 185,193. It has long been settled that a stable and finite project description "is indispensable to
25 an informative, legally adequate EIR.". Id, at p. 192. The EIR fails this basic requirement.

26 106. For the following reasons and others, the Project description is insufficient: The project
27 described in the EIR is not even the same project that the BZA approved on November 24, 2020.
28 Since the publication of the Draft EIR, the project site acreage has been reduced by 73 acres and it

is unclear how much of the reduced acreage affects the project's "development area," The shifting
2 developmental footprint of the Project makes it difficult for the public to understand the full extent
3 of the Project's potential adverse environmental effects.
4 107. The EIR also fails to provide a stable and finite description of the Project's site design. The
5 EIR admits the final site design, including the type and number of solar panels that will be
O constructed, is "subject to change." But, sincc a greater number, or denser spacing of, solar panels
7 and other features of the site design are "subject to change," County decision-makers and the public
ß have insufficient information to "ascertain the project's environmentally significant effects, assess
9 ways of mitigating them, and consider project a)ternatives." Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008)
1) 163 Cal. App. 4th 523, 533.
11 108. The Project design, including the number of panels and overhead wires is "subject to
12 change." The EIR. states that the project will include approximately 267,000 solar panels but does

13 not commit to a number. One virtually certain consequence is that the Project site will be more
1.4 densely packed with solar panels given the reduction in acrcage from 410 to 347 acres.
1. 109. The Project's megawatt production is also uncertain. The EIR states that the Project will
16 | produce 100 megawatts of power, but Intersect has stated on the record that the Project's acrenge
17 reduction will make it impossible for the Project to generate 100 megawatts.

1# The Projsct Added Numerous New Components After the BZA Approval of the

19 Proiect That Were Never Disclosed or Analyzed In the EIR

20 110. In addition to the project description failures listed above, numerous significant Project

2 changes were made after the EBZA Project approval and EIR certification. In summary form, those
24 included the following:
2: The removal of the Stanlcy Ranch 38 acres
24. The addition of "agricultural" landscaping and related irrigation needs

25 Up to 5,000 chickens grazing on the Project site
2t "Tractors" on the Project site
21 An approximately one-acre "bee yard" or apiary
28 Possible honey production and an associated commercial operation

P Possible egg production and an associated commercial operation
2 Possible garlic production and an associated commercial operation
3 Possible lamb and wool production and an associated commercial operation
4 The presence of the general public on the Project site
Additional landscaping
6 111. The Board of Supervisors hearing was the first time that the public or the Board of
7 Supervisors beard of these new Project features that apparently are part of an Agricultural
Management Plan, which was never made available for public review and both County staff and
9 decision makers admitted to having not read before the Project was approved. Many of the new
10 Project features may cause adverse environmental impacts that were not analyzed in the EIR. All of
11 the new Project leatures that followed the BZA's EIR certification, including the many announced

12 on March 4, should have been inoluded in a revised project description that should have been
13 recirculated for review by public, which was deprived of the opportunity to review and consider the
14 full scope of the Project's potential adverse environmental impacts. This information should bave
15 been included in the EIR and the EIR should have been recirculated for additional public review

15 and comment.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Writ of Mandate, Code of Civ. Proc. § 1094.5 - Violation of Measure D

1) 112. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 111 of this Petition, as though
20 fully set fotth herein.

2! 113. The County's approval, following a noticed public hearing at which evidence was taken, of
22 the Resolution No. R-2021-91(*the Resolution"), which certifies the EIR and approves the CUP for

23 the Project, violates Measure D Section 19(b). This Measute provides that any County resolution is
24 ineffective to the extent that it is inconsistent with Measure D. The County's approval of the
25 Project's CUP - Use Permit PLN2018-0017 - violates Measure D Section 19(c), which states that

215 110 use permit, which is inconsistent with Measure D, may be granted or approved.
27 114. The Resolution is inconsistent with Measure D because it certifies an EIR and approves
2it use permit for an industrial SEF that is inconsistent with Measure D's purposed, findings, policies

1 and amendments to the BCAP, the collective goal of which is to proserve and protect the
2 agricultural uses, open spaces, wildlife habitats and sconie beauty of Hast County, and prioritize
3 cultivated agriculture in North Livermore. The CUP is inconslstent with Measure D for similar

4 roasons.

5 115. The County's approval of the Resolution violates Measure D Section 22(a), which states that
6 uses may not be expanded or changed inconsistent with this Measure D. The Project would add a
7 new uge, SEFs, to BCAP land use designations LPA and WM, which wero amended by Measure D.
8 Mcasure D plainly states that the LPA and WM uses may not be increased.
9 116. The County's approval of the Resolution and CUP violates Measure D Sections 19(b) and
10| 19(¢) because the County's approval of the Resolution and CUP would allow the Project to locate in
11 designated Scemic Corridor and adjacent to a Scenic Rural Recreational Route even though the
12 Project admits that it would degrade the aesthetics of the arca. In addition, The Project has put forth
13 a landscaping plan that would block Scenic Corridor. As such, the Resolution is inconsistent with
14 Measure D's goals to protect the beautiful open spaces of East County from badly located
15 development.
16 117. By approving a Project that is directly in conflict with Measure D, the County has
17 prejudicially abused its discretion,

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Writ of Mandute, Code of Civ. Froc. $ 1094.5 - Violation of Alameda County Code of
20 Ordinances Title 17

21 118. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 117 of this Petition as though fully
22 sot forth herein.

23 119. The County's approval of the Project following a noticed public heaxing violates ACCO
24 Title 17 because the Project's industrial use, an SEF, would replace 347 acres of existing oat and
25 hay cultivation and cattle ranching and SEFs are not a permitted or conditionally permitted use in
26 the applicable zoning district. The Project's industrial uge would not promote agricultural and other
27 nonurban uses, but instead, would eliminate cxisting agricultural uses, and place "intensive
28 development" where it is not "desirable or necessary for the general welfare."

1 120. The County's approval of the Project also violates ACCO Title 17 because the County's
2 CUP approval rests on findlogs that are not adequately supported by substantial evidence in the
3 record.

4 121. By approving a Project that is directly in conflict with, and not authorized under, ACCO

5 Title 17, including but not limited to its Chapters 17.06.010, 17.06.030, 17.06.035 17.06.040 and
6 17.54.130 the County has prejudicially abused its discretion.

1
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside Proiect Approvals as Contrary to the Planning

10 and Zoning Law, the County General Plam, the ECAP, the ACCO Measure D, ans CEQA

122.
11 Petitioners incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 121 of this Petition as though fully
set forth herein.
12
123.
13 An actual and present controversy has arisen and exists, ou the one hand between Petitioners

14 and all similarly situated persons desiring to live, work and visit the North Livermore Valley, and

15 all persons intercsted in the full and fair enforcement of the Planning and Zoning Law, the General

16 Plan, the ECAP, the ACCO, Measure D, and CEQA, and, on the other hand, the County, the Board

17 of Supervisors and Real Party, concerning the County's public duty to ensure consistency of

18 discretionary devclopment entitlements with the Planning and Zoning Law, the General Plan, the
ECAP, the ACCO, Measure D, and CEQA.
19

2) 124. Petitioners contend that Respondents proceeded in excess of their jurisdiction and abused

21 their discretion in approving the Project because such approval violates applicable law in the

22 following respects, among others:

8.
23 The Project's discretionary approvals were not granted in accordance with the

24 requirements of applicable law;

25 b. The Projeot's discretionary approvals arc not based on adequately substantiated

2% findings required by law; and

27 C. The Project's discretionary approvals are not based on, ot are contrary to, or

23 arc unsupported by the evidence in the record before Respondents.

T1 125. Petitioner further contends that, in approving the Project and its discretionary approvals,
2 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law in the following respects, among
3 others:

A a. Respondents violated Measure D;
5 b. Respondents violated the County's General Plan and its ECAP;
6 c. Respondents violated the ACCO; and

7 d. Respondents violated CEQA, all as alleged herein.
3 126. Petitioner further contends that Respondents' actions in approving the Project and its
discretionary approvals without complying with applicable law exceeded Respondents' jurisdiction
1:) and constitute prejudicial abuses of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

1l 127. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the County, the Board of
1:3 Supervisors and Real Parties contend to the contrary.
1; 128. A judicial determination and declaration of the public rights and duties of the parties is
14 therefore necessary and appropriate, as sought in the prayer of this pleading.
1: 129. "An action for declaratory relief lies when the parties are in fundamental disagreement over
14 the construction of particular legislation, or they dispute whether a public entity has engaged in
1" conduct or established policies in violation of applicable law. [Citation." City of Cotati v. Cashman
18 (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 79; sec Squire v. City and County of San Francisco (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d
19 974, 976, 979.

2: 130. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 129 of this Petition as though fully
24 set forth herein.

25 131. CEQA mandates that a public agency considering the approval of a project that may have a
2€ significant effect on the environment prepare an EIR that identifies and adequately analyzes and
27 mitigates all potentially significant adverse etfects of the project, including reasonably foresceable

2.8

direct, indirect and cumulative impacts from all phases of the project. (Pub. Resources Code. §
2 21100; CEQA Guidelines, $5 15126, 15126.2.).
132. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately analyze and
mitigate the full scope of the Project's potential significant environmental effects, as follows:
5 133. The EIR's determination that the Project is consistent with the General Plan, is the ECAP and
the ACCO Zoning Code is not supported by substantial evidence.
7  134. The EIR's Cumulative Impacts is Analysis is fatally flawed because it failed to adequately

B assess whether the Project's incremental effects, in combination with the effects of other past,
present, and future projects, is cumulatively considerable.
1) 135. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's potential impacts related to
11 Measure D and ECAP inconsistencies.

1:2 136. The EIR fails to adequately analyzc and mitigate the Project's potential impacts related to
1.3 the General Plan's Scenic Route Element.

1-4 137. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's potential impacts related to
1:5 the General Plan's Open Space Element.
16 138. The EIR fails to analyze all feasible mitigations with respect to the Project's inconsistency
1'l with the RM land use designation, including failing to analyze a general plan amendment that

11! would add SEFs to the R.M.

19 139. The EIR fails to adequately analyze whether the Project will have a sufficient water supply.
21 140. The EIR fails to adequately explain how the Project compliance with the thresholds of

2 significance means the Project impacts are less than significant.
2: 141. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and respond to comments concemning the Project's
2:1 adverse impacts on the groundwater.
24 142. The EIR violates CEQA because it is misleading.

2:i 143. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's
2ti potential impact on biological resoutces.

2.

21

1 144. The EIR violates CEQA because it relies on the Project's implementation of several plans to
2 reduce or avoid environmental effects, but such plans are either unenforceable or constitute
improperly deferred mitigation, or both.
145. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to adequately aualyze and mitigate the Project's
5 potential impacts related to on-site oil and gas wells and their abandonment.

6  146. As a result of these defects in the EIR, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by
7 certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA, by failing to proceed in the manner required by
law, and by failing to act on the basis of substantial evidence.
