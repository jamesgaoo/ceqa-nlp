PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. On December 10, 2020, the California Fish and Game Commission approved Title 14

3 CA Code of Regulations § 749.11 (Special Order Relating To Take Of Western Joshua
Tree (Yucca Brevifolia) During Candidacy Period), authorizing the Department of
4 Fish and Wildlife to issue permits to authorize either the removal of a dead western
Joshua tree or the trimming of a dead western Joshua tree without payment of
6 mitigation fees or other mitigation. ($749.11 (b)). On the same day, the Commission
also determined that the approval of § 749.11 is Exempt from the California

8 Environmental Quality Act. Petitioner contends that §749.11 fails as an action
necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency as specified in Public Resources Code

10 §21080(b)(4) and §15269(c) of the CEQA Guidelines.

11
2.
12 On December 10, 2020, the California Fish and Game Commission approved Title 14
California Code of Regulations § 749.12 (Special Order Relating To Take Of Western
13 Joshua Tree (Yucca Brevifolia) During Candidacy Period) authorizing the City of
14 Palmdale, the County of San Bernardino and the Town of Yucca Valley to issue
15 permits for the take of western Joshua tree for a single-family residence, accessory

16 structure, public works project, or the take of dead trees and trimming of limbs.

17 ($749.12 (c)(1)(A)(B). On the same day the Commission made CEQA findings which

18 purport, but fail, to be made as a Responsible Agency pursuant to the provisions of

19 CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21069).

20 3. Preceding this action, on October 21, 2019 the Fish and Game Commission (FGC)
21 received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) to list the western
22 Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) as a threatened species under the California

23 Endangered Species Act (Fish and Game Code §2050 et seq.). On November 1, 2019

24 the FGC staff transmitted the petition to the California Department of Fish and

25 Wildlife (DFW) for review. A notice of receipt of the petition was published in the

26 California Regulatory Notice Register on November 22, 2019.

27 4. California Fish and Game Code § 2073.5 required the DFW to evaluate the CBD
28 petition and submit a written evaluation with a recommendation to the FGC, which

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 2

1 was received at the FGC April 2020 Commission meeting. The DFW evaluation

2, report delineates each of the categories of information required for a petition,
evaluates the sufficiency of the available scientific information for each of the
required components and incorporates additional relevant information that DFW
possessed or received during the review period. Based upon the information
contained in the petition and other relevant information, DFW determined there was
sufficient information available to indicate that the CBD petitioned action may be
7 warranted.

8

9. 5. The FGC scheduled the public hearing on the CBD petition for its June 2020 meeting,

10 following the public release and required 30-day review period for the DFW

11 evaluation report. (FGC $82074 and 2074.2.) If the FGC determines listing may be

12 warranted pursuant to § 2074.2, Western Joshua tree will become a candidate species
and the DFW will undertake a one-year status review before the FGC can make a final
13 decision on the listing. Candidate species are protected ["take" prohibited] under the
14 California Endangered Species Act (CESA) pursuant to section 2085 during the
15 remainder of the CESA listing process.

16

17 6. At the June 2020 meeting, the FGC took public comment and continued the public

18 hearing to August 19-20, 2020. At the August 2020 meeting, the FGC took public

19 comment and received presentations from DFW, the CBD petitioner, and several
other organizations. After oral testimony concluded, the FGC discussed the item,
20 closed the public hearing and administrative record pursuant to Fish and Game Code
21 2074.2, and continued FGC deliberations to the September 22, 2020 public meeting.
22

23 7. At the September 22, 2020 public hearing the FGC considered two agenda action

24 items. Agenda Item #3: In a unanimous 4-0 vote, the FGC determined that listing

25 the Western Joshua tree as threatened or endangered under the California

26 Endangered Species Act (CESA) may be warranted. The FGC vote commenced the

27 one-year DFW status review for the western Joshua tree. The FGC will make the final
decision on the endangered species listing following the one-year status review.
28 During the status review, the western Joshua tree is protected under CESA as a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 3

1 candidate species. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the now

N candidate western Joshua tree shall nevertheless be considered to be endangered,
rare or threatened pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15380(d).
Ln 00 8. The FGC, at the September 22, 2020 public hearing also Approved the emergency
"conditional take" of the now candidate western Joshua tree on 15 Solar energy
projects located in the California desert. In a lawsuit filed on October 28, a 2020
7 (RIC2004343)1 Petitioner Paulek is asking the Court to direct Respondent FGC to

8 vacate and set aside the September 22, 2020 Approval of the emergency "conditional

9 take" of western Joshua trees until the FGC fully complies with CEQA.

10
11 9. At the December 10, 2020 Public Hearing the FGC Agenda Item 27 proposed two

12 additional Emergency "take" regulations for Western Joshua trees. The Approved
emergency actions, which are the subject of this CEQA action, would add § 749.11 and
13 §749.12 to Title 14 Californía Code of Regulations (CCR).
14

15 10. Section 749.11 authorizes the Department of Fish and Wildlife to issue permits to

16 authorize either the removal of a dead western Joshua tree or the trimming of a dead

17 western Joshua tree without payment of mitigation fees or other mitigation. (5749.11

18 (b)). The Permit takes up to 30 days to be approved. ($749.11 (c)).

19

20 11. The Commission approved Motion 1 (Section 749.11) which stated, "The Commission
[as Lead Agency] further determines, based on the record, that this approval is
21 exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act as an action necessary to
22 prevent or mitigate an emergency as defined in Public Resources Code § 21080(b)(4)

23 and CEQA Guidelines 6 15269.

24

25 12. The Staff Summary states "DFW has articulated risk to the public caused by certain

26 trees vulnerable to severe winter conditions or dead trees."

27

28 1Notice of Related Case filed separately.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA

13. The approval of § 749.11 requiring a permit, which may take up to 30 days to

2 process) is not an action necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency, defined in
CEQA as "a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger,

4 demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to life, health,
property, or essential public services." (Public Resources Code § 2108o(b)(4) and
CEQA Guidelines § 15269).
6

7 14. Section 749.12 authorizes the City of Palmdale, the County of San Bernardino and the

8 Town of Yucca Valley to issue permits for the take of Western Joshua tree for a

9 single-family residence, accessory structure, public works project, or the take of dead

10 Joshua trees and trimming of limbs. ($749.12 (c)(1)(A)(B)

11

12 15. The staff suggested finding that "The Commission [as Lead Agency] further
determines, based on the record, that this approval is exempt from CEQA as an action
13 necessary to prevent or mitigate an emergency as specified in Pub. Res. Code §
14 2108o(b)(4) and CEQA Guidelines § 15269(c)" was abandoned by the Commission

15 after closing the public hearing on § 749.12.

16

17 16. On December 9, 2020, the FGC staff added on the website for item #27 three

18 additional documents:
Western Joshua Tree Ordinance EIR Addendum - Town of Yucca Valley 19

20 Program Environmental Impact Report Addendum - County of San Bernardino
Addendum to the Joshua Tree and Desert Native Vegetation Preservation 21 Ordinance Mitigated Negative Declaration - City of Palmdale .
22

23 17. Without continuing the hearing on § 749.12 or providing the CEQA required Notice to

24 the public, and after the public hearing was closed, the Commission purported to

25 switch from its designation from CEQA Lead Agency to CEQA Responsible Agency.

26

27 18. Section 749.12, the' Commission acting under authority of sections 15091

28 [FINDINGS] and 15096 [PROCESS FOR A RESPONSIBLE AGENCY] of the CEQA

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 5

1 Guidelines finds that measures required by the proposed regulation and additional

2 measures that would be undertaken as part of the required ordinance avoid or

3 substantially lessen the significant environmental effect as identified in the three

4 CEQA documents as supplemented by addendum. The Commission having
considered the Lead agency Program Environmental Impact Report, Environmental
5 Impact Report, Mitigated Negative Declaration as supplemented by the addendum
6 adopts the Project.

7

8 19. The December 22, 2020, Notice of Determination for § 749.12 stated that the
Commission, as a Responsible Agency, made five CEQA determinations after

10 considering the San Bernardino County Program PEIR, for the San Bernardino

11 County 2007 General Plan as supplemented by the County's addendum; the Town of

12 Yucca Valley General Plan update certified EIR supplemented by Yucca Valley's
Addendum; and the City of Palmdale Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Joshua
13 Tree and Native Vegetation Preservation Ordinance as supplemented by the
14 Palmdale's addendum.

15

16 20. The document filed with the CEQA Net is titled NOTICE OF DETERMINATION, but

17 it does not determine anything. The Notice purports to "determine" that the project

18 will not have a significant effect on the environment, but there is no reference to any

19 section in the Three EIR's to support this statement.

20 21. The NOD states that NO EIR was prepared for this project but relies on three EIR's
21 for this project.
22

23 22. The NOD states that no Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared for this project

24 but relies on three MND's for this Project.

25

26 23. The NOD states mitigation measures were made a condition of this project but does
indicate where those mitigation measures can be found.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 6

1

N 24.The NOD states there is no mitigation monitoring plan for the elusive mitigation
measures, without explaining why it is exempt from this CEQA requirement.

- L0 0N 25. The NOD states that Findings were made pursuant to CEQA, but there are no actual
findings, just a statement that findings were made.

26. There is no evidence in the record the Commission actively participated in the

8 EIR/Addendum process with the County of San Bernardino, the Town of Yucca

9 Valley or the City of Palmdale, reviewed the Lead Agency's CEQA document or used

10 that document in making their CEQA decision on §749.12. (PRC 21069, Guidelines §

11 15096,15381). There is no evidence in the $749.12 regulations or in any of the EIR's
or Addendum's that the Commission every considered the listed environmental

12 documents in making it's CEQA Findings.

13

14 27. There is no evidence in the record the Commission relied on the EIRs and Addendum

15 of the County, Town, and City in acting on whatever aspect of the EIR Project

16 required its approval and issued its own findings regarding the EIR Project. There is

17 no evidence to show what aspect of the County, Town and City's EIR's/Addendum
required the Commission's approval. (Guidelines 15096)

18

19 28. There is no

20 evidence that the Commission made a finding that the County, Town and
City's EIR/Addendums were legally adequate. ((PRC 21167.3; Guidelines

21 15052,15096)

22

23 29.0n December 23, 2020 the FGC Executive Director, Melissa Miller-Henson executed

a

24 Notice of Exemption (NOE) on the 749.11 regulation Approval. The 749.11 NOE

25 was posted with the Office of Planning and Research (OPR) on December 24, 2020

26 indicating the FGC as the CEQA Lead agency. The filing of a NOE and the posting on

27 the OPR list of notices start a 35-day statute of limitations period on legal challenges
to the FGC 749.11 decision that the project is exempt from CEQA.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA

1 30.On December 22, 2020 the FGC Executive Director, executed a Notice of
Determination (NOD) for the 749.12 regulation Approval. The 749.12 NOD was 2

statute of limitations on legal challenges to the FGC Approval of the 749.12 rule under
o CEQA.
7

8 31. In approving the Statutory Exemption (749.11) and in purporting to Act as a

9 Responsible Agency (§ 749.12), the Commission violated the substantive mandates of
the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). These violations were prejudicial | 10
error. Petitioner accordingly request this Court issue a writ of mandate under Cal. ~ Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5 directing Respondent FGC to vacate and 12 set aside the December 10, 2020 Approvals of the emergency "take" of western
13 Joshua trees until the FGC fully and correctly complies with CEQA.
14

17 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

18 40. Fish and Game Code § 2084 provides:

19 (a) The commission may authorize, subject to terms and conditions it prescribes,
and based on the best available scientific information, (1) the taking of any

24 authorize, or not authorize, the taking of an endangered, threatened, or

25 candidate species pursuant to this section.

26

27 41. The FGC discretionary project for the "take" of Joshua trees is subject to the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 10

1 limited to candidate species but includes the "take" of already listed endangered or

2 threatened species.

3

4 42. Petitioner exhausted all his administrative remedies prior to the approval of these
CEQA discretionary Projects, when providing oral testimony to the FGC during the
5 December 10, 2020 public hearing by objecting to the incorrect use of CEQA
exemptions and the failure of the FGC to correctly carryout its CEQA duties as
7 required by law. All issues raised in this petition were raised before Respondents by

8 petitioner, other members of the public, Or public agencies prior to the approval of

9 the Projects.

10

11 43. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service

12 upon the California Fish and Game Commission indicating his intent to file this

27 and CEQA Guideline § 15112.

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 11

1 48. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the

2 following ways:

V 49. "The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be
interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the
5 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Laurel Heights
6 Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,

7 390). The basic purposes of CEQA are to: (1) Inform governmental decision makers

8 and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of proposed

9 activities. (2) Identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or

10 significantly reduced. (3) Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment

11 by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation
measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible. (4) 12 Disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved the project in
13 the manner the agency chose if significant environmental effects are involved,*
14 (Bottini v. City of San Diego (2018) 27 Cal. App. 5th 281, 291) [emphasis added]

15

16 50.In enacting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) the legislature declared

17 it is the policy of the state to: *...prevent the elimination of fish and wildlife species

18 due to man's activities, ensure that fish and wildlife populations do not drop below

19 self-perpetuating levels, and preserve for future generations representatives of all
plant and animal communities...." (Public Resources Code § 21001(c)) " Public
20 agencies should not approve projects if there are feasible alternatives or feasible
21 mitigation measures, which would substantially lessen significant environmental
22 effects of such projects, and that procedures required by this division are intended to

23 assist public agencies in systematically identifying both significant effects of the

24 proposed project and feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures which will

25 avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects." (Public Resources Code §

26 21002). "The purpose of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is to identify the
Significant effects on the environment, to identify alternatives to the project, and to 27 indicate the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."
28 (Public Resources Code § 21002.1) [emphasis added].

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 12

2 51. The FGC authorized the "take" of western Joshua trees under CESA section 2084

3 ["The department [DFW] may recommend to the commission that the commission

4 authorize, or not authorize, the taking of endangered, threatened, or candidate
species pursuant to this section. *]. During the FGC one-year status review the
5 western Joshua tree is protected under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA)
6 as a candidate species (Fish and Game Code § 2085). Under CEQA the now

7 candidate western Joshua tree shall nevertheless be considered to be endangered,

8 rare or threatened pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15380(d). FGC regulatory actions

9 under CESA, such as the "take" of candidate species, are not exempt from CEQA

10 compliance (Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 196).

11 52. The FGC December 10, 2020 Approval/Authorization of the section 749.11 and 12 section 749.12 "take" permits violated the substantive mandates of the California
13 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The "take" authorizations approved by the FGC
14 were discretionary Projects under CEQA as they both "require the exercise of

15 judgement or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or

16 disapprove a particular activity (CEQA Guidelines § 15357). Under CEQA an agency

17 contemplating an action having the potential to... reduce the number or restrict the

18 range of an endangered, rare or threatened species (CEQA Guidelines § 15065 subd.

19 (a)) must find that the projects "may have a significant effect on the environment"
(CEQA Guidelines § 15065 - MANDATORY FINDINGS OF SIGNIFICANCE).
20 Because the "take" authorized by sections 749.11 and 749.12 will result in the
21 reduction in number and the restriction of the present range of the western Joshua
22 tree; the FGC is obligated to find the "take" of western Joshua trees may have a

23 significant environmental effect.

24

25 53. Such a finding precludes invocation of a categorical exemption and heightened

26 scrutiny of the statutory emergency exemption brought forward by the FGC.
(Mountain lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 65, 124-
27
125)
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 13

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2

w VIOLATION OF CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
The California Fish and Game Commission Did Not Comply with CEQA

54. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

6 55. The CEQA Finding for § 749.11 that the "take" of western Joshua tree is entitled to a

8 statutory exemption under CEQA as a specific action necessary to prevent or mitigate

9 an emergency as specified in section 21080(b)(4) of the Public Resources Code and

10 subsection 15269(c) Title 14 [CEQA Guidelines] is in error. The creation of a DFW

11 permit process to authorize applicants to remove Joshua trees that have fallen over,
are leaning against existing structures, or otherwise create an imminent threat to

12 public health or safety is not necessary to prevent or mitigate a contrived Joshua tree

13 emergency. CEQA Guideline § 15269(c) provides: "Specific actions necessary to

14 prevent or mitigate an emergency. This does not include long-term projects

15 undertaken for the purpose of preventing or mitigating a situation that has a low

16 probability of occurrence in the short-term." The DFW issuance of "take" permits for

17 the Joshua tree during the candidate period is long-term project seeking to address

18 a situation, fallen Joshua trees, that has a low probability of occurrence in the short-
term. The proposed action does not fit within the terms of the statutory emergency

19 exemption.

20

21 56. CEQA Guidelines 15359 defines Emergency as follows: "Emergency" means a

22 sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding

23 immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to life, health, property, or

24 essential public services. Emergency includes such occurrences as fire, flood,

25 earthquake, or other soil or geologic movements, as well as such occurrences as riot,

26 accident, or sabotage." The statutory exemption relied upon by the FGC are not to be
expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. The claimed FGC

27 emergencies for $749.11 are not sudden unexpected occurrences, involving imminent

28 danger and demanding immediate action. The FGC failed to proceed in the manner

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 14

1 required by law and the FGC emergency determinations are not supported by

2 substantial evidence in the record.

3
57. The December 22, 2020, Notice of Determination for § 749.12 stated that the
4 Commission, as a Responsible Agency, made five CEQA determinations after
5 considering the San Bernardino County Program PEIR, for the San Bernardino
6 County 2007 General Plan as supplemented by the County's addendum; the Town of

7 Yucca Valley General Plan update certified EIR supplemented by Yucca Valley's

8 Addendum; and the City of Palmdale Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Joshua

9 Tree and Native Vegetation Preservation Ordinance as supplemented by the

10 Palmdale's addendum. There is no evidence in the $749.12 regulations or in any of
the EIR's or Addendum's that the Commission ever considered the listed
11

12 environmental documents in making it's CEQA Findings.

13 58. There is no documentation in the NOD to support any of those Findings.
14

15 59. There is no evidence in the record the Commission actively participated in the

16 EIR/Addendum process with the County of San Bernardino, the Town of Yucca

17 Valley or the City of Palmdale, reviewed the Lead Agency's CEQA document or used

18 that document in making their CEQA decision on $749.12. (PRC 21069, Guidelines

19 15096,15381).

20 60. There is no evidence in the record the Commission relied on the EIRs and
21 Addendum of the County, Town, and City in acting on whatever aspect of the EIR
22 Project required its approval and issued its own findings regarding the EIR Project.

23 There is no evidence to show what aspect of the County, Town and City's

24 EIR's/Addendum required the Commission's approval. (Guidelines 15096)

25

26 61. There is no evidence that the Commission made a finding that the County, Town and

27 City's EIR/Addendums were legally adequate. ((PRC 21167.3; Guidelines
15052,15096)
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE-CEQA 15

1 62. The FGC is included in the list of state regulatory agencies certified by the Secretary

2 of Resources as being exempt from the requirements for preparing, Environmental

3 Impact Reports (EIRs) if the FGC program meets the criteria contained in section
21080.5(d)(1)(2)(3) of the public Resources Code. The FGC certified regulatory 4
program remains subject to other provisions in CEQA such as the policy of avoiding
5 significant adverse effects on the environment where feasible (CEQA Guidelines
6 15250). The FGC failed to follow the procedures of its own certified regulatory
7 program claiming instead the "take" of western Joshua tree was exempt from CEQA

8 review. The FGC failed to proceed as required by law.

9

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief Against Respondent and Real Party
In Interest
12 63. Petitioner hereby alleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contain
13 in the foregoing paragraphs.
14

15 64. Petitioner has no plain, eedy, or adequate remedy at law. Unless enjoined,

16 Respondent and Real Party in Interest will implement the Project despite its lack of

17 compliance with CEQA. Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm by Respondent's

18 failure to take the required steps to protect the environment and the implementation

19 of the project. Injunctive Relief is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et
seq. and a writ of mandate is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure § 1085 et seq.
20 and 1094.5 et seq. and under Public Resources Code § 21168.9 to prevent irreparable
21 harm to the environment.
