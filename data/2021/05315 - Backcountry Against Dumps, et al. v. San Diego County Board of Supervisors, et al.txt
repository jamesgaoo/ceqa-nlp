25 OF SUPERVISORS (hereinafter "the Board") and DOES I through XX, and real parties in interest

26 Boulder Brush, LLC, and DOES XXI through C, and by this Verified Petition allege as follows:

27 INTRODUCTION

28 1. This is a public interest lawsuit to protect petitioners' and the public's interest in securing

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES . 1 -

the Board's compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources

2 Code ("PRC") section 21000 et seq., the San Diego County General Plan ("General Plan") and Zoning

3 Ordinance ("Zoning Ordinance"), and the Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et

4 seq. Petitioners bring this action to challenge the Board's approval on March 17, 2021 of the Boulder

5 Brush Facilities Project ("Boulder Brush" or the "Project"). The primary purpose of the Project is to

6 connect the proposed 60-turbine Campo Wind Project on the Reservation of the Campo Band of

7 Diegueño Mission Indians to San Diego Gas & Electric's ("SDG&E's") existing Sunrise Powerlink

8 transmission lines. Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") ES-3, 1-5. Those 60 turbines would be

9 up to 586 feet tall, and they would be located near tribal and private residences and in an area of hioh-
10- quality bird habitat and frequent flights by low-flying military, commercial and private aircraft. The

11 Project would also enable interconnection between the proposed 30-turbine Torrey Wind Project (a wind

12 turbine project that would be built by Terra-Gen Development Company, LLC, the same company that

13 proposes to build the Campo Wind Project turbines) on private lands within the County and the Sunrise

14 Powerlink. FEIR 1-5, 1-6. The Project would be located within an approximately 320-acre corridor on

15 privately owned land just north of the community of Boulevard, an area with extremely high wildfire

16 risk. FEIR 1-2. The Project would include (1) an approximately 3.5-mile-long, 230-kilovolt (*kV")

17 overhead gen-tie line, supported by 32 steel pole structures up to 150 feet tall, (2) a high-voltage

18 substation, (3) a 500-kV switchyard, (4) access roads, (5) three 10,000-gallon water tanks, and (6)

19 additional cleared space around the facilities ("fuel modification zones"). FEIR 1-4 to 1-9.

20 2. Despite the many environmental and public health and safety risks posed by the Project and

21 the at least 90 massive wind turbines it would enable, the Board approved the Project on March 17,

22 2021. The Board adopted findings and certified the FEIR (SCH No. 2019-029-094; PDS2019-ER-19-

23 16-001), adopted a Statement of Overriding Consideration (for unmitigable impacts to noise, biological

24 resources and aesthetics), approved a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, approved a Major

25 Use Permit (PDS2019-MUP-19-002), approved a Fire and Emergency Services Agreement between the

26 County and Boulder Brush, LLC (the Project proponent), and authorized the County Fire Warden to sign

27 the agreement (collectively, "Project Approvals"). Petitioners challenge the Project Approvals because

28 they violate CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DBCLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 2 -

P 3. Petitioners therefore seek this Court's declaration that the Board's actions violate

2 CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law, and this

3 Court's writ of mandate ordering the County to set aside and vacate its Project Approvals. Finally,

4 petitioners seek an injunction forbidding all activity on the Project that could result in any change or

5 alteration in the physical environment until the Board has taken all actions necessary to bring the Project

6 and the Board's Project Approvals - into compliance with CEQA, the General Plan and Zoning

7 Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law.

8 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

9 4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP")

10 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5

11 (administrative mandate), PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA), Government

12 Code section 65009(c)(1) (judicial review under the Planning and Zoning Law), and Article VI, section

13 10, of the California Constitution.

14 5. Venue is proper pursuant to CCP sections 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395

15 (actions generally) because the Board is the legislative body for and has its office within San Diego

16 County.

17 6. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations. This action is

18 timely under CEQA because it is filed within 30 days of the Board's March 18, 2021 Notice of
19 Determination ("NOD") (PRC § 21167(b)) and timely under the Government Code because it is filed

20 within 90 days of the Board's March 17, 2021 approval of the Project (Govt. Code §§ 65009(c)(1)).

21 7. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with a

22 copy of this Verified Petition and Complaint, and consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners have

23 served the Board with notice of this suit.

PARTIES 24

25 8. Petitioner BACKCOUNTRY AGAINST DUMPS ("Backcountry") is a community

26 organization comprising numerous individuals and families residing in eastern San Diego County and

27 Imperial County who will be directly affected by the Project and the wind turbine projects it will enable.
28 Backcountry and its members are vitally interested in proper land use planning and management in order

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 3 -

1 to maintain and enhance the area's ecological integrity, scenic beauty, wildlife, recreational amenities

2 and natural resources, and protect its residents and visitors from health hazards. Eastern San Diego

3 County is home to many elderly and medically at-risk residents who are particularly vulnerable to the
4 Project's adverse health effects. The nearby community of Boulevard, for example, has been designated
as one of San Diego County's Health Equity Zip Codes. Backcountry's members use the area affected

6 by the Project for aesthetic, scientific, historic, cultural, recreational, and spiritual enjoyment.
Construction and operation of the Project and the wind turbines that would connect to it threaten to harm
the use and enjoyment of the area's public resources by Backcountry's members and the public at large.
The Project and associated wind turbines also threaten to cause physical and psychological harm to

10 Backcountry's members and other nearby residents through their emission of excessive audible noise and

11 infrasound and low-frequency noise, and through their adverse impacts to visual resources. As citizens

12 who own, use and/or enjoy the bountiful natural resources in the Project area, Backcountry's members

13 a have a clear and present right to, and-direct beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its

14 public duty to comply with the provisions of CEQA, the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the

15 Planning and Zoning Law. Waste Management of Alameda County v. County of Alameda ("Waste
16 Management of Alameda County") (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1233-1239. Backcountry was duly

17 authorized to and does bring this action in representative capacity on behalf of its members.

18 9. Petitioner DONNA TISDALE lives on Morningstar Ranch, 1250 Tierra Real Lane in

19 Boulevard, California, adjacent to the Campo Reservation and just southwest of the Project site. She is a

20 member of Backcountry, as well as the Chairwoman of San Diego County's Boulevard Planning Group.

21 Ms. Tisdale enjoys living and recreating in the rustic and serene Boulevard community, with its

22 quietude, excellent views of wide open spaces, and wildlife habitat. Ms. Tisdale uses her ranch and rents

23 her nearby 146-acre rental property for livestock grazing, and uses her ranch and the surrounding rural

24 areas of her Boulevard community for hiking, family gatherings, recreation, wildlife and wildflower

25 viewing, photography, star gazing and quiet meditation. Construction and operation of the Project and

26 the wind turbines that would connect to it threatens to harm Ms. Tisdale's use and enjoyment of her

27 ranch and the Boulevard area's natural resources, as well as her own health. Ms. Tisdale therefore has a

28 clear and present right to, and beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 4 -

t comply with the provisions of the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Planning and Zoning

2 Law, and CEQA. Waste Management of Alameda County, 79 Cal.App.4th at 1233-1239.

3 10. Petitioner JOE E. TISDALE lives with his wife, Donna Tisdale, on Morningstar Ranch,

4 1250 Tierra Real Lane in Boulevard, California, adjacent to the Campo Reservation and just southwest

5 of the Project site. He is a member of Backcountry. Mr. Tisdale purchased Morningstar Ranch in 1963.

6 Mr. Tisdale enjoys living and recreating in the rustic and serene Boulevard community, with its quietude,

7 excellent views of wide open spaces, and wildlife habitat. Mr. Tisdale uses his ranch and rents his

8 nearby 146-acre rental property for livestock grazing, and uses his ranch and the surrounding rural areas

9 of his Boutevard community for hiking, family gatherings, recreation, wildlife and wildflower viewing,
10 photography, star gazing and quiet meditation. Construction and operation of the Project and the wind

11 turbines that would connect to it threatens to harm Mr. Tisdale's use and enjoyment of his ranch and the

12 Boulevard area's natural resources, as well as his own health. Mr. Tisdale therefore has a clear a and

13 present right to, and beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to comply with

14 the provisions of the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Planning and Zoning Law, and

15 CEQA. Waste Management of Alameda County, 79 Cal.App.4th at 1233-1239.

16 11. Petitioners have authorized their attorney to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate

17 their, and the public's, vital interest in securing the Board's compliance with the CEQA, the County

18 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law, in connection with its review

19 and approval of the Project.

20 12. Respondent SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS at all material times has

21 been and is the governing legislative body of San Diego County and is authorized and required by the

22 California Constitution to regulate land use within all unincorporated areas of the County, including the

23 Project sites, in compliance with CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the

24 Planning and Zoning Law. The Board is the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. The Board issued

25 the Project Approvals on March 17, 2021. The Board filed its CEQA Notice of Determination ('NOD")

26 for the Project on March 18, 2021.

27 13. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
28 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 5 -

1 r Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this verified petition when the true names and

2 capacities of said DOE respondents have been ascertained.

3 14. Real party in interest Boulder Brush, LLC is a Delaware domestic limited liability company,

4 which incorporated on June 14, 2018 (File Number 6931417) and registered in California on June 15,

5 2018 (Entity Number 201817210016). Its office is located at 437 Madison Avenue, Suite 22A, New

6 York, New York 10022. Its registered agent for service of process in California is Erin Upchurch

7 (Cogency Global Inc.; C2003899), whose registered address is 1325 J Street, Suite 1550, Sacramento,

8 California 95814. Boulder Brush, LLC is the Project proponent and according to the County's NOD, the

9 sole applicant for the Project Approvals.

10 15. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES

11 XXI-C, inclusive, and therefore sue such real parties in interest herein by fictitious names. Petitioners

12 are informed and believe, and based upon such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named

13 real parties are entities or individuals who have a direct and substantial economic interest in, or are the

14 recipients of, the Board's Project Approvals. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties

15 have been ascertained, petitioners will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this verified petition

16 to insert such identities and capacities.

17 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

18 16. As approved by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on March 17, 2021, the

19 Boulder Brush Facilities Project would include (I) an approximately 3.5-mile-long, 230-kilovolt ("kV")

20 overhead gen-tie line, supported by 32 steel pole structures up to 150 feet tall, (2) a high-voltage

21 substation, (3) a 500-kV switchyard, (4) access roads, (5) three 10,000-gallon water tanks, and (6)

22 additional cleared space around the facilities ("fuel modification zones"). FEIR 1-4 to 1-9. The Project

23 would be located within an approximately 320-acre corridor on privately owned land in the scenic
24 McCain Valley area just north of the community of Boulevard, an area with extremely high wildfire risk.

25 FEIR 1-2. But the full project encompasses much more than those transmission-related facilities
26 4 approved by the Board on private land. The primary purpose of the Project is to connect the proposed

27 60-turbine Campo Wind Project on the Reservation of the Campo Band of Diegueño Mission Indians to

28 SDG&E's existing Sunrise Powerlink transmission lines. Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR")

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 6 -

P ES-3, 1-5. Those 60 turbines would be up to 586 feet tall, and they would be located near tribal and

2 private residences and in an area of high-quality bird habitat and frequent flights by low-flying military,

3 commercial and private aircraft. The turbines would be accompanied by three 374-foot tall

4 meteorological towers, 15 miles of new access roads, an electrical connection and communications

5 system, a collector substation, an operations and maintenance facility, and five additional miles of

6 overhead gen-tie lines. The Project would also enable interconnection between the proposed 30-turbine

7 Torrey Wind Project (on private lands within the County) and the Sunrise Powerlink. FEIR 1-5, 1-6.

8 The Campo Wind Project was included as part of the Project for CEQA purposes in the EIR analyses,

9 while the Torrey Wind Project was not. The Campo Wind Project was also separately analyzed in an

10 Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the Bureau of Indian Affairs ("BIA"), pursuant to the

11 National Environmental Policy Act. The BIA subsequently approved the Campo Wind Project on or

12 about April 7, 2020. That approval is currently being litigated in the United States District Court for the

13 Southern. District of California (Case No. 20-CV-2343-JLS). To petitioners' knowledge, the Torrey

14 Wind Project has not yet received any governmental approvals. For its part, the Board did not purport to

15 approve either wind project in its Project Approvals for the Boulder Brush Facilities.

16 17. The Boulder Brush Facilities and connected Campo Wind and Torrey Wind projects would

17 exacerbate an already devastating industrialization of the McCain Valley area and eastern San Diego

18 County generally. The 500-kV Sunrise Powerlink cuts through McCain Valley along the northeast

19 portion of the Project site. The Tule Wind Project's 57 400-plus-foot tall wind turbines loom over the

20 valley further to the north, and more turbines are slated to be added along the ridge line in 2022. To the

21 west, the Campo Tribe has another 25 wind turbines operating as part of the Kumeyaay Wind Project.

22 And to the east, just across the border in Imperial County, Ocotillo Wind's 112 massive wind turbines

23 generate so much infrasound and low-frequency noise that it has been recorded at homes in the

24 Boulevard community.

25 18. Despite widespread community opposition to further industrialization of the McCain Valley
26 area and eastern San Diego County more broadly, in January 2019 Boulder Brush, LLC submitted

27 applications to the County to permit the Boulder Brush Facilities. The County followed with a Notice of

28 Preparation ("NOP") of an EIR on February 14, 2019, which triggered scoping period for the Project's

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 7-

1 environmental review under CEQA. Petitioners submitted at least six sets of scoping comments,

2 including letters from the Law Offices of Stephan C. Volker submitted on February 21, 2019, March 18

3 2019, and June 24, 2019, comments from Backcountry submitted on March 18, 2019 and February 3,

4 2020, presentations by Backcountry to the County Planning Commission on November 13, 2020 and

5 March 12, 2021, comments from Ms. Tisdale submitted on February 28, 2019, and March 18, 2019, and

6 a letter submitted by Mr. Tisdale on March 17, 2019. Ms. Tisdale also submitted comments to the

7 County at the direction and on behalf of the Boulevard Planning Group on February 8, 2019, February

8 12, 2019, March 18, 2019, June 24, 2019, February 3, 2020, and November 11, 2020. Backcountry

-9 supporter and Project opponent Michelle Cuero, an enrolled member and former Vice Chair of the

10 Campo Band, also participated in both the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors' hearings on

11 the Project. Backcountry supporter and Project opponent Monique La Chappa, an enrolled member and

12 former Chair of the Campo Band, also participated in the County Planning Commission hearing.

13 19. The County published the Draft EIR ("DEIR") in December 2019. Petitioners again

14 participated extensively in the public review process. They submitted at least five sets of DEIR

15 comments, including a letter from the Law Offices of Stephan C. Volker submitted on February 3, 2020,

16 letters from Ms. Tisdale submitted on January 24, 2020, and January 29, 2020, and letters submitted by

17 Mr. and Ms. Tisdale on January 12, 2020, and February 3, 2020.

18 20. The County published the FEIR in September 2020. Petitioners commented extensively at

19 that stage, too. For example, the Law Offices of Stephan C. Volker submitted FEIR comments for

20 petitioners on November 11, 2020. Petitioners also submitted comments to the Board prior to its public

21 hearing on the Project on March 17, 2021, including letters from the Law Offices of Stephan C. Volker

22 submitted on February 26, 2021, and the morning of March 17, 2021. Ms. Tisdale also attended and

23 presented oral and written comments at the March 17 hearing itself.

24 21. Despite the many environmental and public health and safety risks posed by the Project and

25 the at least 90 massive wind turbines it would enable, the Board approved the Project on March 17,

26 2021. The Board then filed its CEQA NOD for the Project on March 18, 2021.

27 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

28 22. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 8 -

1 Petition and, to the extent required, have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies.

2 23. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, within
3 the meaning of CCP section 1086. Unless this Court issues a writ of mandate ordering the Board to set

4 aside and vacate its Project Approvals, the health and environmental interests of petitioners and the
public will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could
6 adequately compensate for the harms to petitioners and the environment that would arise if the Board's

7 unlawful conduct were allowed to stand.

.24. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because the Project
threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, the Board and the real parties in interest will -
10 implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing unlawful and

11 unnecessary environmental degradation, impacts to public health and safety, and related socio-economic

12 impacts including impaired property use and enjoyment and diminished property values, to community

13 members. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to the Board's failure to take the steps

14 required by law to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP

15 section 525 et seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

16 25. An actual controversy exists between petitioners and respondents under CCP section 1060.

17 Petitioners contend that respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws, including but not limited

18 to CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law as alleged

19 herein, and must therefore vacate and set aside the Project approvals. Petitioners are informed and

20 believe that the Board disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is therefore

21 necessary and appropriate.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief to Set Aside the Board's Certification of the Environmental Impact Report for the Project and Associated Project
24 Approvals as Contrary to the California Environmental Quality Act)

25 26. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

26 27. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to PRC section 21168 and 21168.5 on

27 the grounds that the Board failed to act in accordance with the law, and committed a prejudicial abuse of

28 discretion, in that the Board certified an FEIR and adopted a statement of overriding considerations that

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEBS - 9-

do not comply with CEQA.

2 28. The Statement of Overriding Considerations violates CEQA because it is not supported by

3 substantial evidence. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to:

4 (1) analyze the whole of the Project;

5 (2) analyze significant Project impacts to aviation;

6 (3) adequately analyze the Project's wildfire impacts;

7 (4) adequately analyze the Project's impacts to golden eagles;

8 (5) adequately analyze the Project's impacts to bats;

9 (6) adequately analyze the Project's audible noise impacts;

10 (7) adequately analyze the Projects infrasound and low-frequency noise impacts;

11 (8) adequately analyze the Project's greenhouse gas emissions; and

12 (9) adequately analyze the Project's impacts to local groundwater resources.

13 Each of these deficiencies is detailed below.

14 The Statement of Overriding Considerations Is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

15 29. Because the Project would bave significant unmitigated environmental impacts, including
16 impacts to aesthetics, aviation safety, wildfire ignition and suppression, biological resources,
17 groundwater and noise (FEIR at ES-8), it cannot be approved without a statement of overriding

18 considerations. CEQA § 21081; CEQA Guidelines § 15093; FEIR ES-9. That statement of overriding

19 considerations "shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record" showing that the benefits of the

20 Project outweigh its unmitigated environmental impacts. CEQA Guidelines § 15093(b). The Project's

21 purported benefits are to "generate and deliver to the grid renewable wind energy to meet the demands of

22 consumers." FEIR 1-1. However, those "benefits" would only materialize if the Boulder Brush

23 Facilities have an energy generation source. The plan is for the Boulder Brush Facilities to connect to

24 the Campo Wind Project, but that wind project might never be built. For one, the Federal Aviation

25 Administration ("FAA") has stayed issuance of its potential approvals for the Campo Wind Project, as

26 discussed further below in the context of the Project's aviation impacts. Unless and until the FAA

27 completes its review and determines that the Project may proceed - which may never happen - this stay

28 remains in effect and the Project cannot proceed. The future of the Campo Wind Project also depends on

RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 10 -

the outcome of petitioners' lawsuit against the BIA in the United States District Court for the Southern

2 District of California over its unlawful approval of the Campo Wind Project (Case No. 20-CV-2343-

3 JLS). In sum, there is no substantial evidence that the Campo Wind Project or any other energy

4 generation project will ever be built and allow the Boulder Brush Facilities to achieve the Project

5 it objectives. The Board thus violated CEQA when it adopted the statement of overriding considerations.

6 The FEIR Fails to Analyze the Whole of the Project

7 30. CEQA forbids "piecemeal" environmental review. Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay

8 Commission v. Board of Port Commissioners of the City of Oakland ("Berkeley Keep Jets") (2001) 91

9 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358. CEQA mandates that "environmental considerations do not become

10 submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones . . . [,] which cumulatively may have.

11 disastrous consequences." Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Commission (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-

12 284.

13 31. Here, the FEIR acknowledges that the Project's 3.5-mile 230-kV gen-tie transmission line

14 would "connect energy generated by [the 60-turbine Campo Wind Project] to the existing SDG&E

15 Sunrise Powerlink," and it accordingly analyzes together the impacts of the Campo Wind Project and the

16 Boulder Brush Facilities. FEIR ES-3. But the FEIR fails to analyze another wind energy project - the

17 30-turbine Torrey Wind Project - that the Boulder Brush Facilities would likewise enable. As the FEIR
18 acknowledges, the Boulder Brush Facilities' "high-voltage substation would allow for the receiving and

19 stepping up of electric energy from 230 kV to 500 kV for the proposed Torrey Wind Project, a separate

20 wind energy project proposed on private lands under County jurisdiction." FEIR 1-5. Despite the

21 inextricable link between the Boulder Brush Facilities and the Torrey:Wind Project, the FEIR merely

22 treats the latter as a cumulative project. E.g. FEIR. 2.3-110. That violates CEQA. The County may not

23 piecemeal the analysis of a project that would not be constructed but for the Boulder Brush Facilities'

24 500-kV substation and switchyard. City of Antioch v. City Council of the City of Pittsburg (1986) 187

25 Cal.App.3d 1325, 1337 (holding that approval of a road and a sewer line triggers a duty under CEQA to

26 examine the impacts of the development that they will foreseeably serve).

27 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze Numerous Significant Environmental Impacts

28 32. An EIR must include "enough detail to enable those who did not participate in its

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 11 -

1 /preparation to understand and to consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project,"

3 |Friant Ranch, L.P. ("Friant Ranch") (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 513 (quote); CEQA Guidelines 8 15126.2.

4 The EIR "fail[s] to comply with the information disclosure provisions of CEQA" when it "omit[s] any

5 meaningful consideration" of a potentially significant environmental impact identified in the record.
6 Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield ("Bakersfield Citizens") (2004) 124
7 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1208. Here, the FEIR omits meaningful consideration of numerous potentially

8 significant environmental impacts.

9 The FEIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Impacts to Aviation

10 33. As detailed in Backcountry's January 29, 2020 comments to the FAA on the Campo Wind
11 Project, Wind Turbine C-69, Campo, California Aeronautical Study No. 2019-WTW-4585-OE (attached

12 as Exhibit to petitioners' February 26, 2021 comments to the Board, the Campo Wind Project (which is
of the Project for CEQA purposes) would cause significant and life-threatening impacts to aviation 13 part

14 that could not be avoided or sufficiently mitigated by the proposed mitigation measures. These impacts

15 will violate the San Diego County Zoning Code (Ordinance No. 1 0252) G6952 (Large Wind Turbines).

16 FAA's Southern California TRACON ("SCT") also identified numerous impacts to aviation safety and
17 flight control operation in its written opposition to the Campo Wind Project (attached as Exhibit 2 to the

18 February 26 Comments). For example, SCT notes that the wind turbines would compromise the safest
19 flight route for crossing the mountains in winter - a "significant impact." February 26 Comments,

20 Exhibit 2 at 3. The presence of the wind turbines would increase the minimum en-route altitude

21 ("MEA") on airway V317:

22 This airway is commonly used, but more so during the winter months as a safe route for aircraft who cannot climb to higher altitudes due to icing conditions, this airway has the
23 lowest MEA for crossing the mountains to the east. The aircraft that use this are General Aviation fixed wing aircraft from all the San Diego area airports, and military rotary
24 aircraft (who are very ice sensitive) from MCAS Miramar and NAS North Island. The loss of the 7,000 feet MEA would be significant as it [would] force all along the route to
25 8,000 feet MSL and higher.
26 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 2 at 3. The FEIR appears to assume that these aviation impacts

27 will be insignificant, but in fact, they are very significant. For example, the Project would impact use of

28 these critical airways by Homeland Security flights, as at least 50 of the proposed turbines would be

1 located within six miles of the US/Mexico border, and all of the turbines would be within 12 miles of the
2 border. For that reason among others, the FAA has found that Backcountry's Petition for Review is valid,

3 land it is therefore actively reviewing the impacts of the Project on aviation. Pursuant to its finding that
4 Backcountry's Petition for Review is valid, the FAA has stayed issuance of its potential approvals for the
5 Project. Unless and until it completes its review and determines that the Project may proceed -- which

6 may never occur this stay remains in effect and the Project cannot proceed.

7 The FEIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Wildfire Impacts

8 34. The Project - which includes both the Boulder Brush Facilities and the Campo Wind

9 Project for CEQA purposes - poses immense wildfire risks, both by increasing the risk of fire ignition

10 and by impeding wildfire fighting. These risks are detailed in Mark Ostrander's professional review of

11 the Project's wildfire impacts, which is attached as Exhibit,3 to the February 26, 2021 Comments. Mr.

12 Ostrander is a retired Battalion Chief and CEQA Environmental Coordinator with the California

13 Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ("Cal Fire"), with 36 years of experience working in the field

14 lof wildfire suppression throughout Southern California, including eastern San Diego County. Based on

15 (his experience, Mr. Ostrander concludes that:

16 construction and operation of the Campo Wind Project and its sixty 586-foot tall wind turbines, three 374-foot tall meteorological towers, collector substation, gen-tie line and
17 associated electrical lines and facilitic (including the Boulder Brush facilities) pose not only a significant fire-ignition risk, but also an extremely hazardous impediment to
18 effective wildfire suppression in the Campo area. In my professional opinion, the only way to significantly reduce wildfire risk from these power generation facilities is to move
19 them to an area not known for its wildfire hazards. And the only way to significantly reduce wildfire risk from the electrical transmission lines is to underground them
20 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 3 at 1-2.
21 35. The FEIR discusses, yet systematically understates, the Project's wildfire risks. In
22 /particular, the FEIR fails to analyze how the Project would impede firefighting efforts - both aerially and
23 on the ground - beyond an off-hand note that the Project would "represent . challenges regarding
24 rescue or firefighting within or adjacent to electrical facilities" (FEIR 2.9-41) and an evasive, vague and
25 short response to comments. This violates CEQA and precludes informed decisionmaking.
26 36. The nearly 600-foot-tall wind turbines proposed for the Campo Wind Project would "make
27 laerial delivery of retardant or water to the Project site extremely difficult, if not impossible. The mere
28 Ipresence of the 586-foot-tall turbine towers would create a large zone in which it is dangerous for low-

COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 13 -

1 flying aircraft to operate, either for fire-spotting purposes or to drop retardant and water." February 26,

2 2021 Comments, Exhibit 3 at 3. Mr. Ostrander also explains that the Project would "impede effective
3 ground attack against any wildfires in the vicinity of the Project. The deployment of fire crews within

4 100 to 1,000 feet (depending on conditions) of electrified structures is unsafe and forbidden by applicable
5 safety rules and regulations due to the serious hazard of electrical shock from the wind turbines,
6 substations, gen-tie lines and other electrified facilities." February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 3 at 4.

7 That means that "any fire in the area will generally get larger as the fire crew waits for it to pass through

8 the Project area to a safer distance from which to work the fire." Id. Omitting these critical impacts

9 Iviolates CEQA.

10 37. The FEIR also fails to discuss the recent reductions in wildfire fighting capacity in the
11 County:

12 Due to state budget cuts, Cal Fire and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation depopulated (eliminated) two fire camps in the county on December 12,
13 2020, including the camp closest to the Project (McCain Valley Conservation Camp in Boulevard) and Rainbow Conservation Camp in Fallbrook.
14 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 3 at 4. This development belies the FEIR's conclusion that
15 lemergency response capabilities in the Project area are adequate. FEIR 2.9-25 to 2.9-28.
16 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Impacts to Golden Eagles
17 38. Wind turbines kill birds, and so do power lines. The Campo Wind Project's 60 turbines
18 will be no different, just as will be the Torrey Wind Project's 30 turbines and the Project's miles of power
19 (lines. Indeed, in its responses to comments, the FEIR predicts that "one cagle fatality [will] occur[] every
20 8 years" with a "60-turbine design." FEIR GR5-14. The risk to golden eagles from these wind projects is
21 particularly concerning because golden eagles are "currently known to be at risk of population-level
22 effects from [wind turbine] collisions," and must be afforded every possible protection. February 26,
23 2021 Comments, Exhibit 4 at 306. Yet the FEIR brushes aside the risk to golden eagles as insignificant.
24 FEIR GR5-14.
25 39. The FEIR provides zero explanation for how the Project's direct impact to golden eagles
26 qualifies as insignificant when the Campo Wind Project will likely kill at least three eagles over the
27 course of its 25+-year life (at the forecasted rate of 1 eagle fatality every years). FEIR 1-2 (Project life),
28 GR5-14 (fatality rate estimate). Nor does it discuss how the projected fatalities could affect the golden

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES . 14 -

1 eagle population, which is at existential risk from wind turbines and other causes. Even without
2 considering population-level effects, the FEIR's conclusion that the killing of at least three eagles is

3 insignificant contravenes the County's own thresholds of significance for impacts to biological resources.

4 The most applicable threshold provides that a "significant impact would result if" the "project would
5 impact one or more individuals of a species listed as federally or state endangered or threatened." FEIR

6 2.3-45. The golden eagle is a special-status species and the FEIR itself forecasts that "one eagle fatality

7 [will] occur[l every 8 years" with the Campo Wind Project. FEIR GR5-14. That is a significant

8 environmental impact.

9 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Impacts to Bats

10 40. Bats perform vital biological and economic functions. As detailed in a recent peer-

11 reviewed scientific journal article:

12 Bats play a key role in Earth's ecosystems. In North America, ecological services provided by bats have been valued at $3.7 to $53 billion USD per year. They are major
13 predators of nocturnal insects and contribute to the regulation of epidemic outbreaks in agricultural fields and managed forests, as well as the control of insects transmitting
14 diseases to humans.

15 February 26 Comments, Exhibit 5 at 1.

16 41. But as with birds, wind energy facilities also kill bats, through both collisions and

17 |barotrauma (abrupt drop in air pressure behind turbine blades sucks bats into low pressure zone, causing
18 bats' lungs to expand and hemorrhage). And with "continued wind energy expansion, there are

19 lincreasing concerns that there could be population-level implications for bats." February 26 Comments,

20 Exhibit 6 at 125. This is éven more concerning given recent evidence that bats are attracted to wind

21 turbines and associated infrastructure, and use them as night or foraging roosts. February 26 Comments,

22 Exhibit 6. It is therefore essential to assess both project-specific bat impacts and the "cumulative effects

23 lof bat fatalities at wind farms." February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 5 at 2 (emphasis added).

24

25 42. Here, the FEIR fails to meaningfully analyze the Campo Wind Project's impacts on bats.

26 The FEIR concludes that "there were low occurrences of bats during surveys within the Campo Corridor,
27 particularly when compared to other areas with higher-quality habitat types in the region," and that bats
28  were therefore "not anticipated to have a high number of collisions with [Project] turbines." FEIR 2.3-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 15 -

1  52. But the FEIR fails to provide or even summarize the "surveys within the Campo Corridor." Instead,

2 the FEIR belatedly discloses in its responses to comments that the "bat data is presented" in an appendix

3 to the "Draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prepared for the [Campo Wind] Project by the

4 Bureau of Indian Affairs." FEIR 05-4. That precludes informed public review. The EIR itself must

5 disclose the data.

6 43. In addition, the FEIR fails to meaningfully discuss the risk to bats of barotrauma in

7 addition to turbine blade collision. Instead, it cites a study of pressure effects on rats. a But as the FEIR

8 acknowledges, the "actual relationship between rat thresholds and bat thresholds is not known." FEIR at

9 105-5.

10 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Audible Noise Impacts

11 44. The FEIR's analysis of audible noise impacts suffers from at least three sets of critical
12 errors and omissions. First, the acoustical analysis on which the FEIR relies is plagued by numerous

13 Itechnical errors, which dBF Associates, Inc. ("dBF") and Wilson Ihrig & Associates ('WIA") detail in

14 their respective technical reviews of the nearly identical Acoustical Analysis Reports ("AARs") on which

15 the FEIR for the Project (which includes both the Boulder Brush Facilities and the Campo Wind Project

16 for CEQA purposes) and the Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for the Campo Wind Project rely.

17 dBF's February 3, 2020 review of the FEIR's AAR, dBF's February 3, 2021 review of the EIS and its

18 [AAR, and WIA's February 4, 2021 review of the EIS and its AAR are attached as Exhibits 7, 8 and 9,
19 respectively, to petitioners' February 26, 2021 Comments. The technical errors include overstating the

20 lexisting ambient noise conditions (thereby understating the Project's added noise) due to the "limitations

21 of the noise logging instruments" used and "insufficient duration of measurements" (February 26, 2021
22 Comments, Exhibit 9 at 3 (quote); Exhibit 8 at 3), and relying on a modeling program (CadnaA) that
23 "cannot accurately predict wind turbine noise." February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 9 at 8.

24 45. Second, the FEIR fails to meaningfully analyze the issue of amplitude-modulated wind
25 turbine-generated noise. Amplitude modulation produces the characteristic, constantly repeating

26 "whoosh" sound that residents near wind turbines, including residents near the existing Tule and
27 Kumeyaay wind projects in the Boulevard area, frequently identify as distressing, stressful, and sleep-

28 Idisturbing. Recent peer-reviewed academic studies confirm that amplitude modulated noise is a health

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 16 -

problem. For example, Pohl et al. (2018) conducted a longitudinal study of wind turbine noise

2 disturbance in Germany and found that a "cause for the WT noise annoyance might be the amplitude

3 modulation (AM)." February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 10 at 126. Schäffer et al. (2019) conducted a
4 laboratory experiment with audio-visual simulations and likewise found that, even after accounting for

5 visual impacts, amplitude modulation increased annoyance. And Hansen et al. (2019) documented tonal

6 amplitude modulation from wind turbines in southern Australia that was audible outdoors and indoors up

7 Ito 3.5 kilometers away, which the authors concluded had "important implications for possible sleep
8 |disruption from wind turbine AM," particularly where ambient noise levels are low, as in the rural

9 Backcountry area.

10 46. The AAR dismisses the risk of amplitude modulation from Campo Wind Project turbines

11 by citing a 2016 study of "multiple operating wind turbine facilities" in unnamed locations. FEIR,
12 Appendix G at 35. According to that study, most modulation was 2 decibels ("dB") or less. But as WIA

13 |concludes in its technical review, the 2016 "RSG study minimizes the severity of the phenomenon by
14 understating the actual, measured differences in noise levels associated with infrasound." February 26,

15 2021 Comments, Exhibit 9 at 8. Furthermore, the AAR entirely ignores the much more recent and
16 relevant evidence of frequent amplitude modulation in the 5-6 dB range (deemed "excessive modulation"

17 by acoustics experts) at residences in the Boulevard area from the existing Tule and Kumeyaay wind
18 project turbines located quite close to the proposed Campo and Torrey wind projects. That amplitude

19 is modulation is documented in WIA's 2019 report attached as Exhibit 1 to Backcountry's March 18, 2019

20 |scoping comments and in the December 16, 2019 report by dBF Associates, Inc. ("dBF Report"), which

21 is attached to the February 26, 2021 Comments as Exhibit 13.

22 47. The FEIR attempts to critique the 2019 WIA Report and the dBF Report in the responses

23 to comments. FEIR GR4-16. And it ultimately concludes that "these reports fail to provide sufficient
24 evidence that a significant environmental impact due to amplitude modulation would occur as a result of

25 the Project." FEIR 05-6. But that is the wrong standard. The public does not have the burden of proving

26 that project would cause a significant environmental impact as a precondition for CEQA analysis.
27 Instead, it is the lead agency's duty to analyze in an EIR any impact for which there is "enough relevant

28 information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made" that the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 17 -

1 Jimpact might be significant, "even though other conclusions might also be reached." CEQA Guidelines
2 §§ 15384 (quote), 15064. The 2019 WIA Report and the dBF Report both conclude from empirical
3 research that existing wind turbines in the Project vicinity generate excessive amplitude modulation that

4 is observed at the homes of nearby residents. That is the epitome of substantial evidence supporting a fair
5 argument that the Project might cause a significant noise impact. CEQA thus requires the County to
6 thoroughly analyze the Project's noise impacts from amplitude modulation, not merely nitpick the 2019
WIA Report and the dBF Report. It is immaterial that there might not yet be any "local, state, or federal

8 standards of significance for determining the environmental impact" of amplitude modulation. FEIR at
9 05-5 (quote); Berkeley Keep Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1370-1371.

10 48. Third, the FEIR fails to meaningfully describe the full panoply of wind turbine-generated
11 noise impacts on health, including stress, sleep disturbance and reduced quality of life. This is similar to

12 the EIR the Supreme Court found inadequate in Friant Ranch. There, "[a]lthough the EIR generally

13 loutline[d] some of the unhealthy symptoms associated with exposure to various pollutants, it [did] not
14 give any sense of the nature and magnitude of the 'health and safety problems caused by the physical
15 changes' resulting from the Project as required by the CEQA guidelines." Friant Ranch, 6 Cal.5th at. 522
16  (quoting CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a)).

17 49. The FEIR here entirely fails to even mention "stress" or "sleep" or otherwise connect the
18 projected Project-generated noise levels to health outcomes, despite the fact that numerous wind turbine
19 noise impact studies to date have established a correlation between noise and self-reported annoyance or

20 sleep disturbance. Researchers are also increasingly studying the physiological responses to wind turbine
21 noise during sleep. For example, a pair of recent pilot studies by Morsing et al. (2018) investigated the
22 physiologically measured sleep effects of nocturnal wind turbine noise in a laboratory setting. The results
23 provided "evidence that participants had more frequent awakenings, reduced amounts of N3 ("deep")
24 sleep, reduced continuous N2 sleep, increased self-reported disturbance and [wind turbine noise]-induced

25 tiredness in exposure nights with [wind turbine noise] compared to [wind turbine noise]-free nights."

26 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 14 at 10. The increase in self-reported sleep disturbance also
27 comports with the findings of numerous survey-based studies on the subject. Morsing et al.'s (2018)

28 results are also consistent with those of a cohort-based study in Denmark on the impacts on sleep and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 18 -

|depression of long-term residential exposure to wind turbine noise. Poulsen et al. (2019) found, based on

2 their study of nearly 600,000 people during an approximately 20-year period, that "high levels of long-

3 term nighttime exposure to outdoor" wind turbine noise (greater than or equal to 42 dBA) were
4 "associated with redemption of sleep medication and antidepressants" (i.e. filling prescriptions for those

5 medications), particularly amongst people aged 65 or older. February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 15 at

6 I037005-6. The authors reported that their findings accord with most studies on the effects of wind
7 turbine noise exposure on sleep and self-reported mental health. February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit

8 15 at 037005-7.

9 50. The FEIR relies almost exclusively on the 2019 County Public Health Position Statement

10 to support its conclusion that the Project's wind turbine noise impacts would not be significant. FEIR
11 GR4, 05-6 to 05-7. But that statement was in reference to wind turbines no larger than 2 MW, whereas

12 the turbines proposed for Campo Wind and Torrey Wind are 4.2 MW and thus far larger, more powerful

13 land much noisier. Additionally, that statement fails to consider numerous pertinent studies, data, and

14 issues. For example, the statement omits numerous recent relevant studies, including Morsing et al.'s

15 (2018) study and Poulsen et al.'s (2019) study. It also fails to mention or discuss the 2019 WIA Report

16 and the dBF Report. In addition, the statement fails to discuss amplitude modulated noise at all, despite
17 increasing academic and professional literature on the subject, as discussed above. These failures were

18 documented in Backcountry's April 12, 2019 comments on the.2019 County Public Health Position

19 |Statement, which is attached to their February 26, 2021 Comments as Exhibit 16.

20 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Infrasound and Low-Frequency Noise

51. Impacts
21 The audible noise level, like that measured with the A-weighted scale used in Poulsen et

22 lal.'s (2019) study, is only one aspect of wind turbine-generated noise. For example, a 2018 review of the
23 scientific literature affirmed not only that "there is ample evidence demonstrating that a component of the
24 sound energy produced by a [wind turbine] is in the low and infrasonic frequency range" ("ILFN"), but

25 also that the literature presents a "strong prima facia case for neural transduction of low-frequency sound]
26 |and [infrasound]." February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 17 at 2 (first quote), 6 (second quote). Carlile

27 et al. (2018) also noted that weighted noise measurements - like the A-weighted measurements typically

28 done for audible noise impact analyses, and the C-weighted measurements required by San Diego County

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 19 -

|Zoning Code section 6952(f)(1) - "exclude crucial low frequencies" from wind turbines. February 26,

2 2021 Comments, Exhibit 17 at 3. Poulsen et al. (2019) similarly noted studies "suggest[ing] that the

3 characteristics of [wind turbine noise] relevant for annoyance may be better captured by metrics focusing
4 on amplitude modulation or low-frequency (LF) noise, rather than the full spectrum A-weighted nose."

5 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 15 at 037005-1. That is one reason Backcountry commissioned

6 Itwo professional studies, one by WIA and a more recent one by dBF, on the wind turbine-generated
7  infrasound, low-frequency noise and amplitude modulated noise in the Boulevard area.

8 52. WIA obtained noise recordings between November 13 and 17, 2018 in the Boulevard and
9 Jacumba Hot Springs areas. WIA found significant impacts from the existing 2 MW Kumeyaay Wind,

10 2.3 MW Tule Wind, and 2.37 MW Ocotillo Wind turbines. The findings are documented in its

11 aforementioned 2019 report that is attached as Exhibit 1 to Backcountry's March 18, 2019 Comments.

12 Among other things, the report and a predecessor 2014 report on earlier noise measurements

13 *conclusively document the presence of [wind turbine] generated infrasound (IS) as measured at

14 residential and other locations up to 8 miles from the wind turbines at the Kumeyaay and Tule [wind
15 project] facilities," and up to 11 miles from the Ocotillo Wind Energy project. March 18, 2019
16 Comments, Exhibit 1 at 1. dbF likewise found significant impacts from the existing, smaller turbines in

17 the Boulevard area. dBF's more recent report, based on noise recordings in the same area from August
18 16, 2019, likewise "conclusively document[s] the presence of ILFN, at homes up to approximately 6
19 |miles away, generated by the [wind turbines] at the Kumeyaay and Tule facilities." February 26, 2021
20 Comments, Exhibit 13 at 1. The Project's proposed turbines, by contrast, are 4.2 MW. They are much
21  larger, more powerful and much noisier than are the existing turbines in the Boulevard area, and will

22 therefore have far greater negative impacts on both people and wildlife.

23 53. Rather than include a serious analysis of the levels and environmental impacts of ILFN
24 produced by the Project, the FEIR and its AAR try to sweep the issue under the rug with spurious claims.

25 The AAR dismisses the issue by citing a 2016 RSG report claiming that the wind turbines produce

26 infrasound that is "at the least, 25 dB below ISO 7196 audible perception thresholds." FEIR, Appendix G

27 at 36. But as Dr. Richard Carman explains in WIA's review:

28 the RSG study is completely irrelevant to evaluating the effects on infrasound because the RSG study does not evaluate the effects of noise levels below the threshold of audibility.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 20 -

The RSG study presumes that a sound level has no effect on the human ear unless it is audible. But this premise has no basis in science, and ignores the relevant question. The
2 relevant question is whether a sound level - whether infrasound or not - causes physiological changes in the ear. The research by Salt and others shows that humans could
3 be negatively impacted by sound levels significantly below the threshold of audibility.

4 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 9 at 7. The FEIR ignores the issue for an equally
5 lunmeritorious reason - because the "County does not have any regulations or standards pertaining
6 Ito infrasound levels." FEIR 05-8. That violates CEQA. CEQA does not require a formal impact
7 Istandard as a precondition for analyzing and determining the significance of an environmental
8 impact. Berkeley Keep Jets, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1370-1371.
9 The EIR Fails to-Analyze the Project's Greenhouse Gas Emissions
10 54. The FEIR boasts that the "Project would avoid more [greenhouse gas (GHG)]
11 lemissions than it would generate, resulting in less than cumulatively considerable climate
12 change impacts." FEIR 3.1.4-32. But the FEIR fails to quantify the Project's lifecycle GHG
13 lemissions. Many authoritative published life cycle analyses demonstrate that wind energy
14 projects like the proposed Campo and Torrey wind projects have many more sources of GHG
15 emissions than just on-site construction and operation. As one recent study states, "due to GHG
16 lemissions produced during equipment manufacture, transportation, on-site construction,
17 maintenance, and decommissioning, wind and solar technologies are not GHG emission free."
18 February 26, 2021 Comments, Exhibit 18 at SI36. That same study concluded, based on a
19 "*systematic review and harmonization of life cycle assessment (LCA) literature of utility-scale
20 wind power systems," that industrial-scale wind turbines produce 11 g CO,-eq/kWh (median
21 value, with a range of 3 g CO,-eq/k Wh to 45 g CO,-eq/kWh). Id. at SI36, SI46. To meaningfully
22 analyze the Project's global warming impact in compliance with CEQA, the County must conduct
23 lifecycle assessment of the Project's GHG emissions.
24 55. The FEIR cites Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach (2011)
25 52 Cal.4th 155, 175 to support its assertion that a "lifecycle analysis is not required." FEIR 05-9.
26 That case involved a small city's proposal to ban plastic bags, and the relative environmental
27 impacts of plastic bags versus paper bags. The Court concluded that lifecycle analysis would not
28 be useful in that instance because one small city's ban on plastic bags would not increase the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 21 -

1 overall supply for paper bags enough to change overall supply. Here, by contrast, the production
2 of wind turbines is often project dependent, with components made to order. The wind turbines

3 for the Project might not be built absent the Project, making the turbines' manufacturing impacts
4 indirect impacts of the Project that require analysis in the EIR.

5 The EIR Fails to Analyze the Project's Impacts on Groundwater Supply

6 56. Construction and operation of the Project would require substantial water supplies

7 approximately 173 acre-feet just for construction - much of which is proposed to be pumped

8 from the well field on the Campo Band of Digueño Mission Indians Reservation. FEIR 3.1.5-3.

9 That is the same well field that SDG&E had planned to use to supply the water for construction of

10 its East County Substation in 2013. However, pumping from the well field had to be stopped.after

11 only 36 acre-feet of groundwater had been extracted, due to lack of aquifer recharge. Id. The

12 IFEIR fails to analyze the likelihood that the well field would once again fail to provide sufficient
13 water supplies and the resulting impacts both to the on-Reservation well field, the aquifer as a
14 whole, and the additional water supply sources the Project proponents would need to tap to
15 complete construction.

16 57. The FEIR and the Groundwater Resources Evaluation ("GRE") on which it is

17 based also understate the Project's likely groundwater impacts in numerous other ways. Snyder
18 Geologic identifies many of these deficiencies in its independent review of the nearly identical
19 | groundwater resources evaluation underpinning the Bureau of Indian Affairs' hydrologic impact

20 |analysis in its Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Campo Wind Project. Snyder
21 Geologic's technical review identifies five principal errors in the GRE's analysis. The review,

22 which explains these errors in detail, is attached to the February 26, 2021 Comments as Exhibit

23 19. In brief, the five errors identified by Snyder Geologic are as follows. First, the GRE

24 understates the existing groundwater demand in the Project area. February 26, 2021 Comments,

25 Exhibit 19 at 1. Second, the GRE understates the impacts of the Project's groundwater demand

26 on local well drawdown by averaging the 173-acre-foot demand over a 5-year a period instead of

27 the 14-month construction period. Id. at 3; FEIR, Appendix J-1 at 27-28. Third, the GRE omits
28 "key variables or misappl[ies] key principles of hydrogeologic analysis" in at least four respects,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES • 22 -

1 which causes the GRE to understate the Project's groundwater impacts. February 26, 2021

2 Comments, Exhibit 19 at 3-5. Fourth, as already discussed above, the GRE ignores the
3 groundwater impacts caused by pumping a substantially smaller volume of water from the same
4 aquifer for the Bast County Substation project. Id. at 5-6. Fifth, the GRE failed to examine the

5 drawdown impacts of pumping from the on-Reservation wells with actual data on the hydrologic
6 properties of the southern well field, let alone pump tests from the wells themselves. As Snyder
7 Geologic concludes, "this unexplained omission does not meet the standard of care and is

8 unacceptable." Id. All five of these errors in the GRE propagate to the FEIR and preclude

9 informed review of and decisionmaking on the Project.

10- SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief to Set Aside the Board's Project Approvals as Contrary to the San Diego County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance)
12 58. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.
13 59. Petitioners bring this Second Cause of Action on the grounds that the Board's adoption of
14 (the Project Approvals was ultra vires and must be set aside because the Campo Wind Project - which
15 cannot proceed without the Boulder Brush Facilities - would violate the San Diego County General Plan
16 and Zoning Ordinance, and in particular its renewable energy regulations.
17 60. As a general law jurisdiction, San Diego County must comply in its planning, zoning and
18 permitting decisions with the state Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code section 65000 et seq.).
19 That includes complying with the County's own General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. As elucidated 1R
20 Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras ("Neighborhood") (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176,
21 1184:
22 To view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law
23 ([Government Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§ 65860); the adopted general plan must conform with state law (§§ 65300,
24 65302). The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. These laws delimit the authority of the permit issuing agency to act and
25 establish the measure of a valid permit. . A permit action taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires as to any defect implicated by the uses
26 sought by the permit.

27 Id.

28 61. Furthermore, where the local government approves a project in its quasi-adjudicatory

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 23 -

1 capacity, as the Board did here, it is that government's burden to demonstrate through findings, and with

2 levidence in the record supporting those findings, that the project in question and the use permits
3 required for that project - are consistent with the relevant general plan and zoning ordinance. CCP cop

4 1094.5(b) ("Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required
by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the

6 evidence"). The Supreme Court explained the importance of findings in a seminal 1974 case as follows:

7 [A] findings requirement serves to conduce the administrative body to draw legally relevant sub-conclusions supportive of its ultimate decision; the intended effect is to
8 facilitate orderly analysis and minimize the likelihood that the.agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions.
9 Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles ("Topanga") (1974) 11 Cal.3d
10 506, 516. Thus, pursuant to CCP section 1094.5, judicial review of the Board's Project Approvals
11 lextends not only to whether the Project and Project Approvals are consistent with the County General
12 Plan and Zoning Ordinance a as a matter of law, but also to (1) whether the Board made the requisite
13 findings, and (2) whether those findings are supported by the evidence.
14 62. Here, because the Campo Wind Project does not comply with the County General Plan and
15 Zoning Ordinance, and because the Board failed to make the requisite findings of compliance, the Board
16 lacked the authority to approve the Project and its Project Approvals were ultra vires. Any "permit action
17 taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires." Neighborhood, 156
18 |Cal.App.3d at 1184.
19 .63. The primary purpose of the Boulder Brush Facilities is to connect the proposed 60-turbine
20 Campo Wind Project to SDG&E's existing Sunrise Powerlink transmission lines. FEIR ES-3, 1-5.
21 Because the Campo Wind Project's turbines could not operate - and indeed would not be built - without
22 the Boulder Brush Facilities, they are effectively part of the same project for purposes of the County's
23 Renewable Energy Regulations, including Zoning Ordinance section 6952, which governs the siting and
24 operation of large wind turbines and implements the County General Plan. It is true that the Campo
25 Wind Project would be located on the Campo Reservation. But neither the principles of tribal
26 sovereignty nor the relevant federal laws "bar all incidental on-reservation consequences of County
27 regulations." Santa Rosa Band of Indians v. Kings County, 532 F.2d 655, 669 (9th Cir. 1975); cf.
28 California Coastal Commission v Granite Rock Company, 480 U.S. 572 (1987).
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND ATTORNEY'S FEES - 24 -

64. The Campo Wind Project - and thus the Boulder Brush Facilities that enable it - would

2 |violate the County's General Plan and its Renewable Energy Regulations. The General Plan provides in
3 Chapter 1, concerning how the plan is to be implemented, that '[t]he County administers its General Plan
4 primarily through its Zoning Ordinance," as "zoning specifies specific uses and development standards,"

5 and explains that zoning must be consistent with the General Plan. Id. at page 1-14. The General Plan

6 Conservation and Open Space Element provides in Policy 18.3, entitled "Alternative Energy System
7 Impacts," that the County must "[r]equire alternative energy system operation to properly design and

8 |maintain these systems to minimize adverse impacts to the environment." Id. (emphasis added).

9 65. Contrary to these General Plan requirements, the County's approval of the Campo Wind

10 /Project does not "minimize adverse impacts to the environment." For example, it violates Zoning

11 Ordinance section 6952(g), which requires that large wind turbines "shall comply with Federat Aviation

12 Administration height requirements and day and night marking requirements and shall not create an
13 airport hazard or interfere with military or emergency services aviation operations, such as aerial

14 firefighting." The Campo Wind Project violates that provision in multiple respects. Indeed, as discussed

15 labove and in petitioners' February 26, 2021 Comments, the FAA has stayed issuance of its potential
16 approvals for the Campo Wind Project. Among other issues, the wind turbines would compromise the

17 safest flight route for crossing the mountains in winter.

18 66. In addition, the Campo Wind Project poses immense wildfire risks, both by increasing the

19 risk of fire ignition and by impeding wildfire fighting, as also described above. These impacts also

20 violate the County General Plan's mandate that alternative energy systems must "minimize adverse
21 impacts to the environment," and Zoning Ordinance section 6952(g), which directs that large wind

22 turbines "shall not . . . interfere with .. . emergency services aviation operations, such as aerial

23 firefighting."

24 67. In sum, because the Campo Wind Project does not comply with the County General Plan
25 and Zoning Ordinance, and because the Board failed to make the requisite findings of compliance, the
26 Board lacked the authority to approve the Project and its Project Approvals were therefore ultra vires.
