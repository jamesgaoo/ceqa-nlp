Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 1. The non-profit Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC, brings this
action in the public interest on behalf of thousands of elders and other residents of

5 San Francisco neighborhoods citywide. The Consortium alleges that the environmental

6 impact report process for the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan and Long

7 Range Development Plan failed to adequately analyze and mitigate its broad-ranging

8 significant environmental impacts, and seeks enforcement of mandates of the
California Environmental Quality Act.
10

11 The UCSF Medical Center and Research Complex at Parnassus Heights, Mission

12 Bay, and other locations is a foundation of San Francisco's economy and a vital health

13 care provider for city residents. UC proposes to expand four million square-feet of
14

15 medical, administrative, and research facilities at its original, now-constrained

16 Parnassus Heights campus by 50%, to six million square-feet. The new Comprehensive

17 Parnassus Heights Plan expansion plan would replace the 2014 Long Range

18 Development Plan that envisions no significant increase in campus size.

19 The Consortium brings this action out of concern for San Francisco's affected
20

21 citywide urban environment, especially since unadopted plan alternatives would

22 accomplish UCSF's expansion with fewer significant adverse environmental impacts.

23 Parnassus Heights is one of the most difficult locations in the City for commuter

24 access. Just as UCSF's Mission Bay campus launched development in Mission Bay
25

26 twenty years ago, a portion of the proposed expansion at the Parnassus campus could

27 instead occur along San Francisco's Central and Southern Waterfront. Feasible

28 expansion sites are available closer to the Mission Bay campus and could provide

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 almost 20,000 units of new housing with over 6,000 affordable units. Locating UCSF

2 expansion near the city's eastside communities will maximize access for those residents
3 to community benefits.
4

5 UCSF's CEQA process for this impactful project was inadequate in multiple

6 respects. To comply with state law, the EIR must be revised to achieve good-faith,

7 complete analysis of significant environmental impacts, mitigations, and project

8 alternatives and to adequately respond to public comments. The Regents of the
9

10 University must then comply with CEQA's substantive mandates by revising their

11 plans with feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.

12 A peremptory writ of mandamus should issue in the public interest.

13

14 Jurisdiction and Venue

15
2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code sections 21168
16

17 et seq. and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The Regents' principal

18 administrative offices are located in Alameda County where this action is filed.

19

20 Parties

21 3. Petitioner Yerba Buena Consortium is a California LLC that is a subsidiary

22 of the California non-profit corporation Tenants and Owners Development

23 Corporation (TODCO), dedicated to affordable housing issues in San Francisco since
24

25 the 1970s. TODCO continues to manage, renovate, and improve almost 1000 units of

26 affordable housing and to maximize the quality of life for residents of city

27 neighborhoods through community planning and advocacy undertaken by its

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 Consortium. The Consortium brings this petition on behalf of others similarly situated

2 too numerous to be brought before this Court as petitioners. The Consortium

3 exhausted administrative remedies by commenting on the UCSF Comprehensive
4

5 Parnassus Heights Plan and Long Range Development Plan EIR and objecting to the

6 inadequacy of the Regents' CEQA process and Plan approvals.

7 4. Respondent University of California is the lead agency and applicant for

8 the Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan and Long Range Development Plan,
9

10 approved by respondent The Regents of the University of California.

11 5. Does 1 to 5 are fictitiously named respondents whose true names and

12 capacities are currently unknown to petitioner. When their true names and capacities

13 become known, the Consortium will amend this petition to assert them.
14

15 General Allegations

16
6.
17 The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents

18 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

19 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

21 Project Description and Environmental Setting

22 7. As described by the Regents' CEQA Notice of Determination, "the

23 Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan (CPHP) contains master plan level guidance
24

25 for the overall physical environment at Parnassus Heights. It focuses on the

26 configuration of buildings and open space areas and the major types of uses within

27 buildings. The CPHP proposes four Initial Phase projects to be completed by 2030 and

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 they are: (1) New Hospital at Parnassus Heights; (2) New Research and Academic

2 Building; (3) Irving Street Arrival Improvements; and (4) Aldea Housing

3 improvements. Beyond the Initial Phase, the Future Phase encompasses the remaining
4

5 development .. envisioned for completion by the horizon year of 2050. In total, the

6 CPHP provides for development of approximately 2.9 million gross square feet of new

7 building space at Parnassus Heights. Because the CPHP proposes to modify the

8 Parnassus Heights development plan identified in the 2014 Long Range Development
9.
Plan (LRDP), Amendment #7 to the 2014 LRDP is proposed." 10

11 8. The UCSF Parnassus Heights campus includes 107 acres in the dense Inner

12 Sunset neighborhood. The 61-acre Mount Sutro Open Space Reserve occupies the

13 central and southern portion of the campus. The campus elevation provides scenic
14
views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands, Golden Gate Park, and the ocean. 15

13 Environmental Review and Approval Process

14 9. A CEQA Initial study for the Parnassus CPHP project was published in

15 January 2020. A public meeting to scope the EIR was then held in February.
16

17 The Regents published the Draft EIR on July 13, held a virtual public hearing on

18 August 26, and received written public comments through September 11.

19 10. EIR Comments covered a wide range of topics and potentially-significant

20 environmental impacts, including, inter alia, Alternatives, Space Ceiling, Aesthetics,
21 Toland Hall Murals, Traffic/Transit/Ambulance/ Parking, Housing, Population, Land
22

23 Use, Wind, Shadow, Bird Strikes, Historic Resources, and Water Quality/Stormwater /

24 Wastewater. The Consortium submitted a comment letter and objected to the Plans.

25 The Final EIR with responses to a comments and a Supplement were published in
26 January 2021. The Regents met virtually to certify the EIR and approve the project
27

28 during the week of January 18, 2021. The Consortium's representative submitted a

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 request to provide public comment but was not called upon to speak due to the

2 number of speakers requesting time during the virtual event.

3 11. The University of California filed and posted a Notice of Determination on
4

5 January 22, 2021. This action is timely filed on February 19, 2021.

6 12. The Consortium has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the

7 ordinary course of law. Issuance of : a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate,

8 severe, and irreparable harm to the Consortium and San Francisco residents via
9

10 approval and implementation of the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan

11 and Long Range Development Plan without compliance with state law. Respondents

12 have the capacity to correct their violations of law but fail and refuse to do so.
13

14 Notice of CEQA Suit

15 13. The Consortium has complied with Public Resources section 21167.5

16 by providing the respondents with notice of its intention to commence this action.
17
It has also served notice of this action
18 upon the California Attorney General.

19

20 Election to Prepare Administrative Record

21 14. The Consortium elects to prepare the record of proceedings

22

23 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

24 15. The Consortium incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
25 16. The University of California abused its discretion and failed to act in the
26

27 manner required by law in certifying the EIR and relying upon its content to approve

28 the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan and Long Range Development Plan

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 Central SoMa Plan without adequate environmental review. The EIR's analysis was

2 incomplete and prejudiced project approval.

17. The EIR failed to serve as an adequate public disclosure document in its
4
analysis of significant environmental impacts, site-specific and cumulative, inter alia

6 and according to proof upon certification of the administative record:
land use conflicts

8 inconsistency with prior plans and the space ceiling / square-foot cap
9 population and housing

10 transportation
cultural and historical resources
11 biological resources
12 greenhouse gas emissions

13 energy consumption

14 noise
aesthetics
15 wind

16 shadow

17
18.
18 The EIR failed to identify and adequately analyze potentially-feasible

19 mitigation measures and potentially-feasible alternatives, including locating a portion

20 of the Parnassus Plan off-site as suggested by the Consortium and others.

21 19. The Final EIR failed to adequately respond to comments relating to
22 alternatives and significant impacts, including comments made by the Consortium.
23

24 20. The findings certifying the EIR and approving the UCSF Comprehensive
25 Parnassus Heights Plan and Long Range Development Plan were inadequate and

26 unsupported by substantial evidence, including but not limited to findings regarding

27 EIR adequacy and analysis, responses to Draft EIR comments, and the feasibility of
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1. mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or avoid significant impacts.

2

3 WHEREFORE, the Consortium prays:

4 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering the Regents

5 to rescind their certification of the UCSF Comprehensive Parnassus Heights Plan and
6

7 Long Range Development Plan, to void all project approvals and entitlements, and to

8 refrain from reconsidering approval pending revision, recirculation, and certification of

9 a revised EIR that fully complies with CEQA;

10 2. For costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5; and
11
3. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper. 12
