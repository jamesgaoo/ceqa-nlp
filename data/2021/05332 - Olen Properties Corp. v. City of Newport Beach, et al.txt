PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
Petitioner Olen Propertics Corp, ("Olen") respectfully alleges as follows:
BACKGROUND

1, Approving a 312 unit residential complex planned to be built on ground owned by others
objecting to the Project, Respondent the City of Newport (the "City") has violated the requirements of
the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") as well as numerous provisions of California
planning law.
2., This 312 unit Project is planned to be built in the existing common area of the "Koll
Center" Business Park. located in the City, despite numerous significant environmental impacts and
10 despite the complete incompatibility of the Project with the surrounding uses and surrounding
11 community,
12 There are no nearby sorvices to support this "community" that will be literally dropped
13 into the middle of a thriving Business Park.
14 Olen is the owner of property located at 4910 Birch Street in the Koll Center. Olen has
15 been a strong member of the Newport Beach family for over forty years.
16 5. Real Party in Interest TPG (KCN) Acquisition, LLC (*TPG") sought and received
17 approvals from the City for a five-story residential building consisting of 312 residential units to be
18 constructed on the existing common area of the Koll Center which is currently owned in part by Olen and
19 did not secure Olen's permission.
20 6. In fact, many of the owners of the common area oppose this Project that is being built on
their property, The City did not seek or obtain consent from all of the owners of the common area, many 22| of whom protested and challenged the present Project.
23 7. This is the story of a developer swifly and improperly pushing through the approval * process a significant, environmentally impactful project to avbid public scrutiny and comment. 25 Attempting to plap a huge residential structure into the middle of an existing and vibrant Business Park,
26| TPG avoided the legal requirement to prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") under CEQA.
27 8. Instead of complying with the requirements of CEQA and preparing an EIR for this highly
28 unusual and legally-improper project, TPG instead avoided the requirements of CEQA and prepared an

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"Addendum" to'a prior EIR the City had approved almost 15 years carlier in 2006.
9. By taking this uncommon step of avoiding the preparation of an EIR for this huge and
environmentally-impactful Project, TPG and the City wore able to avoid legally-required analysis, public
comment and response to those comments, In addition, by skipping EIR preparation, the City avolded its
responsibilities under CEQA,
THE PARTIES
10. Olen is a Florida corporation doing business in Orange County, California:

11. The City is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a municipal corporation organized
under the laws of the State of California with land use and planning jurisdiction over the Project that is
10 the subject of this Petition.
11 12, TPG is a Delaware limited lability company that does business in Orange County
12 California, and is the Applicant for the CEQA approvals at issue in the present case.

13 13. The City is required by law to comply with the requirements of CEQA, Public Resources
14 Code sections 21000 ef seq. prior to any actions or approvals with the potential to affect the environment.
15 14. Olen is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that TPG is a limited purpose
16 corporation. TPG sought and obtained approval for the Project that is the subject of this Petition.
17 15. Olen is ignorant of the true names and capacitics of respondents sued herein as Does
18 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues said respondents by such fictitious names. Olen will amend this
19 Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of said Doe respondents as soon as the same have been
20 ascertained. Olen is inforied and believes, and thereon alleges, that each of the fictitiously named
21 respondents are responsible in some manner for the acts alleged herein.
22 16. Olen is ignorant of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest sued herein as
23 Does 11 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues said real pacties in interest by such fictitious names.
24 Olen will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of said Doe real parties in interest
25 as soon as the same have been ascertained. Olen is informed and belieyes, and thereon alleges, that each
26 of the fictitiously named real parties in interest are responsible in some manner for the acts alleged
27  herein.

FETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
17. This Court has jurisdiction to review the City's actions and determinations under Code of

3 Civil Procedure sections 525, et seq-+ 1085, and 1094.5. This Court la further authorized to grant the
relief sought herein pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.
18. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) because the
6 City is located within the County of Orange ("County").
OLEN HAS COMPLIED WITH ALL PRE-LITIGATION REQUIREMENTS
19. Olen has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service of a
notice upon the City indicating its intent to file this Petition.

10 20; Olen has exhausted all administrative remedies in that the actions and determination by
1l the City are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are available by state or local law. In
12 | addition, Olen exhausted its administrative remedies by presenting letters on or about January 11,2021
13 and January 26, 2021, commenting on the Project and by orelly commenting on the Project at the January
14 26. 2021 hearing on the Project. In addition, because Olen commented on the Frojoct, it can use any of
15 the issues or arguments raised by any other person or company even if Olen did not directly raise that
16 argument or issue itself.
17 21. Olen does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
18  because Olen and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damages and the
19 City's violations of CEQA and state and local planning laws.
20 22.: Olen is boneficially interested in the subject mutter of the Petition.
21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 23. TPG applied to the City for numerous permits and the approval of an Addendum under
23 CEQA which would allow them to construet a five-story, 312 unit residential complex in the common
24 arca of the Koll Center in Newport Beach commonly known as the "Residences at 4400 Von Karman
25 Project" (the "Project").
26 24. All of the existing buildings within the Koll Center are exclusively office and commercial.
27 There are currently no residences located within the Koll Center.
28 25. Olen is a non-exclusive owner of large parts of the common areas of the Project site.

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Multiple owners of buildings within the Koll Center that are also non-exclusive owners of the common
areas of the Project site also objected to the approval of the Project.
26. The Project applications to the City incladed an amendment to the Planned Community
Development Plan, a Major Site Development Review, a Lot Line Adjustment, an Affordable Housing
Implementation Plan, a Traffic Study, and a Development Agreement.
27. The City ineorrectly determined that CEQA compliance could be achieved through the
preparation of an Addendum "tiering" off of the City's 2006 General Plan EIR. While CEQA does not
absolutely bar the use of "tiering" for a 15-year old document, significant new facts and information as
well as significant changes in circumstances all mandated the creation of an EIR to study this complex
10  and impactful Project.

11 28. TPG's Applications were considered and approved by the City on January 26, 2021. The
12 City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") with the County on February 1, 2021. There is no
13 evidence that the City filed the NOD with the State Clearinghouse.
14 29, Ifallowed to move forward, the City's approval will result in the development of 312
15 apartment units with an 825-space subterranean parking structure and an additional off-site 284-space
16 parking structure located approximately 600 feet southeast of the Project. The Project would be
17 constructed on existing parking lots and other common areas, which provide on-site parking for multiple
18 existing office buildings, including the bullding owned by Olen at 4910 Birch Street.
19 30. While the Project site is actually 3.41 ncres, the pertinent Covenants, Conditions and
20 Restrictions (*CC&Rs") that are applicable to the Koll Center cover almost 14 acres.
21 31. While the CC&Rs wore never mentioned in the approved documents, they fundamentally
22 Fimpact the development of the challenged Project.
23 32. First, the Project is being developed on land ownad by others, including Olen, against the
24 will of many of those owning the land where the Project will be constructed.
25 33. Second, some Project approvals require a 10-aere Projoct site, while it is clear on the face
261 of the Applications that the Project Site is 3.41 acres. The Project Site consists of only three acres as is
27 clearly shown throughout the Addendum. However, the Applicant and the City added more than seven
28 acres of land that has nothing to do with the Project to claim that the Project is 10 acres. This claim is

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

untrue and unsupported by gubstantinl evidence in the record.
34. In addition, there are compatibility, noise, traffic, aesthetics, hazardous materials, and
parking issues that are in conflict with the approvals issued by the City.
STANDARD OF REVIEW
35. For the CEQA claims, this Project cannot use or "tier off of" a former EIR if any of the
following conditions are met: 1) substantial changes are proposed in the Project which will require major
revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects of a
substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant elfect; or 2) substantial changes
occur with respect to the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken which will require major
10 revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a

11 substanttal increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects; or 3) new information of
12 substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of
reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR. was certified as complete shows any of the following:
a) the Project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; or b)
15 significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous
16 EIR; or e) mitigation measures or alternatives previously not found to be feasible would in fact be
17 feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the Project, but the Project
18 proponents declined to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or d) mitigation measures or
19 l alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially
20 reduce one or more signiticant effects on the environment, but the Project proponents decline to adopt the
21 mitigation measure or alternative. (Cal. Code Reg. section 15162.)
22 36. Challenges to the land ose approvals for the Project are governed by the "abuse of" A discretion" standard. "Abuse of discretion" is established when: the agency has not proceeded in the 24 manner required by law; the order or decision is not supported by the findings; or the findings are not 25 supported by the evidence. (See Leal v. Gourley, (2002) 100 Cal.App:4th 963, 968).

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

CEQA IS CRITICAL COMPONENT OF THE CITY'S LAND USE APPROVAL
PROCESS

37. CEQA compliance is critical component of any city's land use approval process and is
intended to benefit the public and decision makers.
38. CEQA describes an EIR as "an informational document which ... shall be considered by
every public agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a Project."
39, The purpose of an EIR is to provide the public and publie agencies "with detailed
information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment; to list ways in

10 which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized; and to indicate alternative to such a
project." (Cal. Pub. Res. Code section 21061)
11 40. CEQA's fundamental objective is "to ensure *that environmental considerations play 2t
12 significant role in governmental decision-making.โข*. (Fullerton Joint Union High Schoal District ยป. State
13 Board of Education (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779.
14 41. To facilitate CEQA's informational role, a legally-compliant CEQA document must
15 contain facts and analysis, not just the City's bare conclusions and opinions.
16 42. This requirement enables the decision-makers and the public to make an "independent,
17 reasoned judgment" about proposed project. (Santtago Coumty Water Disx. v. County of Orange
18 (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 831; People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 830, 841 (requirement
19| of detail in EIR "helps insure the integrity of the process of decision by precluding stubborn problems or
20 serious criticism from being swept under the rug.**): (see also Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14, 8 15151.)
21 43.
22. "Public participation is an essential part of the CEQA process" (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 14,

23 15201), and several CEQA provisions recognize its importance.
44.
8 2 By avoiding the required preparation of an EIR, the City bypassed the requirement for
EIRs that it be circulated for 45 days for public comment. By using an Addendum, it deprived the public
of the ability to meaningfully participate.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of CEQA - Failure to Prepare Subsequent or Supplemental EIR -- Against All Parties)
45. Olen incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 44 as though fully set forth herein.
46. The approval of the Project is a "project" under CEQA. CEQA requires appropriate
environmental review to be conducted by the lead agency prior to the approval and implementation of the

6 Project. The City is the lead ageney under CEQA since it ds the public agency that approved the Project.

7 Yet, the City hes never conducted proper environmental review of the Project,
47. Among other things, the City improperly determined that the Project could be analyzed
9 with an Addendum lustead of a projeci-specific EIR, or a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR tiered off of
10 the 2006 General Plan EIR.

11 48, The City's determination ta incorrect and is unsupported by substantial evidence in the
12 administrative record for the approval of the Project.
49, The Project was improperly approved by the City with the use of an Addendum despite
substantial evidence in the record showing that the Project will trigger all of the eleinents mandating
15 preparation of a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR.
16 50. There are substantial changes proposed in the Project which will require major revisions
17 of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial
18  increase in the severity of previously identified signiticant effect.
19 51. Substantial changes have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the
20 Project is undertaken that require major revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new
21 significant environmental effects or a substรคntial increase in the severity of previously identitied
22 significant eflects.

23 52. There is new information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not
24  have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as
25 complete that shows any of the following; a) the Project will have one or more significant effects not
26 | discussed in the previous EIR; or b) significant effects previously examined will be substantially more
27 severe than shown in the previous EIR; or e) mitigation measures or alternatives previously not found to
28 be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project, but the Project proponents declined to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or d)
2 mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous

3 EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the Project
proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

5 53. TRAFFIC - There are significant changes with respect to traffic conditions which require
major revisions of the previous EIR due to new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase

T in the severity of previously-identified significant effects.

8 54. Substantial changes have oceurred with respect to traffic that have significantly changed
9 the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken which requires major revisions of the previous
10 EIR due to the involvement of new signiticant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the

โก1 severity of previously identified significaut effects.
12 55. There is new information of substantial importance regarding traftic, which was not
13 known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous
14 EIR was certified as complete that shows any of the following: a) the Project will have one or more
15 significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; or b) significant effects previously examined will be
16  substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; or c) mitigation measures or alternatives
17 previously not found to be feasible would in fhet be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more
18 significant effects of the Project, but the Project Proponents declined to adopt the mitigation measure or
19 alternative; or d) mitigation mensures or alternatives which are considerably different from those
20 analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the
21 environment, but the Project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.
22 56. Aftor the approval of the City's General Plan in 2006 (which is the "base" document for
23 the Addendum), the City sued the City of Irvine over the development and construction of new
* 8 residential development in the Irvine Business Complex (*IBC),
57. The present Project is located either within or immediatcly adjacent to the IBC. 26 580 During the course of the several cases litigated against the City of Irvine, the City took the
27 position in legal briefs filed with the court that adding a single residential traffic trip to the IBC was a.
28 significant environmental impact..

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

59. Both before and after the adoption of the 2006 City General Plan, the City argued
extensively that an Addendum should never be used for any residential project within the IBC.
3 60. At the time the EIR was adopted by the City of Newport Beach in 2006, Level of Service

4 ("LOS") was the approved method for determining traffic impacts. LOS measures a vehicle's "wit

5 time" at an intersection and was used to determine traffic flow and traffic impacts.

61; With the adoption of CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3, LOS has been expressly rejected
as a method of determining significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Vehicle Miles Traveled
("VMT*) has been adopted as the sole methad of determining traffic impacts under CEQA. In fact,

9 under the Guidelines, "a project's effect on automobile delay shall not constitute a significant
10 environmental impact.*

11 62 Despite this new, and clearly applicable requirement, no effort was made by the City to:
12 undertake a VMT-based approach to Project traffie. Unlike 1.OS, VMT ignores driver wait times and
13 instead focuses solely on the number of miles vehicles will travel because of new development -an
14 entirely new and different method of measurement that is completely incompatible with LOS. Instead,
15 the City incorrectly uses LOS and then further incorrectly calculates the actual impact of the Project on
16 LOS, understating the actual Project impacts.
17 63. The City's ase of LOS instead of VMT is fatal to the Addendum.

18 64. The City's traffie impact analysis (*TIA") analysis only studied and planned for 128 units
instead of the 312 units (260 units plus density bonus) in the Project.

20 65. The Addendum provides the thresholds of significance used by the City to determine

21 traditional LOS, and asserts that only this means of analysis was required, because VMT analysis was not
22 required in 2006. These conditions result in multiple failures in the traffic analysis.
23 66. For traffic, the City has two thresholds of significance: (1) significant impacts would
24 oceur if an intersection operuting at acceptable levels were to drop to an unaoceptable level; and (2)
25 significant impacts would accur if an intersection operating at an unacceptable level would regult in the
26 Intersection Capacity Utilization ("ICU") increasing by 1% (a volume to capacity increase of 0.010 or
27 more).

28 67. The Addendum, based on a traffic impact analysis appended to the document, considers

10
PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE

1: multiple scenarios, including opening year and General Plan build-out, with and without the Project.
68, According to the Addendum, and based on the analysis of a qualified traffic engineer,
but all are within the City's 3 opening year with Project impacts" results in slightly increased ICU delays,
thresholds. Hlowever, because the 2006 General Plan EIR significantly under-estimated the units at the
Project site, the traffic study also analyzes the impacts of the Project on General Plan build-out

6 conditions.

69. Under those conditions, although Table 3.16-9 of the traffic study states that there is no
Impact, three failing (LOS E or F) intersections result in increases in ICU of 0.010 in the AM peak hour

9 MacArthur Boulevard at Jamboree Road; Jamboree Road at Birch Street; and Bristol Street North and
10 Campus Drive. The Addendum and traffic study go on to falsely state that the Project will have no
1t impact on traffic. Clearly, both documents are mistaken. The City's threshold for failing intersections is
12 an ICU increase of 0.010, and three failing Project intersections result in an increase of 0.010 when the
13 Project is added to General Plan build-out traffio levels.
14 70. In addition, the cumulative impact analysis in the Addendum falsely concludes that the
15 Project will have no cumulative impact on traffice Given the 2006 General Plan build-out impacts, this is
16 clearly not the case. Therefore, the Addendum has identified a significant impact, as defined in the
17| City's own thresholds of significance,
18 71. The faet that the 2006 General Plan EIR did not require VMT analysis does not exempt
the City from now conducting VMT analysis for the Project. Actually, the CEQA Guidelines are
20 explicit; "Beginning on July 1, 2020, the provisions of this section shall apply statewide." (Section
21 15064.3(โฌ).) Furthermore, Guidelines section 15007(b) states, in part, "New requirements in
2 amendments will apply to steps in the CEQA process not yet undertaken by the date when agencies must 88AR comply with the amondments."

72 The Addendum was released by the City long after the July L, 2020 deadline.
Furthermore, VMT analysis is new information, which was not known at the time the EIR was prepared,
26|| and triggers the need for additional environmental analysis under Guidelines section 15162. Therefore, 27 the City must comply and prepare VMT analysis, determine whether the Project will result in significant
28 impacts, and whether mitigation measures are required.

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

73. The Addendum also fails to adequately analyze the impacts of construction traffic. The
Project is proposed on a fully developed site, but no staging areas or construction vehicle parking areas
are proposed off-site, but will stage construction and construction worker parking on-site further
eliminating parking in ways undisclosed in the Addendum. Construction will extend over a three-year
period, in a fully accupied, fully operational office park. Yet the Addendum does not quantify, nor does
it analyze the impacts of dozens of construction workers' vehicles traveling through and parking on a site
which will already be under-parked because of construction activities; or the effect of 7,000 haul trueks
waiting for, boing loaded with and carrying the 114,000 cubic yards of soil to be exported from the site,
as identified in the Addendum through the surrounding office park over months of excavation work,

10 :74. During the Hearing before the City Council at the time it considered the Project at issue in
11 this Petition, Project representative stated that there were no off-project staging arcas, and that

12 construction workers would park in the construction area unless there is not adequate room in which case
13 that will be parking on common area parking spaces. Construction workers will further constrain and
14 reduce parking to the direct disadvantage and against the rights of other building owners within the Koll
15 Center.

16 75, COVID-19 - Substantial changes have occurred with respect to the Project because of
17 COVID-19 which have significantly changed the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken
18 which requires major revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant
19 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identitied significant effects.
20 76. There is new information of substantial importance about the Project regarding COVID-
21 19, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the
22 time the previous EIR was certified as complete shows any of the following: a) the Project will have one
23 or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; or b) significant effects previously
examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; or e) mitigation measures or 25 | atternntives previously not found to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce
26 one or more significant effects of the Project, but the Project Proponents declined toradopt the mitigation
27 measure or alternative; or d) mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
28 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the

environment, but the Project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

2 77. COVID-19 bas transformed the world in the past year. The cost of construction materials
has skyrocketed (the cost of lumber has tripled), the workforce has become uncertain and destabilized,
4 travel patterns are completely changed and erratic, and international travel is timited or prohibited.
78. "COVID-19" was simply not considered in the Addendum in any way readily
aacertainable to the public.

*79 The significance of COVD-19 is recognized in the Addendum with parking, traffic and air

8 quality analysis all applying a "COVID-19" factor. As an example, parking and traffic studies each have
muhtiplier that is applied to any post-COVID-19 purking or traffic study.

10 80. All of these issues could create significant new impacts on the environment. Because of
11 COVID-19, construction times conld wildly vary from that studied.
12 81. Construction times, and the amount of time the surrounding building owners are exposed
13  to construction noise is a eritical part of the Projcet and its ultimate environmental impacts. There is no

14 indication whatsoever that the City or TPG even considered the construction timing impacts potentially
15 caused by COVID-19.
16 82: There is no discussion at all about how this issue. which has turned the entire world on its
17 head, will almost certainly impact this Project and create significant environmental impacts. A

18 discussion of COVID-19 and its impacts on the Project must be discussed for any CEQA document to be
19| adequate in today's world. The existence of COVID-19 is a significant enough new fact that it triggers
20 the requirement of an EIR by itself.
21 83, The City is well-aware of this issue. Almost every City agenda is printed with a "Special
22 Notice Regarding COVID-19" which completely changes the way the City does business. This is a new
23 and dynamic issue that demands study.
24 84, GREENHOUSE GASES - Substantial chaoges occur with respect to the circumstances
25 under which the Project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR due to the
26  involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substential increase in the severity of
27 previously identified significant effects.
28 85. The Addendum incorrectly states that because the 2006 General Plan EIR does not

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

address greenhouse gases ("OHG"), and because the Housing Element's CEQA document found GHG
2 impacts less than significant, the impact is assumed to be less than significant overall,
86. The City cunnot compure the analysis of Housing Element policies on GHGs with the
actual generation of GHG emissions at General Plan build-out. The Housing Element in no way
considered build-out of all land uses in the City, and cannot be relied upon to accurately reรect GHG

impacts at Goneral Plan buildout.

87. The Addendum does not provide substantial evidence, through the preparation of a
General Plan build-out analysis of GHG impacts, that impacts would be less than significant. The City
cannot, without providing substantial evidence, make this assumption.
10 88. The Addendum provides no evidence that the City considered GHG reduction strategies in
11 its General Plan, ox that General Plan build-out would not have a significant impact on GHG emissions.
12 89. While "tiering" from an old EIR does not reopen that old EIR to challenge, the Addendum
13 must address all legally-required elements of CEQA. Cliven that there was no GHG analysis at all, it
14 must be studied and mitigated in the Addendum. Any dofects in the underlying EIR must be corrected by
15 a legally-sufficient CEQA document.
90 The Project is located in the existing Koll Business Center ("KBC"), which is within the

17 Airport Arca, as defined by the General Plan, and designated Mixed Use Horizontal (MU-H2).
91. General Plan Policy LU6.15.5 caps the number of units allocated in the MU-H2
designation at 2200 units, of which only $50 may be ndditive. The ullocation for these units was to be
20 identified in the Integrated Conceptual Development Plan (*ICDP") for the KBC.
21 92. The KBC allocation under Policy LU6.15.5 is 260 units. Nowhere in the General Plan or

22 the ICDP does the cap allow for additional units based on a granting of a density bonus as occurred in the
23 present case.

24 93. The 550 additive cap was determined based on traffic analysis for the General Plan, which
25 found that redevelopment in the MU-H2 designation would significantly impact traffic and related
26 impacts if a cap were not instituted. The Project proposes 312 units, or 52 more than that allocated to the
27 KBC through the General Plan.
28 94, When the Project, which exceeds General Plan capacity, is added to other projects, it will

14
PETITION POR WRIT OF MANDATE

result in greater impacts to GHG than considered in the General Plan, and in the Housing Klement CEQA
document, because it proposes more units.

3 95. The Project also has the potential to genernte additional commercial uses. No commercial
square footage is included in any of the GHG assumptions, and no analysis of commercial uses' impacts
5 was provided. As such, the GHG analysis is incomplete and insufficient

0 96; Therefore, the Addendum fails to provide substantial evidence that the impacts of the
7 Project on GHG emissions will be less than significant, and a potentially-significant impact is likely. As
8  a result, the provisions of CEQA Quidelinos section 15162 do not apply, and a Suhsequent or

9 Supplemental EIR must be prepared.
10 97. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS - Substantial changes have occurred with
11 respect to hazardous materials which significantly change the circumstances under which the Project is

12 undertaken and requires major revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant
13  environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects.

14 98. There is now information of substantial importance regarding hazurdous materials, which

15 was not known and could not have been knewn with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the

16 previous EIR was certified as complete and that shows any of the following: a) the Project will have one
17 or more signiticant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; or b) significant effects previously
18 examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; or c) mitigation measures or

19 alternatives previously not found to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce

20 one or more significant effects of the Project, but the Project proponents declined to adopt the mitigation

21 measure or alternative; or d) mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
22 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the
23 environment, but the Project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

24 99, The 2006 General Plan EIR did not acknowledge or address the pervasive contamination
25 surrounding and covering portions of the Project area.
26 100 The Addendum considers the Jazz Semiconductor toxio-waste plume : non-issue." The
27 Project's proposed free-standing parking structure is immediately adjacent to the Jazz property, and the
28 proposed apartment building and its parking structure is 700 feet from the Jazz property, in the direction

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of contamination. Excavating soils considerably deeper than what has occurred for the existing business

2 center parking lot increases the potential for the plume to spread, involves the Regional Water Quality

3 Control Board, and creates new vapor challenges that do not exist today as a result of the Project's
proposed underground parking structures.

5 101. The Jazz Semiconductor property has been studied and remediated for many years, and
off-site hazards have been identified. As described in Appendix H of the Uptown Newport EIR, the
worst case "Toxic Endpoint" for Anhydrous Ammonia is 6,336 feet, for Boron Triehloride 3,696 feet, for

8 Chlorine 1,056 feet. for Hydrofluoric Acid 6,336 feet, and for Sulfuric Acid 252 feet from the Jazz
property. The EIR for Uptown Newport identified significant impacts for both on-site and off-aite
10 residents and occupants, and required multiple mitigation measures, yet the subject Project proposes
11 none

12 102. The Addendum fails to disclose that the plume of contaminated soils and groundwater
13 extends northwesterly of the Jazz site, and into the Project site.
14 103. Soil, soil vapors, and shallow and intermediate groundwater are contaminated. The
15 Project will include extensive excavation for the proposed free-standing parking structure's foundations
16  and pilings, as well as at least 20 feet of excavation under the apartment building to accommodate the
17 subterranean parking garage. Both of these activities will result in a significant impact associated with
18 hazardous materials from both construction and operation of the Project.

19 104. In the case of construction, dewatering of exeavated areas with contaminated groundwater
20| during excavation will expose contaminated water and soils. The combination of dewatering, ongoing

21 construction activities and natural wind and stormwater movement will push these contaminants into
22 nearby public waterways, exposing people and the environment to harmful chemicals. No analysis of the 23 | potential impacts of this exposure is conducted in the Addendum, and no mitigation proposed.
24 105. During operutions Volatile Organic Compounds (*VOC) vapors will impact the
25 subterranean parking areas, and the residents and business tenants who will park there. This is not an
26 impact that was considered in the 2006 General Plan EIR, and cannot be tesolved through policy. Long-
27 term exposure to hazardous materials is a significant hazard that cannot be glossed over.
28 106. The Jazz facility continues to operale, and based on the Uptown Newport phasing plan,

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

will still be in operation when the Project is under construction. The Project has the potential to be
2 significantly impacted, and the CEQA document must analyze these potential impacts, determine what
3 mitigation measures are required (including those ldentified in the Uptown Newport EIR), and include
4 them in a Project EIR.

5 107. The Addendum defers mitigation, does not disclose signiticant impacts to decision makers
or the publie, and cannot determine whether impacts can be reduced to less than significant levels.

10%. CC&Rs - There arc significant changes with respect to the Project caused by the effect of
the pertinent Koll Center CC&Rs which require major revisions of the previous EIR due to new
9 significant environmental effects or substantial increase in the severity of previously identified
10 significant effects,
109, Substantial changes have occurred with respect to the Project by operation of the pertinent
12 CC&Rs which have significantly changed the circumstances under which the Project is undertaken and
13 which require major revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant
14 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the sevority of previously idenxified significant effects.
15 110. There is new information of substantial importauce regarding the CC&Rs impact on the
16 Project, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence
17 at the time the previous EIR was certified as complete that shows any of the following: a) the Project will
18 have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; or b) significant effects
19 previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR; or e) mitigation
20| measures or alternatives previously not found to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would
21 substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the Project, but the Project proponents declined to
22| adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or d) mitigation measures or alternatives which are
23 considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more:
24 significant effects on the environment, but the Project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure
25 or alternative

26 11l. The proposed residential Project is being constructed in the middle of an existing, fully-
27: developed Business Park that is subject to detailed CC&Rs. There is literally no mention of the CC&Rs
28 anywhere in the Addendum (or in the 2006 EIR) and yet the CC&Rs limit and control the use of the site.

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

112. The Project as proposed will violate the CC&Rs in several material ways.

113. While "on-grade" parking is required by the CC&Rs, it is being replaced by non "on-
grade" parking structures.
114. The CC&Rs prohibit the development of any project that is neither authorized or
prohibited under the terms of' the CC&Rs if tho new use is incompatible with the interests of the other
Building Owners. Oiven the significant number of conflicts between the current Project and the other
Building Owners, this Project is prohibited under the terms of the CC&Rs.
115, The CC&Rs also prohibit development of any project that is of a different nature or
character of the existing uses if an activity is neither allowed nor prohibited under the CC&Rs. The
101 construction of residential uses is neither allowed nor prohibited under the terms of the CC&Rs, therefore

TE this Project can only move forward when the Declarant undor the CC&Rs: estublishes that the Project is
12 in the best interest of the other building owners. It is not.
116. A three-year construction disturbance, loss of parking quality and quantity, and loss of
significant portions of the common areas, without the permission of the common area owners are all
15 burdens unfairly and illegally placed on the other building owners by this Project in violation of the
16 CC&Rs. Based upon the facts laid out in this Petition alone, the Declarant under the CC&Rs cannot
17 make the required finding and the Project cannot move forward.
117. Ia the present case, NONE of these conditions are being undertaken in a manner.
consistent with the terms of the CC&Rs. This is NOT a private matter. The CC&Rs are known use
20 restrictions and valuable property rights that are being ignored or improperly overridden by the City.
21 118. The stated purpose of the CC&Rs is to "insure proper development, use and maintenance
22 of Property, to protect each Owner of any portion of the Property against improper development or use of
23 other portions of the Property which will depreciate the value of such Owner's portion. . . to prevent
24 haphazard and inharmonious Improvements ...." (CC&Rs, Section 1.02.) 25 119, Unfortunately, the Project does not promote *harmonious" use protecting the rights of
26 existing building owners, but crentes disharmony through tiny setbacks, conflicting internal circulation,
27| parking shortages, noise, and concerns about quiet enjoyment, safety of children thrown into the middle
28 | of a commercial development, and many others.

FEESNSRREZN R UAN SIC 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 120. The CC&Rs violations proposed by TPG and approved by the City will have devastating
2 impacis on other building owners within the Koll Center, all of which will constitute significant

3 environmental impacts. There will be jackhammering less than 14 feet from Olen's preperty. During
construction, there will be a deficit of more than 260 parking places, in violation of the CCXRs.

121. The lack of description of the interaction between the residential and commercial uses is
6 fatal. There is virtually no description of how very Incompatible uses will be forced to coexist.
One commenter described children playing baseball in the parking lot of the commercial uses. This is all
significant new information that is unique to this Project and obviously was not considered in any way in
the 2006 General Plan EIR.

10 122. Olen is harmed by the continual violation of CEQA through the action to approve the
11: Project without the City first having conducted proper environmental review.
12 123;

13 Olen is suffering irreparable harm by having to continually protect its rights, the rights of
the public with respect to anforcement of CEQA, and causing an expenditure of scarce and valuable
14 judicial resources. Olen has no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Olen is entitled to temporary,
15 preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief preventing the City from approving and allowing the Project
16 to go forward without first having conducted proper environmental review.
124. Olen seeks through this action to enforce important rights under the United States and

19 California Constitutions and statutory and other law that affect the public interest and that confer a

20 significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the environment of the City.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 125. [Addendum is Defective Under CEQA - Against All Partiest

t 126. Olen incorporates paragraphs 1-124 as though set forth fully herein.
The approval of the Project is a "project" under CEQA. CEQA requires appropriate
24 environmental review to be conducted by the lead agency prior to the approval and implementation of the
25 Project. The City is the lead agency under CEQA since it is the public agency that approved the Project.
26 Yet, the City has never conducted proper environmental review of the Project.
27 127. Among other things, the City improperly prepared an Addendum to the 2006 General Plan
28 EIR. The Addendum prepared and approved by the City ls riddled by defects and cannot be used to

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

support approval of the Project.
128. The City's determination is incorrect and is unsupported by substantial evidence in the
administrative record for the approval of the Project,
129. The Project was improperly approved by the City with the use of an Addendum despite
5 substantial evidence in the record establishing that the Addendum as approved is defective.
130. IRAFFIC -Near the end of the Addendum it is revealed for the first time that the Project

8 site was not studied for 260 units in the General Plan EIR's traffic impact analysis, but for 128 units.
This is the first time, in 16l pages of purported CEQA analysis, that such a significant shortfall is
rovealed. Indeed, the previous 160 pages assert repeatedly that the Project was analyzed in the 2006
10 General Plan EIR.

11 131. The Addendum provides the thresholds of significance used by the City to determine
12 traditional LOS, and asserts that only this means of analysis was required, becรคuse VMT analysis was not
13 required in 2006. These conditions result in multiple failures in the traffic analysis.
14 132. First, as relates to thresholds of significance, the City has two thresholds: (1) significant
15 impacts would occur if an intersection operating at acceptable levels were to drop to an unacceptable
16 level; and (2) significant impacts would ooour if an intersection operating at an unacceptable level would
17 result in the ICU increasing by 1% (a volume to capacity increase of 0.010 or more).
133 The Addendum, based on Project-spccific fraffic impact analysis appended to the

20 document, considers multiple scenarios, ineluding opening year and General Plan build-out; with and
without the Project. According to the Addendum, and based on the analysis of a qualified truffic
21 engineer, opening year with Project impacts result in slightly increased ICU delays, but all are within the

22 City's thresholds.

23. 134: Because the 2006 General Plan EIR significantly under-estimated the units ot the Project
24 site, the traffic study also analyzes the impacts of the Project on General Plan build-out conditions. H! 26 135. Under those conditions, three failing (LOS E or F) intersections result in incrcases in ICU
of 0.010 in the AM peak hour - MacArthur Boulevard at Jamboree Road; Jamboree Road at Birch Street;
27 and Bristol Street North and Campus Drive. 28 136. The Addendum and traffic study falsely state that the Projoct will have no impact on

20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 traffic. Clearly, both documents are mistaken.

2 137. The City's threshold for failing intersections is an ICU increase of 0.010, and three failing
3 Project intersections result in an increase of 0.010 when the Project is added to General Plan build-out

4 traftic levels.

138. In addition, the Addendum's cumulative impact analysis falsely concludes that the Project
will have no cumulative impact on traffic. Oiven the General Plan build-out impacts, this is clearly not
the case.

8 139. The Addendum has identified a significant impact, as detined in the City's own thresholds
of significance. An EIR must be prepared.
10 140. The fรคct that the General Plan EIR. did not require VMT analysis does not exempt the City
11 from now conducting VMT analysis for the Project. Actually, the CEQA Guidelines are explicit:
12 "Beginning on July 1, 2020, the provisions of this section shall apply statewide." (Section 15064.3(c))
13 Furthermore, Section 15007(b) states, in part, "New requirements in amendments will apply to steps in
14 the CEQA process not yet undertaken by the date when agencies must comply with the amendments.* 15 141. In this case, the Addendum was released by the City long after the July 1,2020 deudline.
16 142. VMT analysis is new information, which was not known at the time the EIR was
17 prepared, and triggers the need for additional environmental analysis under Ouidelines section 15162.
18 Therefore, the City must comply and propare VMT analysis, determine whether the Project will result in
19 significant impacts, and whether mitigation measures are required. This must be done in conjunction
20 with the preparation of an EIR.
21 143. The Addendum also fails to adequately analyze the impacts of construction traffic,
22 144. The Project is proposed on a fully-developed site. Aa stated previously, no staging areas
23 or construction vehicle parking areas are proposed. Construction will extend over a three-year period, in
24 a fully-occupied, fully-operational office park. Yet the Addendum doos not quantify, nor does it analyze
25 the impacts of dozens of construction workers' vehicles trayeling through and parking on a site which
26 will already be under parked because of construction activities; or the effect of 7,000 haul trucks waiting
27 for, being loaded with and carrying the 114,000 cubic yards of exported soil identified in the Addendum
28| through the surrounding office park over months of excavation work.

21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

145. The Addendum must consider all of the potential impacts of construction traffic, not just
2 those on City streets. As currently written, the Addendum fails to adequately analyze construction traffic
3 impacts.
146, GREENHOUSE GASES - The Addendum incorrectly states that because the 2006
General Plan BIR does not address GHGs, and because the Housing Element's CEQA document found
6 GHG impacts less than significant, the impaot is assumed to be less than significant overall. This
argument fails under CEQA,
147. The City cannot compare the analysis of Housing Element policies on GHGs with the
actual generation of GHG emissions at General Plan build-out. The Housing Element in no way
10  considered build-out of all land uses in the City, and cannot be relied upon to accurately reflect GHG
11 impacts at General Plan build-out,
12 148. Furthermore, the Addendum does not provide substantial evidence, through the
13 preparation of a General Plan build-out analysis of QHO impacts, that impacts would be less than
14 significant. The City cannot, without providing substantial evidence, make this assumption.
15: 149. Although the Addendum asserts that the City knew that an analysis of GHG would
16 eventually be required when the 2006 General Plan EIR was prepared, it provides no evidence that the
17| City considered GHG reduction strategies in its General Plan, or that General Plan build-out would not
18 have a significant impact on OHG emissions,
19 150. The Addenduma once again asserts that the Project will not result in increased capacity er
20 density in the zone. That is simply not true. The Koll Business Center area was assigned a maximum of
21 260 units, while the Project preposes 52 more units, and the City has already approved 2,038 units of the
22 2,200 total allowed in the Airport Area, so the most the Project could generate within the General Plan
23 capacity is: 162 units. When the Project, which exceeds. General Plan capacity, is added to other projects,
24 Fit will result in greater impacts to OHG then considered in the General Plan, and in the Housing Element
25 CEQA document, because it propases more units,
26 151. A8 described above, the Project also has the potential to generate additional commercial
27 uses. No commercial square footage is included in any of the GHG assumptions, and no analysis of
28 | commercial uscs* impacts was provided. As such, the OHG analysis is incomplete and insuflicient.

22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 152. Therefore, the Addendumn fails to provide substantial evidence that the impacts of the
2 Project on GHG emissions will be less than significant, and a potentially significant impact is likely.
3 153. AIR QUALITY - The 2006 Ceneral Plan EIR relied on the South Coast Air Quality
Management District's (*SCAQMD") 2003 Management Plan, That plan is no longer valid, and any
5  analysis which uses that plun is by extension invalid.

6 154. "The SCAQMD adopted a substantially updated plan in 2015 which is currently in effect.
It is based on much more well-developed science, and updated data that was not known, and could not be
8 known in 2006. The 2006 General Plan analysis, therefore, is also out of date.
155. The Addendum, however, attempts to compare apples to oranges, by discussing the
10 SCAQMD's 2003 Management Plan in the General Plan discussion in the 2006 General Plan EIR.
11 Inexplicably, the Addendum ignores this analysis and uses the 2016 SCAQMD Management Plan in the
12 Project discussion. The City cannot, without substantial evidence (completely absent here), assume that
13 the Project, which is not consistent with the General Plan, is consistent with both plans.
14 156: The Addendum asserts that the SCAQMD Management Plan is based on the City's
15 population, housing and employment forecasts, and that since the Project is consistent with those
16 forecasts, the Project is consistent with the Management Plan. That is simply not the case, since the
17 Project proposes more units than were allowed or analyzed in the General Plan.

20 157. The Addendum's assertion that the Project is consistent with the Management Plan is
wrong, Impacts will be greater than those considered in the Management Plan.
158. Furthermore, the Project, because it exceeds the density allowed in the General Plan for
21 the site, will generate greater trips and associated emissions. The Addendum falsely elaims that the
8I 22 impacts associated with air emissions will be less than significant and that there will be no substantial

8 N change from the previous analysis.

26 159, Although the Project, on its awn, may not exceed SCAQMD thresholds, the 20% increase

27 represented by the additional 52 units will, without question, worsen the significant cumulative impacts
identified in the 2006 Qeneral Plan EIR, since that document presumably only analyzed 260 units for the
Project site. Consequently, the Project will result in "a substantial increase in the severity of previously
28 identified significant effects," (CBQA Guidelines section 15162(aX(1)), and an Addendum is not the

23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 appropriate document to meet the requirements of CEQA.

2 160 The Addendum discloses that seven pleces of heavy equipment will be used during the
3 grading of the Project site. Oiven that the Project will require the removal of' 114,000 cubic yards of dirt,

4 and that the average load of a dirt hauler is 16 to.20 cubic yards, the Project will require 5,700 to 7,125

5 haul truck trips,

161. The Addendum fails to analyze the health effects of air emissions on surrounding

7 employees and residents of Uptown Newport for the three-year construction period, and in the long term.

8 As required by the Court in Sierva Cub v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, an environmental
document must determine the impacts to people's health resulting from implementation of the Project.
10 Without such an analysis, the air quality impacts have not been thoroughly analyzed, and the City cannot
make an informed decision on the impacts of the Project.

12 162: CULTURAL RESOURCES AND TRIBAL CULTURAL, RESOURCES -The

13 Addendum does not discuss Tribal Cultural Resources at all. CEQA requires that these be addressed,
14 and AB 52 requires that the City conduet Tribal consultation for this Project (and since this Project also

15 requires a General Plan Amendment, SB 18 Tribal consultation is required.)

16 163; No mention of Tribal consultation is made in the Addendum, and the City appears to have

17 failed to meet its obligations under AB 52. This is a critical defect that renders the analysis incomplete
18 and inadequate.

19 164: The Addendum cites both General Plan policy and "Standard Conditions and
20 Requirements* which are inconsistent,

21 165. In the General Plan, policy HR 2.2 requires the presence of an archacological monitor for
22 all grading and/or excavation for a project where resources could occur. The Addendum concedes that
23 the Project site has the potential to yield cultural resources, and since both the apartment building and the

24 free-standing parking structure will excavate far deeper than any excavation undertaken for the current
25 parking lots, this likelihood is heightened. Yet the Addendum's Standard Condition requires only
26 periodic monitoring. Periodic monitoring is inconsistent with the General Plan policy, and cannot assure
27 that impacts will be mitigated, since it cannot be assumed that the archaeologist will be on-site when
28 resources are uncovered. The Addendum, therefore, does not mitigate the potential impact to cultural

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

resources, and the impact remains potentially significant and unavoidable. In this case, 45 required by
2 CEQA, an EIR must be prepared.

3

4 166. HAZARDS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS - The Addendum's analysis of the

5 potential for exposure of neighboring buildings' employees, construction workers and residents to

6 hozards at the adjacent Jazz Semiconductor facility is completely inadequate on multiple fronts and ds
completely unsupported by substantial evidence in the record.
167, The Jaxz Semiconductor property has been studied and ramediated for many years, and
off-site hazards have been identified. As described in Appendix H of the Uptown Newport EIR, the
worst case "Texic Endpoint" for Anhydrous Ammonia is 6,336 feet, for Boron Trichloride 3,696 feet, for
10 Chlorine 1,056 feet, for Hydrofluoric Aรงid 6,336 feet, and for Sulfuric Acid 252 feet from the Jazz

11 property. The Project's free-standing parking structure is immediately adjacent to the Jazz property, and
12 the apartment buildings are 700 feet from the Jazz property, in the direction of contamination. The EIR
13 for Uptown Newport identified significant impacts for both on-aite and off-site residents and occupants,
14 and required multiple mitigation measures.
15 168. The Addendum fails to disclose that the plume of contaminated soils and groundwater
16 extends northwesterly of the Jazz site, and into the Project site. Soil, soil vapors, and shallow and
17 intermediate groundwater are contaminated. "The Project will include extensive excavation for the free-
18 standing parking structure's foundations and pilings, as well as at least 20 fect of excavation under the
19

20 apartment building to accommodate the subterranean parking garage. Both of these activities will Tesult
in a significant impact associated with hazardous materials from both construction and operation of the
21 Project.
22 169. In the case of construction, the excavation will expose contaminated soils, and since
23 perched groundwater acours in this area, dewatering of excavated areas with contaminated groundwater
24 will be required. No analysis of the potential impacts of this exposure is conducted in the document, and
25 no mitigation proposed.
26 88 170. During operations, VOC vapors will impact the subterranean parking areas, and the
residents and business tenants who will park there. This is not an impact that was considered in the 2006
28 Cerieral Plan EIR, and cannot be resolved through policy. Long-term exposure to hazardous materials is

25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a significant hazard that cannot be glossed over.

171, The Jazz facility continues to operate, and based on the Uptown Newport phasing plan,
will still be in operation when the Project is under construction. The Project has the potential to be
significantly impacted, and the CEQA document must analyze these potential impacts, determine what

5 mitigation measures are required Cincluding those in the Uptown Newport EIR), aud include them in a
6 Project EIR. Without this analysis, the Addendum defers mitigation, docs not disclose significant
impacts to decision makers or the public, and cannot determine whether impacts can be reduced to less
8 than significant levels.
172. PROJECT DESCRIPTION - The Addendum under-estimates actual approved build-out
10 potential by 534 units. This is a substantially larger number of units than originally contemplated by in
11 the General Plan and constitutes a substantial change in circumstances surrounding the Project. Asa:

12 result of this significant undercounting, the Addendum does not consider the impacts of build-out of the
13  Project when considering other projects, and fails to properly consider cumulative impacts.
14 173, The Project Description makes no mention of the significant CEQA issues raised by the
15 implementation of compliance with the CC&Rs goyerning the development of the Project. These
16 impacts include inconsistency with the terms of the CC&Rs involving on-grade parking requirements,
17 inadequately-described parking and internal traffie circulation, control and separation, and illegal ase of
18 common areas over the proper objections of the existing owners of the common area, among other
19 arguments.
20 174. In addition, the CC&Rs require harmonious incorporation of new development and foeus
21 on the rights of the existing building owners. In the present case, the Project focuses on the rights of a
22 proposed new bullding and ignores the significant disharmony suffered by the existing building owners.
23 The Project as proposed would further violate the CC&Rs in that there is a significant shortage of
24 porking during construction in clear violation of the requirements of the CO&Ra. All of these issues:
25| materially impact the Project and render the Project Description insufficient and legally unsupported.
26 175, The Project requires a staging area for materials storage of 114,000 cubie yards of
27 excavated soil, the loss of parking for existing businesses for multiple years, and other construction
28  activities. Since the phasing of the Project does not allow for the reduction in parking spaces beyond that

26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

described in the Phasing Plan, and since the Project proponent does not control any additional areas, off-

2 site staging and parking must be assumed. Despite all of this, no staging areas or parking areas are
3 described in the Project Description, or are analyzed anywhere in the Addendum. This failure of analysis
infects the entirety of the analysis of the Addendum.
176. During the Hearing before the City Council at the time it considered the Project at issue in
this Petition, Project representative stated that there were no off-project staging areas, and thรคt
construction workers would park in the construction area tnless there is not adequate room in which case
8 that will be parking on common area parking spaces. Construction workers will further constrain and
9 reduce parking to the direct disadvantage and against the rights of other building owners within the Koll
10 Center.

11 177. The City Approval and CEQA analysis is incorrectly based on an ability to reserve
12| separate parking fรถr Residents and Office tenants. In direct contradiction, the CC&R's expressly forbid
13  exclusive reservation of parking areas, Because of this, numerous Planning and CEQA analyses, such as
141 the Parking Study and Circulation designs, as well as the overall ingress/egress of the Project, are
15 | inadequate.

16 178: While there are vague statements made in the Hydrology Section that the Project will
17 drain to Von, Karman Avenue for "south of the high point" and to an existing 60-inch storm drain east of
18 the 5000 Birch Street Building *north of the high point," the Addendum states that the 114,000 cubic
19 yards of dirt that will be excavated from the site will be exported and dumped off-site. In the Air Quality
20 model, a distance of 20 miles is assumed for this theoretical export site, which would necessarily mean

21 that it is not in Newport Beach and was not analyzed in the 2006 General Plan EIR. The CEQA analysis
22 for this Project must consider the whole of the action, including the impacts to the export site. Its.
23 location must be disclosed in the document, and the impacts of bauling such a large quantity of soil to the
24 site analyzed.
25 179, The Project Description is also fatally defective in the way it fails to describe how the site
26 will manage storm flows.
27 180. There is no discassion of what the on-site drainage system consists of, nor whether the
28 Project's storm flows will discharge into the existing storm water management ponds surrounding the

27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Property. These ponds already regularly overflow. To furthor confuse the issue, there is a storm drain

2 under the proposed frec-standing parking structure, which may or may not be relocated, according to tho

3 Project Description in the Addendum.
181. Nowhere in the Addendum, however, are the impacts of relocation, or preservation in simu
considered, nor is it clear whether this storm drain is the one the Project will drain to. The Addendum
defers consideration, and mitigation, of these issues, and fails to provide an adequate description. Itis
impossible to assess the impacts of the Project without an adequate description of the storm flow

infrastructure.

182. The description of parking for the proposed Project assures the reader that parking for the
10 surrounding offices will be replaced. It fails to note, however, that the City's Municipal Code requires
that parking be provided on-site, not off-site at a parking structure 600 fect away from the Project that
12 will be visually and physically blocked from the Project. The CC&Rs require "on-site" parking, and this
13 removed and isolated proposed parking structure is NOT "on-site." The environmental document must
14 properly describe both the construction period parking and long-term parking, and assess the impacts of
15 the Project on those buildings which were constructed with adequate on-site parking and will now
16 become non-conforming because of this Project.
17 183, Olen is harmed by the continual violation of CEQA through the action to approve the
18 Project without the City first having conducted proper environmental review.
184. Olen is suffering irreparable harm by having to continually protect its rights, the rights of
20 the public with respect to enforcement of CEQA, and causing an expenditure of scarse and valuable
21 judicial resources, Olen has no adequate remedy at law. Accondingly: Olen is entiled to temporary, 22 preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief preventing the City from approving and allowing the Project
23 to go forward without first having conducted proper environmental review.
24 185, Olen seeks through this action to enforce important rights under the United States and
25 California Constitutions and statutory and other law that affect the public interest and that confer a
26 significant benefit on the public as a whole by protecting the environment of the City,

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
[Violation Of State And Lucal Planning Laws -- Against All Parties)
186. Olen reincorporates Paragraphs 1 through 185 above as though set forth fully herein.
187. PROJECT INCONSISTENT WITH GENERAL PLAN - Under California law, a Project
must be consistent with a City's General Plan. Any approval granted for a project that is inconsistent
6 with a City's General Plan is invalid and void.
188. The Project is located the existing KBC Business Park, which is within the Airport Arca,
as defined by the General Plan, and designated Mixed Use Horizontal (MU-H2) on the Land Use Map
(Figure LU22). This designation is efined and described through a series of policies, each of which
10 serves a specific regulatory purpose: The Project, as currently proposed, violates each of these policies,
as described below. It is important to note that the policies eited and analyzed below apply specifically
12 to the Airport Area, in which the Project is located, and were therefore developed not as general and
13 broad City-wide concepts, but instead focused on the Project area.
14 189. The Projoct violates the City's General Plan Policy L.U 6.15.5. This Policy caps the
15 1 number of units allocated in the MU-H2 designation at 2,200 units, of which only 550 may be additive.
16 The allocation for these units is to be identified in the Integrated Conceptual Development Plan (ICDP")
17 for the KBC. The KBC allocation under this Policy is 260 units (as repoatedly cited in the Housing
18 Element), Nowhere in the General Plan or the ICDP does the cap allow for or even contemplate
19| additional units based on density bonus.
20 190. The Project further violates the City's General Plan Policy LU 6.15.5 because the Project
21 does not *integrate residential with ground level office or retail uses, along with supporting retail,
22  grocery stores and parklands.**
23 191. The 550-unit additive cap was determined based on tratfic analysis for the General Plan,
24- which found that redevelopment in the MU-H2 designation would significantly impact traffic if a cap
25 were not instituted. As a result, the General Plan determined that no more than 550 additive units could
26 be developed in this land use designation.
27 192. The Project proposes 312 units, or 52 more than that allocated to KBC through the
28 General Plan. On this issue alone. the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan on the basis of

:29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

l- density. Further, the Planning Commission staff report dated November 5, 2020, confirms that the City
will be exceeding the 2,200-unit cap with approval of this Project. As shown in the Airport Business
3 Area Residential Units table on pages 14 and 15 of the staff report, the City bas approved 2,038 total
units at Uptown Newport, Newport Crossings, and Newport Airport Village. The City therefore has the
authority to approve no more than 162 onits under the current General Plan's 2,200 unit cap, Since the
project is proposing 312 units, it is inconsistent with the General Plan, exceeds the 2,200 unit cap, and
cannot be approved without a General Plan Amendment, and accompanying CEQA analysis, to raise the
total unit cap in the Airport Area.
9 193 The Project violates the City's General Plan Policy LIJ 6.15.6. This Policy requires that
10 each "residential village" within the MU-H2 land use designation be a minimum of 10 acres *centered on
11 neighborhood park and other amenities,* KBC is identified as Residential Village 3 in the General
12 Plan's Housing Element. Although the Project purports to be 13 acres, the "residential village" consists
13 ofionly 3.41 acres (ICDP Part VL. Section II.). Even if one adds the 1.1 acres assigned to the park, the
14 total "residential village" area is 4,51 acres.
15 194, The balance of the Project area is completely umrelated to the "residential village," since it
16 consists of parking lots and parking structures allocated to the office space adjacent to the Project, and
17 has no relationship to the "residential village," which is entirely self-contained and self-parked.
18 Therefore, the proposed Project is the first phase of Residential Village 3, and is inconsistent with the 10
acre minimum "residential village" size required by this policy, and a General Plan Amendment, and
2D nccompanying CEQA analysis, are required prior to consideration of the Project by the Planning
21 Commission and City Council.
22 195. The Profect violates the City'& General Plan Policy LU 6.15.8 which requires that the first
23 phase of any *residential village" be at a density of 45 to 50 per net acre, The Project, the first phase of
Residential Village 3, at 312 units on 3.41 net acres, is at a density of 92 units per acre, Even if one were
25 to consider the "net acre" calculation on the basis of the park and the apartment site together, the Project 26 is at density of 69 units per acre. In either case, the Project far exceeds the required density of 45 to:50 27 units per net acre, and a Gencral Plan Amendment, and accompanying CEQA analysis are required prior 28 to consideration of the Project by the Planning Commission and City Council.

aseajeeiewwisarrewsiioriei 30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

196. The Project violates the City's General Plan Policy LU 6.15.13 which addresses standards
and requirements for each "residential village" park, These standards include size (1 acre) and
dimensions. The policy explicitly requires that the park have a minimum dimension of 150 feet.

5 Because of the manner in which the park has been shochorned into the site, multiple areas do not meet

6 this minimum dimension, including the entire east half of the Project, the central portion on the
north/south axis, and the western half on most of the north/south axis. The eastern half of the park, in
particular, at widths of 20 feet or less, is not a park at all, but simply a landscaping area which provides
no amenities or benelit to the residents of the Project. The Project, therefore, is inconsistent with this

10 Policy, and a General Plan Amendment, and accompanying CEQA analysis are required.

u 197. The ICDP is Inconsistent with the General Plan The Project is regulated by the ICDP,
which is being amended to add a residential overlay to allow the Project. However, as an implementing
12 tool of the General Plan, the ICDP must be consistent with it, much as a Zoning Ordinance must be
13 consistent with a General Plan. Since the ICDP would be amended to allow 312 units on 3.41 aeres
14 (explicitly cited in the ICDP), it is necessarily inconsistent with the City's LU Policies 16.15.5, 6.15.6
15 and 6.15.8. Further, since the ICDP in silent on the issue of dimension of parks, the ICDP is inconsistent
16 with the City's LU Policy 16.15.8.
